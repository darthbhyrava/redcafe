Thoughts on his performance today?

Looked a lot better attacking today but defensively didn't convince which wasn't a shock as we were playing with a back five which contained Blackett, Keane and Young and a midfield of two attacking midfielders.

2~~~
Looked a lot more confident today but there was a lot of sloppy passing.

James has looked the better player on this tour so far.

3~~~
He looks pretty shaky to me so far. Needs a bit of time to settle down.

4~~~
Its hard to judge fully because like you said, our overall lineup was a bit all over the place. He didnt stand out - basically he neither excelled nor disappointed, and I am fine with that for an 18 year old who has just arrived at the club, as he will only improve over time.

5~~~
He did okay but still looked a bit nervous.

6~~~
Looked fine to me. I think he's been pretty solid defensively in both games, going forward is an obvious area for improvement though.

7~~~
Don't think he looks good enough going forward. Young looked better on the right today for instance. Obviously harsh to judge but he didn't exactly pull up great attacking numbers for Southampton in his 2 seasons. A United full back/wing back will need to offer more than just defensive solidity.

8~~~
Yup. Plus he's also playing a new role which he's completely unfamiliar with. We can see the talent but needs to settle down.

Like De Gea, there'll be some errors in the first season but I'm confident he'll become top class.

9~~~
he looked like a 19 year old playing one of his first games for one of the world's biggest clubs after moving for a massive fee with lots of expectations.

Patience!

10~~~
Didn't watch enough of Southampton to know what he was like last year - but I have to imagine pretty impressive to warrant his price tag and hype. Has been terrible in these two halves. Early days, but needs to get going soon - he's presumably our first choice (only <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>) left back.

11~~~
A few signs of his ability right at the end. But basically the wing-back position is good for nothing at the moment, regardless of who's in it. Not high enough up the pitch to do any damage as a winger, not deep enough to be dangerous as an attacking fullback.

12~~~
James has been the better player so far on tour. I think Shaw is still getting used to playing as a wingback, should get better as he adjusts to LvG's tactics

13~~~
Looks like backup to James at the moment to be honest. I'm sure he'll grow into it though, he's been here no time at all.

14~~~
Looks slow, disoriented and a bit shit. And a bit fat.

15~~~
Not very impressive so far but young'n'learning

16~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

17~~~
Did well towards the end. Poor decision making in attack mind.

18~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck sake

19~~~
It's not an excuse but I don't think he's comfortable with the system yet. Amazing that James has adapted more to such a role given his lack of experience.

Just looks unsure of when to take his chances and actually go forward as a wing-back should. Had a good 15 minute period today.

20~~~
So far he's not been great. Looks nervous but I am sure he'll settle in and be fine soon enough. At times I actually thought he looked a bit casual today, I hope that wasn't the case. He might think that he has that left back spot tied down regardless and in the long term I'm not sure if James can really push him for it.

21~~~
I dont think he's done very well so far. Better last game than this. A lot more good stuff to come once he settles in

22~~~
This seems to be the trend with any player that looks stocky - Fat. Wonder why no one said that last year.

23~~~
Did fine considering circumstances.

24~~~
What? It's just how he looks to me so far. I'm sure he'll eventually improve. Well, I'm not sure, I hope.

25~~~
He hasn't really been tested nor been given true licence to roam. I think as others have said he looks nervous, he hasn't been bursting forward like he did at Southampton, he instead looks for the safe pass. Came into the game a little toward the end which was good.

26~~~
Perhaps he'll look much better in a fullback rather than a wingback role?

27~~~
He's been mediocre. I have confidence he'll improve as the games mount and he settles.

I've seen enough of him at Southampton to know he's good. Give it time.

28~~~
Bollocks. He did OK today. Certainly not shit. Although he does certainly need to look more of an attacking threat to justify that fee.

29~~~
Talk about gross exaggeration. Okay the guy hasn't been that great going forward but defensively he's been sound. I'd be more worried if he was great going forward but getting taken apart when defending.

30~~~
What are you expecting in 2 shite pre season games? This is why I hate pre season. Luke Shaw happens not to have reached Roberto Carlos levels in pre season so people start worrying. It's not even as though he's been poor. Wait until the proper games and judge then.

31~~~
the way some people are talking is fecking ridiculous. Did you expect him to be the fully finished article at the age of 19, in pre season?

32~~~
Not only has he just moved he's being asked to play a slightly different position in a different defensive formation.

33~~~
The difference between this pre season and others is that players in our side are adjusting to a new system and trying to prove themselves rather than going through the motions in previous years. If James out performs Shaw in the next few games then maybe he will start the league campaign as our LWB.

34~~~
We were playing a backline of
Amos
Young-Smalling-Blackett-Keane-Shaw

and then there was the central midfield pairing of Lingard-Kagawa who are obviously well known for their defensive qualities.

35~~~
So far, it looks like Southampton has committed financial chicanery and we have been mugged. 

Nevertheless, he is still very young and will only get better. Moreover, he is asked to adopt a new role. Even if he does not emulate his last season form, he still has time on his hand.

36~~~
He did okay. I'm sure he will get more confident for the next game. He's very promising and a talented left back. Reece did well.

37~~~
He's a laid back type anyway I think. He'll be bang at it come the first match.

38~~~
I think he has all the tools to be a very good wingback, just probably doesn't have the tactical nous for it yet as I doubt he's ever played in such a system. Louis will knock that into him I'm sure. Might take a bit of time though given how thick he comes across in his interviews <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

39~~~
Good solid performance considering the set up he was in and the players supporting him.

40~~~
Exactly. Wing-back doesn't suit him, but at the moment it doesn't really suit anyone else either.

41~~~
He had some nice bits of play down the right and tried at least 2x to play the ball and run past his man but never received a return ball. 19 years old now though, if he doesn't improve in the next few games I assume we'll see people writing him off based on his price.

42~~~
He did okay. Needs to sharpen up his short passing when under pressure, but I have no concerns over him. 

I don't think he'll walk into the first team as we mostly predicted when we lost Buttner and Evra. I think Reece James has been a  lot better so far. But it's pre-season, so it's harder to judge overall quality. Reece James will probably be a lot fresher than Shaw right now, I imagine.

43~~~
Is it really fair to judge him on numbers? Prior to the last two seasons Evra's numbers were very low but his build-up and link-up play was so important to us. Shaw's good at that stuff too. Not as good though and I don't think he's a wingback at all. More suited to the left-sided centre back in a back 5 I reckon. He's definitely got the skillset to be an influential attacking fullback for us though.

At the moment he's clearly playing within himself because he's adapting to a new team, in a new system,  quite possibly in a country (and more importantly,  a climate) he's never played in before all the while trying to get to know his (much more successful and experienced) team-mates and manager. It takes a while to get it together for most people.

Everyone remembers Evra's shambles of a performance against Trevor Sinclair where he was torn to pieces defensively,  but he wasn't that great going forward to begin with either. In fact the few times he was played further forward as a LM he looked pretty inept in attack. It's much easier being a threat going forward with someone in front of you occupying the fullback and creating space for you to gallop into.

By the way, for anyone ready to jump on the "another overhyped English youngster" line, I was watching the match with Italian commentators and they called him a great fullback.

44~~~
Not going to judge him on todays second half, the team was all over the place. He will be a top player, no doubt about that but maybe he will take a few month to settle in.

45~~~
Wing back is a demanding role, and I think there will be some rotation and resting of players on both sides.  Hope Shaw and James are both capable of playing the left side.  A younger Evra would have been perfect for it.

46~~~
I'd say they were exactly the same today: both had a couple of nice moments, defended pretty well, but were basically marked out of the game quite easily because of the nature of that position. But I guess that means James edges it with his two goals in the first game!

47~~~
He will. He is an excellent defender and isn't as good going forward.

48~~~
Strangely I've heard many people say that on here but the folk on Saints forum say the opposite.

49~~~
Exactly. I mean, the whole team obviously needs time to work out how to make that wing-back position work effectively, because no-one's been <i>great</i> in it so far (with all due respect to James' brace in the first game).

But Shaw is particularly unsuited to it as a full-back whose defending is his best asset and whose attacking threat comes from his pace. He'll not get many chances to get sprinting from such a high starting position where he can be marked all the time by his corresponding winger/fullback.

That said, I'm not worried. If 351 ends up not suiting our players we'll change back to 4 at the back. But it's perfectly possible we'll get better at using wing-backs, and I'm sure Shaw will be a part of that. He's got too much quality not to. He wasn't any worse today than any of our other three wing-backs.

50~~~
I have to say i am slightly worried about his attacking skills as a wing back. I mean he has speed, skill on the ball, he is a modern attacking full back, but for all his qualities he has only one assist in 1,5 PL seasons. That's not a great return by any means. Well he is young and with better players upfront could do better, but still.

The thing i am comfortable is his stamina and speed. He definitely have those to play in this role.

51~~~
We didn't pay 30m for what he brings now as an 19 year old lad. Its an investment and lets have some patience he may even play left of the 3 CB's in time.

52~~~
I'm not surprised Reece James is more settled at wing back than Shaw is. Given that James played at both left wing and left back in his time at the U-21's, he's probably best suited to this role. Shaw, on the other hand, has played at left back for much of his time, so I'm not surprised that he isn't used to the role as of yet.

I'd say that he should be given time to adjust to this role. He has the talent; he just needs to get used to being a wing back rather than a full back.

53~~~
Isn't looking too good atm. He's a big time talent but it certainly is worrying that just how not so good he's looked. We should bring in ali adnan just incase this goes tits up.

54~~~
You just called him shit and fat. A lad with a body that everyone on here would wish for and you are calling him fat. You then ask what? Come on mate seriously.

He was decent and clearly trying to adapt to the new role of wingback. Personally I don't like the role, one player on each wing isn't going to be the most effective.

55~~~
19 year old, 2nd 45 minutes in preseason, new role, stepped up from Southampton to Manchester United. I hope you didn't think he was the complete article at 19 years of age.

56~~~
He called him fat? I dont get some supporters. Like Utd would go out a pay 30m for a 19 year old fat kid.

57~~~
Let's break the mould son, and feck the rest.

58~~~
Are people seriously judging him after 2 pre season games? Jesus Christ. The lad will be world class.

59~~~
based soley on his performances as a red so far, he's looked nothing like the player he was at southhampton. Obviously theres tons of factors at play, but its not the start he would have wanted suffice to say. Im positive he will come good with a run of games under his belt.

60~~~
He  might be solid at best but WORLD CLASS? No. Roberto Carlos was World Class. Maldini was World Class. Shaw won't reach the heights of them. Just wait and see how he fairs before setting yourself up for disappointment.

I thought Ashley Young was gonna be great for United and look how that turned out.

61~~~
I can't image he's too fresh just now. All the travelling with England, back to the UK, then back across the pond to the west coast for the tour. That'll sap it out of you a bit, especially for a relatively inexperienced kid. Probably hasn't had all that much of a summer break. He seemed to sign as soon as he returned, then having to move your life a few hundred miles north. He has been a very impressive player over the past 2 seasons. I'm certain he will be a mainstay at left back, but he will need time to settle, and he'll certain need to up his game to maintain his place. Reece James nipping at his heels can only be a good thing.

62~~~
90 minutes total doesn't even qualify as a 'start'. We can discuss his performances but there's simply no conclusions to be drawn until he's played at least a few full games.

63~~~
He just looks a little nervy to me, much like he did when he played for England, I am sure LvG will get him sorted out quickly and he actually showed some of his quality towards the end of the game.

64~~~
Did you see Carlos when he was 19 and playing for international giants Uniao Sao Juao ? Shaw has loads of time on his side to get to a similar level. Just wait and see how he develops before claiming he won't be world class like them in the future.

65~~~
He looked a bit like a sad clown with his pink boots, but he wasn't that bad. Hope he reaches his Southampton level quickly so there will be no future pressure on him because of his wages and transfer fee.

66~~~
Saying he won't reach those heights is just as presumptuous as saying he will. I personally think he has all the tools to become a World Class full back. He aint no wing back though, not by a long chalk.

67~~~
Oh ofcourse, i stress i really rate him and i think he will turn out a bargain for the price. but looking objectively at his 2 appearences in pre season, he hasn't been close to his Southampton form.

68~~~
Nah, but he's not been playing in his Southampton position either, not really. Until we sort out this wing-back position better I wouldn't expect anyone to make it work, let alone a kid who's hardly even kicked a ball for us.

69~~~
Anyone who is at top club at 19 could be world class.

70~~~
It's the other way around for me. Another poster brought up about me watching Carlos at 19 and That further proves my point that there too much pressure on Shaw to live up to the hype and transfer at such a young age.  Carlos hadn't got that pressure.

I don't "not like" Shaw. I just don't think he's worth 30m. Still don't. I wanted Coentrao, Ricardo Rodriguez or Alex Sandro instead. But that's gone, he's ours now. I don't think he'll be world class. I don't think he'll be a world beater. I think he'll be "Phil Jones" quality.

71~~~
He's already garnered more credit as a defender than Jones probably has and is nothing like him in playing style so I'd like to know where you're going with that.

72~~~
He is adapting to a new club and bit different position which he isn't really ideally suited for. Still he's done Okay and had some good moments today.

He has all the attributes to be top class. Don't really have concerns about him.

Actually would be interesting to see him play a game at LCB in this formation. The role Blackett was playing today.

73~~~
I mean he won't be any better at LB than Phil Jones already is at CB. They're about equal quality.

74~~~
And dozen of others have. Maldini was playing at Milan at 19, with the same hype, there was not a transfer, but the pressure on him was huge. Rio did okay and he was a british transfer record even at Leeds. Buffon was and still is the most expensive GK, while he was like 22 or 23, but he is a GK. A lot of players did deliver while had huge transfers early on in their career.

75~~~
He needs time and games.......and he is new at the club

I don't care about his price tag now......if he plays still shit in 2-3 years then i look at his price tag

76~~~
He looked OK - he showed great pace to get that ball past their RB. It's early days and it's a new role for him so not concerned at all. At 19 & in July, he has time to adapt

77~~~
New club and a new position that doesn't take advantage of his best attribute (one vs. one defending) and highlights the fact that he isn't one of those newfangled failed attacker conversions.  I think he will be underwhelming until the coaching staff have time to help him with his attacking game.  However, I think it will help him out greatly in the long-term because it will force him to focus on improving his attacking play.

78~~~
It's his second 45-minutes, FFS.

79~~~
Seriously. Anyone getting on his back at the moment is being ridiculous. He's just turned 19 years old and has joined the biggest club in the world and is expected to replace a long-time veteran at LB. He's a quality player for fecks sake, let him settle in rather than hounding him after not even playing a full match yet.

80~~~
I'd agree with you but you thought Ashley Young was gonna be great so I can't trust your opinion.

81~~~
It's his second game for us, and it's a bloody friendly. These games mean nothing, otherwise going off of last years games Jesse Lingard is our best player.

Give him time.

82~~~
His current level isn't worth 30m but anyone that watched Southampton can see from his very fast progress during the last 2 seasons that he's bound to become one of the best left backs in world football.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wd10x9-mwg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

If you haven't, you can watch clips like those that show all his touches in a game so you can see both his good and bad side. He puts in some really wonderful crosses against Arsenal, one of them fell on top of the striker and he still managed to miss. Sometimes having a high count of assists depends more on the striker rather than on the player providing the ball. The more useful stat in my book is chances created and he's created 35 during the last season playing for Southampton, a team that's on the back foot against many opponents.


Criticizing Shaw after his first 90 minutes of football in preseason in a new role is just unfair. I suspect such criticism is coming from individuals who thought he would be the finished product from the first minute he played for us.

83~~~
I can see him being first choice this season but will share a fair amount of game times with James.I would love to see LVG try Shaw in the LCB role.No harm having another one who is capable of playing that role plus we can allow James to have more game times without benching one of the two.

84~~~
Some people need a reality check. Shaw is a 19 yo who already has two years of experience in the PL and he is full of potential. We spent 30m because we believe we have all it takes (training ground, coaches, philosophy etc.) to help him reach his full potential and become our LB for the next decade. I think we should wait a liitle bit more than two weeks of training and two 45 minute appearances.

I think he did ok in those two friendlies and there's still plenty of room for improvement. Of course he will improve his attacking game in time. He has a strong left foot and his body structure will make it hard for opposition wingers and full backs to mark him. He will learn how to use his body when he's in possession in order to protect the ball and cross/shoot in the final third and, as the season progresses and he learns his teammates' off the ball movement, he will eventually look better.

I really don't get the comparison with Carlos and Maldini. Roberto Carlos was a player with completely different technical and physical attributes, who played the LWB position in a way Shaw can't and should never try to play. Maldini was one of the best LBs in the history of the game mainly because his reading of the game was unique. He was a ready made defender at the age of 19, a right footed  full back whom Sacchi had no problem starting at LB cause he had Tassotti and then Panucci at RB. Maldini was special, no LB playing for top clubs right now has shown any indication of coming close to that level.

Shaw has to work and learn how to use his physical attributes correctly when he goes fotward. He must improve his acceleration and his reading of the game so that he can perform these short sprints into open spaces at the right time. He will also have to become better on the ball. The key factor will be to not sacrifice any of his defensive abilities or neglect them in training. But with his body structure it will take some time. If i had to compare him with a top LB that would be Alaba. No one thought he was Bayern quality but through hard training, playing game after game and belief from his managers he has become a great player.

85~~~
I haven't made an opinion on him yet, and no one else should either considering the amount of time he has been at the club.

But! when you cost £30 million you have to perform and the 'young and learning' excuse doesn't carry much weight either. Plenty of other players get slaughter every time they have a bad touch and reminded of their transfer fees every second, so Shaw shouldn't be any different.

86~~~
Having rewatched the second half (don't ask why) I don't get the stick he is getting... obviously if you analyse him against his price tag.. he will always underwhelm, bottom line is no full back should be that much.

Anyway as to his performance, much more positive than his first game.. he looked more direct with the ball, had an urgency about him.. definitely the coaches have had a word and he got past some Roma players with some neat touches, good pace. He always looks solid defensively which is another plus.

Alot of growth in this player, he has alot of potential in my opinion. He should be judged at 23/24, because he is a mere baby and in terms of his attacking game.. there is so much to teach him but alot of good material to work with.. quality left foot, fantastic first touch, ability to glide past players (trust me he has it, just needs confidence and pressure from the gaffer to keep driving at players) and very composed passer in the final third and out of defence. If you ally that to his natural ability to read the game in a defensive sense and his recovery pace, he is a solid player for the future. He also has the ability to take set pieces which once he becomes a fixture in the team in the coming years will become more evident.

87~~~
He definitely will need time to adapt in the same mould as Vidic or Evra, especially being so young. If he can replicate his Southampton form for us then he'll be doing ok.

88~~~
I'm not even worried about Luke Shaw's ability to adapt and evolve as a left wing back as he's used to being alone on that left side with Southampton. Both Jay Rodriguez and Lallana aren't players that offer much width.

89~~~
A work in progress. I was disappointed with his pull back, think the obvious ball was hernandez but it's early days. Hopefully his crossing improves because he's obviously important in the formation we're playing

90~~~
This guy will be great, not necessarily in his first season or second even. See - Evra

91~~~
Obvious to the fans who knows Hernandez having watched him for years. Shaw has trained with them for a week so of course he won't be used to their movement just yet, and so he's pretty much guessing where to pass/cross it in those positions. Once he adapts he'll get it right more often.

92~~~
As he's 19, we'll need to wait 3-4 years until we see the best out of him so all good. As long as he's good and solid defensively, then it's all good. The rest will come over time and under LVG he will develop nicely

93~~~
I think some of you guys are missing out on some key aspects surrounding Luke Shaw's performances. If you saw him at Southampton, in a LB role, he got freedom to drive at defenses from deep and could use his pace to get separation from defenders. However, since he's played as LWB in our system, his starting attacking positions are higher up the pitch. Hence, he is getting the ball much later in our build up phase where it seems like he's expected to take on the defender in 1v1 situations.  So he has less room to run which takes away from one aspect of his game which I think coaching staff will work out with him over time.

The second aspect which is important to observe imo is that whenever Shaw has been picking up the ball, he doesn't have that many passing options around him. If you think back to how Evra was used last season, he was quite isolated on the left flank. With Shaw, it's a bit similar but not as bad as last season.  One of Shaw's tendencies is to use his teammates as a passing outlet to run off of. If you look at any of his compilations for Southampton, you will find it's a common feature of his game.  he hasn't been offered the same luxury in our preseason games thus far but he showed more signs of doing it against Roma which I would take as a positive.

There's more to observe as well but think that's enough for now on Shaw. I'm not worried about him at all. Having James as an option can't hurt either

94~~~
Aye, reminds me of the "Evra as a left winger" experiment Fergie tried once or twice. Really shows the different skillset needed to create space for a cross as a winger compared to a fullback. Evra always seemed like a brilliant dribbler to me but was completely out of his depth when played on the wing. Shaw's probably going through similar problems in this formation.

95~~~
I would say so Pogue. Even though it doesnt seem like much of a difference between LB and LW, think it takes different skill sets to excel in a higher attacking position on the flank.

Kid is 19. Young and learning and he's already solid. not worried

96~~~
Not being able to make overlapping runs makes the role so much more different to when you have a winger in front of you.

97~~~
Shaw rarely had what you would call wingers at Southampton since both Rodriguez and Lallana play very narrow.

98~~~
They're still someone else for the opposing fullback to worry about. In Shaw's two games he's almost never found himself on an overlap with his opposite number forced to pick up someone else. In fact, he's probably more often found himself out-numbered by opposing defenders than the other way round. So long as we keep playing 352 I think he's going to find it very tough. From what I saw of hims last season his greatest strength is his defending and he's not a tricky, attacking fullback who will beat someone with a bit of skill. The absence of a naturally left-sided winger in our squad is a real problem if Van Gaal persists with that formation. Slightly ironically, I think Evra would be great as a wingback.

99~~~
He'll need time to develop at United. I'm still not convinced he offers enough in his attacking game currently to play LWB, but we aren't blessed with options in that position. He's certainly done nothing to warrant people questioning his signing, we overpaid yes, but we stumped up that cash on his potential as much as his current ability.

100~~~
Some of the reactions in here to Shaw's performances are ridiculous.

He's only played 90 minutes of football in total for us in pre-season friendlies, whereby we are playing a completely new system, not only for Shaw, but the whole team. He needs time to adjust to the system and develop his attacking game accordingly, but I don't think that will be an issue with van Gaal as manager and the coaching he is implementing.

I don't know what some people expect of him so far. His defensive game is widely considered as stronger than his attacking game and he's playing as a wingback where more emphasis is put on his offensive output and providing the width. His performances so far are only natural.

However, I wouldn't be suprised if LVG felt inclined to give James a chance in the first team, while Shaw slowly integrates into the squad and system. He's been one of our best players on tour so far and looks at home as a wingback.

101~~~
It's not just Shaw who's getting used to the system. Everyone has to adjust to it to bring about the absolute best out of everyone in this formation. Shaw's being outnumbered because not too many look to drift out wide to support the wing backs. This improved against Roma, but we still have a way to go before we start to overload the wide areas appropriately to create space in the middle.

Shaw will definitely improve once everyone adjusts to this different formation. It will also put us in good stead when we play the 4-3-3 as this formation's more familiar to our players than the 3-4-1-2.

102~~~
I think his "struggles" are entirely down to the new position. He might not be suited for a wing back role.

103~~~
He's played 45 minutes in two friendlies FFS! Can't believe some people are getting worried about his performances over such a short space of time in meaningless friendlies. These same probably saw nothing of him at Southampton where he was fantastic.

104~~~
Maybe the huge price tag does get into his head, it would affect most teenagers to be fair. But its only early pre-season, there's nothing to judge from here.

105~~~
One thing to remember is that he doesn't have Jay Rodriguez on the left in front of him for combination play. He has a central midfielder, who will almost always be towards the middle of the pitch. So when he gets the ball out on the lefthand side, for him to do anything but find a pass inside to a teammate, he's probably going to need to burst past a player or two. He can dribble, maybe doesn't do it all that often yet but hopefully when he's fully fit he'll have a couple of raiding runs

106~~~
Training on his own today apparently according to Ladymsn.

107~~~
Maybe just a 10 days rest wasn't a good idea

108~~~

109~~~
I've been impressed; He's played 90 minutes now without doing a single noticeably annoying thing defensively and he seems to be careful with not giving away possession. He'll show us more offensively soon. As the Arsenal clip above shows, he can hit a cross (as well as a diagonal long ball) very well.

110~~~
My head tells me to be realistic, but my heart and this tweet suggest strongly that Van Gaal will immediately work on improving anything a player is not already great at and soon enough Anderson will be thin and defensively responsible, Rooney's first touch in traffic will come back and Carrick will start dancing past pressing midfielders.

111~~~

112~~~
That is a bit worrying. He returned to pre-season training a week early didn't he? Hopefully he'a not too far behind.

113~~~
Bit worrying.

114~~~
To be fair, you need to be extremely fit to play as a wing-back. The fact that Shaw is so stocky means he probably requires a bit more work than others.

115~~~

116~~~
Didn't a poster comment on him appearing chubby a week or so back? I disagreed but maybe he was right? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

117~~~
I don't actually understand how he can be out of shape though. He wasn;t injured last season, went to the world cup, then had about a week's holiday afterwards. How the hell has he managed to get out of shape?

A tweet earlier mentioned that Shaw spent the day training alone trying to improve his beating of a man and crossing, are we sure the press aren't putting two and two together? Or has LVG actually confirmed it?

118~~~

119~~~
feck sake, this is how ridiculous rumours start. He's obviously not <i>chubby</i>, you can see that just by looking at him. There's a difference between being out of shape, which he's not, and not being at peak fitness. The whole point of pre-season is to fine-tune a player's fitness.

120~~~
Luke Shaw loves his big mac's it seems

121~~~
Literally said the words "he's not fit."

It is rather surprising, considering he also played the last game England played in the WC. Maybe now that he and Valencia will be our main wing-backs for the forseeable, LVG has realised Valencia is a monster and Shaw isn't quite on the same level <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

122~~~
Bit weird as he didn't have much of a break after the World Cup, and you'd assume players would come back from that in pretty good shape.

123~~~
He probably is in 'pretty good shape' but van Gaal sees the wing-backs as the truly 'specialised' position in this system we're using. He wants something extra from the players who play in those roles, the fact he used Kuyt there in the WC shows just how fit and willing he wants wing-backs to be.

124~~~
This is a thread in the newbies which I wish I could delete from the interwebs and slap <a class="username" data-user="6018, @Grinner" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/6018/">@Grinner</a>. I predict that'll be getting some bumping with this latest news

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/2f07E0T.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/2f07E0T.png"/>

125~~~
This was a "board" transfer. Not a Van Gaal transfer. Van Gaal probably wants to use James as his LWB considering he's been more impressive in pre season than Shaw. 

Shaw as a LB might be solid... however Shaw as a LWB (right now) won't work. He's too defensive.

I think this is what LVG was talking about when he said he might not cope well under the "commercial" pressure and such. The board might pressure him into using the 30m pound man. I'm not saying it will happen but they're not gonna be happy if he uses someone else there.

126~~~
Don't know which bit of this post is the worst <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

127~~~
? You can't argue that James has been better than Shaw in pre season. He is a natural wingback and he's 20 now. He's ready.

128~~~
There is no way on this earth that James will be ahead of Shaw in the pecking order. The nonsense about the board trying to tell van Gaal who to pick is just nonsensical.

129~~~
Oh yes let's make judgements based on two preseason games and ignore the fact that Shaw has been playing in the PL consistently for two seasons already.

130~~~
Why does Grinner have to be slapped?

131~~~
He 'liked' the post.

132~~~
Ouch, I'm not liking how Van Gaal publicly criticizes the players.

133~~~
Not really. Van Gaal didn't sign Shaw. Would you be happy if you made a big marquee signing and the manager had him sitting on the bench? Probably not. There's been tons of instances where the board try to influence the managers decisions. It happens all the time at Madrid.

134~~~
Why would the board force Van Gaal to sign Shaw for 30 million when he was happy with James for free ? 

Yep, he did. He confirmed himself that he gave approval. So did Giggs saying they along with Chief scout went over players at club and targets.

135~~~
Judging football clubs in large by what Madrid do is pointless. What kind of board that wanted to influence team selection would appoint Louis van Gaal as the manager? Think how that conversation would go. Besides, van Gaal already stated that both signings were completed with his approval.

136~~~
I liked it because it was well-written. As bonkers as it might be, we're in the business of promoting potential, not just those who we agree with.

137~~~
wum. again.

138~~~
Yes, at Madrid, the most famously 'circus' club in the world. Not at United, one of the most 'hands off, let the manager do his job' clubs in the world.

Van Gaal has already confirmed that he checked Shaw and Herrera and agreed to the signings before we got them.

139~~~
how democratic of you

140~~~
I know, I even gave you 2 likes when you were down in the bowels.

141~~~
1 assist in two season? He looked much better than that output last season. Early times, but their are sign of Shaws being a bad investment.

142~~~
Van Gaal wasn't going to NOT approve him, was he? They were desperate for Luke Shaw. They wanted a big young English talent and they were willing to give that much money for him. Van Gaal likely never heard of him prior to the knowledge they gave him. So he approved it cause he didn't want to step on anyone's toes before getting settled into the job.

I'm just going by what I think here. Van Gaal wants to play 352 and 5212. It seems a little strange that he'd pick a stocky defensive LB that only has one assist to his name, as opposed to a defensive tricky winger like say... Cuadrado for example, no? Approving the deal doesn't necessarily means he signed him. It just means he's willing to work with him. He probably thinks he'll make him better but I doubt he's his IDEAL LB. 

Daley Blind probably is. Realistically.

143~~~
shocking that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, but i remember and appreciate it

144~~~
Oh my sweet fecking lord.

And it's *THERE. If you're going to write nonsense at least write it properly.

145~~~
I genuinely just thought he was a terrible poster at first. But it's the sheer consistency of bollocks he comes out with. Not sure I've seen one sensible post.

146~~~
We need to focus less on the price and more on the potential the player has. He was fantastic at Southampton over the last 2 years and no one can deny that. What he is now is a 19 year old at a massive club, and he's only played 90 minutes total. He hasn't been excellent but he hasn't been poor either. Its very likely that he'll get better throughout the season and ultimately in the future, as he ages.

147~~~
He was wumming in the fellaini thread only a couple hours ago and its not even close to being believable.

148~~~
I think someone being written off as a bad signing after two 45 minute pre-season performances is a new record?

149~~~
Thanks for the spell check. I did not say he <i>is</i> going to be a bad investment.

150~~~
Aside from the two goals, he's really not even done anything differently from James, who everyone's suddenly hyping to high heaven (mostly people who've never even watched him before this summer).

In the Roma game they put in fairly similar performances. Mostly struggled to get forward because we're still working out how to use that position effectively, but didn't put a foot wrong defensively. Only difference was the last ten or so minutes when Shaw started to get higher up his wing and look quite dangerous.

And against LA Galaxy, again, both had an easy job well executed defensively, and couldn't make much progress up their wings. Exceptions being James' very well-taken goals and two attacks right at the start of the game which got between Shaw and Evans, a problem they and Herrera quickly corrected after which Galaxy got no more joy down that wing.

So James was better in the first game thanks to the goals, and they were the same in the second. But suddenly people are worrying about Shaw?

You said there are signs. I've not seen any. I'm not sure it's even possible to see <i>signs</i> of anything in two 45-minute spells. In a new team. In a new (and currently problematic) position. Given the circumstances I've actually been fairly pleased with him, but arguably that's also an unfounded conclusion based on so little evidence.

151~~~
Some ridiculous ply premature statements being thrown around here regarding Shaw. He's a very young and very talented footballer, he'll become a mainstay in our side before long, in one position or another.

That said, if LvG feels that James (or anyone else, for that matter) is a better fit for the LWB position at any point in the coming season, you can be sure that he'll be picked there ahead of Shaw. If anyone actually doubts that, they surely can't be familiar with LvG's past history? Just look at who he benched at Bayern for (then) "no-name youngsters". He doesn't care one iota about price tags or reputation.

152~~~
Shaw will develop his attacking game further under LVG. He already has the pace and from what i've seen from him at Southampton, he has the dribbling skills but is alittle raw in that department just yet. 

LVG I would presume will go with his favoured 4-3-3 once he gets the personnel that he desires and that will work in Shaw's favour and United too.

153~~~
They hyping James because he's from the academy and cost nothing. Where as Shaws price tag will be used against him. 

I did say that the Rodriguez links were not surprising a few days ago.

154~~~
The one assist in two shows lack of influence in the attack half of the pitch, his high wages could lead to a lack of motivation to perform on the pitch, his current conditioning that Van Gaal supposedly criticized and the lack of adaptation to a new system which Young, James, valencia and even Rafael looks more comfortable in. Although, the latter their is really no need for him to impress immediately like Herrera or even James or Blackett if talking about similiar positional role. These are the signs I have seen, albeit it is does not overshadow the excellent season he had last term. Which is why I said their <i>are</i> signs of him being a bad investment, not that he <i>is</i> going to be a bad investment.

155~~~
Not if you actually watched him. He started so many attacks for them. And he was also incredibly unlucky not to get far more assists like that - in match after match strikers were fumbling pinpoint crosses from him which should have been put away. But at least his form for Southampton is something you can actually make a judgement on, unlike his tiny amount of experimental pre-season football for us so far, so this one at least isn't completely ridiculous.

<i>Could</i>, but absolutely no sign of it so far, so this is a meaningless statement. RVP <i>could</i> become lazy and entitled because he thinks Van Gaal will naturally favour him.

No, they haven't.

-Young has just gone on and played how he always does, as a winger, and fair play to him. Not been <i>great</i>, but finished the chances Herrera created for him confidently in the first game.
-Valencia has been the worst of all of them so far, definitely worse than Shaw. Given the ball away far too often.
-The only thing James has done better, as I explained in detail in an earlier post, is score the goals. Which were very well taken, but didn't have much to do with how well/badly he is adapting to the position. This isn't a criticism of James - in the context, I think both he and Shaw have been quite good.
-Rafa barely played 45 minutes, too short a time to see much of anything from him really.

So no signs. If you don't rate him that highly based on his Southampton seasons, fair enough, that's your prerogative. If you think £27m is too much to have paid for him, likewise. But any signs that he's a 'bad investment' from this pre-season are in your head.

156~~~
Mother of God. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

157~~~
You forgot to adress his conditioning that Van Gaal criticized. And, I believe the players aforementioned looked to have adopted to this system moreso than Shaw. But, it is a matter of your opinion versus mine. So, I am not overly bothered by that point. 

I rate him, which is why I praised the season he had last term, but at the moment, he is looks like he is playing in a shell at United

158~~~
He has played like 90 mins of football and you are saying he is playing in a shell?

159~~~
Yea, one of the few  players that I have seen so far that has more to give and could do much better.

160~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ok, we'd best leave you to that opinion now then.

On the fitness thing, I've had a look at some photos of him from training and the two games, and he looks perfectly trim. I think we're talking the sort of fitness issue where he just doesn't feel fully fit and at his peak, and they'll fine tune that over the next week or so with this personal programme LVG mentioned.

161~~~
You don't need to have put on weight to be unfit.

I'd say as you said though it's probably more MATCH fitness.

Not just general fitness.

162~~~
Right now, it looks like Shaw is not suited enough to play wing back role. Afterall it a demanding role is the system. LVG has identified the weaknesses and Shaw has agreed too. The special programme will focus to improve him. No need to write him off.

He isn't going to turn into a skilfull wing back trickster. However, if LVG can successfully turn Kuyt, a defensive striker, into a sound wingback, why can't he improve Shaw.

He has the pace, looks good on the ball. He'll learn to beat a man and improve his crossing.

When LVG says he's not fit, I think he's taking about Shaw as a wing back, not Shaw the LB. You have to consider in this year's system all of last season's players will be unfit.

163~~~
This is why you should never judge players based on their World Cup performance only. Blind primarily a LB was converted to CM last season which was where he won the Player of the year and displayed his best form. He played two great passes against Spain and people think he's a top LB/LWB . Midfield is where he's best at. He can cover the LB and CB positions but would only be good as a backup for a team like United as a wingback/fullback. Vlaar looked like the best defender in the world playing in the world cup when instead he's playing for Villa who conceded 4th highest goals in the league. If you watched him a bit more his passing is nothing special but if you only watched him at the WC you'll have the impression that he's Rio in his prime. Playing 6 good games with the right atmosphere and spirit is whole different to playing consistently well throughout the league.


On the Shaw part , we didn't spend 30m on what he is now but for what he's going to be in the next few years. He has just turned 19 which is when defenders are extremely young. When You see Baines being one of the top LBs in the world at 30 its scary to think how much years Shaw can give us even if he reaches his peak after 5 years. He's already among the rare breed of fullbacks who can defend extremely well and just need a wee bit tweaks in his game to make him a right player for us for years to come. And he showed it at Southampton that he can make the grade.

164~~~
Which positions requires more stamina and fitness ? LB or LWB ?

165~~~
No difference really, it depends on the specific set up and how the match evolves. The more back and forth the match is the more full pitch sprints you have to do and that will be the decider.

166~~~
LWB

167~~~
VG has already said that he given the go ahead for both Shaw and Herrera. If it wasn't the case then he wouldn't have said it in the first place. FFS We're talking about a man whose not afraid of challenging Bayern Munich's top guns and criticizing our pre season marketing ploys. 

Returning to Shaw, the boy was trained and groomed to be LB. Now he's expected to become a Wing back which requires alot more running and stamina. Under such circumstances a player need to be on top of his game as he's expected to cover for two roles (LB and LW). We've already seen Rafael breaking in pieces and returning back home so I wonder why people are surprised if VG feels that Shaw is not ready.

168~~~
LWB by a mile.

169~~~
This latest news doesn't change anything regarding what you've quoted. Stamina's got feck all to do with whether he's got the attacking chops to play as a wing back. Which is, I agree, a doubt (posted something along those lines myself yesterday)

Anyway, this 352 formation isn't set in stone. He didn't used it when he had a full squad for Holland and he probably won't used it when he has the squad he wants at United. He's said 433 is his formation of choice loads of times. Luke Shaw will cope just fine in that formation.

170~~~
Luke Shaw(t) of breath.

I'll get my coat.

171~~~
"I predict that Shaw will end up struggeling to be a starter"

what a bullshit! Hope the most United supporters are more patient with this boy. Of course it will take some time till he performs at the level we bought him for. Same story with De Gea. To have the expectation he makes us better from day 1 is so deluded

172~~~
Shaw has that stocky frame like Rooney, I would imagine they need quite a lot of hard running to get into peak fitness. Nothing to worry about and we still have 2/3 pre season games left. As long as he is ready by the start of the season what's the problem?.

Playing wing back is a role you need to have maximum stamina, and Shaw is perhaps a little behind on where LVG want's him right now, no big issue.

173~~~
Shaw looks like a natural athlete to me. The muscle tone he's got at such a young age is amazing to me.

174~~~
More like AnderShaw am I right guys?

175~~~
He's built absolutely nothing like Rooney <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

176~~~
Quality from LvG.

177~~~
Looked quite chubby on the few pics we have seen. And with LvGs comments he really seems to be unfit. I hope we can get him in shape soon enough

178~~~
Blind didn't even impress me for the Netherlands from an attacking perspective at the WC. He had 2 great assists in the opening game but I don't think he's anymore attacking than Shaw is, probably less.

179~~~
Like this from LVG, why not call him on it and make it public, it goes to show that the team will be fit. LWB or LB's these days should probably be the fittest players on the pitch so it should be a given.

180~~~
Remember when Moyes publicly called out Welbeck for not staying behind after training to practice his finishing? Danny's reaction was basically "I stay behind every day, I don't know what the f*ck he's on about."

At least Shaw has accepted that LvG is correct.

181~~~
He is quite young and has lot of good aspects to his play. A full back who is defensively good has become rarity these days so that is a plus. If he has to play as wing-back in 3-5-2 system, he will need to improve on attacking aspect and do lot of running so need to be fit to that level. Thankfully, in LvG we have a coach who understands each player very well and works on them individually so I don't think there is much to worry. He should be fine.

182~~~
Has he come out and said something?

183~~~
Yeah, agreed. Has an eye for a pass but that's about it. Can hardly ever remember him beating his man.

184~~~

185~~~
He certainly doesn't have anywhere as much pace as Shaw either.

186~~~
By the way, Pogue, I wasn't having a dig at Welbeck there. All things considered, I would take his version of events over Moyes'.

187~~~
Oh yeah, me too. In fact that was the first point in last season where I started wondering whether Moyes was losing the dressing room. He seemed to be wanting to take credit for Welbeck's form which ended up, understandably, pissing the player off.

Re Shaw, I was wondering if he'd actually come out and said anything himself about his fitness. Doesn't seem he has. The last bit about "good messages from Tony Strudwick" is a bit strange. Either he lacks fitness or not. If he's unfit they're not going to turn it round in a week or two, so what are the good messages?

Van Gaal can be quite confusing in what he says. I think it's a language thing. I suspect we're going to spend a lot of time this season picking apart slightly obtuse quotes!

188~~~
I said a while back Shaw and Herrera are signings that will improve after the first season or two and may not excel in their first year. However Herrera already looks good, but Shaw is definitely the former, he is very young and has talent, but rushing him panicking about him and overloading him will lead to him flopping. The problem is without the stability of SAF you become like every other top club, reactionary and panicky, I can guarantee lots on here will label him a bad signing if he does not excel in his first season.

189~~~
Why do people think fitness is judged entirely around how slim/toned someone looks? I know people who don't have an ounce of fat on them who literally look like they're going to die after playing football for 5 minutes.

Also, with the amount of training and running around footballers naturally have to do, I don't really get how it's possible to end up being particularly unfit. I mean unless the England camp are an utter joke Shaw was training every day in Brazil. If you're ok weight wise and training and not old, you must need to have a staggeringly bad diet to be in noticably bad shape fitness wise...and your fitness doesn't deteriorate in 10 days.

Van Gaal's probably being a little bit misleading. Some area of Shaw's game needs work and it's better to say it's a fitness thing than say "he's not good enough yet"...just guessing though.

190~~~
Early signs can be misleading. Young and Macheda looked great for us early on, while Evra and De Gea looked like bad signings after a few matches. Some of you lot need to stop being so dramatic.

191~~~
I'd agree with that. Especially when you consider that the freshest comparisons in LVG's mind are probably Valencia on the other flank and Kuyt from the WC. Both are monsters athletically speaking. It's also no surprise that an 18 year old can't quite run up and down a 120 yard stretch at pace over and over again for 90 minutes, which is what wingbacks usually have to do. I don't think anyone is that freakishly fit at 18.

192~~~
to be fair, while van Gaal's command of english isnt too shabby perhaps in these cases, this is where his words can be misleading. he's already spoke with shaw anyway so the resolution is already in place

193~~~
All I hear in LvG's words is that Shaw may not be playing much over the next couple of  weeks because he'll be on a different training schedule to some of the others. He's just turned 19, he played a lot of football last season and he's had an odd sort of summer in a training camp where the manager's focus is on the starting lineup, not him. He might have been better off having extra holiday and doing a  full pre-season. It might be something specific they need to work on, which could be his sprint speed as easily as his stamina.

I really don't think it means anything. As long as Shaw understands why he isn't starting/playing 90 minutes on the tour it doesn't matter.

194~~~
So basically, Shaw's fitness isn't where LvG wants it to be?

He has what, 3 weeks till the season starts? He'll be fine by then.

195~~~
Think this was more of psychological warning to both Shaw and the full squad that everything they do will be questioned under the new regime - he's setting an example and using a new signing to make the point.

196~~~
He looks like he's carrying too much weight to me. I imagine Van Gaal thinks the same.

197~~~
Even if Shaw doesn't adapt to playing as a wing back, it's pretty clear that LvG wants to move into a 4-3-3 as soon as he feels he has the squad to do so, and Shaw will look a lot better and a lot more confident as a left back.

198~~~
I can't say I've noticed but it amazes me how footballers manage to be overweight/unfit either way. You'd have to eat more or less nothing but the worst kind of crap, and a lot of it, because the amount of excercise they get through should more or less take care of things on its own.

Either that or some of them do a lot less training than is perceived.

199~~~
van Gaal never said Shaw isn't fit, he just said he needs to be <i><b>fitter</b></i> for the role he's playing.
He's built like a tank, always been and as he grows up he will become even larger. How can a player that's played over 30 games over a season and took part in World cup training and started pre-season training earlier not be as fit as the other players?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag475/protaras2003/4d0aRzh_zps9555af58.jpg" src="http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag475/protaras2003/4d0aRzh_zps9555af58.jpg"/>

That's how fat he looks.

200~~~
I think that's the issue. You can exercise as much as you want but if your diet is terrible you'll always be a bit of a fat bar-steward, especially if you're an individual who is prone to putting on weight. footballers don't compete in weight classes they might not have much motivation to watch what they eat and usually only train for a few hours each day, which gives them a lot of time to sit on their arse watching telly and eating pringles.

The flipside being skinny cnuts who can eat whatever the hell they want, do very little exercise and still look really trim. The latter do tend to baloon once they go above a certain age, mind you.

EDIT: Based on the photo on the previous age I don't think Shaw is overweight, mind you.

201~~~
And some guy suggested he looks nothing like Rooney <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> they've got like an identical body, apart from Shaw is more toned.

202~~~
Just moving this to the right thread.

Which does kind of indicate the issue is as much about him needing him to work on the attacking side of his game as it is about him needing to improve his stamina.

203~~~
Well LvG said he was unfit, so...

204~~~
Could he have meant fit as in suitable and not actual physical fitness? But then again Strudwick is the fitness coach. It's strange to single out a single player about not being fit enough when just a  few days ago he said none of the players are fit yet.

205~~~
Or maybe a bit of both. His fitness isn't quite where it needs to be and he also needs to work on the attacking side of his game. We're kind of stuck at the moment. Shaw's not a natural wing back and we've no left-footed wingers to convert into the role. No wonder Van Gaal is making Shaw work extra hard to get where he needs to be when the season starts. I just hope this doesn't backfire like it did the last time we "overtrained" someone.

206~~~
It would have to be almost 100% terrible though. Say if footballers are running on average 5k a day in training, plus they have matches on top of that, and a fair bit of weight training. That's an awful lot of energy being used...they'd have to eat a fair bit as it is just to keep on the muscle weight I would have thought.

I mean there are indesputably overweight and/or less fit footballers even at the top clubs in the PL, so there''s no denying it happens. I'm just baffled as to how. If anything I'd have thought the perma skinny types you mentioned would struggle more as they'd be using more energy than their body would usually maintain.

I wouldn't say I have a good diet for example. I eat enough protein and good foods but then plenty of crap on top of that...yet I can stay fit and keep at 75kg fairly comfortably just by running a few times a week, keeping up weight training, and playing football on Sunday (when I'm not hungover). The only way I could really screw this up is by either drinking loads nearly every night, or not eating any protein food at all.

...actually, maybe it's the booze that's the problem. I didn't consider that.

Not that this has anything to do with Luke Shaw. To be honest, I haven't paid nearly enough attention to say whether I think he's unfit or not. I would just presume that a 19 year old athlete who just came off world cup duty about 2 weeks ago, can't be in that bad shape...and at that age can't take too long to sort it out even if he is.

207~~~
He looks as if he puts on muscle easily (hence his huge legs), but he still looks like he's carrying too much body fat.

He can obviously still get up and down the pitch (as said earlier, their are people with very low body fat who are useless at running on a football pitch, and visa-versa) but looking at his face and arms, there's some fat there that can be stripped. He'd benefit from it, and even with low levels of fat,  he'll never look twiggy with his body type - much like Rooney.

He wouldn't have played the number of games he did for Pochettino's team if he wasn't fit enough. But he can definitely be in better shape, by the looks of it.

208~~~
For most, having a month off if they don't take care of themselves could be like a shock to the system. Basically doing extreme training every day for 11 months then suddenly stopping for a month, and just sitting around on vacation could easily see them put on the pounds since their bodies were used to a certain way of living. 

Don't think that's the case with shaw mind you, he looks like he's built as a tank and him being so young probably wasn't used to playing a full season and then going off to the World Cup, and then straight here more or less. That and the new position, I think it's more just working on his stamina and knowing where and when to make the runs up the field.

209~~~
That was a real problem for Fletcher actually (before his UC flared up) Not so much the producing energy thing (being skinny is no impediment to having great stamina, obviously) but in terms of becoming physically stronger. I remember him in an interview saying how hard he used to find it to put on muscle and how any weight that he managed to put on over the summer was all lost by the end of the season. There's a big variation in metabolic rates, most of which is down to genes. That said, no matter how bad your genes if you eat sensibly and exercise as much as a professional footballer you'll be in great shape. I reckon the footbballers you see who have a noticeable amount of body fat must be eating a lot of crap. I'm sure that's possible, though. They spend a lot of each day not doing much and if you're awash with cash yet very bored, it would definitely be tempting to comfort eat.

If you're eating plenty of crap and find it easy to stay the exact same weight then you must have a fairly high BMR. I used to be the same. Wait til you hit 40 though. You'll be having to deny yourself biscuits a lot more than you used to!

210~~~
I think you're over analysing this, he has a low bf% in that pic and it's only preseason. 

He's never played as a wing back before so maybe he doesn't fit the role yet rather than isn't fit.

If old man Kuyt can do the role Louis wants in ridiculous heat then Shaw better get his act together quickly.

211~~~
Kuyt barely has any excess fat on him and just has great stamina, so age isn't an issue. But I get your point. Shaw's not in bad shape, just could be better. And yes, he'll need to learn the role, and to be more comfortable receiving the ball from a stand still position. But it'll come in time. 

He may only play the wing-back role for a year or two, but it'll be beneficial for when he goes back to playing full-back.

212~~~
Too much? You can see his abs! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

213~~~
Obviously it's nothing major, and he's not fat. He's in good shape by non-athlete standards. Maybe 'too much' is harsh. He can obviously play well enough in his current shape. But he could benefit from a tiny bit of trimming down.
I expect any Premier League footballer's abs to be visible. But I think he could do with losing a little bit. Heck, I'm sure even he'd agree that he could get himself into slightly better shape.

Like I said, I think he's a natural muscular guy. One of those who always looks like they work out, and carries their weight well even when they've let themselves go a bit, but needs to work more on keeping their body fat down.
For example, Rooney's no less trimmer than Shaw right now, and I doubt his abs will show like that.

Obviously stamina doesn't 100% correlate with how overweight someone is. You either have it or you don't. But he'd just be that bit quicker across the ground and on the turn.
Hmmmm.... I'm probably just over-analysing things. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

214~~~
You can´t be serious. He is 19 years old, has just moved to one of the biggest clubs in the world, he has played 2 halfs in 2 preseason games so far and based on that you think he is showing signs of being a bad investment. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

215~~~
Just a concern because of the negative signs I have seen so far. You guys seem to take things out of context though and ignore the part where I said the lad is still young and will only get better.

216~~~
He just has wide hips which make him look bulkier than he actually is.

217~~~
A big arse can be a handy weapon on the football pitch. Anderson almost made a career out of his.

218~~~
Ivanovic has. Aguero and Hazard have similar physiques for small players and it benefits them in jostles also.

219~~~
Think Van Gaal appreciates his wing-backs probably held his Dutch team back at the World Cup in terms of attacking threat, not much more too it I think. As LVG said the wing-back's are the specialists in this system.

220~~~
Clearly Shaw isn't some kind of lazy bum given that he voluntarily come back early from his holidays. I think the individual training is just to help him adapt to his new role.

221~~~
Probably <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> But I can see your point!

222~~~
People on this site clearly have no fecking idea about body types if they keep claiming Rooney and shaw are overweight. its insulting.

223~~~
I'm surprised some of the media outlets haven't already started sticking the knives in.

"Luke Shaw already in exile" or something along those lines. He's probably used up a lot of mental energy being so young and signing for the biggest club in the World. He'll be fine once he settles into the routine of things.

224~~~
It's probably got SFA to do with his body weight (which everyone here seems fixated on) and everything to do with his overall fitness (stamina, speed) which may be behind that of the other players even though they have just returned. Not difficult to fix.

225~~~
I think that's how professional athletes look after a period of partying and festivities.  Just because they pig out doesn't mean they will lose their muscles, and if he increased his body fat % it probably won't be visible unless he keeps on eating crap for months.  Rooney has looked out of shape during preseason many times in the past few years, but he still looked fitter than 99% of us.

226~~~
I think its not a case of him not being Fit enough full stop. I would suggest he isnt fit enough for Manchester United yet. The kid has promise and could be sensational for us. The problem is hes taken a huge jump. Hes playing for a club that is used to winning titles and competing for the champions league (last season blah blah blah) and hes come from a side more known for its multiple promotions through the division than its trophy haul.

Its a similar effect with Fellaini except he was never at the base level Shaw is. I wouldnt be surprised if LVG is talking about his twitch muscle reflexes and his overall stamina and sharpness rather than his body fat content or his muscular weight (which may be high anyway). He will have to completely change the way he trains, extreme cardiovascular exercise with minimum weight training if any at all and at very low weights. Hell have to change his diet completely too, rather than stocking up on proteins, hell be instructed to concentrate on eating vegetables, lean fish and pasta for energy. It will take him about 2-3 months to fully adapt and when he does we will be in for a treat. I just hope it does not effect him mentally and defensively.

227~~~
Big frame, easier to put on muscle and fat. He will have to work harder than others, otherwise he'll end up like Ando

228~~~
I've thought this from the first press conferences. To be honest his English was pretty rusty during that, which is not a criticism, just fact. However, this will undoubtedly improve during the season in the English Premier League and also in his alledged instruction for everyone to speak English. Perhaps he said that to help his own! But it can't be easy answering pertinent questions from hungry British journalists who are always trying to read a multitude of things from every word said. I think he's done bloody well so far, but definitely he will say things that confuse and are slightly unclear...

229~~~
Matt Law is saying that it was Shaw who went forward and told van Gaal that he doesn't feel fit enough.

230~~~
I think it's being blown way out of proportion. As a LWB your job requires you to not only defend but to be the sole attacking wide outlet. His running requirements have basically doubled from what you'd expect as a modern day fullback.

231~~~
Overweight <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Some people just love to embarrass themselves. Shaw is coming across bloody brilliant so far. Not only do I rate him big time but firstly he returned a week early from his holidays and now he's personally asked for extra training to get sharper in his fitness and performance. That's the kind of work ethic and attitude I love to see and the kind of attitude that separates alot of great players from the good players.

232~~~
Great attitude to have.

233~~~
Someone explain to me how Luke Shaw is "not fit enough"?

He was fit going into the World Cup and was hardly overplayed in that. Has he just let himself go on holiday or what???

234~~~
I don't know. But imo just a 10 days rest for him was a bit stupid by himself.

235~~~
Not an ideal way to start his United career, well whatever it is i hope Shaw will be fit again really soon, not much time left before the season kick off.

236~~~
Where did LVG say Shaw is unfit though? Difference between not quite being up to standard and just not being fit

237~~~
“He is ok, but I am always a trainer-coach who sees individuals and what they need,” the Dutchman said of Shaw. “He needs to be fit and is not very fit and fit enough to do what I want. He needs to train individually until he is fit. I cannot judge that, but I see what I see. I have spoken with him and we have made a programme for him. He agreed with me.”

To the question of how long his arrival at Premier League readiness would take, Van Gaal replied: “That we have to see, but that I don’t know. I have heard good messages from Strud (fitness coach Tony Strudwick), but we have to see.”

238~~~
Who's actually said that?

239~~~
You guys actually think he's fecking fat? Lmfao, if thats fat then sign me up!!!

240~~~
He looks the second least leanest after Rooney to be honest, so I noticed when we were playing Galaxy.

241~~~
thanks crono. another non-story. *sigh*

242~~~
Nobody's actually called him fat though.

243~~~
Theres a few people, cant remember names exactly but there are definantly comments suggesting shaw and rooney in particular are fat through the caf. which is just not the case in any way.

244~~~
This fatty is quick as feck. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Did good today.

245~~~
van Gaal was pleased with his performance.

246~~~
Best half so far from him, he looked much more relaxed and confident when attacking.

247~~~
Keep eating the pies Luke.

248~~~
insert fat joke here

249~~~
The fastest stoned guy I've ever seen.

He's slowly starting to grasp the concept of VG's philosophy. The individual trainings organized for him may be the key.

250~~~

Shaw wasn't supposed to play tonight, only played because James had a knock

252~~~
If he isn't fit currently, he's going to dominate when he is.

256~~~
Good boy Shaw acknowledging it. Not that he had anyother choice.

257~~~
Good game from Shaw. Bit bananas the way we're already so reliant on a 19 yo kid who just joined the club. The difference between him and playing Ashley Young on the wrong flank was huge.

258~~~
I agree. THought he did really well.

I for one enjoyed our second half more as a whole than the first (albeit that beautful passage of play between Mata and ROoney). Much more pace in our passing and more chances created.

259~~~
Good attitude. He'll do well with that under LvG.

I do think that we'll have to be patient with him and it will be a few years till we even start seeing the best of him.

260~~~
What number shirt was he wearing against Inter?

261~~~
28, but MUTV said those numbers aren't final.

262~~~
To be fair we could have played James, who's done well so far, but he had a little knock or something.

263~~~
Nice to see being such an expensive buy so young hasn't gone to his head and he's ready to admit his downfalls (his fitness) recently.  Luckily its something that can be worked on too.  Personally i think he's already doing well, defensively his performance this morning was sound imo, and he looks very determined every time the ball comes near him, pretty sure once he's settled into a season he's going to fill the position nicely.

On his fitness: he's not the leanest on the team, but he's far from fat.  He's 18 though ffs, his physique will change a lot over the next few years anyway, so nothing to worry about just yet as long as he can get through 90 minutes ok.

265~~~
I'm not saying he's not a good player but the signing is becoming even more bizarre over the last week or so. First, never had this lad down as a wing back, more a really solid LB player in a traditional back four. I'm not saying he cant do it but surely you dont pay 27m for a player thats not suited for your system. I'm convinced this is not a LVG signing. This is a signing we were already committed to from last season. Also, the comments about his fitness, Players are fit or they are not. You dont become 'more fit' for playing a certain role?

266~~~
1) We wanted him since January

2) We're playing this system maybe just for 1 season....in the next 10 years he can play left-back

3) All should calm down ffs....he has played just 3 feckin friendlies

4) Fit or not fit....Van Gaal and his team will make him fit!!!!!

267~~~
What player do you have down as a wing back i wonder, someone like Coentrao?

LVG has already said that Shaw and Herrera were signing already on the list, and that he also liked. So he agreed to them being bought. Also you can be fit and unfit for different formations, They way Alves used to play the right wing under pep was different class - i don't think every right back could have done that, as a wing back you are doing two peoples jobs.

268~~~
Not being funny but thats absolute rubbish. You're either fit or your not. Also we are not talking about a player who's returning from injury or an older player. The lads just returned from world cup duty where although he didn't play much, was training more so than others outside of pre-season. Look at the lads age and LVG specifically singled him out. Don't you find that strange?

Wing backs for me are players that started their careers as wingers and are converted to defenders like Ashley Cole and Evra and many more. Naturally better going forward. Then there's Gary Nev who's your traditional RB that overlaps the winger. Shaw is the later for me.


1) thats my point, we wanted him under the old regime. I'm convinced we already bought him before LVG got here so was Hobsons choice.

2) So, where did you get this only one season from?

3) Lets just shut down the forum then till the start of the season if we cant make observations?

4) Make him fit? see above

269~~~
For a big lad, he sure does have some pace about him.

The next Gareth Bale? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

270~~~
Different roles have different fitness requirements in the same way they have different technical requirements, that's fairly obvious.

271~~~
Sorry thats rubbish. Footballers might be fit, but thats relative to the player, not their role or their technical ability. All players have different levels of fitness which is generic and has no relationship with <i>how fit you make them. </i>Giggs was naturally a fit lad, once he was fit, you couldn't make him any fitter?

Is ridiculous to suggest the fitness players in the club, are the ones who have to run the most....thats just not true. There have been instances where GK's have been the fitness players in clubs, and they rarely run on the pitch.

I can only suggest that Shaw's fitness levels are not where they should be with regard to his capacity to be fitter, which is nothing to do with the role of playing wing back. This is strange given his age and the fact he's trained all summer?

272~~~
Ah, we have a sports scientist. 'Giggs was naturally a fit lad, once he was fit, you couldn't make him any fitter.'

Sounds legit.

I think I'll go with what the manager and player have actually said, which is that he needs to be a bit fitter for the wing-back role.

273~~~
Excuse me, thought it was a football forum and not B.A.S.E. Managers and players say a lot of things and the last time I logged onto this forum, there was a thousand posts questioning and offering opinions exactly on what managers and players say and do. Thought that was the purpose of public forums. I might be wrong?

274~~~
I thought forums were for discussion more than anything else. Telling anyone that doesn't agree with you that they're talking rubbish doesn't tend to be particularly conducive to a good discussion.

275~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

276~~~
First of all id say Cole was better defensively than he was going forward. LVG said Shaw wasnt fit enough yet and that he cant do what he wants him to do at the highest level. He has designed a program to get him fitter, why cant you accept that?  Its not as black and white as you put it - "You are either fit or not". Shaw just came out and said in a interview that he mistakenly underestimated how much harder the training would be at United (its on youtube), if the player himself can say that, what makes you say different?

277~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

278~~~
It is. My opinion is that your suggestion that a player is either fit or not fit is rubbish. Anyone who's done any kind of sport of any sort knows there are levels of fitness. And the words of the player and the manager suggest that Shaw is not <i>unfit</i>, he's just not fit <i>enough</i> for the wingback role.

279~~~
How ridiculous. How do you qualify 'fit enough'? Its the same principle as being injured. You either are or your not. Its like saying "he's only fit enough to play one half" therefore he's not fit....Its funny cause anyone who does know about sports science recognises the 'smoke n' mirrors' of LVG's simplistic statement. 

I suspect that Shaw might be carrying a little to much 'body fat' than LVG would like. The lad like Rooney have the body shape where they have to be aware of their BMI for being a professional footballer.

280~~~
What are they saying

281~~~
"Luke Shaw is going to Brazil"
"Hes off to Brazil, luke shaws off to Brazil"
"luke shaw eats at burger king" 
"you fat bastard he's off to burger king"

282~~~
ok thanks its really funny

283~~~
Because I dont take everything that comes out of the football club as being the law. The reason for this is there a so many examples where we've been told things that have come out later to be a lie. Its no big deal, no one has the monopoly for knowledge and its my opinion. As is thousands of views on here for why players remain at the club, why we paid that for this player and many more debates?

I not suggesting that LVG or Shaw didn't say it, just my experience players are fit or they are not. If they are improving their fitness levels thats moving towards being fit. Its someones carry an injury, are they injured or not? Its not suggesting that they cant play? Its not suggesting that they cant play for 90 mins either.

I find it amazing that we'd pay 27m for someone who's fitness levels would have been tested, to then now suggest that he's not fit enough for us. I've been around football and sports a long time, and I cant recall at this level where a manager at a press conference signals out a signing to suggest he's 'not fit enough' for what he wants him to do. I certainly seen 'he's not fit' but 'fit enough'......He's not even suggesting he'll get fit within the existing fitness regime of the players but requires a specific programme?

Sorry thats a LVG 'shot across the bow' at someone.

Just my opinion......

284~~~
I though he done well in that second half when he came on. He's had such a big move coming here and is playing in a new role.. so much to learn yet, getting unfair stick from all quarters at the moment, feel for him.

He'll come good.

285~~~
Have you seen Shaw's six-pack? You don't get one like that by having too much body fat. Rooney's certainly never had one!

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on the fitness thing. For me, fitness is a scale. You can be very near the top of it, very fit, which I suspect Shaw is, and still as an elite athlete need to fine-tune yourself to your very peak levels in order to be putting in the best performances you are capable of.

286~~~
Yeah he was impressive in the second half against Inter. Probably the best half that any of our potential wingbacks have played so far.

287~~~
I guess so. Maybe its semantics and I'm not suggesting not fit = unfit. Yep seen the six pack but might just me but he looks 'heavy'. Rooneys never fat but if you look at him at the moment he looks good.

288~~~
Thought he looked a lot better today.

He's a funny one though, most young full backs thesedays are very good going forward, but suspect defensively, yet Shaw is the complete opposite. He's very good defensively (fast, strong in the tackle, has good awareness and positioning, makes plenty of interceptions), but its going forward that he needs to work on things. Impressed me a lot today though.

289~~~
Was very good I thought. Much better going forward.

290~~~
He is suited to when we are playing on the counter in this system. Then he can completely own that side with excellent interceptions and break quickly with composure.

Don't get why he stops sometimes when onto the last defender though. Needs to do a Bale and knock the ball past and just beat him for Pace/Strength few times.

291~~~
He can be very useful in 3-5-2, but he needs to be more brave. 
He can cross a ball in a few different ways while galloping, something I haven't seen among our players for a while.

292~~~
No issues with his performance for me, he defended well and used the ball well when he got in good positions rather than just blasting it across or smashing it off the fullback.

293~~~
Did well today, sometimes looks a bit lost when he has a defender in front of him (when attacking), big improvement from the previous games I have seen him in.

294~~~
Still think he'd be an absolute beast at LCB but was very good at wingback too today. Either way he's unreal already for his age.

295~~~
Very promising performance. I think he'll slot right into our first team no problems, looks a real Manchester United sort of player.

296~~~
On a few occasions he put in an excellent cross and picked the right man. Defensively very solid, considering it was against Madrid that is impressive.

297~~~
I think he could become a good left sided central defender and may be we should be looking for a good left footed wing back with James as cover, or maybe stay as he he is and then Vermalen looks like an intelligent buy if he can stay fit. In either scenario Shaw and Blacket and James seem to have the left side of the defense covered, we just need that expereinced defender as they are all so young

298~~~
He has the odd concentration issue but he does read the game very well for a young fullback. You can see his attacking game will improve as he becomes more comfortable and confident because he's definitely got the technique, composure and pace to carry a decent attacking threat.

299~~~
I think he will completely lockdown the left hand side by himself in a few years.

300~~~
Missed the game unfortunately but good to hear that the lad has done well

301~~~
Shouldn't worry too much at this early stage, he's learning with a new coach at a new team.

For me it's similar to the Rio signing, big big money but money well spent cause it's guaranteed (injury withstanding)15 years of top class service...for me he's that good.

EDIT - not sure if he has played 3 at the back before now in such a short career...another reason to give some slack.

302~~~
Shaw looked better in this match than he did before. He still has a few issues going forward, but he's definitely improving and looking better going forward than before. He still seems to have some trouble in 1-on-1 situations, but other than that, he's more daring with his game and is adding more variety to it as well. Defensively, he's very good and is adapting himself better in the wing back role. I just hope he gets more match time so that he can get himself fully adjusted to the role and settled into the first team.

303~~~
An okay game, but could have offered more in attack. He had space and opportunities.

304~~~
Any other performances of tonight's players you want to play down?

305~~~
Shaw has looked a lot more...shall we say 'awake' since LVG critisied his fitness.

I'd still like to see him played as the left sided CB a few times.

306~~~
He looks like one of the best left-footed defenders around and will be a huge asset once he settles into the team.

307~~~
Looked more comfortable today.

308~~~
He was quality, loved his driving runs forward, he aint half fast for a fatty.

309~~~
Like I've said before, I don't think ever seen an 18 year old defender with his maturity and composure. Definitely not at fullback. So, I don't see someone with his sort of decision making and composure, struggling to make the switch to wing back. Given a bit of time, he'll be quality there I reckon.

310~~~
The fat prick looked fast against Madrid. Imagine how quick he will be if he stops eating, losses the beer belly and actually trains. It's scary really! Haha

311~~~
Doesn't look a natural wingback right now but he sure looks like he has all the components. Provided us with actual width as opposed to you who stopped and made the pass inside.

312~~~
He looked rapid when he was running. He's quicker than I thought.

313~~~
I have no idea how this guy got promoted (not you, Lane). Couldnt stop telling us how this was all just a pre season game and all that. Maybe a Moyes fanboy? No idea why he is actually here when there is nothing to do but moan for him.

314~~~
Looked dangerous today and i'm looking forward to him giving opposing defenders nightmares.

315~~~
He definitely doesn't use his full pace 90% of the time. 

A lot of the game he just jogs about looking quite casual, then he suddenly bursts into life and flys forward. With that pace defending too it makes him really hard to beat.

316~~~
I know and how bad was De Gea I mean I once saved a penalty so why couldn't De Gea stop that one. Needs a loan at a lower prem team IMO. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

317~~~
I still think he'll be pushed into the LCB role eventually. Had a difficult opening 20mins (like the entire 2nd half team) but once everyone settled down he started to look a threat moving forwards.

318~~~
Pleased with him. Unfortunately he won't be bale mk2 <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> as bale always had a great shot on him but we can see the progress he's making. Even though these are pre season games, playing big teams can only help him and give him more confidence going into the season. I don't think many people will consider the price much of an issue now. Providing he keeps fit and working hard, he'll do well for us.

319~~~
Looked far more comfortable coming on against tired players, could be our new super sub? Wing back takes a lot of energy so can see our sub's being in those positions.

320~~~
Yeah just seen him and bruiser, another newly promoted one, in the "We.Are.Back" thread playing down the pre season as a whole, telling everyone not to get excited and treating the games like LA galaxy as the equivalent of Crewe, where in fact it seems everyone is more excited about <i>how</i> we are playing, which is evidently superior to any game of last season.

You go through about 6 or 7 of the player threads last night, and all he can say about a player is "he did okay, but X Y and Z wrong". On a day where we outshone Madrid in how we played rather than cower in defensive mode <i>is </i>something to praise, friendly or not. We would never, ever have seen this from Moyes at this stage of the season, heck we had lost 2 games in pre season at this stage already if memory serves me well!

321~~~
So it seems LVG has confirmed that Young's going to play the full 90 vs Liverpool, I wonder if that means no Shaw, or if Young might play on the right? I was looking forward to seeing Shaw again.

322~~~
Yeah he's gonna be a super sub <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

323~~~
Um... I think he just played really well, to be honest.

Same. I'm hoping that Shaw left and Young right will be our starting wingbacks going into the season proper (with Rafa getting his chance to compete with Young once he's fit again, obviously). So maybe that's what he's going to try out against Liverpool.

324~~~
Hope for this too. There's just something depressing about both Young and Valencia in the same line-up.

325~~~
If Young is playing the full 90, wouldn't surprise me if he plays one half on the right and the other on the left with Shaw and Valencia playing 45 minutes each.

326~~~
Really need big games from our wing backs tonight. Liverpool are prone to getting their full backs caught up the field which gives space for Young/Shaw to drive into.

327~~~
£30m super-sub left back? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

328~~~
I'm not been able to catch any of the games but how has Shaw progressed during the tour? I know LvG said he was a bit unfit for the role he's been asked to do but has he got a good attitude to succeed at the club?

329~~~
Doesn't look fit enough yet. if he works at his fitness my be a good player. Not overly impress with his offensive play at the moment to be honest. Young has been far more productive in  the final third when playing left wing back on the tour.

330~~~
I'm sure over time that will come along with his performances offensively. We know could do it with Southampton. Just needs a bit of time to settle into the new team.

331~~~
Started off quite shaky (looked nervous to me) but has steadily grown into it. Looks very solid defensively, strong in the tackle, good at tracking runners, and very good at making interceptions. Going forward he's obviously very fast, but needs to work on beating a man and crossing (which apparently he already has been working on in training)

332~~~
I'd just add that he's quite good at playing the ball infield and on the ground, rather than only going vertically, an underrated skill for a fullback.

333~~~
I don't want to curse him but he's looked a lot better since the whole fitness thing. He's responded fantastically to it so far after his first two disappointing appearences for us.

He's managed to make good out of the situation so far. Really positive signs from him.

334~~~
Looked good since he came on. Physical beast for a 19 year old.

335~~~
He was good in this half but I wish he demands the ball more than he does at the moment, it's quite obvious he can make a difference but he is quiet at times.

336~~~
He's an awfully auld looking 19 year old.

337~~~
It must be gut-wrenching as a wingback busting a nut to get yourself open and then being completely ignored, and the team losing the ball anyway. Happened to him twice in that half.

338~~~
Been great. Looks like Shaw on the left and Young on the right is our best pairing at the moment...

339~~~
His first touch is far far better than I ever thought. He releases the ball at the right time and plays nice neat passes. Bombs forward too. Quality looking addition.

340~~~
Impressive. I hope he can be an Irwin or Evra who rarely misses a game.

341~~~
Between him and Young as our best player tonight.

342~~~
I'm impressed that Shaw found himself when other more experienced players seemed to get overcome by the ocassion of playing Liverpool. Its just pre-season but he didn't show the panicky play some others did, which totally contrasted his nervous first few appearances. Showed bottle tonight. Pleased.

343~~~
White Evra.

344~~~
He's brilliant. He is going to be a star.

345~~~
Really like the look of him. He has great intelligence in the final third, beyond his years.

346~~~
Impressive. Will be even better when his fitness peaks.

347~~~
He's got a great first touch and a very good pass on him

348~~~
He's been continuously getting better after a nervous couple of matches. Like Evra, his attacking contribution is a lot more than what his stats show.

349~~~
Very accomplished. Get the feeling he'll keep gradually improving until he's a rock at LB.

350~~~
He's a beast.

351~~~
Very good performance again. Really like the look of him.

352~~~
Very impressive and very happy for him too, he actually looked chuffed in the team photo with the trophy. Defends well, his first touch is actually perfect and his low cross to the 18 yard line is a very intelligent pass with great vision, he's done it in every match this tour and each time finding his man but majority of the time that player wasn't expecting it. Few more games together and they'll be waiting for that ball!

353~~~
He reminds me a bit of Kagawa in the attacking third.

354~~~
He's getting better and better <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Going to be difficult to choose between Young and Shaw in that LWB role.

355~~~
Shaw left wing-back, Young right wing-back. I fully expect us to start versus Swansea like this.

356~~~
He did really well. He's got such a great burst of pace and he looks very composted. It's mad to think he's only 19.

357~~~
Did really well again, he is quickly going to become a fans favourite I think.

358~~~
I like him a lot. He got more comfortable in his role as the tour went along. Impressed with his performances and effort, he'll be a star.

359~~~
He is progressively getting better. Took the criticism really well and looks sharper now. Some more improvement in crossing and he can be a fantastic LB/LWB.

360~~~
There was one incredible burst infield  with the ball second half, my stream was crap and I assumed it was Rooney, such was the power and pace. Couldn't believe it was Shaw - he's really good already and still settling in.

361~~~
Arguably our best player today. Can't wait to see how he turns out once he reaches his full potential.

362~~~
Permission to join the hype train please?

I was so impressed today. For a 19 year old full back to be <i>that </i>good defensively is quite incredible imo. Madrid and Liverpool have barely got a sniff out of him in the two games (in fact the one time today I thought they had beaten him it turned out to be Cleverley <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>). One thing that has really impressed me is his ability one on one with an attacker. He seems to have this incredible ability to read the attacker, he doesn't fall for the shimy or the trick, and usually goes the way the attacker does and nicks the ball of him. Its like the complete opposite of Evra, who it got to the point where I expected him to get beaten by his man, wheres with Shaw I'm actually expecting him to the win the one on one.

I actually focused on this today, as I hadn't really noticed before, and you're absolutely right. He's very very good on the ball. Tends to play the correct pass most of the time, with really crips, quick interchanges.

He's a gem.

363~~~
Looks fit and pacy now! One thing that annoyed me was everyone on the team insisting on passing the ball to him by aiming it 3 feet above his head.

364~~~
What a game from him. He will be a worthy successor for Evra.

365~~~
He is rapid off the mark and links up well in the channel's, but what I like most is his use of the ball when crossing, he doesn't just whack it across into a zone hoping it will be attacked, he looks to play it into a runner.

366~~~
Luke Maldini

367~~~
He's quite good, this guy.

368~~~
I noticed in the Real game that Carvajol clocked him, I think he was suprised how good he was. He's very committed in the way he plays.

369~~~
He's steadily improved since the first match which is pleasing. He'll end up being a very good player, just has to keep improving and all will be fine. He does look like he is carrying some extra weight. I know he's big and that's probably all it is but he looks heavy, to me anyway.

370~~~
I think the beard makes him look fatter than he is.

371~~~
Felt this was his best display so far. Looked far more composed and showed a great touch when driving forward.

372~~~
as i said before, the kid is solid already. LVG can work wonders with him

373~~~
Only saw the second half but he was pretty good. Solid defensively but I was extremely impressed with his passing. Was always picking the right option.

374~~~
The weight of pass especially, he was always giving the receiver the best possible chance to continue with the flow.

375~~~
I think this picture sums up his performance

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/23/article-2637384-1E23387600000578-182_634x422.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/23/article-2637384-1E23387600000578-182_634x422.jpg"/>

376~~~
Thought he was quite good today. Would have been nice though, if Evra had stayed to mentor the kid. He's different from Evra in the sense that he relies on his pace and is good at crossing the ball, or picking players out in the box from the left (as he did today with Mata). Evra relied more on his dribbling skills to get by players and was good at interplay and short intricate passing. (Pretty bad at crossing though).

So Shaw is a different type of fullback from Evra, but had Evra stayed on he could probably have taught him some of the aspects of his own game that would have been useful. It is what it is though, and it certainly looks like Shaw could be an asset for us.Still think he needs a little more training to get fully fit.

377~~~
Nice to hear from a Barca fan

378~~~
He had a good game last night. Looks to be responding well to the high standards van Gaal has set for him.

Over 80 minutes under his belt won't do him any harm either.

379~~~
Wouldn't be surprised to see Shaw and Young as our starting wing backs against Swansea.

380~~~
his best game since he came,he was an absolute monster.

381~~~
No doubt it is them to start against Swansea, I think Young plays better from the left though. His in-swingers seem more dangerous than his out-swingers. Gives LVG an interesting conundrum to sort out.

382~~~
I hope so.

383~~~
Somebody stopping crosses coming in from the left.Result

I cant believe he is 19 though. He does look very comfortable and even against Liverpool who were pressing quite a bit, he didn't panic once, unlike Evans who's been there and done it.

384~~~
You’re right. Shaw is massive improvement on Evra, defensively he’s already very good, and I always thought Evra’s crossing was pretty bad.

I take a fullback/wingback who is good at crossing over the one which main strength is dribbling, everyday. He still has time to develop this side of his game mind you.

385~~~
He was superb yesterday. Especially considering how poor most of our players were in the first half. Evans was having a meltdown next to him but he looked incredibly calm on the ball. I already feel more confident of his defending than I did of Evra's at the end. Stopping crosses, for crying out loud!

386~~~
More of that please.

Looks the real deal, as he's always done.

387~~~
Was very impressed with the lad last night, really wanted to see some more of him and he didnt dissapoint, he has that burst of energy in his runs that Rooney used to have and is working on getting back. Hes the kind of player that when the winger bursts down his wing you simply know that Shaw will catch up and go in hard and thats why I think we love him, he doesnt give up and his fitness is starting to match his desire.

He does EXACTLY what Evra used to do though, rather than a conventional cross he prefers the cut back which is smart when executed as sharply as he has done, his team mates will get used to it and I hope his pace keeps up so that opposition ddefences simply dont have the time to recover.

388~~~

389~~~
That burst infield at 3.00 was very impressive. He showed a lot of traits I really hadn't credited him with before in the last couple of games. His passing infield is really good, to go with his already superb defensive skills. 

Big upgrade on the Evra of the last 2-3 years. Frightening how good he could become.

390~~~
He has really superb technique on the ball which I hadn't fully credited in his Southampton performances. Wonderfully delicate control of the ball when running at full pace.

391~~~
He's superb now so can't wait to see how good he is at his peak! 8 years away from it at least, this is gonna be a bargain!

392~~~
He is a little tank, he glides across the ground at incredibly deceptive speed. Looks such a natural runner.

393~~~
He does look fat though.

394~~~
Do you even lift bro?

395~~~
Agreed with the rest, looked very good last night, very comfortable on the ball, picked it up and wasn't afraid to take it forward, precise passing as well, looks a great prospect, hopefully can become LvG's left-wingback of choice.

396~~~
All Shaw does is lift burger by the looks of things.

397~~~
A protein burger.

398~~~
He had a few Bebatov-esque touches to bring the ball out of the air yesterday.

399~~~
Please show be a picture of Shaw where he looks fat. Do you want him to be anorexic or something? Is Ander Herrera the ideal build?

400~~~
He's lampard fat, big boned and a bubble butt.

401~~~
Shaw is the new Andooney or Roonderson if you prefer.

402~~~
I never realized how stocky he was. Especially for a teenager, I think athletically if he can keep himself fit then he will be a very good player.

403~~~
Very good at linking up with his teammates but i want him to attack opposition players more,especially when he is 1 on 1 with the fullback.maybe he does'nt realize this but he is actually quick. Knock the ball and then run ala bale could actually work for shaw.

404~~~
Fixed*

"Luke Shaw spots a kebab stand"

406~~~
he seems to have a physique not dissimilar to Phil Jones but he is deceptively quick and covers the grass well

he's obviously not at his best in terms of fitness - in a few weeks I think he'll be in great shape

407~~~
"Uses it as the starting point for some shuttle runs"

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/b6O8h46.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/b6O8h46.png"/>

There's really never been a serious case for this being about actually being 'fat' or 'out of shape'. It's about fine tuning already decent fitness in order to be able to perform to your very best in the most physically gruelling position on a football pitch.

One picture with his shirt billowing unflatteringly doesn't change that.

408~~~
He doesn't look fat there and he clearly has something on under his shirt which is creating those weird bumps on his stomach unless he has some sort of tumors which he doesn't. There are plenty of pics of him with no shirt on and he is a tank. Just because he isn't some skinny kernt doesn't make him fat or anywhere close to being fat.

409~~~
Surprised he's getting so much stick. If anyone should get it I though it would be Phil Jones. Now he's stocky!

410~~~
Great talent, very happy we got him.

411~~~
Definite fatboy beardface he's got going on.

Looked excellent last night though, let his talent do the talking rather than his bodyshape and he'll be fine.

412~~~
Oh sweet lord, how is this total myth already replicating. There's nothing for his talent to 'do the talking' instead of. There is no bodyshape problem! He's very obviously not at all overweight, you can see it with the naked eye.

413~~~
On my phone - hence the typos and odd random word.
Stubble usually chisels the face, if anything.

Nobody has said the guy is fat or is carrying too much weight to play a game of football.
And you can be underweight and still be carrying too much body fat. It's not that he'd be too heavy on the scales, but that he might be carrying a little excess fat if he wants to be at his best.

He's a built lad anyway, and he'll obviously never be skinny like Ashley Young, and nobody wants him to be like that either - because it's not even close to a natural or sustainable for him.guy, but he still looks, to some, as if he could take off a bit of body fat. It's really not a huge deal.

414~~~
How many sneaky balls to the edge of the box did he deliver when everyone thought he'd cross it? I've been impressed with his intelligence over pre-season.

415~~~
It was fantastic.

There was a point where I was a bit annoyed by it. Felt like he was being a bit too safe and needed to go for it a bit more but he grew in confidence as the tour went on. Every performance was better than the last.

I fancy him to live up to all expectations over the coming years.

416~~~

417~~~
He kind of looks like a guy who's been 'bulking' in that picture - right before they'd go on a 'cut'. He's obviously still in good shape there though.

418~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this thread is reminding me of the Anderson ones, people arguing he is fat or not

419~~~
Agree. But it seems if Shaw is and performs well he'll be lovable chubby, Anderson is/was just depressing chubby.

420~~~
Yeah I can see it lasting the whole year....

Deary me. The youth of today really do wear some disturbing outfits. The other bloke looks unsure if he should be stepping out in public looking like that.

423~~~
That pic is 10% or below body fat. it doesnt really get much better than that, hes just a tank.

424~~~
Looks like someone who wouldn't even have any interest in football.

425~~~
From last season. Hardly stocky.

426~~~
Yea. The older generation says that all the time. I was born in the 80s and every decade i've heard the same things.

427~~~
My old man probably said that about my fluro tracksuit and beehive in the 80s.

428~~~
I'm from Shaw's generation, and on behalf of 'my people' I can tell you that he looks like a total prat to us too.

429~~~
To each their own. It seems to be a look quite a few indie bands are rocking. The pants are too much <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

430~~~
noway that he has below 10% body fat in this picture. Something around 12-15% which is okay for his body/amount of muscles. Professional footballer have in average around 10%, depening on position/body type.

431~~~
Yeah, I'd say a minimum of 15%. But he looks like he has a naturally high amount of sub-cutaneous fat, so that's always going to be the case. It hardly makes him fat. Giggs had more of a paunch in his last few years.

432~~~
Yep, I'd say about 15%, which is probably higher than Rooney's.
He clearly puts on muscle easily though, while Rooney doesn't, which is why Rooney wont ever have a good six pack, and will have slightly flabby arms even with lower levels of body fat.

15% isn't bad, and it clearly doesn't make him fat, but if it could be brought down to 12 ish %, it would be a benefit. He wont ever be twiggy, in the same way Rooney isn't, even at his trimmest.

Some players (like Shaw) are muscular but have to work more than others to keep their fat down; some (De Gea or Young) have no problems with keeping to ideal levels of body fat, but have to worker harder to gain and mantain muscle; some (Welbeck or Valencia) have it easier and have great natural bodies to work with. Some one like Rooney (and to a lesser extent, Joe Cole as an example) doesn't put on muscle that easily and also has to work harder at keeping his fat down.

433~~~
You realise how defined his torso and in particular his abs are in that photo? in order to see that six pack definition you need to be around 10% body fat give or take. i disagree that he's closer to 15% but this is all semantics really and anecdotal. im sure we can start quoting bodybuilding forums at some point <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

434~~~
Christ this is boring.

435~~~
Apparently he's banging some reality TV slag. Great.

436~~~
He's only 18/19. 

Get in Luke!

Hardly thin! Beer belly on that

438~~~
Yep.

He is closer to 10 than he is to 15 for sure. He looks too define there to be 15. People regularly confuse looks for fitness though. A fat Rooney is still fitter than most fitness models with perfectly chiselled bodies. They train to look good he trains to be fit.

439~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That is a bloody unflattering shot of both Rooney and Jones.

440~~~
I wish I was as fat as Shaw...

441~~~
Eh? Rooney doesn't put on muscle easily?

442~~~
Oh come on please! The wind blowing through the shirts is seriously misleading you here. Same with Rooney next to him and the same can be said of the Luke Shaw photo from earlier in this thread. Show me a photo of Jones without his shirt on and lets see that beer belly.

443~~~
Leave him alone. The poor fella has clearly shat himself.

444~~~
Just cringed a bit for him hearing Roy Hodgson on SSN talking about his body shape developing and his "puppy fat" (I think he actually did air quotes at one point)!

The essence of what he was saying was probably correct but it was still a tad 'embarrassing Dad/Grandad-esque'.

445~~~
The faces, always the faces! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

446~~~
Any news on the injury? LvG confirmed that Shaw and Evans are injured.

447~~~
Out for up to a month

448~~~
Out for up to a month according to SSN.

449~~~
He's caught Man Utd defender-itis.

450~~~
Feck sake. Can we catch a fecking break with these injuries?

451~~~
Well that's his first box ticked on the "Manchester United defender" checklist...

452~~~
He has finally arrived as a Manchester United defender.

453~~~
Can't be long before that Ducth trainer c*nt chimes in, having a go at Van Gaal for making him do extra training.

454~~~
fecks sake. What a pisstake.

455~~~
Un-fecking-believable.

Could do with a banging head against wall smiley. I would get a lot of use out of it.

456~~~
Gutted for him, he needs game time to fully gel with the squad.  But delighted for Young though, perfect opportunity to carry his form into the new season.

457~~~
We were asking for it; part of the risk when you leave all your transfers until so late. No top team should be starting their season with only one proper left back.

Guessing it's James on Saturday then, assuming Valencia isn't fit to allow Young to play on the left.

458~~~
Good job we've brought in cover then...

Smalling or jones next?

459~~~
Just like usual.. Chance for young to impress now i guess.

Its Hamez time i guess.

463~~~
Someone quickly photoshop Van Gaal's face on a dinosaur.

464~~~
Shame for the lad but hopefully that will force us to do something in the transfer market. It was always clear that we weren't going to last a whole season with Shaw as our only LB. It's only a matter of time before Evans/Jones/Rafael get injured, we should get Rojo signed up as soon as possible as he can fill in at LWB whilst also adding depth at CB. 

Blackett can also do the same and we have James who looks eager to impress. I wouldn't fancy Young defending on his weaker foot. If we are going to play him at WB, it should be on the right side.

465~~~
Hardly a surprise sadly.

466~~~
This must be a cruel joke. How unfortunate can we be at the back?

467~~~
Is it something with the training ground?

468~~~
There must be some sort of curse with us and defenders. For the last 7 or 8 years we've constantly suffered from an injury crisis in defence at some point during the season. Only Evra seemed immune to the voodoo.

As if buying some more defenders wasn't urgent enough as it is. If we don't buy anyone we're going to need an incredibly lucky season with injuries to finish in the top 4 and as this shows we're never lucky in that regard anymore.

469~~~
What's his injury?

470~~~
When was the last time a team has 3 fullbacks/wingbacks out injured at the same time?

471~~~
It's been honestly years since we haven't had defensive injury problems. At least 3 if I remember correctly.

472~~~
Over Training anyone ?

Hamstring Injury as well.

473~~~
He hasn't played since the Liverpool game, has he? I remember Van Gaal saying he didn't want to play him in that game because he'd done so much fitness work earlier in the day but his hand was forced by James (I think?) getting a niggle in the warm-up. Bet he's seriously regretting that decision today.

474~~~
Not sure, pre season training is always tough. I know he did a 'special program' but he should be up to it.

475~~~
Isn't it good we brought in defensive cover so early in the window instead of leaving it until the last few weeks.

476~~~
So much for that.

Bloody Moyes and his training.

477~~~
Very rarely injured at Southampton, comes to United and is already out for a month. We're cursed when it comes to injuries.

Oh well, I suppose this will give James a chance to stake his claim. Either that, or if Valencia is back, I take it Young will be used on the left.

478~~~
Wasn't that the Inter game? Anyways, the liverpool game he came on since Valenca got subbed off injured early on, don't think Van Gaal said anything about not planning on using him. Think this is just unfortunate rather then anything.

479~~~
Damn it.

480~~~
Any idea how long he's out for?

481~~~
A month apparently.

482~~~
This is Van Gaal's fault for working him too hard in training. #VanGaalOut <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

483~~~
Reece James in at the deep end then 

Could be the making of him

484~~~
Can we take Evra back on loan for 1 month? <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

485~~~
Either that, or if Valencia's back, Young will probably play left wing back.

486~~~
Our squad is made of glass. Season hasn't started and we already have five players injured.

Our only players capable of staying fit are De Gea, Mata, Fletcher (illness excluded) and Herrera who suffered only two short term injuries at Bilbao.

Gutted for Shaw though, so it looks like James will be thrown in the deep end or Young plays there.

487~~~
Is it a requirement nowadays for a Manchester United defender to be injured?

488~~~
So an already weak defense is now even weaker.. we should have brought earlier regardless LVG wanting to see what he already had.

489~~~
fecking unbelievable. I swear we get more injuries than every other team year after year. It's absolutely infuriating.

490~~~
Bit like Young and Fellaini when we signed them then <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

491~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> I think we should wrap him up in cotton wool to be safe.

492~~~
I thought he was pretty poor against Valencia truth be told.

493~~~
Fe.king hell! 
And no Moyes and his rigid training methods to blame for this injury.

So either James or Young with Cuardado on the right. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

494~~~
We've got no one else to play there. Young will be on the right because Rafa and Valencia are both injured. 

Unless we sign Rojo immediately but even then he might no be eligible to play yet.

495~~~
So did Rooney.

496~~~
Unbelievable, our worst fears about our strength realised in depth before a ball is even kicked.

Valencia made a point of hitting our left side and so will Swansea.

497~~~
No proper fullbacks. Ridiculous situation to be in.

Is Valencia back in time so Young can play there?

498~~~
Good job we held on to Buttner then

499~~~
And what does that fact has with Shaw's injury exactly? 


What's up with Varela these days?

500~~~
Still there.Trained with the first team couple of times.

501~~~
I wonder if he'll get a chance this year. Since he wasnt on preseason tour very much doubt it. He could  come handy in this kind of situations.

502~~~
Irrelevant. Young has been doing a great job at the LWB spot and if need be James can be put there for the very short time-being.

503~~~
Eventually he will I think.As much as I want Lingard to get games he's not a RWB and should only play there against bottom table oppositions.

504~~~
FFS!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.hibeesbounce.com/forum/images/smilies/wallbash.gif" src="http://www.hibeesbounce.com/forum/images/smilies/wallbash.gif"/>

Three of our first choice defenders already settled into the sick room before a ball has been kicked in anger!! I have never known a United squad with so many fragile players.

505~~~
Last season was stop/start with all the International breaks, so if this season is the same then his absence for a month shouldn't be missed too much.

But that is what you get for being a fat bastard! the first time he does a bit of running his hamstring buckles under the weight! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

506~~~
Already the idea with no european Football we will have less injurys is already looking like a pile of crap

507~~~
James is not premier league ready. Ashley young to fill in.

508~~~
we now have less than 3 recognized defenders, its august 13th and still no signing's made

509~~~
Last season Arsenal lost more than twice as many 'player days' to injury than any other PL team. United, City, Liverpool and Chelsea were all very similar.

510~~~
United signed a £34m full back this window.

511~~~
Rubbish for him and us. He looked good in pre-season. Thin at the back as it is and injuries mounting up, bad news especially with a new system to settle into.

512~~~
If we can get Rojo before friday noon we can play him there maybe. Though he would be thrown in the deep end as much as James if he was to start.

Blackett can play LB, but I am not sure if he is as suited to LWB. And again, he would be thrown in the deep end. It looks like it is either take a risk on a younger player or put Young on the left and rush back somebody on the right.

513~~~
27 million

514~~~
Barley missed a minute for Saints.

Comes to United and gets injured before the season starts.

Standard.

515~~~
Yeah, it probably seems like more for United cause it's always in the same area - defence. We're low in numbers there anyway, so it'd help if they weren't all crippled.

516~~~
Either our medical staff is fecking atrocious or we just have bad luck, I can say with confidence no other team gets as many injury problems as we do..

517~~~
Missed just three league games for Southampton last year and is set to miss 4 games for us already at the start, this club is just ridiculous in terms of injuries. People can moan about transfers, our style of play, or anything they want, 
but our biggest problem in every season are fecking injuries, and I am quite sure it will repeat this season too. I would take injury free season for our team ahead of signing Ronaldo and Messi on free.

I know every club get their fair share of injuries, but I am quite sure no top club is even close to us in that department, because it happens to us in<span style="text-decoration: underline"> every single</span> season unlike other top teams.

518~~~
Scousers<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

519~~~
Over trained trying to get extra fitness or is it unrelated?

Gutted he looks the business and I would like to get him settled in quickly.

520~~~
Arsenal definitely do.

521~~~
Prefect time to give a little experience to James and Blackett. With the teams we will face in the first month, they will either sink or swim.

522~~~
Took a look at his transfermarkt injury list and it seems that there's been just 1 match he's missed due to confirmed injury ( missed like another 5-6 but it hasn't been specified that it's due to injury, so could be just anything else ) over two seasons. He comes here, season doesn't even start and he's out for a month. This is seriously looking fecking stupid, what the hell are they doing on the training ground, ramming into each other ?

523~~~
I'd like to see this "special" training program we put him on, prob ran him into the ground. He's still a teenager ffs, what happened to easing them into the team and managing them to prevent burn out?

524~~~
It does make you wonder to what extent this is related to Shaw's attempts to get up to LVG's levels of expected fitness. I wonder if we're going to see a lot of this with the wing backs during the season, due to the amount of distance they're expected to cover in that role.

525~~~
I'd definitely give James the run out. He's looked more than good enough to play against Swansea at home, and you never really know how these youngsters will do until you throw them in. Young will be playing on the right I imagine. Shaw should be back before we have any properly tough games, it's just a shame that it disrupts his preparation and settling in period.

526~~~
There's always something to throw our plans into disarray. It's good for Reece James. He's got a real chance to make an early impact and if he performs he'll stay in contention. For us it's hard enough trying to form a backline of regulars that will emulate Evra, Vidic and Rio when none of them can stay fit. 

We better work hard to close that Rojo deal now. We surely need extra cover.

527~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

528~~~
Over training

529~~~
Always said this was the problem spending so much on an 18 year old. Undeveloped body, difficult to predict injuries. Feared another Rafael. Already injured. Hope this isn't the first of many.

530~~~
FFS! Ok, back to the General to keep the spirits up.

531~~~
There are other ways to injure yourself apart from over training you know guys. I am hoping he gets it out of the way now and we have a smoother middle and end of season. Good thing LVG has already tried the likes of young etc on the positions isnt it?

532~~~
:3

533~~~
I heard The Little Witch Juan Veron put a voodoo curse on our training ground that won't be lifted till we buy a world class midfielder again.

534~~~
Considering the entire defence was sink or swim this season before these injuries, it's not an ideal situation to be giving their even more inexperienced back ups the same treatment...

Dear lord we need defenders.

535~~~
Everyone is doomed.

536~~~
Evra never got injured... get your finger out Shaw dammit!

537~~~
And this is the point! Evra was rarely injured, nor Irwin before him. 

Extend that comparison to our centre backs. Jones/Smalling/Evans are never more than a heartbeat away from a "knock", "strain" of "pull" - all of which are on the face of it innocuous but that sideline them for weeks. The likes of Stam, Pallister, Bruce, Rio (until he was in his thirties) and Vidic until his serious knee injury were available for selection week in, week out. 

Look further. Anderson is never fit. Nani rarely so. Young, who was barely ever crook at Villa. Rafael, seemingly made of glass.

It's feckin ridiculous! Yes, injuries are part of the game but not the number of seemingly minor ailments that sideline too many of our squad for weeks at a time.

It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, either our medical/training staff are not properly managing these players physical condition. Or far to many of them are insufficiently robust for the rigours of an EPL season and need moving on. This needs to be seriously researched by van Gaal because the question of the quality of some of this squad is secondary to their appalling injury records.

538~~~
I know, 2 signings still not going to cut it

539~~~
If he wasn't injured I'd be surprised, it's how used we've become to these injuries.

540~~~
They've <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsenal-transfer-news-arsenal-make-first-signing-of-the-summer-9532100.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">taken steps to address this</a>. 

We should probably do the same.

541~~~
Ha! Right on cue. The irritating prick. 

No, not me (although some might say...). This arsehole. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/499487/Luke-Shaw-s-injury-is-YOUR-fault-Louis-Van-Gaal-under-fire-ahead-of-new-season" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/foot...Louis-Van-Gaal-under-fire-ahead-of-new-season</a>

542~~~
LVG will take him to the cleaners, he will lay into him one way or the other. This is not Moyes who was too nice to do anything about it and who didn't have the medals to back up his methods.

543~~~
Not a great situation to have this guy injured before the season started. He is basically our only LB, before we get into the kids who while looked decent on tour are unproven. We really need to bring in some extra bodies for the defence quickly, or we are going to struggle managing injuries at the back this year.

544~~~
And where did they finish Ray? Did they lose a game?

No? Oh ok, then feck off.

545~~~
I was really looking forward to seeing him play. I think he'll add a lot to our play when he comes back.

546~~~
Look at his arse when he's running with the ball....

It's like two pigs fighting under a blanket

547~~~
Hehe. Kudos.

548~~~
No he'll just ignore him like he did during the WC. No point giving this joker any attention.

549~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

550~~~
He should probably focus on getting himself fit and proving his worth instead of getting involved with shit on twitter. That's not the first time now. Fat wee shite.

551~~~
To be fair he's got a point. He's supposed to stay at home crying or something then?

552~~~
It would only take 2 seconds to write it but yeah I see your point. He's done this a few times before, it's best if he would just ignored it.

553~~~
Im sure he will in time as he's just a youngster. But he shouldn't be get in involved. That wouldn't have happened under SAF.

554~~~
How exactly does tweeting stop him from focusing on getting better?

555~~~
The first time was quite funny. Should just ignore it now or else he might come across a bit oversensitive.

556~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

557~~~
Nobody of even the slightest intelligence takes the taboids seriously so Shaw shouldn't bother responding as they are only going to write more drivel.

558~~~
I wish more players would quickly address these stupid "news" to lessen their effect on fans. Good on him I say.

559~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

560~~~
Good from Shaw.

561~~~
For some reason all I can take out of that article is how shit men's fashion is. Skinny jeans and those ridiculous shoes <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

562~~~
Men's fashion is fine, it's just Shaw clearly has a bad fashion sense.

563~~~
So he can't go out for dinner or post tweets?

He is clearly taking the piss out of nonsense shite which is somehow news.

564~~~
Did you see what Liam Gallagher then replied to this tweet. 

''When you've been humiliated in public by your manager for being clinically obese, the answer is NO, u fat shite #saladdodger''

All he needs is his teddy bear and a parent holding his hand and he could be someones toddler daughter being brought to school.

570~~~
What's so funny? I wear similar jeans.

571~~~
I like his jeans, but feck they are pretty damn snug.

572~~~
Kille'em all pants <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

573~~~
these jeans look absolutely hilarious.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I never understand guys wearing tight pants, i know everybody has his style but it feels and looks ridiculous on males.

574~~~
Any bloke with a big ol' booty like that should be buying a different cut of jeans.

/GokWan

575~~~
hehe poor shaw! but that is hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

576~~~
Shawls legs are massive!

When's he back .

577~~~
His arse looks bigger than Ivanovic's

578~~~
You should see what NBA players are wearing these days.

579~~~
He needs a stylist. Quick

Those tight ass jeans are not a good look

580~~~
Good Lord, pulling on them jeans can't be good for his hammy. Or self-respect.

581~~~
I love them jeans, so much hate. They're very comfortable, you just have to try them on and it feels like you're visiting a whole new world. You really start to see the world from a different perspective when you start wearing skinny jeans.

582~~~
Skinny jeans are atrocious. Women wear skinny jeans to show their body/figure. Why do men do this? 

What's wrong with slim fit jeans?

...when is fatty back anyway?

583~~~
The scandal at those jeans, do you all not leave your houses anymore or something? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> They're quite common now and have been for like 2 years.

584~~~
Or at least a whole new bar. Full of other blokes in skinny jeans.

585~~~
Tbf his shirt is more hideous than his skinny pants which are rather just unsuited to his body type. It looks alright on guys with a slimmer build.

586~~~
I can't decide what's worse. The jeans, the shirt or the backpack.

587~~~
To be fair, with leg's and an ass like that it's probably hard to find a decent pair of jeans that fit anyway! No wonder the fecker is so quick <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

588~~~
He looks like a toddler in that getup.. Bizaare really.

589~~~
Or the shoes ! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

590~~~
How old is he though? He's basically a schoolboy still.

Bit weird seeing (presumably) adults mocking a kid who's still in school over the clothes he wears.

(yes, I know, I did it too. <i>mea culpa</i>)

591~~~
He can wear a pink onesie in is spare time for all I care.

Can't wait to get him back on the pitch and some much needed balance on the left hand side.

592~~~
My daughter wears worse. But you are right - still shocking getup that old men like me don't understand.

593~~~
yeah thats what you get from Luke Shaw 14/15 performances thread

594~~~
To be fair with that arse he'll make an amazing tranny.

595~~~
He does dress like a muppet. When is he back?

596~~~
I don't think van Gaal will risk rushing players back from injury, like he said most players will be back after the international break. It's better to play it safe rather than bring him back not 100% ready and risk getting him injured again.

597~~~
He dresses like any other Teenager does.

598~~~
There are so many questions I don't want to know the answer to surrounding this comment.

599~~~
If he was your average skinny 18yo he could probably get away with it. He's well built and looks like he's in his thirties the style doesn't suit him at all.

600~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

601~~~
Yeh he should be wearing regular cut wranglers and a shirt jumper combo.

602~~~
He can dress in a teletubby outfit for all I care. My main reason for posting in the thread was to ask when he's back not to discuss his poor choice of attire.

603~~~
I don't even care whether he plays exceptionally well or exceptionally shite when he returns. I just want him to stand out so we can put an end to the embarrassing fecking discussions going on in this thread.

604~~~
I don't beleive that.

605~~~
What?

606~~~
Isn't he dressed that way in those pictures?..

607~~~
Girl got booty.

608~~~
True.

612~~~
I'm no expert or doctor but i think that's one of the reasons why we have so many injured players in the last 5 years.....most are coming back too early (Ferguson has said that he has made this with a few players in his career) or are playing with injections like Carrick against Arsenal last season (He was then out for 2 months)

613~~~
When is he actually due back? If is isn't 100% still I wouldn't bother bringing him back for our next match, give him the break as well to recover. Plus that way England are not likely to call him up either.

614~~~
He is a young player, I really believe that if he listens to Van Gaal and knuckles down, LvG could transform him into a beast of a left wing back.

615~~~
He looks like Kim Kardashian, it is just plain wrong. He needs to fix up in terms of dress sense the fat slag.

616~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

617~~~
That's a pretty shitty t-shirt, but he's 19, you can wear pretty shitty clothes when you're 19.
Good to see this guy was back in training this week, still excited to see more of him.  Still think under the guidance of LvG at such a young age he should fulfill his potential, which is going to be nice to see.

618~~~
When is the last time we bought a player from weaker team/foreign league that didn't have fitness issues? De Gea was nowhere near ready for PL, Kagawa was nowhere near ready at the beggining even though his stamina was extraordinary(according to some sources) and even though many here thought Dortmund was so far ahead of us fitness wise, Fellaini had some issues immidiately IIRC, Robin wasn't fit but tbf he wasn't even properly training with Arsenal Herrera is one of the rare ones who was ready when the rest of the team too, but he end up injured once the season started too. Mata? I don't think he was on requiered level at the start of his United career either.

619~~~
Was due to be back early September anyway. He's back in training now but definitely won't be risked until after the international break. Anyway, England have already announced the squad so no worries in that regard.

620~~~
Van Gaal sees Shaw as an example for other players in our team. Good to hear after all those questions about his fitness when he first joined.

621~~~
Lets hope he isn't setting an example with his dress sense.

622~~~

623~~~
Well, he was 7 when Adams retired and Shaw said his earliest World Cup memory was from 2010 (seriously), so not that surprising.

Bit amazing that he's never seen Adams on TV though. He's been on plenty of things since retiring.

624~~~
People should be grateful, if he really is the reason why Lampard retired from the selection.

626~~~
It just makes me think of Ander Herrera who was more than certain knowing of players like Sir Bobby and Eric Cantona. Guess some players have a bigger love for the game than others.

627~~~
I'm starting to think he was one of the lads who played football but had no real interest of watching it from a young age. I'm only one year older than him, I never watched him play but I know about Adams. I can even remember the 2002 World Cup yet he claims the first one he remembers is 2010.

628~~~
Surely he remembers a World Cup before 2010? That quote must have been taken out of context or something. He was 11 when the 2006 World Cup was on so he should at least remember that. I can remember some games from the 1998 World Cup and I was only 7 at the time.

629~~~
There's something lovable about Shaw.

630~~~
"Frank Lampard took that shot and it went over the line and it didn't count," he recalls. "That was the only one I can remember."

His quotes from the BBC about England WC memories. I found it hard to believe when I first heard it and still do.

631~~~
I hardly remember 2010 and it was just 4 years ago. I know I've watched every game in 2010 but if you ask me something about any of those games(except the finals) I would struggle to remember anything without rewatching highlights/fixtures. Some people just have shit memory about certain things; even though I like football, I forget football games quite quickly even though I am excellent at memorizing some other things someone else would never remember.

Of course not knowing Adams is weird considering he is quite often on TV.

632~~~
To be honest it could have something to do with his memory. I watched most of the matches from this summer's world cup and I can barely recall 5 moments. It doesn't mean that he had no interest in it, he could have just forgotten.

633~~~
Ya surely he can remember more than that. Not necessarily in great detail but he must be able remember watching it and what happened. 

I can remember Brazil beating Holland in a penalty shout out in 98 as well as the 3 French goals in the final. I can't remember them in great detail but I can remember them none the less.

634~~~
To be fair I can barely remember anything about the most recent world cup apart from Suarez round 3.

635~~~
Maybe it's just me then. I don't remember in too much detail what happened in each WC but I can remember quite clearly who or how we went out of each WC since 2002.

I remeber that Ronaldinho free kick (he didn't mean it) and his red card in 02 then losing on penalties to Portugal in 06. Don't think I'll ever forget thay Germany game in '10

636~~~
Chelsea fan isn't he? What would he know about football pre-2004?

637~~~
How can his first World Cup memory be 2010 if he was born in 95? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

638~~~
Seriously, his first World Cup memory is Lampard's non goal against Germany! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

639~~~
Who is Tony Adams??

Shaw is too young to know him

Shaw could be my son

640~~~
The lad is quite clearly an eedjut.

641~~~
Each time I visit this thread my hope is that there will be a discussion of his footballing exploits or news about him recovering from injury, but it's always about his booty, bad choice of pants and his lack of knowledge about players who played before he was born. I don't remember any players from the 80s, so why should Shaw remember any from the 90s? (born early 80s)

642~~~
Tbf I don't remember anything from WC '94 & '98 and I'm 22. I probably wouldn't remember anything from WC 2006 if I was put on the spot like that in an interview.

643~~~
24 and remember perfectly well who Tony Adams was.

I suppose we live in an idealistic world where we think footballers actually give a shit about football.

644~~~
I'm a year older than Luke Shaw and I know feck all about Tony Adams either. I only know who he is since he retired from football forums really. The only players I really know from the 90s are United and Irish players and some top strikers like Owen and Shearer. Even the 2002 World Cup I can't say I particularly remember watching any of it. I can tell you Brazil won and Ireland were knocked out in the round of 16 to Spain in penalties but I don't remember actually watching those. The only thing I can actually remember from the 2002 WC is Keano getting in a row with Mick McCarthy and him not playing. So if Luke is only a casual football fan then you can't really expect him to know players who retired when he was 7 and played for a team he didn't support.

645~~~
He does seems a bit thick tbh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Makes Rooney seem like the brain of Britain at times.

646~~~
Not a surprise, many footballers are thick as pigshit and the english footballers on average tend to have less footballing knowledge on average than their european counterparts. Loving the history of the game doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be a better footballer.. makes you a more likeable footballer though. Herrera for example.. the passion for the game is there in his interviews, he's like a fan living the dream... not all players are like that.

647~~~
Nothing to do with the nationality of players. A lot of footballers barely watch any football. I've seen pundits first hand who haven't got a clue what's being talked about. That's coming both from the ex-professionals and the current ones. People were laughing a lot about it a few years ago when Balotelli didn't have a clue who Wilshere was. That's how it is like for most players. A lot of them just focus on themselves and/or on their team. When you live it day to day it's understandable that you're not really into watching football much or following what's happening in other leagues.

648~~~
Assou-Ekotto is a prime example of footballers who don't watch or like football. He's been pretty vocal about how he views football as just a job where he earns money to support his family.

It's not out of the realms of possibility that Shaw (making a huge assumption here) doesn't watch that much football when he's not training/playing himself.

649~~~
You are 5 years older than him, how are you relating?

Adams retired 12 years ago, Shaw would have been 7 at the time. No shame in not knowing who he is. I was six at the time of world cup 1994, I couldn't tell you who was in the England team back then.

650~~~
Sometimes i find the Benoit assou ekotto mindset quite refreshing, hates football, sees it as purely a job, and turns up for Post match interviews baked off his mind.

651~~~
I'm sorry but what is this based on?

Shaw doesn't know Tony Adams and Fabio Cannavaro wasn't sure Martin O'Neill had ever even played. There are players of all nationalities who aren't football gurus. Cannavaro could hardly even name a current English player other than Rooney.

652~~~
Don't blame Cannavaro to be fair, you'd be hard pressed to consider anyone in the England team a footballer.

653~~~
Life experiences, people I've worked alongside/met - so it comes from a skewed perspective admittedly. Nor did I say every European has great football knowledge.. I said on average in my experience, it is greater (only in footballer circle's mind you), football fans is a different kettle of fish.

Ask Cannavaro about Italian greats, if he still doesn't know - lord knows how he got that world cup gig.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tDTEGqnMLfc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Imagine him linking up with Di Maria/Januzaj on the left..

656~~~
May make his debut vs Qpr.

657~~~
Looking forward to seeing him again. After a shaky start, I really liked what we saw in pre-season.

658~~~
Would be great if he starts. He's going to be a fine player for us.

659~~~
Is he fit? I've been hearing mixed messages.

660~~~
He's thick for not knowing who Adams is, who played when he was like 4 or 5?

661~~~
It's just a bit surprising for an professional English footballer not to know who Tony Adams is. I'd expect that the vast majority of teenagers who have an interest in football would know who Adams is. Wasn't it only 5 year ago he was managing Portsmouth in the Premier League.

662~~~
I don't even remember him managing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> just knew he was an arsenal legend.

663~~~
The real weird thing is that Lampard didn't mentionned Keown, Parlour or Seaman.

664~~~
I'm a year younger than you, and not English, but off the top of my head I could guess:

Seaman, Ince, Gascoigne, Sheringham, Beardsley <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>, Campbell, Shearer, Le Tissier probably, and Ian Wright too

665~~~
I don't know who Tony Adams is. Neither should he. Lampard has nearly double of Shaw's age.

666~~~
Thick as pigshit obviously but luckily we don't pay him to be clever. How the feck he cannot know who Tony Adams is is beyond me. Mind you Shaw is from the Twitter & FIFA generation though isn't he.

667~~~
He probably knows who he is, just I'm guessing lampard meant something like he never saw him play. I'm a bosnian who lives in canada and only a year or 2 older then Shaw and I know who he is ffs.

668~~~
Doubt that even Tony Adams knew who he was most of the time when he was younger.  He lost a few weekends for sure.

669~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

670~~~
I could guess but apart from Shearer and Seaman I couldnt tell you for sure.

671~~~
I'm a few years older than Shaw and Australian and I know who Adams is. Although that would largely be from manager games and just study of the game. It's a little surprising he's never heard of him at all but it doesn't really matter. 

Anyway, hope he makes his debut against QPR. Even if he struggles a little bit. As long as he shows <i>something. </i>I am tired of Valencia and Young not giving us any penetration.

672~~~
I hoped Tony Adams talk would die till now but I was wrong. 

So he doesnt know who Adams is, who the f. cares? 
Maybe he was just trolling Lampard anyway.

673~~~
All he needs to know is who his next opponent is and what their strengths and weaknesses are. Knowing who Adams is won't help him in the next 90 minutes.

674~~~
Maybe I misunderstood but wasn't he meant to play today or did LvG just say he <i>could</i> play today?

675~~~
He was fit to play 'some minutes' but not a full match is what LVG said, our defence was playing too good to take anyone off.

676~~~
Pundits, journalists and commentators keep talking about our defense but when Shaw comes into the mix, we've got him at LB, Rojo and Evans at CB and Rafael at right back which will be a massive improvement on what we've seen during these opening games. We've seen what we lacked on that right side and this game was an example of that when Rafael was taken off for Valencia, that right side became unproductive. Rojo is very good defensively on that left side but Shaw is a much better attacking player and in turn Rojo is a much better CB. The thing that really excites me is the pace, out of our back 4 we've got 3 extremely fast players in Shaw, Rafael and Rojo.

677~~~
Put Jones in next to Rojo instead of Evans and you have another strong and fast player. Evans doesn't fill me with confidence and makes mistakes pretty much every game, Jones though has started the season really well and I think he can really form a good partnership with Rojo.

678~~~
I'd even rather Blackett than Evans! He's been piss poor.

679~~~
Shaw will be in the team as soon as he is fit, absolutely no doubt in my mind.

680~~~
Wouldn't be surprised to see him start next week as well. I think he went to warm up after Falcao and probably would've been introduced but then Di maria went down with cramp. He'll have another full week to recover and hopefully get a start. Will bring loads of pace and power, and more running on the ball to the left side. Him and Di Maria/Januzaj will be a devastating partnership on the left these next few years I think.

681~~~
Starting for the U21's tonight along with Anderson and Adnan.

682~~~
Any report on how he went? Get through?

683~~~
Departed at half-time, replaced by Ben Pearson.

684~~~
Got an assist for pereira, played well, clearly a level above especially physically. Came off at half time, hopefully means he'll play next weekend.

685~~~
Is he still unfit for EPL? Anyway LvG might want to use Rojo as LB now because of his chemistry with Di Maria. 
Shaw has tough competition ahead.

686~~~
I can't see Shaw starting against Leicester if he can only manage 45 mins for the U21 side. LVG had mentioned during his pre-match press conference that Shaw couldn't play 90 mins against QPR.

687~~~
Good for him to get 45 minutes under his belt, interesting that Januzaj played as well. How can Anderson play in an U21's game?

688~~~
Rules allow for 3 over-age players + an over-age keeper (not 100% sure on the number). Vermijl is 22. Amos is 24. Last season Fletcher played several matches for the U21s.

689~~~
Thanks for the info, I'd forgotten about Fletch playing games in the U21's to get his fitness levels up.

690~~~
He could've easily completed 90, I think he was subbed to prevent any chance of injury, got some minutes and impressed, wouldn't be surprised to see him start this weekend.

691~~~

3 over 21 allowed in the squad.he was shit even at this level

693~~~
Lots of praise for pace/urgency/tempo di Maria has brought to the team. This boy will do the same.

<b> Shaw will be world's best left-back, says Evans </b>

If Di Maria and him can striker a understanding with Rooney drifting into that channel too that whole left side has potential to be lethal.

695~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

696~~~
Is that Pereira at 2:58? Lovely stuff.

697~~~
yes, guy is phenomenal.

698~~~
No pressure!

699~~~
Looking at his fashion sense you'd think he wasn't into football if you met him down the street. He looks like he'd be part of an indie band or something.

700~~~
I'm sure Shaw will be very good, but that's a ridiculously bold claim from Evans.

701~~~
I do have doubts over Shaw tbh but he's at the best club to fulfill his potential.

702~~~

703~~~
Still looks a little overweight, doesn't he?

704~~~
Except he isn't overweight? He's built like an ox, he's a tank.

705~~~
Yeah, a bit like Rooney I say. I can't believe he is a teenager!

706~~~
He's not fat, he's big boned.

707~~~
Would love to see a back four of Rafael - Evans - Rojo - Shaw tomorrow. I think if everyone is fit, that's our strongest back four. I know Evans has had a few shaky moments this year, but he is our best centre half.

708~~~
He just isnt. Smalling is far better than Evans (defensively)

709~~~
I hope Shaw starts on Sunday. I believe there will be a lot of media crap if he does not start. Plus I want to watch him start at LB and Rojo at CB.

710~~~
I disagree.

711~~~
He isn't overweight but he just has a bigger build than average. As such he has to look after his body and diet more carefully than the skinnier types like Di Maria and Herrera. Rooney and the Brazilian Ronaldo spring to mind. At their best physically they were brilliant but they could get out of shape easier than most players.

712~~~
Yep I don't see how people cannot understand it. Shaw has a big ass and leg's naturally he is a big set guy. He will never be stick thin like Di Maria. He is powerfully set which is why he is fast and strong, but looks stupid in skinny jeans.

713~~~
You cant. Evans is the huge weak link with his numerous brainfarts. 1 clearance for de Gea doesnt change that. Smalling is much better 1 vs 1, better in the air, has better sliding/tackle and reads the game better. Lets stop this discussion btw, should be in the other thread.

714~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

715~~~
Smalling and Jones are better.

716~~~
Thanks Amolbhatia. Apparently I can't have an opinion now. 

If everyone is fit I want Evans in the team as I think he is our best centre half. You disagree. fine. However if anyone is wrong in any of this it's you claiming Evans is the huge weak link. You don't play the guts of 200 senior games for Manchester United if you're a huge weak link. Not when he's been in a team with Vidic, Ferdinand, Smalling and Jones. I know we've had our injury problems over the years but sorry, if he was a huge weak link he would have been shipped out. And I'm not basing anything on one incident with De gea. I'm basing it on having watched him play most of his 180 odd games for United.

717~~~
You can't.

718~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

719~~~
This weight thing has to stop. It's stupid.

720~~~
I really don't understand how people can think Evans is our best CB. Jones is far better already and a few years younger. Only logical explanation for all the praise Evans gets on here is that he has multiple accounts on here.

721~~~
Agreed.

722~~~
Just like Antonio isnt shipped out, or Young, or Clevz.. It is much easier to play well with someone like Vidic, Ferdinand in their prime covering for your stupidities, now he is on his own, we all see how poor he is. It's just the overrating of an academy player all over again.

723~~~
Yeah it's wearing thin.

724~~~
That's just lazy posting to say Rio and Vida covered his errors. When we went on that 4 month clean sheet run in the team in 2009, I believe he made the most appearances of all our defenders in that period.

725~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

726~~~
IMO, Jones > Evans > Smalling

727~~~
I think that it would be more fair to judge him in a month or so once he's fully back to form. Rio's been a much bigger liability in defence over the last couple of seasons than Evans who's had one of the best periods of his career in the 12/13 season where he was brilliant. Any CB is reliant on their partner and he and Vidic complemented eachother very well just like Rio and Vidic did in their prime. While he's started this campaign very poorly, he also saved us from conceding against QPR and he looked as if he was gaining confidence as the game wore on, hopefully a sign that he's regaining some form. I have alot of faith in him but it all comes down to if he can stay fit.

728~~~
OK

Cleverley was shipped out and I would bet that if clubs showed any interest so would Valencia and Young have been. Evans played next to both Rio and Vidic over the last year or two where neither were at their prime and looked solid. To say that Rio was covering is errors makes it clear that you have an agenda against Evans when Rio was our most error prone defender over the last two seasons. 

Again, I can see the arguments in favour of Jones and Smalling. Both have huge potential and if they fulfill that there is no reason why they couldn't force their way past Evans. Obviously, for some of you, they already have. But for me, if we had a game against a top four team at the moment I'd want Evans as one of our centre halves.  Evans is far from perfect and there is no doubt he'll make the odd mistake. But so will every centre half.

Also, it's not over rating an academy player in the slightest. It's judging a player on his performances for the first team over 3/4 seasons. He has proven himself to be a top centre half and that's why he continues to start matches for us. Until he doesn't, then while you may say I'm wrong or my opinion doesn't count, it seems to be the same opinon that Fergie and Moyes had and now van Gaal has. That Evans is a top class centre half.

729~~~
Surprised he's not started again.

730~~~
Yeah, from the looks of things he is clearly not seen as a 30 million pound player by LVG.

Hopefully he gets some minutes today.

731~~~
Will he ever play? He's a left back who knows how to defend.

732~~~
Should have been on at half time, surely must start next week.

733~~~
Poor kid.  He was so good last season and now can't even get game time with the rest of our defense looking absentee.  Surely he plays next week?

734~~~
Why isn't he playing? He's the best left back we have by far. I don't know what he's doing at the training ground but I really doubt he's regressed that much after two stellar seasons in the PL. He's fit too, played in the reserves last week. The feck is LvG playing at?

735~~~
Better be in the side next week.

736~~~
He must play next week with the injuries and Blacketts suspension.

737~~~
We need him ASAP.

738~~~
Van Gaal probably wanted to keep Blackett in the team because of his good form early in the season. And since Rojo was available to play first he got the nod a t LB over Shaw. He will probably definitely start next week.

739~~~
Why isn't he starting, strange from LVG.

740~~~
I expect him to play next week.

741~~~
Why the hell isn't he playing it's incredibly frustrating considering our defensive frailties.

742~~~
LVG has said it's fitness related hasn't he? Or was that a while back now?

I think he would have been brought on if the game hadn't taken the disastrous turn for the worse that it did.

743~~~
Yeah. Didn't have a reason to drop any of them and would have probably been harsh on blackett and not send a good message to drop him. Not anymore of course. Awful game from all our defenders but once Shaw comes in, Rojo moves to the middle I think they'll all be better.

744~~~
He really really needs to be playing. Have I missed some sort of reason for him not?

745~~~
It's simply time. Our defence is the worst part of our team at the moment. We've given chances to all of them but we need to assemble our first team together from the back now. Shaw has proven himself as a top class LB in this league and he does know how to defend against these types of attackers. Must be a starter while we work on strengthening the middle.

746~~~
He should have played today. He's a very good defender and the improvement he'll make should be a noticeable one.

747~~~
That answers that then. He didn't start because of fitness and presumably didn't come on because of the way the game unfolded.

748~~~
Ha has to start at LB in the next game with Rojo probably as a CB. I see LVG has already said that, that's good.

749~~~
I think he'll come in, and as long as he stays fit, he'll play every remaining game in the league. As we're playing musical chairs with CBs, we could do with having consistency at fullback at least.

750~~~
Smalling, Jones and Rojo should be playing for the 2 centre back positions from now. We need to start playing Shaw and see what he's made of.

751~~~
I'm sorry, but that doesn't cut it for me. Right now, we only have the League to focus on, so he better starts throwing the kitchen sink in every time. That strongly implies that our best players must stay on the pitch at all times and play the fecking game so we can get results.

752~~~
He needs to start playing Rojo in the middle with Shaw on the left. Not that we have much choice mind you.

753~~~
I'm not sure what you mean. I'm sure LVG would love to keep our best players on the pitch at all times, but if their fitness isn't up to it then he's not exactly going to push them too hard is he?

754~~~
I'm referring to the fact that some of our best elements are benched while others who should be there still keep playing. For the record, I would have thrown Shaw into the action at some point today because it was obvious that we sucked at the back.

For the record, we are not the only team that needs its best players to be on the pitch in order to stand a chance of winning and meeting our objectives.

755~~~
It wasn't possible to bring Shaw on though because of our injury/fitness issues. Evans, di Maria and Falcao all came off because of fitness reasons. The only way Shaw could have been worked into that was if he came on for Evans and Rojo moved inside. Perhaps he wasn't ready to play an hour or more likely LVG didn't want a left footed partnership of Rojo and Blackett. 

LVG's hand was forced with the subs today and I think Shaw will start next week.

756~~~
''I think Shaw shall be fit enough to play (against West Ham) and Rojo and Smalling can play. We can manage."

- Van Gaal.

757~~~
Now we will see if we have bought a good LB. Will be great to see him play.

758~~~
Hoping he gets a good run of games before he's judged, he hasn't played much football so I am not expecting much from him if he starts against West Ham.

759~~~
If he plays well, that will be him set for the season, if LvG has any sense. Luke knows how to defend and actually his size is one of his greatest assests, he won't be easy to bully.

760~~~
We have been shite at the back so I don't why he hasn't featured yet, If Blackett wasn't suspended for the West Ham game I think he might have stayed on the bench.

761~~~
Might be a blessing in disguise.

762~~~
Shaw must be utterly garbage in training if he can't get a game ahead of Rojo.

763~~~
feck me relax lads, he has just came back from an injury and Rojo had a good enough game last week there was no reason for van Gaal to push him in when after we looked so good last week. It doesn't mean Luke is stinking up Carrington with his shite play and fat belly.

764~~~
Twas a joke.

765~~~
How dare you get in the way of the cafes over exaggerations and wild assumptions with your silly logic!

766~~~
Maybe yours was a joke but there are enough people saying such things that they aren't all joking.

767~~~
Based on his performances last year he'll be our best defender.  As long as he avoids injuries he shouldn't have any problems performing to the required standard. Can't say the same about the rest of the back four.

768~~~
I know it was pre season but I remember that he did look very good against Pool in that 'Cup Final' thing in the US

769~~~
Looking forward to him coming in. He'll improve that left side all day long. He won't lose many 1v1s.

I'm worried about Rojo being shifted to the centre now - but I do hope it ends up being a positive.

770~~~
With Blackett suspended for next game(s), and 2 of our 3 British glass CB's being injured you'd expect Rojo to shift to CB and give an opportunity to Shaw at LB, one I think he'll probably take and never look back.

771~~~
Will definitely be in for West Ham you would think. Hope he plays well.

772~~~
If he doesn't start v West Ham, there must be an attitude problem or something.

There is no reasonable explanation if he doesn't play.

He should start next week without a doubt, and I hope he plays excellent.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Louis van Gaal does NOT rate Luke Shaw, claims former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen</b></span>
<ul>
<li><b>Manchester United bought Luke Shaw from Southampton for £31.5m</b></li>
<li><b>19-year-old Shaw has not yet made an appearance for United</b></li>
<li><b>Rene Meulensteen said on Monday that Van Gaal does not rate him</b></li>
<li><b>Meulensteen also said the signing of Marcos Rojo is bad news for Shaw</b></li>
</ul>

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal does not rate Luke Shaw, according to former Old Trafford coach Rene Meulensteen.

Left-back Shaw became the world's most expensive teenager when he was signed from Southampton for £31mmillion this summer but has not yet appeared for United.

Asked if he believes that Van Gaal does not rate 19-year-old Shaw, Meulensteen told <a class="externalLink" href="http://talksport.com/football/exclusive-man-united-boss-van-gaal-does-not-rate-shaw-claims-meulensteen-140922114972" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talkSPORT</a>: 'Yes. It’s a big surprise for me.

'He would have been informed by the club that they were putting this bid in for Shaw because he’s an up-and-coming player.

'He’s got a good left foot and a lot of pace. He’s got a lot to learn to get to a Man United level though.

'He’s a great prospect but he’s brought [Marcos] Rojo in, which is bad news for Shaw.'

Meulensteen's comments come just days after United defender Jonny Evans claimed that Shaw will be the best left back in the world.

'I had the chance to work with Luke in pre-season and there is no doubt he is going to be the best left back in the world,' Northern Irishman Evans told United Review.

Shaw joined United on in June from Southampton, the club who awarded him his first professional contract.

His form last season earned him a place in England's World Cup squad at the expense of Ashley Cole. He played in the draw against Costa Rica.

Shaw's non-appearance for United may be down to the fact that Van Gaal has questioned his fitness since he came back in the summer. 


Hopefully just Meulensteen speculating incorrectly and it's actually just down to fitness.

775~~~
Can't believe he's not fit, last season he was one of the fittest fullbacks in the league. Really excited to see him in the team

776~~~
Rene talking out if his clacka.

Gobshite!

777~~~
Saying that bringing in Rojo is bad news for Shaw? Shaw is a left wing back whereas Rojo is generally played as a left centre back... IF the 3-5-2 does come back I have no doubt Luke will be played regularly. I also thoroughly expect him to start on Saturday and play well.

778~~~
Okay, bringing in a CB that can cover LB is bad for Shaw how? If he's scared of competition, perhaps that's not what we need, but I'd imagine he will thrive on it, after seeing him last season for NT and Sot'on, he should make the spot his own..

779~~~
Ern he has been injured for like a month? 

People keep forgetting how our defenders keep getting injured. Im  pretty sure he would have come on yesterday if the match didnt change so dramatically. I for one am glad he didnt come on considering how the match turned out.

780~~~
Aware that he has been out injured but LVG was talking about Shaw being unfit before his injury. He must have let himself go after the World Cup.

781~~~
Out of the team because of injury, suddenly LVG doesn't rate him. Yeah alright, I bet he starts the West Ham game and never looks back.

782~~~
I've been thinking this all along. But everyone in the media thinks otherwise because they don't remember that he was out injured. I thought Rene of all people would have the common sense to realize that.

783~~~
I feel sorry for Shaw, the price tag and initial fitness issues have led to some stupid shite being written and Rene really should know better, he seems to be under the same misguided impression as many that Rojo is a LB. The fact Rojo became the first player I have ever seen play the position as a free role yesterday should end that nonsense.

LvG kept the same back 4 as against QPR because we won 4-0, any manager would have, why he didn't swap Shaw for Rojo at half time yesterday is anyone's guess though.

784~~~
Oh look Rene.


You don't hear much from him these days do you.

785~~~
LVG also spoke about how the LWB spot is a specialized role and requires an extremely high level of fitness to play. It isn't even about letting himself go but having to change his physical capabilities to suit the LWB role rather than the LB role which doesn't require as much end to end running. The match after LVG said it about his fitness Shaw had a fantastic game.

786~~~
I'm starting to think that looking like a member of McFly is working against the lad... I mean, what else could it be?

787~~~
He's not really out of the team because of injury though. Started a game for the reserves, over a week ago.

To be fair to Van Gaal, Rojo played well last week so deserved to start. It is a bit of concern that Van Gaal didn't seem to think Shaw was a better option off the bench once it became apparent that Rojo was having a bit of a 'mare.

788~~~
Spending £27m on a left back and playing a center back at left back instead of him is sort of indicative of our weird transfer policy of the last few years.

789~~~
He used one sub in the first half and perhaps he felt he needed to keep a couple in reserve for Di Maria (who was also injured by being shoved into the tarmac) and Falcao, who may not be fit to play 90. But yeah, it might have been better to bring on Shaw.

790~~~
I'm kind of missing the part where Rene says Van Gaal doesn't rate Shaw. Sensationalist headline.

791~~~
Rene doesn't realize Rojo is a cb. No trouble for Shaw at all.

792~~~
It was agreed beforehand that he would only play 45 minutes though partly because of the injury but also because he had the flu

793~~~
Ah. Ok. That's good news I guess. Flu might have left him a bit run down for a week or too after.

794~~~
Don't believe that he doesn't rate him at all. Just being mentioned because he hasn't played yet despite being fit.

795~~~
There's no way in a million years that Van Gaal rates Rojo's left back capabilities over Shaw's. Every manager that knows about football knows that Shaw is one of the most promising left backs in the world. He'll be phased in to the team when he starts to prove his fitness (which Van Gaal has previously expressed his worry in) - and at the same time Rojo will probably be given minutes at centre back.

The West Ham game will be the perfect opportunity for this because Blackett is out.

796~~~
Well, with EVERYTHING that has happened this season, including injuries and results, if the poor lad can't find himself a place in our next squad, he may as well piss off...

797~~~
I predict he starts this Saturday and has a very good game, thus silencing this constant nonsense the media are writing in their chip wrappers about him.

798~~~
While individually he might probably be better than Rojo, if the entire mindset isn't changed, I don't see how his inclusion will make a difference. We need absolute focus, calmness and ruthlessness during 90min. No complacency, no more chickening out please.

799~~~
It's pretty obvious he'll start seeing as we only have 4 available defenders (Rafael, Smalling, Rojo and Shaw).

800~~~

801~~~
I have posted Luke Shaw's pre-season performances.. no way in hell any manager could watch those and not think we don't have a talent on his hands. It is preposterous to suggest otherwise. It is fitness related.. he didn't look too sharp in the reserves game, so is slowly getting back to match sharpness.

802~~~
Why do people panic so much when one player plays and other doesnt. 
Rooney plays as a nr.10, Mata sits on the bench - that's it, Rooney will play all the games there, Mata will be a sub and will probably leave. 

Shaw doesn't play cause he isnt fit, Rojo plays as a LB - oh no LVG doesn't rate Shaw, what's happening, why did we buy him.. 

And Rene trolls all of us with the theory of LVG not rating Shaw and others will follow if they haven't already. 

Rojo is a CB and he's bough to play there primarily, Shaw will be 1st option for LB of course with Rojo jumping in when necessary.

803~~~
Agreed. 

Our defence had a few shaky moments against an admittedly shambolic QPR defence, but it was still comfortable and kept a clean sheet. You can't really argue against the same starting backline in the subsequent game against Leicester, as no one really put a foot wrong and the only player who you could say deserved dropping from that performance (Evans) would have meant two left-footed centre backs in the Leicester game if it was a swap for Shaw and van Gaal doesn't approve of that.

For all our defensive frailties, building some continuity in the defence is just as key and Shaw would have undoubtedly forced his way into the first team sooner or later anyway. It's such sensationalism to suggest LVG doesn't rate him, as he hasn't featured in any of our six games this season when he was out indefinitely for four anyway.

804~~~
If we'd believe all the stories LVG doesnt rate about 10 of our players. 

And if it isn't in the media people make things up just because that and that player hasnt played. 


I remember a story about LVG not rating Rafael, than Mata and so on. I guess he rates 2 or 3 players tops...

805~~~
I'd rather have Shaw as centre back than Blind.

806~~~

807~~~
So LVG doesn't rate shaw but according to today's daily mirror hes told fellaini he as a future !

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Yeh right

808~~~
Really excited to see him play. I think many forget just how important a signing this was/can be. I think all the attention on Falcao and Di Maria should help Shaw settle a little easier (once he starts playing).

809~~~
The pace of Shaw and Di Maria going down the left...

810~~~
Copy paste the Fellaini thing in his thread, I don't read the mirror or the mail but interested to hear if he's said something about it?

811~~~
Shaw was the best left back in the league last year. Utter nonsense that LvG doesn't rate him.

If he'd of been fit for Leicster and played instead of Rojo at left back, it would of went a lot better.

812~~~
Agreed. It's obsurd how he's gone from one of the best young defenders in the world to 'overweight flop' within a month. He'll be a top, top player.

813~~~
We need a big game from Luke, dont expect to see him bombing forward with or makeshift back four.

814~~~
Think he has looked very good

So confident <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

815~~~
Yes he has been fantastic

816~~~
He's fecking rapid! didn't know he was that fast.

817~~~
Nice stuff. He's a seriously good one-on-one defender already. Natural talent is all there.

818~~~
He's brilliant.

819~~~
He's been pretty good.

Playing more restraint behind Di Maria.

820~~~
Is anyone really surprised? He's top class, everyone already knew that.

821~~~
Great showing so far!

822~~~
Just need him to stay fit and he'll be starting games from now on. We gave him #3 for a reason. He's a class player already at such a young age.

823~~~
Brilliant so far.

824~~~
Been a big help in us looking more solid at the back and has the pace and power to just drive past players.

825~~~
He's so strong on the ball. He doesn't always need to look up and find a one-two to get forward, he can get his head down and beat a man with pace and power.

826~~~
Looks solid but a bit nervy as expected. Hopefully he "unchains the shcakles" so to speak because clearly he has bags of pace and should just keep getting forwards in support of ADM.

827~~~
For his united PL debut, been very good. Not afraid to run with the ball if the pass isn't on. Has pace and also some strength on him.

828~~~
Nice and composed.

829~~~
Had no doubts.

830~~~
Not surprised one bit. The kid is absolute quality for a 19 year old. Quick, strong and most importantly his understanding of the game is excellent.

831~~~
Pacey fat fecker ain't he <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> been very very good so far, if he can link a bit more with ADM we should be solid left side. Just said very similar of Rafael and Herrera,  we look very well balanced out wide.

832~~~
It sort of baffles me that our entire defense had to get injured for him to actually make his debut, really. He's obviously quality.

833~~~
He goes past people with ease. Good half so far, defensively and going forward.

834~~~
Shaw's been strong and has gotten forward to support attacks well. You can see the understanding between him and Di Maria needs to develop a bit, this season I don't think anyone else has done better for us at left back than Shaw though.

835~~~
It's not baffling. Rojo can also play there and played very well against QPR in a game where we kept a clean sheet, so LVG decided to not change it.

836~~~
Rojo should've been moved to Cb over Blackett. Not been kept at Lb.

837~~~
In 1 on 1 situations, he is incredible.

838~~~
Love him. Rafeal and Shaw were our best players today.

839~~~
Goes alright for a obese unfit fecker <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

840~~~
Great on his debut I think we've that LB spot covered for a very long time.

841~~~
Definitely is a better LB than Rojo, more PL experience too which helps. Gave us more defensive solidity on the left side today for sure and needs to start every match.

842~~~
Even 3-5-2 would've worked with Shaw and Rafael on the flanks!

843~~~
Very good game from him today, solid the whole time and overlapped well. As long as he stays clear of injuries he'll be a great singing I think. Sort of like Rio, 30m but he'll be worth the big price.

844~~~
He's going to be an outstanding defender for us.

845~~~
He's going to be a star for us. Hard to believe how young he is given that he plays with so much maturity.

846~~~
I was impressed on the whole.

847~~~
I really like his passing in the final third, neat and tidy.

848~~~
Great début for Shaw today. Calm on the ball, defensively sound, and got forward well. This guy has got it all.

849~~~
Bargain.

850~~~
He's overweight apparently.

851~~~
true though towards the end our left side of the defence looked more vulnerable than the rest...maybe di Maria was not helping him enough

852~~~
Still can't believe he's 19, played great today.

853~~~
He's a fat mess, to be fair. But a cracking footballer.

854~~~
I agree with that but I will say that we were still much worse last week down the left. Rojo was making some shocking forward moves and losing the ball.

855~~~
He is brilliant. A lot more to come from him from an attacking perspective too

856~~~

857~~~
I love him.

858~~~
He Provides us with a great balance because of his defensive capabilities Di Maria has a lot more offensive freedom on the left.

859~~~
Had a good game but did look vulnerable at the back post for headers. But then again the whole defense did

860~~~
Explains why you thought Anderson would be a world-class player too then, fatty lover!

(I do too)

861~~~
He wasn't match fit. He was put in the starting XI as soon as he was. Nothing baffling about it.

862~~~
Finally we see him....and he had a great game. I reckon we've made a great signing that will get better and better.

863~~~
Looking forward to having him as a steady fullback for the next 10 years hopefully. Assured performance, quite staggering that he is only 19.

864~~~
I don't see the issue with starting him still, though, best way to get match fit is to play matches and I'd have taken a half-fit Shaw over what we saw from Blackett last week.

865~~~
Charlie Nicholas saying he struggled all game....rrrrrrrrright

866~~~
He's quick, assured, and has a composed head. He'll be a great asset to the team.

867~~~
He talked a-lot of shit today. He also said Rafael was poor.

868~~~
Great performance today. Brilliant to see him and di Maria bombing down that flank together. He's very assured and his composure on the ball for such a young player is brilliant.

869~~~
Very mature performance from a 19 year old, unlike Rojo at LB, he knows when to sit and when to go, put himself about as well. A very promising start.

870~~~
His pace is extraordinary, you just can't stop him once he gets going.

871~~~
Shaw is a few notches better at left fullback than Rojo, who for me looks a lot better in the center and easily several grades better than Evans.  

We can sort things out on the back line, amigos.

872~~~
It's very promising that he already seems to be a fairly mature player for his age who knows how to play well in defence. It's difficult to find a full back in the game today who is excellent both when attacking and defending, so it's very promising that we could potentially have one on our hands here.

873~~~
I just hope van gaals stubbornness with shaw does not keep popping up throughout the season, as we need players like shaw who can defend. I just hope to hell the reports that shaw is not van gaals cup of tea are not true

874~~~
I agree. I'm just saying that him not being in the team was because of a lack of fitness rather than LVG not rating him.

875~~~
What else would he do, though? It was clear last week that Rojo is a dodgy full-back and he made it clear today that he's more impressive as a centre back. With Shaw impressing, I don't think LVG would take him out of the team, even if he's not his biggest fan. At least, I hope he wouldn't.

876~~~
I never said he didn't. I just said it's baffling, for whatever reason, that our entire defense had to get injured before he got a debut.

877~~~
There was a point in the first half where he had di Maria over lapping him but he opted to cut in and pass it himself. Obviously going out wide was the easy option but I liked that he took responsibility himself

878~~~
Very happy with this lad today, looking forward to see him claim his place in this team now!

879~~~
I reckon LVG would have played him today even if Jones, Evans, Smalling and Blackett were available. He is our first choice LB.

880~~~
If it was ever true VG never rated him, hope he's learnt a few hard truths that shaw is one of his few defenders that can <b>defend</b>

881~~~
He is better than Rojo at LB. Or at least he played better than Rojo did these past two games.

882~~~
Was referring to his own punditry....he is shite tbf

883~~~
Guy was watching an entirely different match in his own little universe, apparently both Shaw & Rafael struggled. How does he earn a living spouting such complete pap?


<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/teams/manchester-united/9492237/manchester-utd-v-west-ham-nicholas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/watch/vid...ed/9492237/manchester-utd-v-west-ham-nicholas</a>

884~~~
Annoying how some pundits/former players keep claiming that Rojo is a left back 'because he played there for Argentina' totally ignoring that at club level he played at centre back. Ince said it on Football Focus today and pundits do the same with Blind. 

Delighted for Shaw. Could potentially be our left back for the next decade and seems to have his head screwed on straight.

885~~~
That's atrocious! I mean, your average football fan knows more than quite a few people in the game. Absolutely shocking from Ince <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

886~~~
Agree. Indeed one of those moments was very similar to Ashley Young misjudging the cross from which Swansea eventually scored their winning goal. This time the West Ham player shot directly towards goal with De Gea making a comfortable save. 

Overall, I thought Shaw was decent but not amazing. Much better than Rojo against Leicester (not difficult), though not as good as Rojo against QPR.

887~~~
Comfortable display from Shaw. Nothing worthy of a 7/10 but likewise nothing alarming or below a 6/10.

Needs to be more aware of players moving behind him toward the far post but even this has context, arguably only Stoke are likely to sling as many balls into the box as West Ham. Showed good energy too. 

All in all a more comfortable debut than Evra had.

888~~~
Rock solid today. We all knew he was the right signing. He's got the right balance. Big strong lad to boot.

889~~~
I really really like him. He's gonna be a star.

890~~~
'could have been 2 red cards' and the Shaw comments are beyond belief...

891~~~
If he thinks that then he must've done well. Soccer Saturday lot have become very bitter towards United so much so it's bordering on embarrassing I've stopped watching it.

892~~~
It's the sort of thing you want from him each week for 10 years. A good 7-8 out of 10. Very pleasing, especially in a tough defensive situation.

893~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uVihkeimdo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

894~~~
Irwinesque. Id be happy with that.

895~~~
Very encouraging from him. Could end up being one of our most consistent and constant players, hopefully like Cole was for Chelsea.

896~~~
Solid performance.

897~~~
I agree. Was solid, calm, composed, and mature. He will hopefully be the LB for the next decade. Well done, Luke.

898~~~
He looks capable of doing the job that Paddy Evra did down the left side. My main wish is for him to match Evra's fitness record of missing very few games.

899~~~
Played very well. Overshadowed by Rafael today, but Shaw did well defensively and his ability to pass the ball infield is already miles ahead of most fullbacks, despite his youth. I'm a big fan.

900~~~
Great debut. Him and Rafael were both very good today.

901~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ciro-ferrara-england-have-tactical-problems-midfield-and-gerrards-getting-old" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features...al-problems-midfield-and-gerrards-getting-old</a>

Old article... but there is abit about Luke Shaw, where he mentions him as a wonderful prospect.

902~~~
He was out of position once or twice but otherwise I'm very pleased.  I like how he sticks with players moving up the wing and doesn't give them much room to work with.  As great as Evra was for us, he gave opponents way too much space in his last couple of seasons here and we were vulnerable in that area.

903~~~
Was it him who actually gave the ball away to Downing before Rooney's red card. In the replays they kept showing Rooney's foul, but not what happened before, so I am not entirely sure.

904~~~
I just hope we can beat Everton and Chelsea beat Arsenal, not convinced we will win league anyway. Just so we go above his and Merson's precious club. He will still think we are struggling and Arsenal are the bee knees.

905~~~
He attempted to play the ball forward but it was closed down by a West Ham player. If we're being critical he probably should have played the ball a bit earlier, seemed to dwell on it.

Other than that a very solid display. He's going to be a fantastic player for us.

906~~~
Hopefully we'll see him in our 'Players with most appearances for Utd' column in 10-12 years. Has a bright future ahead of him.

907~~~
Apparently was head butted by Sakho during the game on Sat. Saw him poleaxed and complaining but no idea what it was about at the time.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/28/west-ham-diafra-sakho-fa-butt-luke-shaw-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...fra-sakho-fa-butt-luke-shaw-manchester-united</a>

908~~~
Shaw looks nailed on for left back for many years.  As for Rojo he looked much happier in a central defender position and considering all the circumstances all our backs were terrific on the day.  Despite the close shave on the final score and the sour notes of De Gea's and Rooney's mistakes, we should be very pleased.

909~~~
His ball forward was blocked by a west ham player with their hand and it deflected to downing when before it was heading into box

910~~~
Him and Rafa down the wings are just absolutely terrifying. To think that we have Rooney, Di Maria, Van Persie and Falcao interchanging in their channels is just beautiful. Once this team really gels we are going to have something wonderful

911~~~
Very good performance.

I think the best thing about Shaw is that he can give us very good balance. He is a full-back who can actually defend very well (unlike most modern wing backs who love bombing up). On the left, we have Di Maria to provide us width (On the right, Rafael does that much more than Herrera) and Shaw can be a fantastic ally for his defensive skills are terrific.

912~~~
Just saw this on the BBC article about Rooney, just casually added on the end. Anyone seen the incident or any footage of it?

913~~~
Delighted with this signing. Hopefully he cements the left back slot from now on.

914~~~
Solid performance from him. Much better than Rojo at LB. I'm hoping that this now means Rojo will be CB (where he also had a solid game) and Shaw LB from now on.

915~~~
Didn't notice anything live to be honest although Sakho should have been sent off regardless of any incident with Shaw.

916~~~
One of the best things about Shaw is that he's had brilliant footballing education and I feel it marks him out from say Jones and Smalling. He does the simple technical things like trapping the ball, passing with proper weight etc, really well. The fact that his defending, especially one on ones, is really good is extremely heartening. Lot of talk about Lukaku bullying our defense next week. If Martinez shoves him out on the right wing again, I can fully see him spending time in Shaw's back pocket.

917~~~
I would think he would start as a CF to bully our center backs

918~~~
Shaw did OK Saturday. He will get better and more consistent as he gets more games. Great potential and showed that he has a burst of pace as well. That extra training looks to have paid off.

919~~~
It's amazing how punditry is getting worse, and how little interest these professionals have in football outside of the Premier League. They're obviously entitled to their opinions about Shaw, and we'll always disagree on stuff they say, but it's remarkable how many folk seem to think we signed 3 left backs this summer.

Databases like Transfermarkt should make research so much easier for basic stuff, and you can just about watch any top flight football match you want on the internet. Hell, they could probably stand to learn a thing or two even from having a browse on Football Manager, yet somehow the accuracy in what pundits say is getting worse and worse. No research or knowledge.

920~~~

Sakho not getting a ban, then. Did anyone see the incident?

921~~~
They showed the incident on NBC Sports a few minutes ago. How they reviewed it and haven't banned Sakho is beyond me. It's a blatant headbutt.

922~~~
not a United player so the media don't make a fuss.

It's not paranoia, it's just obvious.

923~~~
Is there a video of the incident?

Best left back in the land in the under 21 squad.

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

925~~~
Listening to supposed pundits on the radio giving it "van Gaal doesn't fancy Shaw" nonsense is hilarious.  Gets an injury day before season starts and all of a sudden that equals the manager doesn't rate him. 

Thought he looked good against West Ham and fully expect a similar performance this weekend.

926~~~
He's only played the one game, in fairness. Gibbs and Baines have been playing more football.

As for the talk of Van Gaal not taking a fancy to him, Shaw will have to learn to accept this. I said it yesterday, but no longer will all coverage be positive like it was as a plucky teen at Southampton. Good performances are expected, seldom praised, and negatives in his game will be scrutinised a lot more than they have ever been before.  The perks of playing for Manchester United.

927~~~
Of course, his one and only competitive performance was excellent. So hopefully onwards and upwards from there.

928~~~
Don't forget that Van Gaal also signed two other 'left backs', because of how little he likes Shaw...

929~~~
Im hoping that's sarcasm!

930~~~
Yes. I was poking fun at all the pundits and media outlets who seem hellbent on pointing out that we signed 3 left backs in one transfer window. Not only is it absolute silliness, it just didn't happen. I'm sure Rojo will play a few games on the left when needed, but I don't see Blind doing so unless we really are urgently short there.

931~~~
Thought as much - we agree 100%!

932~~~
I think even this will be when urgent. There is no reason Shaw won't be automatic first choice. Blind has clearly been brought in as a DM who can cover if really needed, but in absence of Carrick that is not happening any time soon. Rojo has been brought in as a left side CB who has ability to cover Shaw when required or for a back 3! Neither have been brought in to replace Shaw!

933~~~
It's actually a good thing he's been called up to the U21's, provided he doesn't get injured. Really, it should help build up some match fitness. Just as he's getting into the swing of things again there comes another international break so two competitive games should, hopefully, do him nicely.

934~~~
Agreed. He needs the game time. Gibbs and Baines deserve to be ahead of him this season so far anyways, as they've actually played more than once.

935~~~
I don't think it was the injury that led to suggestions he was out of favour with LVG, it was the managers comments about the sheer size of Shaw when he reported back after his extended Summer break. In Shaw's defence, he's a young lad who went to the World Cup, he was always going to go celebrate that with a holiday while some of the squad were already starting their preseason fitness.

936~~~
1) At the moment Baines is still above him
2) He needs game time
3) The Young Lions need him more than the senior team
4) The games against Croatia's U21 will be tougher than the games against San Marino & Estonia for the senior team

937~~~
I don't recall van Gaal ever saying anything about Shaw's size but rather he just wasn't fit enough for the LWB role. He also didn't go celebrate with a holiday but rather cut his holiday short and reported to preseason early, just 15 days after returning for the world cup and a week before any of the other England internationals returned to training.

938~~~
I heard them on talksport yesterday morning as well. Spouting off that bullshit without even considering that Shaw was out through injury. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Such exaggeration. LvG saying he wasn't fit isn't the same thing as saying he's fat. Also I think he only went away for a week after the WC - he came back to carrington early by all accounts. Surely not enough time to badly decondition himself through excess.

939~~~
Did LVG not also say that Shaw was an example to the rest of the squad for the way that he reacted to the questions of his fitness and for the way that he applied himself in training.

Why would he go out of his way to say something like that if he didn't rate him.

940~~~
Exactly.  Just like the, "he signed 2 other left backs...".  The criminal level of arrogance from some pundits (and I include Scholes in this) in this country is a disgrace.  They couldn't be bothered to do their research on players like Blind and Rojo and actually understand what position they have been playing for their clubs.

941~~~
True, but didn't LVG say that Rojo came to his attention, or at least he was really impressed by him, when they played in the WC, a game in which Rojo played LB? In that case I don't think it's that unreasonable to think he might fancy him in that position.

942~~~
That may be where he first noticed him but he still could have been thinking about him as a centre back.  Hard to know what LVG is thinking but I believe Shaw will be his first choice left back and Rojo in the middle.  I think the whole stuff with Shaw has been about reminding him he hasn't made it and he needs to work for his place in the team - clever management.

943~~~
He actually said it was watching videos of past performances in preparation for that match where he got "enchanted" by him.
I guess it's most likely these were all at LB for the Argies but it's also possible they included club games in central defence. The order in which he names the positions he can play is interesting.

944~~~
Fair enough. Makes sense.

945~~~
Top class player

946~~~
He went asleep just for a moment there and ended up tackling recklessly, but despite the fact that it's somewhat tough to call, can we all agree that he actually took the ball and nothing of Hebert? It just wasn't a foul, no matter how difficult it was for the ref to spot!

947~~~
Penalty or not, hes having a good game. Hope it stays that way.

948~~~
Still think he's played well today despite switching off for a few seconds. He'll iron those errors out of his game over time. Going to be the best LB in the world bar none.

949~~~
Its very easy to make it with the national team when your club team is dominating the scenes (Massaro, Simone, P Neville, Nicky Butt etc) however one must really give his 110% to justify his place when the club team is under performing. That's how football works

Shaw is part of a defense that is leaking goals for fun. Its difficult for him to make his case under such circumstances

950~~~
Good run there to nearly get an assist to Falcao.

951~~~
Could see him say to the physio as he went off "It's bad" <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>.

952~~~
The International break has come to the rescue again.

953~~~
Looked great before his injury, hope it's nothing serious and I hope this injury crisis fecking stops soon. We aren't always going to get an international break to save us.

954~~~
Another bloody injury. Unbelievable.

955~~~
I think it was a precaution more than anything, Shaw wasn't limping on his way out.

Can't be blamed for the penalty, Everton would have most likely scored if he hadn't made that challenge. Having hindsight at my disposal, this was the best outcome of that incident. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

956~~~
Seemed to be touching his hamstring on the way off. If that's the case he's looking at another 6 weeks. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Suppose with Jones, Evans & Carrick coming back that's <i>some </i>consolation ..

957~~~
He was playing well though. Rafael too.

958~~~
Feck Jones and Evans.

959~~~
I only saw one replay. Did he get a touch to the ball first?

I thought he looked good anyway. Physically strong, very quick and seems to have good awareness when he gets into the final 3rd.

960~~~
Think he went through the man to get the ball so it was a penalty.   Was brilliant today, looks so cool on the ball for his age its very exciting.

Any update on his injury?

961~~~
Thought he had great match today, apart from penalty switch off, did very well on both sides of the pitch.

Has potential to be world class fullback, will only get better.

962~~~
Thought he was good again today, the way he bombs down the wing is wonderful to watch. Another injury is the last thing the lad needs though, hope it's not to serious.

963~~~
Looked great. Better going forward than I expect. Only gonna get better too.

964~~~
Some very Good moments and some bad ones.

He lost Naismith for their goal too though it was a tough one. Aerially on the far post he can be weak.

Penalty incident ofcourse was a problem too.

965~~~
Good performance in all. Harsh penalty call as I felt he won the ball, and I hope he's okay after walking off gingerly. Any updates on that?

966~~~
He's looked good since coming in at left back. God willing he isn't injured too badly.

967~~~

968~~~
Love that he thanks De Gea for saving the penalty he conceded <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

969~~~
Good news, he should be fit for next week so.

970~~~
So A 'dead knee' shouldn't keep him out at all? maybe a game at most?

971~~~
The nice thing about Luke is that he is more of a defender than an attacker from what I've seen. I think that perfectly suits this team.

972~~~
God bless the International Break.

973~~~
Honestly thought he was poor especially compared to Rafael didn't do much going forward and was poor defensively.

974~~~
Looks a bit too sluggish for me, which is what I blame for him losing his opponent for the penalty. It was a touch harsh, but like Scholes said at half-time, you slide in in the box and you better make it clear you got the ball. Particularly if you're going in from behind.

975~~~
Agreed.

Once he came off and also for that matter when Valencia came off, Everton appeared to find more joy down the flanks.

976~~~
Not his greatst game but he looks comfortable, he'll get there

977~~~
Has loads of potential and does have a great left boot on him for crosses. Still feeling his way into a united shirt atm, hope the injury is not a big problem and I am glad we forked out for him rather than near enough the same amount Everton wanted for Baines last year. Will only get better and it is good to have to full backs who have good engines and love to get forward.

978~~~
Aww

979~~~
Looks to me like one of the best youngsters in the world, and that's why we paid so damn much for him.

980~~~
Penalty aside he did very well. Attacked well and defended well.

981~~~
Looked very good again. Think I saw a picture that showed he got a touch on the ball for the pen too? Either way, he's very good at defending 1 on 1, he's fast and strong. Still so young too. Think he has it in him to become the best left back around, he's that good.

982~~~
2 weeks until our next game so I'm sure he'll be fine.

International break next week.

983~~~
He lost Naismith for their goal though it was a quality ball and run but still could have done better putting more pressure. 

That's a slight weakness in his defending aerial balls on the back post. Though not having a commanding aerially CB like a Vidic doesn't help the fullbacks in that regard.

984~~~
Love him already.

985~~~
True, Rafael's position didn't help either.

986~~~
This, having said that it was a brilliant cross and a good header. Also am I the only one who thought he got the ball?? for the penalty that is.

987~~~
did ok. some good moments and some horrific. got to get the defending part of his game sorted first.

988~~~
Not quite there today which is odd because he managed to shut out McGeady. The Hibbert pen was silly but at the same time he shouldn't have to track their right back.

The goal was kind of his 'fault' but it was a great ball in from Baines and he'll grow into the ability to defend those as he gets older and wiser.

989~~~
He's going to be great once we actually have a settled back four around him.

So that'll in about 2020.

990~~~
he is actually exellent with the all at his feet very promising dribbler. I think it's a matter of time when he will be the best attacking full back in the league if not a future winger / AM like Bale:-) Shame about his injury thought Rojo would be put on the left but after his improved performances as a CB it was Blackett. But we don't need to speculate who will be the cover leftback now because he will be ready for the next match hopefully

991~~~
Dead knee doesn't sound too serious. I was concerned it was worse. Hopefully should be back for our next game, especially with the international break. He's impressed me so far, besides the penalty. Those mistakes are to be expected from a young player though. He looks good defensively and going forward, especially his dribbling.

992~~~
Daily Star's headline:-

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/403399/Manchester-United-FLOP-Luke-Shaw-thanks-David-De-Gea-for-penalty-save" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/fo...uke-Shaw-thanks-David-De-Gea-for-penalty-save</a>

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

993~~~
?

His defending has been excellent except for that one mistake. Even with that one mistake taken into consideration he's defended better than any of our other fullbacks this season.

994~~~
Was very good early on, I liked what I saw.   Horrible penalty to give up, however.   It was too risky, he should know better.  Hope the injury isn't serious.  I like him and Rafael bookending the defense and going forward.

995~~~
The issue with the penalty isn't the tackle, it's that he completely switches off after Hibbert plays the ball instead of tracking the run. If he tracks the run the ball never gets to Hibbert.

996~~~
He just oozes class and confidence for such a young player. He's going to be a very special player.

997~~~
hehe deary me...gotta laugh at the headline! such a pointless dig at the young lad, but he wears a United shirt now so it comes with the territory sadly.

Solid performance for him today, he has settled into the side surprisingly easy and along with Blind i'm liking what i've seen from him so far.

998~~~
Sure they don't even know who he challenged for the penalty. He got the ball anyway, never a penalty for me.

999~~~
The biggest compliment Shaw gets is United just seemed a lot weaker as soon as he got injured. So much composure for such a young player.

1000~~~
Really impressed with this kid, looks very solid and excellent going forward. Can't wait to see how he develops, he's only 19 as well.

1001~~~
That headline <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

His defending is the best part of his game, I don't think I've seen a winger beat him once in a one on one yet. And even for the penalty, on the replay I saw it looked like he got the ball.

1002~~~
Flop? Jesus Christ.

1003~~~
He has some pace this kid. I want to see him fully fit. He is going to be a very good buy for the team.

1004~~~
Felt a bit sorry for him with the amount of times he busted a gut to make an overlapping run on Di Maria, but then Di Maria didn't pass to him...

Mind you, at present time, Di Maria can do what he likes.

1005~~~
The lad is a star, I've been very impressed so far <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1006~~~
Glad the injury isn't serious, he's doing great at left back right now. I'm glad that he is better defending than going forward right, very unlike most young fullbacks. Love having young English talent at United.

1007~~~
The one time he did get the pass, pinged a cross in between a pair of CB's right onto Falcaos head. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1008~~~
He has the potential to surpass Evra offensively because his crosses/passes are much more accurate.

1009~~~
I absolutely love him. Defensively he's a monster, especially in one on one situations. Just went to sleep for the penalty and I'm sure that won't happen too often

1010~~~
It must feel awful having to put your name to such tripe. Being a Daily Star journo is basically a case of sacrificing your dignity to make ends meet.

On Shaw, he was okayish today. Gave away the penalty and lost Naismith for the goal which were the negatives. Overall though you can see he is a player and that all the potential is there. He will have the beating of many a fullback when he tears forward, hope to see him do it more often. Linking up with Di Maria, that left hand side should be lethal.

1011~~~
Played well again today, Hope his injury isn't too serious as we could do without having to play Rojo or Blackett at LB against Chelsea

1012~~~
Can't wait to see more of him, potentially be at the club for a decade with any luck! Has so much quality, yet to see the best of him in a United shirt.

1013~~~
Was very impressed today... you sometimes need to remind yourself how young he still is.  

Any news on the injury?

1014~~~
Dead knee, apparently. Better news than what I first heard (hamstring).

1015~~~
WTF is a dead knee?  Surely you can only get that in muscles, like dead leg?

1016~~~
Its like a dead toe but its on your knee.

1017~~~
Hard to believe he is only 19 yet! There's plenty of scope for him to get even better

1018~~~
Still can't get over the fact that he's only 19, an absolute star. Bar the penalty incident, I thought he had a pretty good game against very tough opposition and he will only get better. I wouldn't trade him for any other LB, the potential is huge.

1019~~~
Totally and he doesn't look it! On the pitch neither, a-lot of maturity in his play.

1020~~~
It's a bit funny how often di Maria ignores him on the overlap. Our old wingers loved to just chuck it to fullback and take no responsibility.

1021~~~
He'll be in England U21 squad over the weekend, so the injury is clearly not serious.

1022~~~
He really will be as good as Ashley Cole, you can see it already. Can anyone beat him in a one-on-one.

1023~~~
Said this earlier in the thread, including pre-season, I honestly don't remember any player beating Shaw in a one on one situation yet. He seems to have a brilliant knack of reading an attackers mind and where he's going to go.

1024~~~
In Rafael and Shaw, if they can stay fit, we potentially have two world class full backs, in my opinion.

1025~~~
Can't believe he was dropped back from the England sqaud! Clearly San Marino should be used to give youngsters first team competitive experience! Feckin short sighted England muppets!

1026~~~
I think it was more to do with the fact he is just coming back from injury. He is clearly ahead of Gibbs in the pecking order.

1027~~~
So Shaw conceded a stupid penalty and then was at fault for their goal when his man (Naismith) scored.

1028~~~
Correct. He's also 19 and is showing a fecking shit load of promise. 

Now, what's your point?

1029~~~
What was the consensus on the penalty? I thought he got the ball watching live and MOTD only showed one replay but I thought again he'd got the ball?

1030~~~
He definitely got the ball, if only barely.

1031~~~
I thought he got a tiny bit of it, but coming from the side/behind and completely wiping out the player... didn't massively alter the path of the ball. Stone wall for me.

1032~~~
I wouldn't criticized him for a penalty. It was one of those tackles when the player got the ball and it was not really a penalty but you can't argue with the ref because from the angle he saw it it was a stonewall penalty. Tbf the tackle was spot on and he got the ball, if the ref could see the replay he wouldn't give the penalty. But as LVG said after Rafael penalty incident, you can't give the ref the opportunity to give the penalty in the box and i think LVG will have a word with Shaw.

Aside from the penalty he was very good, he looked so good defensively that you can't imagine he is really just 19 years old. Great talent.

1033~~~
He got the ball first, a faint touch, but it was coming from a poor position through the back of the player. 10 out of 10 referees would give it.

1034~~~
Played well today and showed the same sort of form he did whilst at Southampton. I hope the injury isn't too serious.

1035~~~
Not to worry! He was just taken of as precaution <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

He'll join up with the U21's now.

1036~~~
Sounds reasonable.

1037~~~
He clearly kicked the ball with his left foot and Hibbert then fell over his left leg so it isn't a penalty. He hit the ball before making any contact so his left leg had every reason to be there, Hibbert then falling over it isn't his fault. If his trailing leg tripped Hibbert then it is a penalty but no chance was that a penalty for me.

1038~~~
I'm not sure it would be a stonewaller like that. Had the referee be positioned a little differently, there is a strong chance he doesn't give it, as Shaw does win the ball.

1039~~~
Not a pen IMO. He's also ridiculously mature for someone his age. And unbeatable on one on one situations.

1040~~~
Bloody brilliant. Love him!

1041~~~
The ball goes a completely different direction after he hits it.


<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OKb9YzVrULi/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1042~~~
Just because he slightly touches the ball doesn't suddenly give him license to clatter through the back of Hibbert. His 'touch' barely makes any impact on how the ball moves and Hibbert would have continued on (and possibly scored) if Shaw hadn't brought him down.

1043~~~
Well, not really...

it goes the way Hibbert is going, which is the point.

1044~~~
Surprised so many of you don't think it was a penalty.

1045~~~

1046~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Doofy

1047~~~
"It's not a bad injury, it's a dead leg on my knee. I felt it in the first 20 minutes when I got caught but it carried on during the game so I thought it was probably best to come off before it gets any worse. I spoke with the doctor and obviously the manager as well and both feel it's best that I do go [with the England Under-21s] as it's not an injury that is going to keep me out. Hopefully, I should be training in the next couple of days and can get another two games of 90 minutes each." - Luke Shaw

1048~~~
Bound to make it worse with England U21s now knowing our luck.

1049~~~
Thought it was a penalty. But I also thought he was quite good apart from that. The cross to Falcao for his headed chance was very nice.

1050~~~
Excellent player looks the part already, had a brain fart with the goal and the penalty though.

1051~~~
As others have said, regardless if he touched the ball or not, there was always going to be a penalty awarded when coming through from behind like that,
but he'll learn, luckily it didn't cost us.

1052~~~
He does ball watch from time to time. Lost his man for the goal and did the same when De Gea needed to make a good save against West Ham. He looks defensively solid otherwise but needs to iron those flaws out of his game.

1053~~~
He's a real talent and very sound defensively despite being only 19 years. However, bad penalty to concede. Clear penalty as well

1054~~~
He was probably at fault for both the penalty and the goal they scored yet his quality is there for everyone to see. Players can have a bad game but still it could be easy to spot their talent. That's the case with Luke Shaw. He looks a star in the making.

1055~~~
He's a typical new-gen fullback, decent going forward but lack abit of the defensive side, but he's only 18-19 years of age and has alot of time for improvement.

1056~~~
That was stonewall penalty. Happy to not get sent off.

1057~~~
He's not a typical new-gen full back at all, he's an old fashion full back who's fantastic defensively.

It's just lazy to assume "oh, he's 19, he must be great going forward and suspect defensively".

1058~~~
No ref would ever give a red card for that. Well, maybe except Nani's Turkish friend.

1059~~~
Yeah it's definitely not a red card... though was incredibly surprised to see him not get a yellow considering how card happy the ref was yesterday.

EDIT - Or did he get a yellow? I can't remember seeing him show one... though I was sat at the opposite side of the ground.

1060~~~
I was mad at di Maria for ignoring him all the time, especially because Shaw was great with the ball whenever he got it in final third. It's unfair comparision, but if(for example) Nani was opting for a shot instead of passing it to Shaw at least 3 times in similar situations he would get ripped appart here. Just to be clear, I am not naming Nani just because I like him, same would happen with Rooney too. Di Maria was very frustrating yesterday for me.

1061~~~
Imagine if Di Maria gets it. He'll start thinking he could cross the ball in from the halfway line - dead centre <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1062~~~
That's not true about Shaw at all...

1063~~~
Yeah, concerns were the other way with him, that he's good defensively but not good going forward but from what I've seen so far he's pretty good going forward too and will just keep on getting better. He gets compared to Bale saying that he'll end up being moved into a winger role. No chance for me. Perfect in his current position.

1064~~~
Never a red card, was a penalty though not arguing there.

1065~~~
Its the complete opposite.

1066~~~
Do you actually watch football?

1067~~~
He is bit of both right now. His attacking play has been good in his appearances so far for us even though he is playing a more curtailed role behind Di Maria. Better than i have seen in the past actually. 

Like even yesterday he created 2 chances for Falcao.

His defensive play is pretty good one on one and positionally generally anyway too. Can improve ofcourse with experience there but his weakpoint defensively is crosses to the back post.

1068~~~
For their goal, he was a bit unlucky. Had Rafael been in line with the rest of the defence, Naismith would have been offside. Shaw should have done better but Rafael's position didn't help.

1069~~~
If Shaw's contact had have changed the direction of the ball more visibly, then I don't think the referee would give it. In real time, it didn't look like Shaw got anything on it, but he clearly does. I understand why he's given it, but I don't think it was "stonewall".

1070~~~
I don't know if this has been mentioned by anyone, but did anybody notice when he came off that he has the most spastic, infantile clap ever? Like a mindless fecking seal

1071~~~
Is this the most obnoxious post of the day?

1072~~~
Looks a very good player already at 19. Saw quite a lot of him at Southampton last season and thought he was excellent so when we signed him up I was chuffed. Haven't been disappointed, only 19 and looks great going forward and defending. Was a bit unlucky with that penalty and the goal wasn't entirely his fault.

Does anybody know how serious his injury is?

EDIT: Just read that he came off because of a dead knee. Hopefully he's back and ready to go after the international break.

1073~~~
No idea why anyone would think it wasn't a penalty. One of the most dumb decisions I've seen all season from any player. Could see it coming a mile off.

We'll give him some slack given his age but it really was joke defending.

1074~~~
Almost certainly. What next?

1075~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> 

A little crude, but accurate. Try not to have a stroke over it

1076~~~
I assume you've watched every game for 90 minutes? If not then your sample size is rather small with only 7 games played.

1077~~~
Been very happy with him so far.

1078~~~
Was good for much of the game save for the penalty.

1079~~~
The penalty giveaway was caused by Hibbert making an unexpected run on Shaw's blind side - was a lack of awareness, put simply. He'll iron those sorts of kinks out of his game.

1080~~~
It was just inexperience is all. We knew things like this would happen with a lad his age. He pretty much did everything else very well though. 

The movement of the striker dragged Rojo out of his position, which left Shaw with doing nothing. When the overlap came he didn't realise his cover had gone until it was too late, and then made a risky challenge. Probably should have gone for the shoulder barge to put him under pressure. 

Great new's that he is fit though, I was worried he was going to be out for another month.

1081~~~

1082~~~
Good to hear, we'll need him. He is our best left back now, considering Evra left.

1083~~~
He is class, should be displacing Baines from the England set up once he has a few more games under his belt at United.

Still a teenager so will make mistakes (like the penalty) but he is going to be a great player for us, so comfortable on the ball and brilliant in 1v1s

1084~~~
Great player in the making.

1085~~~
I think Gibbs deserves a chance as well. He's been good for a while now.

1086~~~
Looks like a special talent! That being said I did feel he was at fault for Everton's goal and the penalty. It was a great ball into the box but he did lose his man.

1087~~~
You just know he is as pure a left back you'll see in the modern day. He's quick-ish (once we get him to Ronaldo fitness, he'll be lightning), very strong, tactically sound, mature in game play, makes very good decisions when attacking down the flanks and more often than not has a good tackle on him. Not to forget, he's good in the air.

£30m is a bargain for a special talent like him.

1088~~~
Gotta give part of the blame to Rafael.

1089~~~
What on earth is Rafa to blame for? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1090~~~
He has pleasantly surprised me with his performance so far. Hibbert tackle (which was unlucky anyway because a fraction of a second and he would have made a beautiful last ditch clearance) aside he has been faultless. He is still only 19 and bound to significantly improve.

1091~~~
When i meant lack, i meant as in still need more experience under his belt and a better relationship with his fellow defenders. That lunge in the penalty box still shows he's got alot to learn, could say a brain fart or anything. At the end of the day if Everton scored that penalty, i doubt you be boasting how he is a fantastic full-back. He's really good, and has got potential to be the best, but stop putting these kids like him and januzaj on a pedestal, happens everytime when i see a decent young player doing well and they make a mistake they get slaughtered by the fans and the media. Granted Shaw does have a large price on his head for what united has paid but thats not his fault, its just todays football. He did well last game but made a huge error that could of changed the game, Lucky for him De Gea was there to save the day (literally). Other than that he did okay and created problems going forward aswell, defense is a hard trait too learn because its not natural trait to learn for footballers. Shaw can pull off brilliant tackles but he's got to learn when to not to go in and thats a normal mistake for youngster. Rafael is an example.

1092~~~
I feel safer when he plays at left-back. But he still has that mistake in him that would cost us points throughout the season, such as the penalty today. 

Defensively sound and has good pace as well. A decent left-back at the moment, and capable of taking on most premier league attackers right now. He's only 19 so if he continues improving, we may have quite a good player in the future.

1093~~~
He reminds me of Ashley Cole in terms of the type of full-back he is. Very strong defensively and good (but not amazing) going forward. He has time to really improve his attacking play though. Technically he is impressive so I can see his crossing becoming very good as he matures.

1094~~~
It says a lot for him - and I'm sure others feel similarly - that you don't watch him with any worry or trepidation. Already, I just expect him to go out there, play well and just get on to the next game. Well beyond his years.

1095~~~
I think he offers just about enough going forward, doesn't lose the ball and is good with his passing. I remember him being amazing for Southampton in one of the games I watched last season, think it was against Arsenal.

1096~~~
Exactly!

Very similar feeling i have when i see DDG...just quality players doing their jobs!

Amazing to think they are both not even close to there bests yet <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1097~~~
Yeah, his best asset is not his pace, or his dribbling, or his ability to stand tackle, or any of that; it's his maturity. Really is a sign that he is destined for great, great things.

1098~~~
One thing about him is you don't watch him and think he's a young defender. He just has "it". Our centre backs before, Rafael before, even januzaj last season, you could tell with them they were inexperienced or very promising youngsters. Shaw is already very, very good and developed physically to the point that you don't notice we have someone who just turned 19 starting every week at left back, effortlessly replacing evra.

He really can become a mainstay in our team if he gets evra levels of staying clear of injuries. Will potentially be the first name on the team sheet for the next 15 years or so.

1099~~~
Rafa wasn't in line with the rest of the defence and played Naismith onside.

1100~~~
Tbf, he is pretty experienced himself. Probably more than most of our defenders especially when it comes to playing in his proper position.

Shaw - 19 and has 62 Premier League appearances
Evans - 26 and has 135 Premier League appearances
Jones - 22 and has 110 Premier League appearances (how many at CB?)
Smalling - 24 and 91 Premier League appearances (how many at CB?)
Rafael - 24 and 103 Premier League appearances

1101~~~
True,  but that's still only like a season and a half which isn't much. He plays like he's more experienced and mature then any of them though, despite being a few years younger.

1102~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1103~~~
Ah okay, I hadn't realized that.

1104~~~
Thank god.

1105~~~
Starts for England U21's today, as does Michael Keane, for anyone who's interested. Kick off is at 5.45pm on BT Sport.

England: Butland, Keane, Shaw, Hughes, Gibson, Moore, Berahino, Forster-Caskey, Kane, Carroll, Redmond.

1106~~~
Currently is beast mode for U21's.

Hit the post too.

1107~~~
He's started really well, pretty much created all chances in first half hour.

1108~~~
Shaw's been great but what is Southgate playing at? Why is Berahino, our biggest goal threat, playing on the wing?

1109~~~
England look to be relying on him to create for the team so far. He's put in some great balls.

1110~~~
Been really impressed with Luke.

1111~~~
He's been England's best player easily.

1112~~~
His passing has been particularly good.

1113~~~
What's crazy is that he's actually the second youngest member of the U21 squad yet he's by far their best player. There's not a lot from that lot who will make it through to the full England squad. Maybe only Berahino, along with obviously Shaw.

1114~~~
Will Hughes will do I reckon.

1115~~~
He's far too good for the U21's.. not that I'm in any rush to see him at the 1st team though!

1116~~~
Good to see hargreaves singing his praises in post match.

1117~~~
Only 15 minutes into this now but he lost his man for the Croatian goal, right?

1118~~~
Was he good today vs Croatia?Havent watched the game.

1119~~~
Yep, that was probably the only thing he did wrong the entire game. Should've stayed with Livaja but to be fair to the striker only he anticipated the flick on so I'd give Shaw the benefit of the doubt and chalk that goal down to good movement and anticipation from the striker.

He was a beast!

1120~~~
Been excellent since the goal, to be fair.

1121~~~
So glad we signed this guy. Was excellent for the U21's earlier.

1122~~~
I heard he hit the post?

1123~~~
He's going to be the best left back in the world in a few years.

1124~~~
Decent enough half. Not outstanding but he's done his job.

Good for him to get this game time too.

1125~~~
He's just so composed I love him. The only thing i'd say is he seems like he could give so much more, someone like Rafael always seems to give that extra 10%, maybe its just me but I think we can still get even more out of him.

1126~~~
Thought he showed some decent energy second half, getting up and down with a few sprints here and there, looks so comfortable on the ball, I thought Hughes was also very good for the u-21's, not juts his goal.

1127~~~
I haven't watch the U21 games, but reading comments here, he made a mistake for a goal, but was excellent apart from that? Against Everton he also conceded the pen, but ppl were happy apart from that. I know he is young and all that, but if he is making one vital mistake per game against not even the toughest opposition or best players, then I somehow fail to see how he is excellent. Decent maybe ...

1128~~~
Good logic, captain.

1129~~~
My god.

1130~~~
Mistakes like that are part of growing up as a player.

He's natural talent, but there are things you must learn in order to fulfill your potential such is positional awareness which lead Shaw in making those mistakes.

He'll come good, we just have to be patient with him like any other young player.

What sets him apart from the rest of young players in that even after making mistake he didn't sulk and tried to play safe for the rest of the match(es), but he continued as nothing happened, determined something like that doesn't happen again, which only means he has great mentality so those mistakes will eventually dissapear from his game.

1131~~~
Great logic.

1132~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> All I am asking is how he has been excellent while making vital mistakes. I swear if Rojo or Jones make similar mistakes ppl are quick to question them, but God forbid someone says anything against St. Luke.

1133~~~
Because he's fecking 19 and will become a fecking world beater.

1134~~~
Yep 2 mistakes in 2 games definatly proves that he will make at least 1 vital mistake in every game he plays. Maybe spread out the sample size before deciding that.

1135~~~
Yep. Seemed to be just about the only fullback that Januzaj couldn't trouble last season.

1136~~~
'kinell. He has been good. Take our word for it!

1137~~~
We said that about Jones too when he was 19/20. I have just not been too impressed and found we overpaid a lot especially in wages. He might turn out to be a world beater, but he might as well not. I find him a bit overrated by our own fans, he is a good player with potential but has all to prove obviously at a big club.

1138~~~
Then you should just stop watching young players because every of them is the same.They all will make mistakes at some points and they all have something to prove.As long as he can turn out to be a first choice left back for us in the next 10 years it will be worth the money.There is something called long-term investment.

1139~~~
Well we don't have to wait long for a first proper judgement, Chelsea and City are coming soon.

1140~~~
Only time will tell what kind of player he'll turn out to be, but better stay positive and support him than being negative and sceptical.

1141~~~
Nope, because not every young player is deemed a future world beater without having proven much so far.

1142~~~
Well I am not planning to boo him next time I am at OT so no worries ...

1143~~~
That's the spirit! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1144~~~
Yes but 2 mistakes in 2 games doesn't automatically mean he will continue at that pace. For all we know the could be the only 2 mistakes he makes all season. If he has played , say 7 games and made a vital mistake in each game then I'll be concerned but not yet.

1145~~~
Not sure if you're talking about Jones or Shaw. Jones has been halted by constant injuries but he's still only 22, that's like 5 years off his peak maybe more. If you're referring to Shaw, he's missed 7 games due to injuries in his entire senior career. The fee has been paid and the wages are set, can he at least play half a season for us before we start labeling him (a 19-year old) a failure, completely disregarding the fact that he's played only 2 out of perhaps a few hundred games for us?

1146~~~
Shaw is already better at defending than Jones right now, never mind comparisons at the age of 19. You don't really know what wage he's on, and I'm inclined to believe it isn't nearly enough as has been previously reported. As for being overrated, I don't really follow. The guy just knows how to defend and has demonstrated that in his two seasons at Southampton. He's as sure a thing you'll ever see, future injuries notwithstanding.

Of course, you're right in saying he has it all to prove, but I think that's exactly what he'll do.

1147~~~
I was talking about Shaw. And where have I labeled him a failure? Stop overreacting, there are several levels between a "failure" and "(potential) world class".

1148~~~
@<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/sparky-rhiwabon.79008/">Sparky Rhiwabon</a>

Please don't make such posts in the future.

1149~~~
Mistakes? You can hardly call it mistakes if the scorer made excellent runs at both times.

1150~~~
You've already made up your mind that we've overpaid for him, not only in fee but also in wages 2 competitive games since joining, who's overreacting?

1151~~~
I have stated before we signed him and when it looked that Chelsea might get him that I don't want us to sign him for that much and I would have preferred other left backs in Europe anyway, especially Coentrao. But now he is here obviously and isn't going anywhere, but that doesn't mean I have to call him excellent when I don't think he has been that.

1152~~~
At least we are finally bringing in some proper english talent, unlike our recent forays with Jones, and Smalling

Shaw looks the real deal, been really impressed with his tackling in one on one situations

1153~~~
Oh right. You're one of those gimps who won't give a new signing a chance because you moaned about him being linked with us in the first place. Explains the shocker you've had on this last page of the thread.

1154~~~
So the fact that the top teams in England wanted both means nothing?

1155~~~
I can understand all of that and i'm not saying that he has been excellent or that you can't criticize his performances, but you can't say that he won't justify his fee after only 2 games for us. If he was supposedly a finished article such as Coentrao or someone like him who's played at the highest level for several years then maybe there'd be more cause for concern, but even then it'd be really premature to make such judgements after such a short time.

1156~~~
Nope, I haven't moaned about any other of our new signings at all, and you really are the last poster here to tell anyone about having a shocker.

1157~~~
Well done you. 

What's that got to do with what I said?

1158~~~
Again I have not said he won't justify his fee, the same way I find it hilarious ppl thinking he will definitely be a world beater and thus justify his fee, but let's wait and see first. If he wasn't English then I doubt we would even have gone for him. Maybe he steps up and can take the challenge at United, but it's just a completely different thing if you play for Southhampton or United where ppl expect good performances.

1159~~~
Read your post again and you might find it out yourself.

1160~~~
We signed Rio for £30M at a young age and look at how that turned out. Signing Shaw is a long-term investment and a calculated gamble at £27M. If he develops as expected and reaches anywhere near his enormity of potential he will be a steal that will offer us ten-plus years of service.

1161~~~
Agree with this. All I have a problem with is calling him excellent in games where he is making mistakes. Especially when at the same time a player like Rojo who is new to the league / plays out of position is called average after one mistake. Rojo at least has had a solid world cup out of position, Shaw failed to deliver in the same competition against Costa Rica. It's just very much double standard for my liking when it comes to Shaw since we have signed him.

1162~~~
I dont think either of his recent mistakes were a lack of understanding or childish mistakes as much as him being slightly slow to react in a split second situation due to a lack of match sharpness which is unsurprising since he's only returning from injury

1163~~~
1. Yes u did...Notice how you wrote quite definitively and also in past tense:

2. That's the whole point ffs, you're the one jumping to conclusions so start following your own advice!!!!!!!!!!!

3. He was the best left-back in the Premier League last year (fact) at only 18 years of age, if that doesn't justify us going after a player then I just don't know...Being English is obviously also a big thing but saying that's the only reason we went after him is just stupid.

4. You're completely disregarding the positives from his performances, he's made 2 or 3 errors yes but that can be accounted to being inexperienced, being in new surroundings or to the fact that the entire team has looked really unbalanced and unstable. The really good things he's done while also looking impressive in his overall game you've completely ignored.

1164~~~
Hey man. I know you've probably got a lot of alerts for this post; I just want you to know that I also think it's quite a silly post.

1165~~~
We have overpaid for him. It might come out in some years that he was a bargain, which doesn't mean that for now I am of the opinion we have overpaid. 

Oh and I couldn't care less if he was the best LB in the PL (fact? Azpi was better imo when played there last season), as football for me exists outside of PL as well. And it's not like the PL was the best league in Europe last season. 
Anyway I will call Shaw's performances excellent when I think they have been that and not when he is costing his team goals. After all I don't call our other defenders' performances excellent either when they make mistakes.

1166~~~
Thanks for giving your opinion. You'll get the alert in exchange.

1167~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what were you expecting him to do?

Also, a striker can have a good game but miss a sitter, just as a striker can have a poor game yet get on the score sheet.

1168~~~
To defend well?

1169~~~
Both Smalling and especially Jones were also very impressive early on. They've got the talent as well.

1170~~~
Eh? I seem to rememember that Shaw had a very solid game against Costa Rica. He's a left back, what did you expect him to do, score a hat trick?

1171~~~
I don't recall him having any defensive issues in that game.

1172~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> If only he'd kept a clean sheet or something

1173~~~
He played well that game. It ended 0-0. What did you expect the lad to do? No offence but you've had a shocker in this thread. Better off leaving it for a while before you dig an even bigger hole for yourself.

1174~~~
I seem to remember he was all over the place just like Baines was in the first two games.

1175~~~
From what I recall, people were calling Shaw a stand out player against Costa Rica.

1176~~~
Again Shaw was out of position a lot and didn't have a good game at all. And thanks for the advice but not needed.

1177~~~
If a 19 year-old Shaw is no worse than a 28 year-old Baines, I'll take that for now.

1178~~~
Just did a quick Google search of match ratings against Costa Rica for Shaw.

Goal - 6/10; The 18-year-old is reportedly the subject of major interest from Manchester United and, while he hardly starred, he will not have put the Old Trafford club off. He was tough with his defending, but lacked a bit of spark in attack.

BBC - 7/10; Always wanted the ball and showed pace to snuff out occasional Costa Rican attacks.

Independent - 6/10; As secure as any 18-year-old full-back on World Cup debut has a right to be, storming up and down the line, solid on and off the ball.

Mirror - 6/10; Looks physically strong, not overawed, clearly has a huge future in front of him.

MEN - 5/10; Didn't get to play his natural game due to a lack of bodies in the box, meaning his impact was largely stunted.

Hardly representing <a class="username" data-user="66977, @united_99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66977/">@united_99</a> 's views.

1179~~~
Well thats just nonsense.

1180~~~
I don't understand why you insist..You can say that you believe that we've overpaid for him, but you can't say definitively that we have, so don't.

He was named in the PFA team of the year, perhaps also subjective but i'd trust their judgment over yours especially as your methods haven't exactly convinced me. Wether the PL is the best League in europe or not is debatable, but for a player to perform like he has (at 18 years of age) in any of the 2 or 3 best leagues in the world means alot, and of course it matters that the league that he performed so in is the same league that the club competes in.

I've already explained to you that I don't care about wether you think that his performances for us have been excellent or not, that's not what i'm taking issue with. My problem with you is your willingness to write a young player off for making a few mistakes at 19 years of age, add to that the "mistakes" he's made aren't even that serious to begin with, Another of our record signins; De Gea made alot, ALOT, of mistakes at his start here that were far more concerning than the ones Shaw's made. Were you as quick to judge him as you've Shaw?

1181~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/day-13-costa-rica-vs-england.392644/page-15">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/day-13-costa-rica-vs-england.392644/page-15</a>

Not much about Shaw, was mentioned just about 5 times, from what ppl have written here Costa Rica didn't attack much, Shaw started being average, disappeared at times, but improved in the 2nd half.

1182~~~
Again, I am not writing him off, all I am saying is he has NOT been excellent. 
DDG by the way played at a higher level with Atletico before he joined us and was nowhere physically as ready when he came to us than Shaw is now. DDG looked like 17 whereas Shaw looks like 24, not physically weak at all.
And while I have always rated DDG I wasn't calling his performances as excellent in games he had made mistakes.

1183~~~
So not "all over the place" and "out of position a lot" then?

Be honest, you didn't watch the game did you?

1184~~~
I did! I recorded it!

1185~~~
I don't think the majority are saying he's excellent in all fairness, but like another poster said, to judge Shaw at this early stage of the season you need a larger sample size than the amount of games he's played thus far. I'm especially not going to draw conclusions off of his performances so far, as he's performed better offensively than defensively so far, but going off the basis of his Southampton performances he's actually a better defender than he is an attacker.

1186~~~
I'm starting to understand how you got your tag. Claiming that we've overpaid for him after 2 games is writing him off.

De Gea was not playing at a significantly higher level than Shaw at the time that we signed him. Atletico ended up 7th in La liga the season before we bought him, and 9th the season before that. Southampton ended up 8th behind us last year, both were midtable teams in major leagues. The only difference is that De Gea had some international experience that Shaw hasn't had. Far from all of the mistakes he made in his debut season for us can be accounted to lack of physicality, there was alot more to it than that.

Since you didn't seem to get it the second time either, i'll post this one last time...

Did you or did you not think that De Gea, at a similar time in his United career as Shaw now, was overpriced and that we should have gone with another player?

1187~~~
Nope, DDG wasn't overpriced, also cost around 10 mil less than Shaw and as you figured out yourself was experienced in Europe. Plus apart from Neuer who didn't want to come, there was no better option than DDG to go for. DDG also was very successful with the Spanish youth teams. 
Apart from that I won't go into the "excellence" part again, as I have already mentioned it more than once.

1188~~~
How many fullbacks were at Shaw's level when they were 19? That's one question we have to ask. He is one of the top teenage defenders in the world, no doubt. It's all good and well comparing him to Coentrao, but what was he doing at 17/18? Shaw was playing PL football and put in performances which earned him a £30 million move.

1189~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Youre having a 'mare mate.

1190~~~
? What's so funny?

1191~~~
For a goalkeeper it was obviously a large sum since it was the highest fee that had been paid for any goalkeeper at the time. 

A few games in the europa league doesn't seem so meriting when you consider that it consists largely of teams who'd struggle in bottom the premier league.

Shaw has played for every England team from the u-16s and up. Even though that spain team won alot you don't grade an individual player by the success of the team.

There were plenty of "safer" options to go after at the time than De Gea, apart from Neuer there was also Lloris, Adler and many other talented goalkeepers around who had more merit than De Gea did. But De Gea was an exceptional talent just like Shaw is.

1192~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at United_99

1193~~~
Coentrao is defensively quite poor, whereas Shaw is defensively brilliant. For a club that's absolutely loaded with money like ours, buying English talent like Shaw is an absolute no brainer.

1194~~~
<a class="username" data-user="66977, @united_99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66977/">@united_99</a>

EDIT: Oops, I forgot the important part: <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1195~~~
Ah that's good. Watch it again and come back to us. Easy on the Crystal Meth this time though.

1196~~~
Probably that's why Shaws were, literally, all over the place.

1197~~~
I'd rather watch Chelsea bore me to death than watch an Englang game twice consisting of current useless and overrated players. The only reason I even bothered watching it was because of Jones' and Smallings' world cup debut and not because of a guy who didn't impress me and somehow managed to be unfit, but never mind, apparently he is still excellent while Coentrao who has been defending at the highest level and against the best attackers apparently is poor defensively.

So far all I have is an unproven potential who both his club and country manager deemed unfit and who has not acchieved anything yet.
But excuse me for asking how he has been excellent.

1198~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1199~~~
Is it because he wears tight pants? Is that why you dislike him? Is it?

1200~~~
If that's the case you could blame DDG too for not coming to claim. It was Luke's man and he fell asleep really to let Naismith in. Shaw is an excellent talent and I'm completely comfortable with the fee we paid, but people have to be realistic and he has made some bad mistakes - 2 in one game against Everton for example.

1201~~~
Naismith's goal can't be blamed on any one individual imo. If Rafael had held the line Naismith would have been off. You could even blame Falcao for being a little sleepy in watching Baines. Falcao was the one man wall and let Baines do a 1-2 before crossing the ball unchallenged. 

Then like you say, you could blame Shaw for not being tighter on Baines and perhaps DDG for not coming out, although that's the harshest blame of the lot imo. If I remember correctly the freekick was given away cheaply in the first place too.

LVG would probably rewind even further back to where possession was originally lost. Anyway my point being, there's no point trying to lay blame with individuals for that goal because it wasn't solely anyone's fault. It was a fantastic ball in and great movement and finish by Naismith.

1202~~~
If your going to put blame anywhere, it's falling asleep at the free kick. Every man and their dog know what Everton were going to do. Stop Baines crossing and their threat is severely limited. Why we decided to back off and just let him drop it where he wanted it was ridiculous.

1203~~~
Yep, sometimes you just need to give credit where it's due. It was a magnificent ball in and good movement by Naismith.

If we're going by any sort of logic, then every goal can be dissected and blame attributed to an individual accordingly.

Shaw has started slowly (injuries etc.), but he'll get there. Talent is undoubted.

1204~~~
Naismith was playing centrally, no? How on earth was he Luke Shaw's man to mark?

If Pienarr or McGeady had scored he might have a point...

1205~~~
The goal came just after a set piece, so perhaps he means Shaw had been assigned to mark Naismith.

1206~~~
I see him as an ideal replacement for Rooney as captain. I think the timing is right. He'll be 25/26 probably when Rooney retires and mature enough to take it over. He's English, he has a good work ethic and I think he can develop into a real leader.

1207~~~
Well seeing as he <i>wasn't</i> marking Naismith when the cross came in, I'd be curious to know why anyone is assuming he was supposed to be?!

1208~~~
It's just the way the play developed, he was definitely Shaw's man. Like others have said though there was a whole range of problems with conceding that goal.

1209~~~
Actually, just found a (really poor quality) video online and it does look as though he was supposed to be picking up Naismith. My bad.

In the grand scheme of things, those two errors mean feck all really. Just unlucky those mistakes were both punished. Generally been excellent so far. Which is the main thing. It would be like saying Di Maria's been a poor signing on the basis of a few misplaced passes or scuffed shots. Mistakes happen. It's possible for a player to make some mistakes and still put in an excellent performance overall.

1210~~~
I agree with the Pogue.

1211~~~
From our current set up, I think Rafael or De Gea. Maybe Luke will grow into the role, he already looks ridiculously composed and mature, who knows? Maybe leadership is synonymous with that.

1212~~~
He's looked class imo, thought the penalty was harsh but only gave big Dave the chance to shine.

We need someone that strong going forward as a full back, the modern game demands it from a top team.

1213~~~
Yup, agreed. He's made a mistake here and there but looked very solid otherwise. Which is very different to many of our other defenders who have spent entire games being nervy and mistake prone (till their injuries put them out of their miseries...).

1214~~~
I'm only talking about the one specific game where you said he was all over the place, but everyone else disagrees. Everyone from the people on here who watched the match to all the papers, to anyone else I've spoken to about it. Everyone.

1215~~~
Even though <a class="username" data-user="66977, @united_99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66977/">@united_99</a> has said many absurd things in this thread, I do understand his underlying point. The fact that we plaid 27 million pounds for Shaw is strange for him as Shaw isn't some established, world class left back at the moment. He'd rather prefer if we went for a cheaper alternative (I'd like to know who you preferred over Shaw) who was also a very good left back.

As a result, <a class="username" data-user="66977, @united_99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66977/">@united_99</a> is scrutinizing Shaw without much context, which is what's so absurd about his evaluations. If Shaw has made mistakes in his performances and hasn't look world class as of yet but has shown lots of promise and good quality in his current performances, does that mean that we can dismiss him and immediately conclude that he's not a good buy? When Rio was making mistakes in his first few years (on and off the pitch), how many fans immediately dismissed him and declared him a poor buy?

At this point, he's shown himself to be an excellent man-marker and composed defender. Going forward, he has an excellent delivery and very good decision-making. His only weakness is that he struggles at reading the game, defensively, and reacting to certain situations, which is normal for a teenage defender. Even then, though, it's not like his weakness is so bad that it'll never be suppressed.

I can see that <a class="username" data-user="66977, @united_99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66977/">@united_99</a> is afraid of Shaw not fulfilling his potential and remaining as error-prone as he currently is. However, given his mentality, I don't think he'll fail. He's so mentally strong and composed that I feel like he can be successful and be among the best left backs in the world.

1216~~~
Wouldn't count out Jones yet either.

1217~~~
Any theories on why he's been dropped back down to the England u21's?

Regular game time is good as he doesn't look naturally the fittest lad but I'd have expected him to push on and be challenging Baines who is starting to fade.

1218~~~
Gibbs has been good for a while so he deserves the chance, probably more so than Shaw.

1219~~~
Pretty sure it was mainly because England had to win the leg against Croatia to qualify, so they wanted the best players available. I think those games would have been more of a test than against Estonia and San Marino anyway!

1220~~~
Shaw will be an excellent signing for you - just give him time.  He was fantastic for southampton - just needs a run in your side.

The only thing bad about him is not knowing who tony adams was!

1221~~~
There's no doubt he's an amazing signing. He's one of the best left backs in the league already and he's only 19. Overpriced, yes, but he's an amazing talent. If we can get close to 10 years out of him (like we got with Rooney and Rio), he'd have been well worth his £27m fee.

1222~~~
Agreed, but at the risk of being pedantic I think we'd have to pay Southampton the reported extra £8m if he's here for 10 years. Still would be well worth it.

1223~~~
Because he has only played one and a half games so far this season, while Baines and Gibbs are match fit and playing regularly. Plus the Croatia match was an important one for the younger age group. It was a good call from Hodgson and Southgate. It means he's got 180 minutes against better opposition than the 45 he may have got against San Marino. He'll be back in the main set up soon enough.

1224~~~
I think it's a good idea to give him some time in the u21s. He wouldn't be starting just yet, England have a player of similar calibre in Gibbs and at left back it's unlikely he'd be used much as a sub. He will play every game at u21 level, will be one of the best players and has something to really work towards in the knowledge that Baines is on his way down.

1225~~~
He is exactly what i thought he would be, loads of talent but lack of experience has caused mistakes. He will learn, he is very young and the price tag will be justified in years time and not in the first few matches.

1226~~~
Gibbs similar calibre? Maybe now Shaw has just turned fit and hasnt got his form yet, but normally Gibbs isn't his level.

1227~~~
united_99 reminds me a bit of kietotheworld/MaroonPondlife.

He's not had the opportunity to play much this season due to injury, and when he has he's largely done well. Judge him after a few weeks/a month or two once he's got that run of games.

1228~~~
United99 or Shaw?

1229~~~
I think that's probably about right, and Shaw has a much higher cieling. But right now, they're a similar level for me.

1230~~~
Just read about his great gesture after Croatia U21 vs England U21 match recently played here in Croatia.

He promised his shirt to little kid who was staying before him while national anthems played, and after the match when people started to head home he just stepped out of the dressing room asking them about kid who was with him.

After they found him, he gave him his shirt and all while being friendly and nice to everyone around.

Nice from him, showing he's grounded enough to make an effort for someone like that little kid.

Oh, and not bad LB as well. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1231~~~
Wait, what? Where did you get that from?

1232~~~
Don't think he's on that level...yet. Them two were on another level of spackery all together

1233~~~
Widely reported at the time of the transfer, £27m rising to £35m I think it was based on appearance related extras.

I don't think we have to worry about that, if he makes that many appearances for us then he must be doing something right, still money well spent.

1234~~~
£27m rising to £28m in performance based bonuses: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/fee-luke-shaw-revealed-manchester-3779639" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/fee-luke-shaw-revealed-manchester-3779639</a>

1235~~~
Yep, that's the first I've ever heard of a £35m fee. I'm 99% sure that it's the fee that Damien posted. Well that was the fee that was widely reported at the time, not £35m as you've said.

1236~~~
Yeah maybe I got the fee wrong but I knew I'd read about appearance related increases to the fee. Here's a more recent article with the added bonus of it not being the Mirror. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/10931793/Luke-Shaws-30m-move-to-Manchester-United-will-have-bad-long-term-impact-says-Paul-Scholes.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...e-bad-long-term-impact-says-Paul-Scholes.html</a>

1237~~~
I'm a little disappointed with this lad thus far. He's too one-dimensional in his attacking play. He constantly hugs the touchline and pretty much runs in a straight line down the wing - not even sure he's that fast, tbh. With Evra, you knew that he could cut inside leaving masses of space for the winger and creating a two against one in the middle. Shaw's passing is a little simple as well. I'm sure he's a great prospect, but for the first goal, Evra would have been slaughtered on here. Other than that, he looks a great defender.

1238~~~
Not good at all today. Shaky defensively, at fault for their first goal and shite going forward

1239~~~
Needs to get back to the freedom he was playing with at Southampton, he looks as if he has been told to be a bit more disciplined which is ruining his game.

1240~~~
I am hoping it is just the step up nerves between SOU and united and he will get over it with more game time. Was at fault for the first goal and like you said, just did not offer enough in the attacking sense.

1241~~~
West Brom seemed to have free reign down that side at times, and he didn't offer much going forward until near the end. Just doesn't seem to be playing his proper game at the moment. Still settling in.

1242~~~
When you feck up like he did for the first goal, at least you can try to make an effort to get back; instead it was Di Maria who was ten yards further from the ball who tried to chase the attacker. Awful by Shaw - and as I said, Evra would've been crucified for doing something similar. His attacking is limited it appears. Let's hope he can improve on that.

Was the pitch narrow though? I'm only asking as there appeared to be so little space on the wings at both sides.

1243~~~
He needs to do better. And I'm sure he will. I remember at the start of last season some posts suggesting he'd been poor. Well it turned out to be his best season, so hopefully in a months time he'll be back at top form

1244~~~
Totally agree. Wasn't a good game tonight either at the back or up the pitch. No idea about pitch width but he has to offer more, especially since Di maria is our main player and he plays that side. He will learn and improve hopefully but now he is at United, he will definitely under a lot more scrutiny this season. Has to put in a lot better performance v Chelsea.

1245~~~
I think there was a massive difference from playing behind di Maria to Young. Behind di Maria he always plays the ball to di Maria and then half heartedly runs beyond him, not really expecting to actually get the ball. Behind Young he looked a lot more confident and was more adventurous with his balls. 

Perhaps it was because it was late on in the game and we were getting more desperate, but I think he's still intimidated playing alongside di Maria.

1246~~~
He is allowed to have a go you know. Very timid so far.

1247~~~
Wasn't very good tonight. Obviously young and will improve but these sort of games will be frustrating - particularly when we don't win them.

1248~~~
Grew into the game after an error for the first goal.

Anybody else feel that Di Maria doesn't really use him as much as he should? Young played a pass into Shaw which allowed him to burst between the right back and centre half nearing the end of the game and we got into a great position. Di Maria tends to cut inside.

Shaw and Di Maria need to work on their link up.

1249~~~
Didn't like his performance too much today tbf. Evra esque lazy tracking back for first goal(I am not blaming him for the goal, just didn't like his attitude there), and was pretty poor attacking wise. I also don't like that he never wants to start our attack, he is always happy to pass it back to defender instead of actually pushing us forward like Rafael quite often does, and like Evra used to do. He is better than this, so hopefully he'll show it soon.

Yep, quite obvious.

1250~~~
Seems to be lacking in confidence like most of our defenders. Clearly he can turn on the afterburners and beat a defender whenever he wants. Just seems to defer a little too much to Di Maria. Hopefully will grow in confidence as season goes on.

1251~~~
Not his best performance but I'm confident he'll improve. He's just finding his feet at a big club which is not easy for a youngster.

1252~~~
I'd definitely agree with that. Some blame Di Maria for not using him enough but he never seemed to make the purposeful overlapping runs when Di Maria had the ball. Hopefully as they get used to each other, that will improve.

1253~~~
Agree. He seems to have modelled himself on Cleverley. Run forward with the ball, but as soon as you see an opposition player, stop and play a nice safe backpass to someone.

No attempt to run through players, and the rare occasions he did try to do something attacking like put a ball in the box the result was woeful. 

At £30M+ we needed someone to fit right into our first team. Shaw however is looking like a newly promoted youngster who could go either way. You'd never guess he was a regular in the premiership last season.

1254~~~
True, but then again, did Shaw help Di Maria out enough? He hardly made too many overlapping runs that created space for Di Maria; not every overlapping run has to be used. They are important for creating space also.

1255~~~
Is it a case of him not being as good as he was at Southampton or it a case of his shortcomings becoming more apparent now that we see him every week?

1256~~~
I don't think anybody would pick up on him being at fault for the goal if they weren't trying to scrutinise for something (anything.)

He's gone to challenge for a header and somebody hasn't tracked Wisdom. He can't do both.

1257~~~
Of course he is as good as he was at Southampton.  However he is still young - out of form - and playing in an out of form team as well.  Southampton were settled and playing well all season.  Give him a chance ...

1258~~~
After Everton and England U21 - oh what a great player we have on our hands! 

After WBA - he isnt doing enough. He is like a newly promoted youngster. for 30 million he should  do more.

1259~~~
I really like Shaw but he was at fault for the goal. He was sucked in. That'll come with experience though.

1260~~~
I expect that Di Maria backs himself to put in a better ball than Shaw would, even from a worse position.

1261~~~
I'm not writing him off.

He looks very good for most of the game so I'm hopeful he cuts these mistakes out.

1262~~~
Games like last night really bring home how much Evra will be missed. He was taken for granted in the end but swash-buckling fullbacks like him are a rare breed. Shaw wasn't terrible (although it was probably his worst performance) just a bit "vanilla". Something you could never say about Paddy!

1263~~~
to be fair, Paddy did put in plenty of 'terrible' performances towards the end.

but I agree for the most part, full-backs these days seem more restrained and you can see that in Shaw. Evra's workrate was beyond madness at times considering he played every second of every game.

1264~~~
Well you can't just let Berahino take it down and turn on the half way line can you? Jones' mistake for the goal is a real case of getting sucked in because he's actually leaving his own man to make a shit challenge.

1265~~~
Even in his "terrible" performances , which involved getting caught upfield not a whole lot more than Shaw last night, he was a threat going forwards. That's what we miss most of all. Even started scoring from corners in his final season. By god we could do with some of that under Van gaal!

1266~~~
He is still young so probably deserves a bit of slack, but I did think he was awful last night. At fault for the first goal in my opinion - no need to get sucked in that scenario, particularly with no cover behind you.

Gave the ball away a few times, crosses were lacking quality and his overall positioning left something to be desired. Seems more confident at home when he and Di Maria are careering down the left flank, but he needs to be much more solid in away games.

Still a prospect, but lots to learn.

1267~~~
I think long term he will be very good for us, but he had a bad day yesterday.

1268~~~
He looked nervous, he would get to 30 yards from goal on the left and then cut back and give it back to a CB if Di Maria wasnt free. I understand the want to just give it to Di Maria but varying it up, overlapping, running inside etc is what I would expect minimum from him. He also got pulled out of position for their first (maybe this resulted in the cautious approach after. He did improve second half. But probably put in 3 crosses all driven all hit first man. 

Seems like hes not playing his natural game and therefore not offering anything going forward and playing within himself. I wasn't overly convinced with him at Saints and was hoping his reputation would not exceed him here. Sure he'll find form but for our defence and attacking variations we need this to happen sooner rather than later.

1269~~~
to be fair, Shaw on his day is lightning quick and we have seen glimpses from him, he's obviously suffering from fitness issues too. I see no reason why we can't mould him into that sort of full back, he obviously has all the required talent, it's just a shame that he's not like that right now in our toughest spell in a long, long time.

1270~~~
Evra certainly offered something more than just defending and attacking. He spurred the team on and always looked to find a teammate with a pass; he was simply that good at linking-up play. The funny thing is that Evra was criticized for most of the chances created against us came down our left side - that still seems to be the case. Shaw will turn out good, I'm sure, but I would've loved for Evra to have stayed one more season and taught the lad a thing or two. 

I don't think Shaw is as athletic as Evra at his prime, but then again, who is?

1271~~~
He's probably quick enough, although I have yet to see him matching a prime Evra for pace. What he lacks is unpredictability and being creative in the final thread. He looks to run in a straight line down the wing. He had so many opportunities yesterday to take the ball inside, leaving more space for Di Maria on the wing, but he never took those opportunities; Evra would have most certainly exploited that space. Then again, I've barely seen other fullbacks than Evra actually do that on a regular basis, drift into the center of the pitch and bomb forward, but it worked a lot of the time.

1272~~~
He's 19.

1273~~~
I've seen Shaw dribble inside plenty of times for Southampton. The problem is how often he goes for it, like with the rest of his attacking play. The attempts seem few and far between, a bit too content with finding a sideways pass to a teammate. LVG needs to drill it into him that he should be trying to make progress down the wing far more often

1274~~~
There needs to be no more of these fitness stories, or him mouthing off on twitter, or generally being a prat, until there is any evidence at all that he is actually good at football.

He's hardly endeared himself to me thus far. To be fair neither did Evra when he first turned up, and he wasn't 19, so we shall see.

1275~~~
Do you watch any teams other than Utd?  it was quite clear last year that he is.

1276~~~
I'm not worried at all. He's been very good up until yesterday, and at 19, he's going to have off games (I didn't actually think he was anywhere near as bad last night as some are making out).

1277~~~
He wasn't bad. He did the right thing by following his marker in with that header, but Di Maria didn't track his fullback. If Shaw sat off and let the guy win the header, people would be saying "oh he didn't challenge him". 

Apart from that he had an OK game, nothing special but he was hardly awful either.

Clearly his instructions were to give the ball to Di Maria as much as possible, which is hardly a bad thing. 

Once Di Maria went off, he obviously took charge more and started attacking by himself.

1278~~~
The more you watch their first goal, the worse Shaw looks. He couldn't even be bothered to sprint back, having made a questionable decision to challenge for the ball in the first place. Had he done so, it would have been touch and go whether he could have got a foot on the pass for their goal.

He's had a poor first few games. Far too many errors. At fault for Everton's goal as his man scored. Conceded a stupid penalty. Another poor performance here.

Right now he looks more like a McNair, Lingard, Blackett than a Herrera or Blind. At least with Rafael, you get an obvious contribution to our attack, to balance out the defensive errors.

1279~~~
What are you talking about here, exactly?

The one and only "fitness story" I can remember was him being a bit under-cooked in pre-season following a World Cup where he barely played any football. What's this about ""stories"? Anything I've missed?

I've obviously missed the rest of the stuff too. I tend to ignore what most footballers say on Twitter as it's usually quasi-literate nonsense. What's he done to stand out?

1280~~~
Most footballers don't feel the need to tweet newspapers whining about legitimate criticism aimed at them. Nor do they post topless posy selfies of themselves as some kind of *** at people calling them unfit.

You also don't get to act like an obnoxious child about being called unfit when the person who called you unfit was your manager...and then also your national team manager. He's 19, had just come out of a world cup squad, being in a fit physical state should not be something that the manager needs to specify for him to do. A bit undercooked is putting it kindly too, when it was noticable enough he had to train away from the rest of the team (i.e. everyone else in the squad managed to do what he didn't, including those who had the entire summer off).

I'm not writing him off or anything close to it by any means, but I've yet to see anything at all to be impressed by, either prior to or post us signing him. There's just stuff that makes me suspect he isn't made of the right stuff. Might be slightly harsh but he's already put himself in a position in my mind where he has to prove me wrong, though he wouldn't be the first person who has. Evra for example I was convinced was the worst signing ever by the time he started playing well.

1281~~~
Genuinely have no idea what you're on about here. All I saw were these quotes from pre-season:

Like I said, am I missing something?

Actually, just found some more recent quotes about his fitness which I also wasn't aware of until today.

Obnoxious child, you say?

1282~~~
In fairness, our entire back 4 is a bit of a mess at the moment so its harsh to single him out. The second WBA goal just showed how unco-ordinated they are at the moment. I still like the look of this guy, needs a run in the team, some positive results and hopefully doesn't get any stick from the stands while he gets through this period.

1283~~~
The first quote is Van Gaal publicly stating he wasn't fit, after which Hodgson also came out and said he didn't seem fit enough when he was with England (which reflects pretty badly on Hodgson for not bothering to do anything about it). In terms of fitness, I'm afraid Pogue it doesn't get too much more damaging than your manager (or both of them in fact) coming out and saying you aren't fit enough...remember when this happeend with Rooney?

I can't dig out the quotes because I'm at work but it came out Shaw was put on his own training scheme in order to get him up to speed, which is a pretty drastic step for someone who was only slightly off...if he was only slightly off then Van Gaal would have played him more in pre-season, not taken him out of the team entirely. Van Gaal actually praised his response to it and said he was now "an example to the squad" or something, but it's a bit like the naughty kid in school who gets extra praise for behaving as well as the others for a few days. It's fine but it's a black mark if there are any mishaps further down the line.

As I said, I'm being harsh...but, I don't know about you but my patience has worn pretty thin with players at United letting themselves down...especially when there's others like Young getting most of the stick, who's only actual crime is genuinely not being good enough. The thing I like about Van Gaal so far is that although he wont criticise any of them, he's made it pretty clear that he's not there for them to hide behind instead of sorting themselves out, like so many did with Moyes and to an extent Fergie.

1284~~~
Yeah, I remember all of that. It's in my post. Just don't understand where you've got the impression he reacted badly (obnoxious child) to being taken to task about his fitness. He gives a very mature response in the quotes above.

Genuinely curious, it's definitely possible I didn't see some stuff on social media.

1285~~~
Last season and his pre-season games against Liverpool and Madrid showed that he is. He was pretty shit last night but has been solid enough so far considering his age, recent injury and new surroundings. Judging him now after 3 games (also bearing in mind he is just back form injury), is harsh to say the least.

1286~~~
His latest interview doesn't sound like an obnoxious child. He clearly says he hasn't been good enough and that he must raise his game, but he hopes that the fans understand that it will take some time. Sensible that...

1287~~~
I don't think you can blame him on the first goal for being sucked in. He was on his man, Dorrans(?), and had to challenge him or he'd be free to bring the ball down and turn right in front of our back four. Absolutely no way should that be allowed. Di Maria banks on Shaw to win the aerial ball and tries to stay in behind Wisdom but Shaw doesn't win it and now Di Maria is caught out. Di Maria should be getting on the inside of Wisdom not trying to risk getting in behind on the chance Shaw wins it.

1288~~~
Di Maria really gets left for dead, doesn't he? Blind looks to be the quickest United player in that clip and he's got a reputation for being a bit slow. Go figure.

I tend to agree with G Nev's opinion on Shaw. If he's going to challenge for a ball that deep (and central) in the opposition half, he either needs to win the ball or clean out the man and the ball at the same time. Not a really grievous error but definitely could have done better.

1289~~~
The guy is 19. I aint looking to him to go all Wayne Rooney phenom on us. I want 15 years of good to excellent fullback play.

1290~~~
Yeah, an error of judgement by Shaw I guess.

Blind's the only one that's busting a gut to get back there, that's the problem.

1291~~~
To me it sounds like he's talking about Taarabt as a comparison, but I'm not sure.

1292~~~
It's Di Maria's man. He should be following the right back. He clearly thinks the defense will deal with it, so isn't really running as hard as he could. 

Shaw had to follow his man really, it's just unlucky that the ball spilled behind him. 

Both he and Di Maria could have run harder though to try and stop the cross.

1293~~~
I agree Di Maria should have done better following his man in the first place. If he's close to Wisdom he could at least slow him down or stop the simple cross along the floor.

But Shaw was definitely at fault, for the same reason that Jones was later. He simply didn't need to chase his man there. After all, if Shaw stays in position and the attacker controls the ball, what's the attacker going to do? He's 10 yards inside his own half with the entire back four & Blind between him and the goal. No threat at all there.

To compound the error Shaw then runs to a total non-position on the pitch. He's ball watching instead of thinking about the danger. He should have been trying to cover the edge of the D where Blind normally plays, because Blind was covering his space. Its entirely possible that he couldn't have made up the ground anyway, since Sessegnon was easily 6 yards ahead of him, but he was the only man with any chance of doing it (and Shaw hardly looked to be running full pelt). Instead he just drifts to the corner of the box, where there's no danger and no player to cover.

Anyway focussing that closely on the guy makes it sound like a total howler, where as in truth he was just punished hard by a great touch from Dorrans and then a once a season quality finish from Sessegnon.

1294~~~
Yep, simple things that could be cut out, end up being a big matter when analysed hard. 

Unfortunately though this is the tail off we have by choosing a young talent. We will reap the benefits in the next few years, but right now he will make a few small mistakes here and there.

1295~~~
Fantastic today. Solid defensively and some good moments going forward. Link-up with Januzaj particularly encouraging.

1296~~~
Thought he was brilliant. Exciting to see.

1297~~~
Had a great game today both in defence and going forward, was well happy with his performance.

1298~~~
2nd best United player on the pitch today, very solid defensively and linked up well with Januzaj.

1299~~~
Well done, Luke.

1300~~~
He's great.

Loved the bit in the first half where he tackled Willian, who went down clutching his leg. Shaw just walked past him, had a look down, then carried on. None of this help the opposition up bullshit.

1301~~~
You wouldn't tell he's 19 at all. Very mature and solid LB

1302~~~
He did go and give him a little hug and pat on the back when Willian got back up. I don't think it matters though, hack a feckers legs out and pat him on the back.

Thought he was really good today, still think he needs to work with Di Maria more.

1303~~~
A much better performance than last week. Was nice to see him dribbling sometimes as I mentioned he's done it before and just needs to try it more often

1304~~~
Very good.

1305~~~
Yeah thats fine, once he's back up. But I liked the fact his first priority was to get back into position, rather then check on the opponent. Its only a little thing, but its something I quite liked seeing.

1306~~~
Really impressed by his performance. Good going forward and did well defensively. He's going to be amazing in a couple of years.

1307~~~
Really liked that tackle on Willian, excellent game.

1308~~~
Looking better and better. But still so young so there will be screw ups along the way.

1309~~~
Want to see a few more whipped balls with pace into the box. He could be a great outlet but it's easy to forget how young he is.

1310~~~
He's amazing. In the second half when Di Maria realised he couldn't beat Ivanovic, Shaw just took it upon himself to run the left flank.

1311~~~
Linked up very well with Januzaj I thought today.

1312~~~
Had a very good game, him and Januzaj seem to have a good understanding of each other. Once the wingers swapped sides, Shaw received the ball less on penetrating runs but was still solid of defence. 

Has some hustle about him too, can't help but love that.

1313~~~
He does play with so much maturity at his age. They rarely had the beating of him because he was positioned so well in defence. You still feel he can be more effective going forwards than we've seen so far. He does have real pace and a good cross on him. I guess we've been spoiled with Evra's marauding runs so I keep looking for more out of that LB spot. Otherwise his general link up play with Di Maria and Januzaj was clever and purposeful.

1314~~~
He's a bit slow in the final third I have to say (mentally). Could've played Januzaj on plenty of times.

1315~~~
He's emphatic at 1 on 1s isn't he? Yet to see him lose a 1 on 1. Looking forward to see him own the left side of the pitch for the next 10 years.

1316~~~
This lad is going to be class.

1317~~~
He seemed a lot better going forward while he was on the same wing as Januzaj in the first half, compared to 2nd half with di Maria.

I think he's intimidated playing with di Maria and seems reluctant to go beyond him. He just gives the ball to di Maria and almost seems to sit back, waiting for him to do something magical. Alongside Januzaj he seemed a lot more proactive.

1318~~~
Tireless and Evra'esque in that aspect of the game. We'd have seen a different game if Di Maria was up for it today. Like him.

1319~~~
His best performance so far. Thought he did well though didn't seem to be much understanding with either Januzaj or Di Maria, tending to get in each other's way rather than creating space.

1320~~~
Excellent performance. Kept Willian very quiet.

1321~~~
I still think he can do more in the final third. He had the pace to destroy Ivanovic.

He's 19 and it was a big game mind, but there is more to come and it's just getting it out.

1322~~~
This baby got gas. His mid range accelaration is pretty impressive. Didnt know he had that.

1323~~~
Good performance. Chelsea defended our wide threats quite well but he made a nuisance of himself coming forward. Even though we know he's quick, it's quite deceptive as to how quick he is.

1324~~~
Already seems to be a very good player. It's rare to have a full back who's actually good at defending, and he seems pretty decent at it.

1325~~~
I thought he was outstanding today. Very mature performance from an 18 year old. I think I only remembering him being caught out once and that's not bad against Chelsea.

1326~~~
he is pretty fast, but what i like is his composure for a 19 year old. He is happy to hold the ball with somebody on his back unlike almost all our defenders. Also, he is 19<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1327~~~
He's only going to get better. So much better.

1328~~~
His touch in some tight situation was excellent today and so was his pace.

Nice understanding with Januzaj in first half vs a defensive Chelsea right side. And was our most solid defender today probably.

1329~~~
Improvement is evident. As he gets fitter and more match practice he will come into his own. I do expect him to make some mistakes as he is only 19 but i think he will be a rio type investment which will bear fruit for a long long time.

1330~~~
I thought he was extremely good today. Best performance so far, hopefully many more even better ones to come.

1331~~~
Solid player but hopefully his end product is better in his crossing.

1332~~~
Him and Sterling look the most nailed on future world class youngsters in the PL, for me.

1333~~~
The tackle he made on Willian I think was class. Big part of what we did to combat Chelsea's physicality and stand up to them.

1334~~~
Our wingers aren't using him at all, especially di Maria. , I think Shaw just gives up making overlap runs after few times in every game becaue di Maria keeps ignoring him time and time again.

1335~~~
I keep forgetting he's only 18. Incredible performances considering.

1336~~~
He is really good, but offensively can improve immensely. He is far too happy to just keep the ball and play a back pass, although to his defence our movement in front of him isnt the best. When he crosses though, they never pass the first defender.

1337~~~
I really rate him. His fee seemed excessive at the time but we'll look back on it as a bargain the same as we did with Rio.

1338~~~
Him and Januzaj were linking up pretty well in the first half. He has great pace though and I agree we should be looking to play him in behind the fullback much more often.

1339~~~
Extremely impressed by him today. He'll be a fantastic player for us and on defending is already an upgrade in Evra of the last 3 seasons.

1340~~~
He needs to cut inside more. Rafael does it quite a bit and I think it's really effective. At times today he looked like he had no idea what to do with the ball and other times he looked good. When he gets one on one with the opposing fullback he looks like he knows himself he can't beat him though. Needs confidence and to grow into the role.

1341~~~
Excellent think he was close to MOTM

1342~~~
You can see his confidence increasing with every game. He will be an excellent left back for us for many years to come.

1343~~~
I thought he had a great game today especially as it was against a good chelsea side . 
Chelsea like to get Oscar and Willian back to help the full backs and this made it even harder , but to his credit he played well and was hardly ever exposed 
What we seem to forget is we had an 18 and 19 year old on our left side for most the game and we looked solid . 
Good stuff

1344~~~
Great performance from him, he's pretty fast for a bulky guy!

I thought he and Januzaj linked up really well today, better than he does with Di Maria.

1345~~~
Good to see a reaction out of him after Monday, very good today against Willian who is strong as well as quick.

1346~~~
Good game from him and he is certain to improve offensively as he has the basics, like good first touch, pace etc, nailed down.

1347~~~
No one would guess looking at his dressing habits that he looks so mature as a player. No nonsense , comfortable football player. Bargain.

1348~~~
I still feel like he is playing within himself, like he is afraid to lose possession or go against his coaching, but once he feels at home in the starting eleven i expect we will see him show a lot more of his attacking ability.

1349~~~
Two 19 year olds on our left flank, still did alright mind.

1350~~~
Thought he was great today. Very positive signs.

1351~~~
I am always impressed with his maturity. Did very good today, we are lucky to have him.

1352~~~
He was fantastic today, Can't believe he's so young! Will be a legend for us IMO.

1353~~~
Yeah he was neutralised a bit up against Ivanovic today but I think he set the chance up for RVP in the 2nd half. Don't think they expected him to cut inside and do that at all.

1354~~~
Thought today was his best game so far. To be fair Rafael had a much tougher job but Shaw looked very good. Looks like him and Adnan could be a nice partnership.

1355~~~
He's learning game by game what it takes to be a United player. In four to five years time he'll be a fully established member of the first team.

1356~~~
New (God-mode) Evra

1357~~~
I disagree with this. Provided he's not on the opposite side to Phil Jones in training, he'll have made that spot his by the end of the season. I can only really see injury keep him out of the side now (unless he goes through a period of abysmal form). His injury record before coming here was fantastic, and hopefully poaching Matt Radcliffe from Southampton will help that here.

1358~~~
Too optimistic. It'll take at least seven to eight years.

1359~~~
I can't wait to see how he develops. We, injuries aside, will have a beast of a lb for years!

1360~~~
Looks better and better with each game...

Haters still keep trying to say this, that and t'other about the lad. All nonsense. Took great pleasure in correcting their opinions today and all because the kid is that good i only had to smile, point at the telly and say "look at that, pure class and only a young lad too. What a bargain" 

A lot done, more to do!!

1361~~~
Am I missing something? He's already our first choice left back isn't he?

1362~~~
Thought Shaw was good. His tackle on Willian was great; has really good recovery pace.

1363~~~
I don't think we'll ever get a player as physically blessed as Evra.

1364~~~
I think he already is one, by default but I can't see too many left backs in this league keeping him out. He is already a decent defender and he will grow into his role as the season goes on.

1365~~~
I'd say he's a very good defender already. Its the attacking side of his game that has scope for improvement.

1366~~~
Right about that.

1367~~~
79 more matches than Vidic who was signed on the same window. Amazing!

1368~~~
Bloody hell! I'd never seen that stat before. The man was a machine.

1369~~~
even if he was a short, caught out on the back post too often in his latter years, machine?

1370~~~
The machine definitely started to break down in the final couple of years.

1371~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.gyazo.com/96c3f9725a516d82a0d8470961fb8db7.png" src="http://i.gyazo.com/96c3f9725a516d82a0d8470961fb8db7.png"/>
That's just <i>league</i> matches. He was just a physical mutant, literally ran into ground with no help to come in and take shifts from him.

1372~~~
He certainly is. I was impressed by him today - I'm a huge fan already.

1373~~~
I think Shaw, at the moment, is still a bit nervous in his play. He is generally doing the basics well, but he isn't yet playing with the freedom he played with at Southampton. When he goes forward, he seems apprehensive and is taking less risks himself, usually stopping and going back to Di Maria or Januzaj.

I think with a few more games, we'll see the shackles go off a bit more and he'll really step it up a level in attack. I know many said attacking wasn't his strongest suit anyway, but he was definitely better at Southampton.

1374~~~
I agree with this to some extent. His defending is good, but he needs to improve going forward. I don't think Januzaj's performance in front of him helped, although there was a few glimpses of it clicking in the first half.

1375~~~
I think he does ok going forward, can definitely do better, but what impresses me is that when he puts a ball into the box, he usually seems to pick someone out rather than just swinging one in, a few times hes even pulled it back towards the edge of the box to pick out the free man. He'll improve going forward once he has a settled player in front of him

1376~~~
Thought it was easily his best performance for u guys yesterday - and your best defender.  Good to see he is getting back to close to his best.

1377~~~
This.

There was the one time he mixed it up and came inside and then a pass to RVP which was great but want to see him doing it more often. TO be fair against chelsea is probably the right time to be a bit more cautious. But want to see more from him as he builds in confidence. He hasnt for me come close to the quality he showed at Southampton going forward and with theoretically more quality around him he should feel more confident.

Against West Brom the amount of times he goes forwards and the checks back to give the ball back to a CB is annoying. Did it less against chelsea but still needs to push on and start to produce assists, this is a key stat now for a LB / RB and he like Rafael should be contributing to attacking stats

1378~~~
I like him. A lot.

1379~~~
Let's sign Mandingo.

1380~~~
This is a current popular tactic upon starting an attack from the back. I think it is to safely walk the defence up to the half way line and pin teams back in to their own half and in the process run the opposing attackers into the ground. Not sure I'm a fan of it but it is what it is.

1381~~~
Disagree personally. As rafael isnt doing it. Its not a tactic. It's potentially an issue with Di Maria as he is so dominant in our team in terms of a) players passing to him and b) his end product, he puts the ball in the box etc. So Shaw doesnt often get it back and he wants to pass to Di Maria and if not him then he decides to go back to a CB. 

Personally I think he doesnt want to lose the ball (not a bad thing) and is settling in to life at Utd not making mistakes etc. But for me he needs to try to be productive going forward too.

1382~~~
It's worth remembering that he had Lallana ahead of him at Southampton so it was Shaw's role to inject pace and width into their wing play. With Januzaj and Di Maria that isn't required and a more conservative supporting approach makes sense.

1383~~~
Its been employed by nearly every prem team. Full back races forward until he is met. Then its decision time, Usually back to center mid or center back. Watch tonight's game. You'll see it loads. It is the safe option so maybe you have a point in that he has some doubts still. But maybe its that he doesn't make the overlap often enough which would give the move a more attack minded purpose. Again because of confidence as you suggested. Hopefully it will be more productive as we build on yesterdays performance.

1384~~~
That's an argument. I think there have just been a few actual situations that he has found himself ahead of his winger and I would have hoped he'd been a bit more penetrative, and he's turned back. Rafael, for instance, wouldn't have done so I think.

1385~~~
The commentator yesterday made a good point in the first half about how Fellaini was getting into Adnan's space on the left, which in turn would have done the same thing to Shaw.
I said it in another thread about Adnan as well though, he doesn't use Shaw as much as he should. Shaw made alot of overlaps but barely ever got a pass from it

1386~~~
Did anyone else think Shaw seemed to be struggling fitness-wise later on? He didn't seem to make many overlaps and when he did rather than continuing on he would turn back and play it slowly.

Still has a bit of work to do in the attacking wing back role IMO but looks solid.

1387~~~
Definite improvements from Shaw which is pleasing to see. Was starting to harbor some doubts on having him as our first choice/only LB this season, but looks like he is growing into it.

1388~~~
Just wrote it in the Rafael thread. They weren't allowed to attack much because the way Mourinho's wingers were situated, he's a brilliant defensive tactician after all.

1389~~~
Didn't notice him tire. I think he lacks confidence on the ball going forward and in the second half there was more onus on him to do that when Januzaj moved to the right. He was still making the runs even after we equalised. He was in a really good position to put a ball in just afterwardsbut Di Maria didn't play it to him.

Overall thought it was a massive improvement on his other performances. Didn't look out of his depth...just looked a bit limited going forwards, but at 19 you're not going to be too worried about that as long as he's making the runs.

1390~~~
Yup. Spot on. He's not playing with any swagger yet but it makes sense to play the percentages when he's still settling in.  Especially when we've been conceding so many soft goals this season.

1391~~~
I've a strong feeling he'll still be around a decade later, probably still as our starting leftback. He'll get even better once we're more settled as a team.  I can't believe he's 19.

1392~~~
Maybe if he could use his right foot he would open up more and better passing options for himself.

1393~~~
One of our best players against Chelsea. Definitely easing into the role, and getting better every game.

1394~~~
Solid performance so far. Causing all sorts of disruptions to their crosses into the box.

1395~~~
Good solid 45 minutes so far.Hopefully he can link up with di maria more.Oh shit, I forgot we are down to 10 men

1396~~~
Good defensive performance so far.

1397~~~
Our best player today.

1398~~~
Fantastic effort from our senior defender.

1399~~~
He would be a better cb than all our cb's.

1400~~~
Superb. Got caught out of position in the first half, but in one on ones, he's excellent for someone so young.

1401~~~
Superb performance. Incredible.

1402~~~
Probably the best defender at the club.

1403~~~
Great game from him. £27m looks like a bargain now.

1404~~~
Yes defensively he is excellent for his age.

1405~~~
Brilliant.

1406~~~
Our best player by miles. Brilliant performance.

1407~~~
He's brilliant.

1408~~~
Gets better every time he puts the shirt on. Polar opposite to Paddy's first Manchester derby.

1409~~~
He keeps getting better matches after matches, our best defender.

1410~~~
Please stay fit

1411~~~
Did very well defensively

1412~~~
Has been slowly solidifying his position in the first team. Expecting exceptional things from this kid. Superb.

1413~~~
Was one of our best players today, although they concentrated attacking our right, what Shaw had to do, he did very well.

1414~~~
All one on his side late on and he kept going.

1415~~~
Our best player today. My only problem with his game at the moment - not including his attacking game which will surely improve as he develops - is that he can get caught high up the field with no cover behind him. He needs to be a bit more intelligent when he presses, but other than that he's shown improvements.

1416~~~
Quality player. Quietly one of our more effective performers this year.

1417~~~
He's just 19...christ.

Got absolutely no worries with him.

1418~~~
Superb today, comfortably our MOTM, won his one on one's and never lost his head under pressure.

1419~~~
Old school full back.. if he can add elements of a Marcelo to his game, he'll be beastly.

1420~~~
Only defender I'd keep......

1421~~~
I wasn't sold on him but this is why he is at United he looks like a great one

1422~~~
Not many defenders can keep up with Navas on those runs - fantastic pace and strength. Terrific at defending; when he improves his attacking, he will be an absolute beast of a fullback!

1423~~~
this but that will change with experience

1424~~~
Fantastic today was a rock at the back.

1425~~~
He was excellent. Tired a bit towards the end and let Navas in a couple of times, however.

1426~~~
Some people have it, some don't. Shaw has that composure about him that is unfound in many of our other defenders.

1427~~~
Those fitness issues are a thing of the past. He covered so much grass today. Still made some silly mistakes but he will learn. MoM for me.

1428~~~
He looked punctured at the end. Played really well though.

1429~~~
Experience and a nailed down central defensive partnership alongside him and a midfield infront of him.

The sky really is the limit with this kid.

1430~~~
Worked his socks off again today, this guy is a star in the making. My one concern is that he seems to have lost some of that attacking flair he showed at Southampton whether that's because he's been told to or not who knows.

1431~~~
Our best player today. The good thing about him is his defensive part of the game. For someone who's 19 its incredible.

1432~~~
Lost Navas for a bit in first half which can be put down to inexperience. Solid in the second.

1433~~~
Man of the match for us (maybe on par with De Gea). Very composed, blocked a lot of crosses (definitely read Neville's article) and made two superb clean tackles in the box.

1434~~~
Was brilliant I thought. Great defensively.

1435~~~
Great game from him. Only 19 and will develop further as a player

1436~~~
Great performance and basically ran the length of the left touchline all by himself.

1437~~~
He's been our best signing of the summer.

1438~~~
Controlled his side. Very good for someone so young.

1439~~~
Beast of a player. Absolutely love him. Second only to De Gea in terms of performance today. 

Our only defender who knows how to defend.

1440~~~
Our best player today

1441~~~
Shaw's confidence is increasing with every game. I think perhaps he was a little overawed when he first arrived, which is perfectly understandable for someone of his age. His is one of the very few positions we have no concerns with - or will have for many years to come.

1442~~~
He's a rock. So solid at leftback.

1443~~~
Beast. Unlucky to be on the losing side today along with Big Dave.

1444~~~
Delighted with how he played today, he was superb.

1445~~~
Brilliant performance from him. Our best player on the pitch today, never thought we could justify 30 mil for a left back but right now he looks worth every penny of it.

1446~~~
Great job at blocking crosses, I thought City had signed Valencia off of us.

1447~~~
Man of the match. He was brilliant.

1448~~~
The only defender we have who is not prone to stupid mistakes(knock on wood).

1449~~~
This kid is the real deal. He's absolute class.

1450~~~
He's going to be a wonderful player for us providing defensive solidity and attacking impetus for many years.

1451~~~
Looks a proper United player, doesn't he? All those questions of fitness look silly now. Glad we got him; I consider DDG and him as our best young signings made in the recent years.

1452~~~
He needs to stop getting caught high up the pitch. It happened against WBA, and it happened again a couple of times today. Sure he'll learn from it as he's only young, but certainly something he needs to sort out.

When it actually came to defending though, bar one of two moments, he was grand.

1453~~~
Why was there no minute silence today?

1454~~~
I'm guessing it's him learning to pick his moments in that regard, but Rafael hasn't learnt that yet and it's been years.

1455~~~
Yep - but you know, you hope you're second child doesn't make the mistakes your first one did....

or some other analogy.

1456~~~
Lol. Every time I've seen him IMO he's been average as best, if not poor. Today was one of those matches. Defensively ok, on the ball just annoyingly poor.

1457~~~
No idea, but I don't think Shaw was to blame for that.

1458~~~
Going to be a star for us, without doubt.

However, what the hell is with that haircut??!?!.....It's absolutely shocking! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1459~~~
He was excellent today. Shut down Navas for the most part. He switched off for that one attempt in the end, apart from that he looked the part.

1460~~~
To the Smalling thread?

1461~~~
Fantastic. What a player at 19. That is the type of man I want when the shit hits the fan.

1462~~~
Yeah he seems a lot better at defending than Rafael to be honest, such a welcome change to have a left back actually with his man for once (sorry Patrice).

1463~~~
It happened a couple of times but di Maria didn't track Zabaleta on those occasions.

1464~~~
He's really showing his worth now, and he's only 19. Bright future ahead of him.

1465~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1466~~~
Isn't he?

Yeah I got threads mixed up.

1467~~~
True, though there was another time that Navas could have been in as a result, but I digress... Shaw has to get used to the fact that Di Maria won't track back as well as he might expect. It sucks for him, but it comes with the territory of being in that position.

To repeat, I thought he was very good - I just think he could be even better.

1468~~~
He was excellent today, a real rock. In a world of modern day full backs who are shakey in defence, he's bucking that trend.

1469~~~
Probably get shot down for this but I would like to see him tried as a CB, he seems much more of a natural defender than our actual CB's.

1470~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1471~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1472~~~
So much maturity in his play. It makes a change from the defensive errors his team mates keep making. He read the play so well and doesn't give many opportunities in those one on ones. He can shut down a left sided attacker superbly. It's taken a while but the investment in him looks smarter by the week.

Offensively there's still much more to come from him.

1473~~~
Really good today, City didn't get much through our left side at all thanks to him.

1474~~~
Easily our best player, his defending is excellent just needs to work on his crossing, needs to look at gary Neville as an example of someone who improved that part of his game dramatically.

1475~~~
Agreed, with each passing game hes looking more comfy and looking more like a United player. Like how hes cutting off / blocking crosses. Did well against Navas.

1476~~~
He's on his way to becoming the best left back in the league, if he isn't there already. I'm confident he'll cope with any right winger he can face in the PL.

If there was a right-sided version of him available, you'd snap-call at 27 million quid.

1477~~~
Defensively, he is by far the best, attackingly he hasnt showed much yet.

1478~~~
Absolutely fantastic, will only get better. Can't remember him losing a one on one. Looking like a bargain right now.

1479~~~
Another great display by Luke. I keep saying it, but he really is impossible to get past. Solid performance.

1480~~~
He was just brilliant, no sign of nerves or apprehension about his first derby. A threat going forward, showed signs of a better understanding with Di Maria and he's better at the back than Evra was, at least in his last couple of years. Particularly with one-on-ones and the sliding challenges. So excited about him.

1481~~~
the most composed young fullback I've seen in years  - does everything well

he's going to be a rock for the next 10-12 years

be great to add someone as cool and reliable at the other fullback and defensive positions

1482~~~
One of our best players today. Did well considering the amount of changes we had to make in defence.

1483~~~
Brilliant. Even Zabeleta had to show him some respect late on in the game.

1484~~~
"<b>Luke Shaw – 4</b> Couldn’t get forward as he likes due to City’s constant pressure. Looks out of shape and not a natural defender."

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1485~~~
you can see why we paid wat we did for him.

pure class...and he is still a teenager.

1486~~~
And he got paid to write that shit. It is amazing how some clueless idiots say that Shaw isn't a good defender. He already is one of the best fullbacks on the league when it comes to defending.

1487~~~
Genuinely don't think he had a good game today. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Navas seemed to have the beating of him and thought he was caught out of position too often. Even then, you can tell he has a bright future ahead of him.

1488~~~
absolute idiot.

1489~~~
Seems like a lazy assessment of a typical young full back to say this given that most are converted wingers. Shaw is excellent defensively, better than he is going forward in fact.

1490~~~
Jesus Christ.

For someone of 19, I've been very impressed with Shaw so far. I think he'll go on to be a top player at this club.

1491~~~
That's definitely true. In fact going forward he's nothing more than average, but his defending rocks. With his speed and physique he'll be very good on attacking part of the game soon enough.

1492~~~
Thank God I'm not the only one. I said the same thing in the post match thread, but after reading the other comments here thought I must have got it wrong.

1493~~~
I also agree he was pretty poor overall. Especially in possession. Defensively he was ok, although he was caught out once or twice.

1494~~~
Thought the same myself, put it down to the club bias though.

1495~~~
He improved in the second half and finished the game strongly I thought.

1496~~~
That's just bizarre.

1497~~~
I came here to say any criticism of Shaw is merely nitpicking and he's the best defensive fullback I've seen in a while and then I see that article. Some people deserve to be fired for spouting such shit.

1498~~~
Got to grips with the pace of Navas after struggling early on. Doesn't really bring us any threat going forward and certainly doesn't have the skill set to be a wing back. Sometimes all you want from your fullbacks is to be steady players, I think he's that already and still only a young man.

1499~~~
Nah, he had a good game. I was curious so looked at 5 or 6 different reviews. Almost every newspaper said he played well and rated him around 7/10.

Rojo and Smalling rightly had much lower scores. Smalling got quite a few 2s, which I think was generous to be honest.

1500~~~
I think he was fantastic again. He's 19 and has played just his 5th match for us!!!!!!

I can't wait to see him in 2-3 years

1501~~~
Thought he was really good today. Best defender by far. Some people are being too harsh with him.

1502~~~
Played really well. Like him a lot, especially if Rafael is on the other side constantly getting forward and Shaw is in a bit more of an Abidal style role, playing cautiously. Our best passer out of defense, too, which is another reason not to mind him not getting forward as voraciously as an Evra, Zabaleta or Rafael type.

1503~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1504~~~
Did Navas even get a cross past him? That was one of his most subdued performances. I don't think Shaw barely put a foot wrong today defensively. He's not going to fly past people like Evra but its refreshing to have a full back who's solid.

1505~~~
I didn't even know Navas was playing...

1506~~~
Navas got in behind him and hit the post didn't he? One of the very few times he did get away from Shaw

1507~~~
He's a beast. Will be a rock for years to come.

1508~~~
Such mixed opinions.

I thought he was fairly awful first half. Improved second half. His defensive play is ok, although caught out of position a few times second half it improved second half.

But both halves he was awful going forward just looks like he lacks confidence, tends to cut back, no killer instinct at all. Poor decisions and does not look productive at all going forward which is very different from his play at southampton where dribbles etc were quite a good stat of his (if I remember correctly). But he was really poor yesterday, could only imagine what Baines, Evra, Kolarov, even Gibbs and Clichy would have done if they found themselves in some of the positions he did yesterday. But he made poor decisions either putting in a bad pass, or slowing down the play or cutting back and passing backwards.

Really disappointed with his perfomances so far. I want to like him, but he just looks too nervy / not playing naturally at the moment. It could be LVG enforcing possession football and he's just trying to keep the ball instead of waste it. But its not working IMO.

We do have to pursue with him though as no other options, and with his reputation maybe he'll develop into the player he is touted as.

1509~~~
It amazes me that even though we're evidently wank at defending people want to focus on the attacking instincts of our defenders. It's bizarre. Right now, I just want them to stop the ball hitting the back of the net and the best defender we have to stop that happening is Luke Shaw. Call me ecstatic.

I'm more worried about the shit the likes of Di Maria and Van Persie are serving up in the opposition half, not our 19 year old left back.

1510~~~
He's been defensively great in the last two games but really isn't offering enough going forwards. Which I would only partly blame him for, as none of our wide players have been linking up very well with him. It is a problem, though. Modern football requires attacking full-backs and Shaw has only very rarely got behind their defence.

1511~~~
Don't think that a stupid statement, I think he'd do well at CB, the only problem would be you'd lose his best asset, his attacking ability

1512~~~
That stinks of some lazy person that saw the score and judged him on previous form. Out of shape...

Journalism is such a joke. Danny Kelly was saying on the radio last week how we gave a band a rubbish review without listening to the record for the NME. He was in a record shop later on, heard a song being played, liked it and asked the owner who it was and it was the record he gave the crappy review of. He just laughed it off, showed no shame.

1513~~~
Seems that he preferes attacking alone that combining. 

During the last 3 or 4 games, the few times he attacked well, it was pure lonely attacks. It’s true that Januzaj wasn’t great with Rafael neither Di Maria, but we need to find fluidity down the wings when we play this system

But I think that he begins to find his feet and putting good performances.

1514~~~
The thing is it would probably be easier to get another LB than a top LCB at this juncture.

1515~~~
I'm not sure if there's a sarcastic tone to this post but what attacking ability is this? If anything his performances for Southampton and this season have shown his best asset is his defensive work and he really needs to develop an attacking instinct.

1516~~~
Finding a good center back is likely easier than finding a competent fullback in today's football. There's very few full backs who are defensively as solid as him.

1517~~~
I don't know about that, we don't seem to have managed it, but of course if we could get a top LCB I'm very pleased with Shaw at LB.

1518~~~
Definitely concur with the trying him at center-back bit. I look at Callum Chambers who also played at right for Southampton at a good level but some of his best performances have come at the center of Arsenal's defense, and Shaw's overall skillset is pretty comparable with him. That's the beauty of having young players, their positions are very fluid at times and they can unlearn+learn newly acquired concepts at a faster rate.

All things point to him being very good at the defensive aspect already contrary to media opinion and this calculated calmness is something we lack between our current set of CBs. Give him a run of 5-10 games, if it doesn't work out then let him carry on at LB. And like you pointed out, there's an abundance of quality young LBs around, so replacing him won't be an issue. We could get someone like Kurzawa or Rodriguez for a relatively smaller fee than an equivalent top class CB.

Do we need an extremely solid leftback though ? The way football is being played right now, attacking instinct is a premium characteristic for that position. Most of the truly elite clubs have fullbacks who're only average at the back. Even Evra at his peak wasn't exceptional defensively but was a Top 3 leftback for about 5-7 seasons.

1519~~~
I think its the other way around, people find it hard to get a full back that can be solid defensively and try to play more attacking wingers into those positions, other than Lahm, Zabaleta and Ashley Cole until recently there's rarely been good defensive fullbacks but when they do come, they are invaluable. You only need to see the issues Evra had dealing with wingers like Lennon and jeopardizing the defense to understand the value of Luke Shaw.

1520~~~
LvG is known for converting younger players as well, but I guess right now we can't even try it out as we have no LB cover with Rojo hurt and Blind much better as a DM than a LB where his lack of pace is really a detriment and his positional sense can't cover for it.

The other alternative is for Shaw to stay at LB and for us to buy Laporte for LCB. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1521~~~
I strongly disagree with the notion that defensively stout fullbacks are hard to find. It's just symptomatic of the trend of putting greater emphasis on the attacking aspect from a younger age among modern fullbacks. I believe Gaz's recent article addressed part of this too, and it's being done for a reason. Top notch attacking fullback is more effective than one who's great defensively but about average going forward. It isn't an indictment of Shaw per se because I feel he hasn't displayed his full attacking armory at United yet. But I do feel the defensive part is easier to compensate for than the attacking aspect in a general sense. Someone like Evra might have had a torrid time at the back on the odd occasion but his overall dribbling and linkup ability more than made up for the relative frailties.

Yeah, I reckon he could've tried Shaw in different positions were Evra still at United given his history with Alaba, Piggy etc. In a way I see a bit of Shaw's skillset in Blackett who's looked quite assured at the center.

Wouldn't mind Aymeric though. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1522~~~
It's interesting that you mention Blackett, he can play LB and maybe could be an option there if we wanted to try Shaw at LCB.

Of the LCB's around right now from the games I've seen Laporte ticks the most boxes for an LvG CB who also looks strong and tall enough for the PL.

1523~~~
Maybe LVG was of the mindset that Blackett didn't add enough offensively compared to his defensive proficiency. Dunno, it's all conjecture TBF.

Yup, he's pretty much the ideal choice for Van Gaal - good presence, technique, comfortable on the ball and intelligent. Another very important aspect thing that some don't account for is the manager's adamance on having left footed defenders at LCB, which would rule out some alternate candidates. I really like Sokratis too and he might be available for the suitable amount of money. Him an Laporte backed up by McNair, Rojo, Jones (if he's around) and Blackett would solve almost all of our central defensive concerns.

1524~~~
Was pleased again with how he played yesterday. He's one of our consistently better players.

1525~~~
Jesus Navas - 7 Took advantage of <b>Shaw’s desire to be upfield</b>. A constant threat with his pace, but his decision-making let him down once more.

<img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1526~~~
I hadn't even noticed that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1527~~~
Not sarcastic at all, I agree he hasn't been great going forward for us but I think he was very good going forward for city.

1528~~~
That's possible, as you say it's guess work though as Blackett has only made one brief appearance in the senior side as a LB.

We are on the same page although I'd favour Garay over Sokratis in truth....unless of course PSG are sick of having Thiago Silva. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1529~~~
He's improved noticeably since his debut for us.

1530~~~
Definitely one of our better players recently.

1531~~~
He's probably our best player alongside DDG at the moment.

1532~~~
He's ridiculous for his age. You can see him gaining confidence. He's one player I've got no worries about.

1533~~~
He's so so good.

1534~~~
Our MoTM.

1535~~~
Outstanding. Already world class.

1536~~~
Yup, he was excellent today. Did nothing wrong and made very good forward runs. Hopefully he keeps it up

1537~~~
He's quality.

1538~~~
Best player today. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Looks like this will be De Gea all over again.

1539~~~
Easily our best player, is looking better and better with each game.

1540~~~
Are there honestly still people that doubt this lads quality? I mean seriously?

1541~~~
MotM for me.

1542~~~
Starting to look like a United player. My MotM.

1543~~~
He's the dogs.

1544~~~
He's brilliant for someone so young.

1545~~~
Not only great defensively, showed his attacking qualities too, along with DDG, the certain starters for me. He is also lightening quick, feck me.

1546~~~
Excellent again.

1547~~~
Just looks so polished in an absolute shambles of a back line.

1548~~~
He is great. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1549~~~
Touch wood, we'll see him in the red shirt for a long, long time.

1550~~~
Great game again.

1551~~~
And people suggesting Rojo or Blind would be the starting left back not so long ago<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. The lad is quality, potential to be the best left back in the world one day. Already one of the best in the league at his age is impressive. He's been picking up some serious form since the Chelsea game.

1552~~~
Fantastic game from him looks very confident.

1553~~~
I don't think he's anywhere near being word class yet but I'd be amazed if he didn't get there in the next few years. The idea that Gibbs is better than him is just baffling...

1554~~~
Whoever's controlling the Twitter feed (<a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a>?) has done something right in congratulating and tweeting Luke Shaw on his performances as he'll probably read it. He's a beast, especially for such a young age, and I hope he knows and recognises how much we United fans appreciate it.

1555~~~
Great performance from him today and I really love his energy, as he still went up and down in extra time. Unfit? My ass! MotM along with Carrick for me.

1556~~~
Gave him MOTM, really impressed with him so far. He gets forward well and knows how to defend.

1557~~~
Great today. Very comfortable and is clearly growing in confidence with his runs.

1558~~~
Last three tweets were by KM. I agree with you, though he'll most likely have been bombarded with so many tweets congratulating him that he wouldn't read it.

1559~~~
What a great game from him. Tremendous energy up and down the field.

1560~~~
Are tweets sent to your account randomly organised or are they sorted in a specific order i.e. time sent, account with most amount of followers, etc?

1561~~~
He's been fantastic the last couple of games.

1562~~~
Most recently received tweet at the top

1563~~~
Oh right, so he probably won't see it. Oh well, he'll get plenty of responses from United fans.

1564~~~
Very solid today once again and that was a great run too. I'm really delighted .

1565~~~
Please let him have an Evra/Irwin ability to stay fit. At least give us one defender who we can rely on.

1566~~~
Great game, MOTM, and the only one to show some balls in that first half.

1567~~~
signing of the season for me. Regardless of his price!

1568~~~
What a fantastic young player we have. Really making that position his own. 

Another excellent performance.

1569~~~
Imagine when (or if?!) di Maria gets into some form on the same wing as him. God help anyone coming up against those 2 running at you.

1570~~~
Great performance defensively so hard to get the better of him 1v1.

1571~~~
Luke Shaw today: 

100% tackles won
2 aerial duels won
7 clearances
2 blocks
2 take-ons
84% pass accuracy

My MOTM

1572~~~
He's only getting better and better <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

My only worry is if (more like when) he gets injured. Hopefully he has Evra's fitness.

1573~~~
He is seriously good. Very good going forward as well for probably the first time this season.

1574~~~
I have a man crush on him. That run and shot was dynamite!

1575~~~
MOTM for the second game in a row for us, looked our best attacking threat as well.

1576~~~
That was impressive to see. Taking players on and producing something at the end of it reminds me of a previous LB we had. I'd like to see him become a complete player in that position, but defending securely is what matters most now. Really does look like he's been playing the game at this level for years.

1577~~~
Usually you'd have some concerns with a teenager in defence, but not with him. Great player.

1578~~~
I didn't watch him in his best years, but I guess you're referring about Denis Irwin.

1579~~~
Currently the best defender in our team period; A 19 year old bought from S'ton in the summer. I have no doubt that he would be the best in the world in the position once he improves his attacking game and forms a better understanding with the left sided player in front of him.

1580~~~
Specifically Evra, but Irwin was superb there as well <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1581~~~
Great mid range speed on this kid.

1582~~~
Very pleased with him lately. He'll become something special for us.

1583~~~
Never had any doubts about this kid, he needs to be playing for England too.

1584~~~
He's brilliant. Nothing to worry about with him whatsoever.

1585~~~
Very good again. Is getting sharper.

1586~~~
He's going to be class. What frustrates me is how reluctant Di Maria is to give him the ball. He needs to learn to use him more, especially as Shaw is producing the quality down that side right now.

1587~~~
He's was like Evra on Speed today. Solid performance and by god, he has more pace then I thought. If he can keep this form, we'll have a great LB for years to come.

1588~~~
I think Shaw also gives the ball to di Maria too much. Like he feels obliged to pass it to di Maria at any available opportunity, rather than going for a run himself. The odd time he's been on the same wing as Januzaj, they have looked like a much better partnership, rather than just 2 individuals playing their own games nearby one another.

1589~~~
He has really grown on me in the last couple of games. He has looked every bit the player we hoped we had bought for a big fee. Rock solid defensively and a real threat going forwards with those powerful runs. If he keeps getting better he will grow into being one of the best full backs in the world hopefully. Of course a lot can change in the next few months/years but can't help but get a little hyped.

1590~~~
Will get even better with more confidence and experience, it's a lot of resposibility to take on at such an early age but he's doing really well.

1591~~~
Thought he was our best player, looked fired up but focused, made some good forward driving runs, nearly scored and defensively he was tough, decisive and solid, won some good headers too and hit our players with them into the bargain, very confident display.

1592~~~

1593~~~
Just reading these comments brings a smile to my face, we really have a gem of a player.

1594~~~
Looked good again today. I like that he isn't afraid to take on a player or two. I just hope he stays fit and isn't hit by our injury curse like all our other defenders. Even defensively he looked really good in our last two games which isn't always something you can say about FBs these days.

But looking at this gif above it's also a bit depressing how non of his teammates is picking up on his run and start moving forward with some urgency to maybe offer some passing options.

1595~~~
A big talent. Given how the chase dragged on over start of the summer, it was a relief to get it done then but an even bigger on now having seen him play for us.

Our left back spot is tied up for years to come.

1596~~~
RVP is the only one, the only one in the whole team who is making runs.

1597~~~
He's just one of those player's you never have to worry about, isn't he?

1598~~~
Imagine if Southhampton still had him...

1599~~~
Yeah 100% correct...i'd like to put Blind in that group too.

Shaw looked more confident in himself today as well, i hate keeping the ball just for the sake of it so it was nice to see him attacking with a freedom today. Very promising for only having played a handful of games...after Christmas he will be a beast!

1600~~~
When he gets into full flow, he's unstoppable. Another good performance from Shaw. Pleased for him.

1601~~~
good couple of games from him on the trot... keep it up lad

1602~~~
He looks way mature on the field. Much more composed than a lot of our experienced aged defenders.

1603~~~
he is actually younger than Mcnair. Incredible

1604~~~
Our best player today. His defending is sound and he is getting better at attacking.

1605~~~
I remember when some were suggesting Reece James should be ahead of him after the pre season tour <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Never had any doubts about the lad.

1606~~~
Any opposing fans with a piece to say on Shaw?

1607~~~
Was that his best game for us so far?

1608~~~
vs City IMO, he was a left side one man show!

1609~~~
He's becoming more noticeable now that Di Maria has become less impressive. 

Great turn of pace, hard to knock off the ball once he gets into gear. Plenty of time to add that final ball to his game (like a certain other 19 year old who people in the match day thread claim they have no more time for).

He looks a hell of a lot more comfortable next to calming influences like Carrick, McNair and Blind (minus one moment) too.

1610~~~
Now, he looks like a proper United player. Massive future ahead of him.

1611~~~
Looking like an excellent buy. Shaw was quality again today, he's on great form so hopefully he carries this on into the Arsenal game in two weeks.

1612~~~
He was very good today, looks composed compared to the rest of the defence.

1613~~~
Undoubtedly MOTM.

The more positions we can nail down as having a definite player for that role the better.

It's only really De Gea and Shaw at the moment. Need some more to nail down roles.

1614~~~
Love watching him play

1615~~~

1616~~~
He's been good to great for the last four games now, and in the middle of a defensive injury crisis that is brilliant. I'd like to see him make more Evra-like runs beyond ADM though, to give ADM more space to exploit inside.

1617~~~
I know a Chelsea fan who was a massive fan of him. It was actually quite weird. He used to text me how he can't wait for Shaw to sign.

The guy now rants on twitter how he can't stand him cause he grew up supporting Chelsea and now plays for us <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1618~~~
He was good, one small thing that I'd like to criticize him for is that he needs to overlap the winger a bit more.

1619~~~
Is rapidly rising in my favourite player list. MoTM for me.

1620~~~
Phil Neville: "I think they've got a player with real star quality. There aren't many players in world football who can open up a defence like him (on that chance giffed)."

Also mentioned that Shaw reminds him a bit of Bale when "he opens his legs", was one of the best attackers for us and said England have got a real talent.

1621~~~
He looks very good atm. Hard to believe he's only 19 when you see him play.

1622~~~
A great display. Exactly what we want from him.

1623~~~
He must stay injury-free* then he'll become the best left-back in the world over years

<i>*Unfortunately that's the hardest job for a United player</i>

1624~~~
He's going to become a beast for us. Can't believe we have people comparing his performances to Buttner's from last season.

1625~~~
Nice choice of words there from good ol Phil.

1626~~~
I knew he was quick, but he's faster than I thought!

1627~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlMwFI-OBlY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1628~~~
To help him achieve this, we can't let him play every game for us at left-back for the next 15 years.. We need to have cover for him (preferably someone that can cover both full-back spots).

1629~~~
Basically I think he's settled, got fit, and lost the initial nerves that come with playing for United. He's smashing it now. Potential is through the roof.

1630~~~
Beast of a player. Endless potential.

1631~~~
Sounds strange but I do wonder whether there's a touch of Bale about this lad....def bright future for this lad.

1632~~~
I'm not getting too excited about the Bale comparisons but he's far better than Bale was at the same age, looks a far more intelligent player at 19. Doesn't have anywhere near the physical attributes that Bale had though.

1633~~~
Don't want to hype the lad up too much, with young players you never know. But he seems quite humble and professional, and his play does seem reminiscent of Maldini. Larger than average frame for a fullback, solid at the back, serene in possession and increasingly potent going forward. If he can give even half of the service Paolo did for Milan, we can sleep soundly with the knowledge that another one of our positions is sorted for the long term. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1634~~~
He's very good. He and Di Maria don't really have any understanding though. Di Maria doesn't use Shaw enough, and Shaw doesn't make runs on the outside of Di Maria to open up space for him. We'll be a lot more dangerous if and when that clicks going forward

1635~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Manchester United's £27m man Luke Shaw: I'm ready to prove everybody wrong</b>
</span>
Luke Shaw believes he is finally starting to vindicate Manchester United's decision to pay £27million for him.

England defender Shaw was United's stand-out performer in <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-united-1-0-crystal-palace-4590574" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">their hard-fought 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday</a>.

The left-back had a slow start to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">his United career</a>, with injury and fitness issues delaying his debut, but <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the 19-year-old</a> believes he is now starting to show his best form.
Shaw revealed how having his family and friends move up to Manchester with him from Southampton had made it easier for him to settle in to his new surroundings.
Shaw’s family have even relocated from the south coast to Manchester to help the teenager adjust to life at United.
Shaw’s penetrative surge forward against Crystal Palace on Saturday was a highlight of the match.

1636~~~
Keep forgetting how young he is too, just 19. Crazy. Has so much more maturing to do, will be top quality.

1637~~~
He's not coming at bargain price like Irwin and Evra, but feck me, it's been a while to choose a left-back as MotM.

1638~~~
200m + pounds spent and our best player is a 19yr old. Says it all about him eh? It's a shame defenders are overlooked for ballon d'or awards because this man will be up there in a few years. Yes, I haven't seen potential like that in a 19yr old since C.Ronaldo - in the form of a full back of course.

1639~~~
He is quickly becoming one of my favourite players in the current team.

1640~~~
One of the best full back performances I've seen in a while. Had to handle his side almost alone, if he gets somebody to play off who's also in form that would be hard to stop.

1641~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1642~~~
Thankfully he didn't use the "don't you know who I am?" cliché. Each to their own, but a grown man going to watch the X Factor? I'd be grateful at not being allowed in, hopefully he went out elsewhere in London and had a great night. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Luke has been my MotM for the last two games. Looking like a great buy and showing some promising performances in defence and attack.

1643~~~
Shaw is only 19 remember!

1644~~~
I thought that after I typed it, but surely that's more reason for him not to go. The stick he will get for that Tweet at training. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1645~~~
Roy Keane isn't in the squad anymore, so I doubt there's any faux hardman nonsense.

1646~~~
Looks a quality player and is getting better with each performance especially going forward. My only worry is that he's 19 and will most likely play in all of our games from now till end of season if he's fit. 

With young players, it's important to rest them where we can but we don't have any back-up for him just makeshift LB's like Rojo and Blind. He's also playing for the England Under 21's at the moment rather than the senior side and he was pretty much a regular for Southampton. I just don't want to see him burned out at a young age.

1647~~~
I'm fairly sure I remember Wayne Rooney used to tweet about the xfactor all the time... so I'm sure he'll get sympathy. Who knows, maybe they're all huge One Direction fans in the OT dressing room?

Also, if I got turned away for being 5 minutes late to events in life, I'd never be allowed to watch/see/do anything ever.

1648~~~
Ferdinand loves X factor, and I remember RVP being at 1 last year. I have a feeling it'll be more than "accepted". It's just music at the end of the day, if you don't like it sure, but what's the big deal?.

1649~~~
He's one of those youngsters who seems to have absolutely everything needed in his position. He's rapid, has a useful cross, a very good tackler, he's good positionally and is a big strong lad. 

We're very lucky to have him.

1650~~~
Finally produced what he has done for Southampton - defended well, which he has done when he's started this season, but added some great work going forward. Played with some drive, which we desperately needed. More of the same Luke!

1651~~~
nice to see him having the guts to take on opposition players when attacking now, as the first few games he look nervous and took the simple option of passing the ball to whoever next or close to him.

as long as he continues working hard and stay injury free then he is going to be an amazing player for us. doesn't care about his love for x factor or his skinny jeans, as long as he follows the footsteps of irwin and evra, the 2 best LB i've seen live playing for united.

1652~~~
In case anyone didn't see the tweets it looks as though Nev might be doing a feature on him on MNF. Sky box set to "record".

1653~~~
Thanks for that mate. Will also set to record now. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1654~~~
Which ones? If you're on about Neville's reply to Luke, that is about England duty. Nev is with England now so won't be MNF today as there's no football.

1655~~~
Yeah, was just going to say the same. Just looked and obviously there is no game tonight so no MNF. All I can find is the "Premier League Review" on at 11pm on SS1

1656~~~
Balls. Got that one completely wrong so. Apologies all <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1657~~~
No worries <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1658~~~
Just limped off at the 65th minute after getting hammered in a clash 5 minutes earlier.. any money he'll be missing the weekend for feck sake.

1659~~~
I think he'll be fine - surely we can't be that unlucky...surely?!

1660~~~
I doubt he's injured. Probably a few bruises. He took a few hammerings. He's a tough little rogue. He had a solid game though. One of the best players on the pitch for me.

1661~~~
Injuries happen - it's football!

1662~~~
Limped off and got hammered? He looked tired when he came off but he walked off. There was no limp from what I could see. As for getting hammered in that tackle he got up pretty much straight away and looked fine afterwards.

1663~~~
I don't think its anything to do with luck any more, its an actual curse!   Could just be a dead leg, hopefully.

1664~~~
He's a United player so he'll definitely be out for 6 weeks at least.

1665~~~
Can't blame me for being over dramatic after the past four months surely <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> .. I didn't the clip of him getting back up after it but he definitely wasn't walking normally coming off.

1666~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ya I think we all fear the worst when a player goes down these days.

1667~~~
A few late challenges went in on him so he probably was limping. Didn't look in any pain though so I reckon he'll be fine.

1668~~~
Hodgson said he felt his groin was a bit tight, so they took him off as a precaution. Doesn't sound serious though.

1669~~~
He had a good game overall, Scotland clearly preferred targeting our right side.

1670~~~
It was unnerving to see him hacked down over and over again, but he looked ok to me when he went off.

Scotland were pretty dirty today, in a competitive game they'd've been looking at a lot more cards.

1671~~~
Doesn't sound serious yet. But wait until United's medical staff assess him. Probably a 6 weeker in the makings.

1672~~~
Stiff groin, he's done for a few weeks if he plays v Arsenal he will just get a groin pull anyways.    We are fecked this season.   LvG needs to have a talk wiht the players and get them to agree to sit out friendlies until the season is over.

1673~~~
1) I don't think Shaw's injury is serious

2) His next England match is in March

1674~~~
you are forgetting the luck we have, he will pull his groin getting out of bed in teh morning of some shit like that.

March is too soon.

1675~~~
Gonna be great.

Love him.

God I hope he's not too badly injured, that would actually be fecking ridiculous as if it isn't already.

Also lol at Liverpool fans for thinking their luck with injuries is ridiculous cause of Sturridges setback, yeah, try Mignolet, Moreno, Skrtl, Lovren, Sakho, Henderson, Borini, Sturridge and Balotelli all being out injured at once, week after week, then come and talk to us about injury problems.

1676~~~
On RoM they have the following quote:

And was asked if he'd be ready for Arsenal game said "<i>We will just have to see but I am hoping to be fit." 
</i>
Ridiculous if he chose to continue on his own - well not so ridiculous in that I am sure he wants to do well but, will be very irritated if he misses Saturday.

1677~~~
If that's true then they're idiots, the pair of them. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, however, because it really is seriously stupid to have a discussion about a hamstring strain, the same muscle the player pulled at the start of the season, then conclude that the only option in this friendly match is to risk it for a further 15 pointless minutes.

1678~~~
That's incredibly annoying but understandable, all the same.

I am so fecking sick and tired of injuries.

1679~~~
Nothing weird, the majority of the footballers do the same, and also in Shaw's situation, he has to prove himself at England, he has some competition with Gibbs and Baines.

1680~~~
It's brainless, but he's obviously got that youthful enthusiasm about him, and it's hard to blame such a young kid for not being wiser about his injury. The England management should be more responsible though for not being more precautionary. It was the same a number of weeks back when they kept Phil Jones on for an extra 10 minutes after getting an injury when he was clearly hobbling about.

1681~~~
The England management don't care whether he's fit for the next club game or not. This sort of shit will always happen. Nobody to blame but it's a pain in the hoop all the same.

1682~~~
I understand but, then again he'd probably prove himself a lot better playing well in a meaningful game against a top team rather than a friendly. More frustrated because if he could have come off earlier to reduce the possibility of missing the game - then that would have been the better decision overall. Not to mention the back has been chopped and changed so much, we very well could do without being forced to change again.

1683~~~
Shaw should have come off and Roy should have made him come off. Stupid to take a chance. Shaw should realize he will want to play against Arsenal too. Sometimes you have to be sensible. It's not like he's not going to win 100 caps. England give them out like a cheap date.

1684~~~
Jesus wept! Every fecking thread on the United forum seems to be a discussion about injured players. Who plays at left back if Shaw is out (given that Blind is also out)?

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's a fecking farce.

1685~~~
Rojo is out as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

James might get the nod or more likely Blackett

1686~~~
Blackett probably.

1687~~~
I understand he wanted to make an impression but it's absolutely ridiculous that he was allowed to continue after complaining of an injury. Hodgson and Shaw should've looked at the bigger picture instead of the second half in a fecking friendly.

1688~~~
Forgot about Blackett. At least he has games under his belt this season, so would be reasonably comfortable with him.

1689~~~
He'll be fine, as will Di Maria, comfortable 2-0 win for us.

1690~~~
After all the shit Sterling got, Luke was probably just trying to get the point across that the players do care about playing for England.

Although yes, he should have just come off.

1691~~~
Could be out for Saturday, kill me now.

1692~~~
Im still really hopeful that he'll play.. Otherwise we're fecked. The other players who can play left back are also conveniently injured.

1693~~~
His injury situation is outrageously stupid. Utterly pathetic decision-making from the pair of them, most notably the manager.

<i>"Ah, ok Luke, you're telling me the hamstring you injured earlier in the season is a little tight. I tell you what, play another 15 minutes for me and just try and strain it a little more."</i>

Imbeciles.

1694~~~
Blackett is healthy isn't he?

1695~~~
Knew he would be out for us, probably going to be a few weeks also.

1696~~~
Blackett isn't very good though, and I definitely wouldnt want him to play vs arsenal.

1697~~~
Late fitness test presumably or LvG would have just said he's out, he's not exactly pulled punches in regards to categorically ruling players out in previous press conferences.

1698~~~
Oh I definitely wouldn't either, Sanchez would tear him apart. Just thinking of the potential options.

1699~~~
The thought of Walcott or Chamberlain running at Blackett is frightening. It can't be overstated just how important Shaw is to our back line. He defends well, and we need as much of that as possible.

1700~~~
Out for a few weeks with a tight hammy? What would make you think that?

Late fitness test usually means the player is likely to make it, or if not he'd be very close to fitness.

I'm feeling very positive about this fixture, was more worried about Crystal Palace to be honest. People jumping on the injury excuse before a ball is even kicked is a bit weak.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/537696/Luke-Shaw-Man-Utd-Arsenal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/537696/Luke-Shaw-Man-Utd-Arsenal</a>

Luke certainly doesn't sound like a man who's feeling sorry for himself, I'm confident he'll play.

1701~~~
Hodgson the owl faced twat should know better than letting a teenager decide how long he plays in a match. How the feck he remains in the job is a mystery to me.

1702~~~
I was, given our record against Arsenal, but the latest round of injuries have somewhat dented by confidence.

1703~~~
Shaw was probably afraid he'd be thrown under the bus like Sterling was.

1704~~~
Not his perogative to worry about United. If it helps his relationship with Shaw to let him take some responsibility for a decision like that, then Hodgson's done what's best for England. Which <b>is</b> his perogative.

1705~~~
There is no way of spinning this one. If a player tells you he has a tight hamstring then you take him off. If this was a cup final, or a game of great importance, I could almost understand the need to leave a player on the pitch, but you don't leave a player on the pitch in a friendly. Even more so when the said injury is quite possibly a recurrence of a more recent one. 

Hodgson bears some responsibility here.

1706~~~
Hodgson is a plank.

1707~~~
He's also a young lad who's keen to impress so it's undestandble that he's been a bit naive about it. Hodgson on the other hand should've seen that there was no point in leaving him on, especially when Gibbs came on later anyway.

1708~~~
Even more reason to dislike Hodgson. Idiot.

1709~~~
Really dont fancy the likes of Blackett, James or Vermijl lining up against Sanchez (or Walcott) on that side is the thing.

1710~~~
He definitely bears responsibility. I just don't think he cares.

As far as he's concerned, he's avoided annoying Shaw by taking him off against his wishes, he's given him an extra half hour bedding into the England team and everything will be hunky dory by the time the next England game comes around. Job's a good 'un as far as he's concerned.

Obviously, I'm annoyed by what's happened but I think Hodgson made a sensible decision from the perspective of the job he's supposed to do.

1711~~~
Both Hodgson and Shaw are idiots. fecking hell

1712~~~
is he doubtful or definitely out for arsenal?

1713~~~
Doubtful. I reckon he'll play.

1714~~~
Confident he'll play. Everyone got themselves into a tizz about our internationals injuries, but only Blind's was ever actually serious.

1715~~~
Whether he ends up playing or not, the situation doesn't reflect well on Roy Hodgson and his England staff. National team managers love to moan that club managers put pressure on their players regarding internationals, but when complete stupidity like this situation with Shaw is going on, you can see why. 

I don't see any excuse for playing him after he complained that he felt the same hamstring that he had an injury in earlier this season. Allowing him to continue was an irresponsible decision. The risk was unnecessary. He's a youngster who should be nurtured and looked after, and it was a f*cking friendly.

1716~~~
It's so frustrating. If he plays I am confident we can beat Arsenal. If we have to play some youngster there (who doesn't have Shaw's quality) then I think we'll really struggle to get anything. Really hope he is fit.

1717~~~
What side does Sanchez play on? We could be fecked if Shaw is out.

1718~~~
Funny that we've bought 3 players who are comfortable to play at LB this summer and we'll end up playing Tyler fecking Blackett there.

Really sums up our season so far.

1719~~~
If he's a winger, he plays on the right, which means he'll face whatever left back/left central defender we put up. Recently, though, he's been playing in the middle behind Welbeck, so expect him to face our central defenders more. McNair's going to have a real test if he starts in central defence.

1720~~~
This. The manager is responsible for his player, especially a teenager. Hodgson fecked it up, again.

1721~~~
I was at the game and Shaw didn't look that bad. I'm sure he'll play, Welbeck looked more of a doubt if I'm honest. Shaw along with Smalling were excellent on the night.

1722~~~
Gulp

1723~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You've just got to laugh now.

1724~~~
Shaw hurt. No shock at all

1725~~~
Standard

1726~~~
Our most experienced defender on the pitch who also happens to be 19 years old gets injured and no one is surprised.

1727~~~
Our most experienced defender on pitch is Smalling BTW. These injuries have gone beyond ridiculous now though.

1728~~~
Listen, injuries are part and parcel of the game. Remember, Chelsea had Costa injured for a couple of games and now Nathan Ake is also out for them.

1729~~~
It was so obvious from the moment he first touched the ball that he wasn't right. Just like Herrera a few weeks ago.

Just when you think we've set the bar as high as humanly possible for complete and utter feckwittery, we go and outdo ourselves. Genius.

1730~~~
GIVE US A feckING BREAK

1731~~~
Didn't we check his glass to bone ratio when we signed him?

1732~~~
Something is seriously wrong with our medical staff. We buy players with decent injury records and make them injury prone.

1733~~~
What'cha talkin' 'bout? He went over on his ankle, nothing to do with what made him a doubt for the game.

1734~~~
That ankle will surely swell and I don't know how long it'll take for the swelling to disappear and the pain too.

1735~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How in anyway shape or form was this one their fault?

1736~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> *sigh*

Hopefully it's something and nothing, but going over on your ankle like that can go either way.

1737~~~
Apparently pictured leaving The Emirates in a moonboot.

Not good.

1738~~~
Really hope it's not serious. He's been great for us.

1739~~~
It is clearly not only bad luck that we get so many injuries. I think that in our desperation to field players we play them before they are 100% and then you are more likely to suffer setbacks on old injuries and new injuries. Combination of bad luck, injury prone players and high risk taking.

1740~~~
Yeah but this injury had nothing to do with that, it was a nasty challenge by Chamberlain, he'd also get injured if he was fit for 2 consecutive years.

1741~~~

1742~~~
He turned his ankle quite badly, nothing to do with being fragile like some of our other crocks, his injury fits into the same unlucky category as Blind's. We are utterly fecked at LB with all 3 options out.

1743~~~
He just landed akwardly, nothing to do with rushing him.

1744~~~
Isn't it just typical that we buy 3 players capable of playing at LB and they all get injured?

Really can't be doing with Blackett there again, would much prefer Young to be honest.

1745~~~
Hopefully just a sore/twisted ankle and no damage to the ligaments or anything like that.

1746~~~
We are going to play 3 at the back again when we have no leftbacks at the club anymore

1747~~~
Ah fair enough. I thought he went off clutching his hammy. He definitely didn't look at the races today mind.

1748~~~
Our injured players keep picking up new injuries. When will this madness end? Hope he get's back quickly because he's looked essential to our team.

1749~~~
I just don't understand why he played on. Same goes for Wilshere. It's pointless.

1750~~~
LOL.

He is a defender.
He plays for Man Utd.
It follows that this glass:bone ratio will be high.

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1751~~~
Jesus Christ. Looks like we will be seeing Young at left back next week then.

1752~~~
The moon boot is a standard precaution when needing to ice an area. Fingers crossed it's not too bad.

1753~~~
My post was making a point about our general problems with injuries. Not specifically this one. But the way a player coordinates his body and general fitness obviously have effects on the probability of suffering injuries. If you are not completely up to the tempo of the game you are also more likely to have challenges coming at you. Again talking generally and not trying to analyse this particular injury.

1754~~~
Confusingly I think we looked more solid with Young there instead of Luke.

He obviously wasn't right from the start of the game.

1755~~~
We probably have to sign a fullback during January. We need cover for both positions as well anyway.

1756~~~
Really really frustrating. While Young was solid today I don't think he can be as good with a back four unlike Shaw who is a natural. Hopefully the moonboot was precaution and it isn't too bad. Knowing our luck though I am expecting the worst possible scenario.

1757~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I've had a few to drink, but that made me laugh more than it should've!

1758~~~
Any update on the injury?

1759~~~
Id be very surprised if we saw him again this side of xmas

1760~~~
meh! another injury....Bring It On!

we can play with the academy back four and teams would still need 20+ chances to best De Gea <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1761~~~
Cheers doc.

1762~~~
Only one reason that a Defender thread gets bumped right?

Reports suggesting he could be out for 3 weeks...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/412262/Man-Utd-Luke-Shaw-Liverpool-Southampton" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/412262/Man-Utd-Luke-Shaw-Liverpool-Southampton</a>

1763~~~
Is there any way a mod can do a mass update on these "2014/2015" player threads to replace the word "performances" with "injuries"?  Just to avoid confusion like...

1764~~~
3 weeks isn't that bad I guess. As long as he's back for Liverpool.

1765~~~
Does his/Rojo/Blind absence mean 3-5-2 to continue?

1766~~~
Would expect so yes.  Unless he plays Blackett at left back.

1767~~~
Or stick with the guidance from <a class="username" data-user="1, @Niall" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/1/">@Niall</a> ages ago and burn these fecking mega-threads to the ground!

No reason at all we couldn't have had a thread about his injury in the Arsenal game, with subsequent updates in the same thread. That's the way redcafe used to roll and it was far more user-friendly.

1768~~~
You may be on to something, Pogue... are the Megathreads to blame for our preposterous injury record?!

1769~~~
Wouldn't surprise me..

1770~~~
What about having an injury thread for each player? Specifically related to injury and no talk on performance.  It's not as if they'd be empty.

1771~~~
With you on that Pogue, I was thinking the same after the Blind injury. There should be a thread to discuss it but it was being rolled into the performance mega thread, the injury crisis thread and others.

Perhaps another announcement is needed.

1772~~~
I'm in favour of specific threads for specific injuries. Blind busts his knee, make a new thread. 

He fractures his face later in the season, make a new thread for that too.

He cuts his hair, make a new thread.

You get the idea.

Smaller, more focussed discussions should be favoured over massive threads that span months and have multiple overlapping discussions.

1773~~~
Would be better, I reckon. Some of these player threads are just becoming catalogues of their bad performances, the ones which earn them a day or two of bitching before the thread disappears into the void for another two or three weeks.

1774~~~
I suppose that makes sense. If there's not already a Blind one, I'll go make one seeing as I'm a big fan of his.

1775~~~
God no.....

1776~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1779~~~
This could mean that we'll be sticking with 3-5-2 for a while longer.

1780~~~
Feckin disgrace this is.The likes of Rojo,Shaw and Blind were not injury prone before coming here and are now out for 6 weeks a piece.

Something has to be going wrong somewhere.This can't be coincidence.

1781~~~
more likely so. 

ready for more of valencia and young as wing backs now.

1782~~~
Lol at people going on about his medical and the physios and that.

He rolled his fecking ankle.

1783~~~

When is he returning from the injury?

1784~~~
Bet he plays Monday.

1785~~~
More importantly when will he stop wearing those skinny jeans?

1786~~~
He probably can't get them off.

1787~~~
Recent pic?

1788~~~
Buy him for the bones of 30m and don't pay him enough to afford a pair of pants that fit, or socks. 

What a world.

1789~~~
Yup from the Xmas party. He's also on Rooney's instagram pic.
He has a Ryan Gosling feel to it.

1790~~~
Shaw, I like you mate, but people that wear those jeans and those shoes without socks need to be taken out back and shot.

1791~~~
I have legs like Shaw's, skinny jeans just never ever work no matter how many times you try <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1792~~~
Great. Doubt he'll be back for Monday though. LvG usually demands that players train for a week before returning to football and we've not heard anything about Shaw going back to training yet.

1793~~~
What is so positive re his injury about that picture? Did people expect him to still be on crutches?

1794~~~
He may still be limping. Can't tell from a pic.

Atleast he is out of the protective boot.

1795~~~
Not so much that, just that there doesn't seem to be anything around the injured area.

1796~~~
Stop hating on skinny jeans you old farts.

1797~~~
It would be great if he was back for the Liverpool match. Young has done well in his absence but I wouldn't really fancy him up against Sterling or Lallana.

1798~~~
Ya true. He seemed in good spirits anyhow. Last I heard he won't be back until next year but it would be great to have him back for the Christmas programme.

1799~~~
This. Matalan warriors.

1800~~~
His legs are too muscular for those jeans to be fair, straight cut would suit him better <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Luke buddy, time to visit G-Star !

1801~~~
They're shit on blokes, they always were shit on blokes, they will always be shit on blokes.

1802~~~
Ya they really are awful.

1803~~~
Yo, speaking of that Xmas party, did anyone see Jesse Lingard's missus!? The body on her is just <i>damn</i>.

1804~~~
If we thought Shaw was bad have a look at what Anderson was wearing! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/pictures-manchester-united-stars-wags-8224111" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...pictures-manchester-united-stars-wags-8224111</a>

1805~~~
'kinell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1806~~~
He wears that jacket everywhere. His funds must be tied up in other expenses that he can't afford another outfit.

1807~~~
Yeah, but since he has little else to do now, Ando was just at an audition for a vampire movie.

1808~~~
I actually think Luke Shaw looks smart in what he's wearing. 

You caftards just ain't fashionable!

1809~~~
Hopefully we get an update today in LVG's presser.

Not a fan of the look for what it's worth. Stick to the blazer and shirt look and keep it smart.

1810~~~
Did Lingaard take his mum?

1811~~~
Anderson's clothes aren't half bad as Shaw's.

1812~~~
He's obviously been told that black is slimming (Ando, that is).

1813~~~
Sorry, does anyone know how much he earns per week (and is it with the signing on fee, or without).

1814~~~
Only rumours that he is on 100k/week. United usually doesn't make public the contracts of players, so it's mainly guesses from media.

1815~~~
From what i gather, he's actually on approx. £75k a week.  I would imagine he will have performance related bonuses though.

1816~~~
I read 50k a week, and that's credible when you compare to Jones or De Gea

1817~~~
Thx <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>.

1818~~~
Any injury update?

1819~~~
Also any fashion updates?

Has he decided to wear proper jeans now?

1820~~~
The Telegraph said the new year in an article today.

1821~~~
Bloody hell.. it couldn't have been that bad if he played on afterward? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1822~~~
Unless it's one of those injuries that looked not too bad at first, but has turned out to be a lot worse than initially expected.

1823~~~
Ya and judging on our luck he'll probably have to get both legs amputated.

1824~~~
He'd probably still be our best defensive player to be honest.

1825~~~
I think LvG likes giving players time to get back.
In the case of Rafael and Jones, they are only being considered for a return to the team two weeks after returning to training. Hence Rafa's return has been pushed to this weekend and Jones' to Christmas.
Shaw was always expected to be returning after Jones.
I hope we have Jones, Shaw and Blind available for at least one of the three games on 26/12, 28/12 and 1/1.

1826~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-expected-return-man-8330492" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 15px">Luke Shaw expected to return to Man United squad v Newcastle</span></a>

1827~~~
Hopefully he's 90 minute fit, such a beast of a player we'll look so much better defensively and offensively on the left side with him back.

1828~~~
ah, the Manchester Evening News, always good for United inside info.

1829~~~
But he should be really back......he's back in training since 1 1/2 weeks and the Newcastle match is 4 days away

1830~~~
This all came from the game where he went over on it and kept playing for a little bit right? I'm actually surprised it took him this long to return. Didn't look particularly bad to the untrained eye.

1831~~~
probably wouldn't start him until the FA Cup game now. Give him a couple of weeks training to get extra sure he's back.

Had a very stop start career so far with us.

1832~~~
Anybody else ifnd this a little odd:

<i>Marouane Fellaini was absent from the United first XI for the first time in two months at Villa Park but should also have recovered from his "illness" to be available for selection on Friday.</i>

What's with the quote marks... is there some dark secret we don't know about?

1833~~~
Yeah he gave Herrera the clap and they both had to go to the clinic on Saturday hence they couldn't play due to "illness"

1834~~~
Makes sense.  Though it mus surely have been crabs, with all that excess pubic hair?

1835~~~
It might be just sloppy writing, but it is kind of interesting..

1836~~~
I think it's in quotes because "illness" was the official explanation given by the club, rather than a specific diagnosis (influenza, heavy cold, gastroenteritis etc.)

1837~~~
That's probably it. Maybe the MEN journo resented not getting the full lowdown on what was wrong with Fellaini.

1838~~~
Aye, they do give the impression of being a petty enough bunch, football journos.

1839~~~
IMO the only reason we're missing him is that, with him, we'd most likely play 442. Young has been in fine form otherwise

1840~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-ace-fellaini-cleared-4851363" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-ace-fellaini-cleared-4851363</a>

1841~~~
Interesting

1842~~~
I'm impressed that they are now referring to him as "United Ace" as opposed to "flop".

1843~~~
What's Fellaini being found <b>not</b> drink and driving got to do with "illness" a week later?

1844~~~
I never knew someone could be "de-arrested".

1845~~~
Maybe he was driving while being sick, which lead the Police to think that he was under influence.

1846~~~
Yeah we've all been there.

1847~~~
Yes, it came up with that jogger who ran into David Cameron a few weeks back. It's basically an acknowledgment that no offence has been committed.

1848~~~
It is intriguing... not least that nobody noticed this article yesterday

1849~~~
Was thinking the same, with Rafael and Shaw back we'll probably play 4-4-2 again or so I hope.

1850~~~
Ashley Young on facebook - 
"En route to London with <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/lukeshawofficial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Luke Shaw</a>, hoping for another 3 points to end the year on a high"

1851~~~
So is he in the squad for tomorrow?

1852~~~
Yeah. He'll probably be on bench at best

1853~~~
Great news, thanks.

1854~~~
Great news, such a solid LB.

1855~~~
On current form though, I wouldn't pick him over Young.

1856~~~
Good to see him fit but I wouldn't start him against Spurs if we're still going with the 352.

I'd rather ease both him and Rafael back against Stoke and bring the diamond back.

1857~~~
He is in the travelling squad, doesn't necessarily mean he'll be in the 18.

1858~~~
Good news nonetheless.

1859~~~
But Young cant play lb, he is a wing back. The only reason we're playing 3 at the back is due to having no full backs available.
Dropping Young and Valencia would be a welcome development.

1860~~~
As a wingback, maybe, but as a left back, it has to be Shaw everyday of the week.

1861~~~
Why can't he? He played in a back four at LB (with Valencia at RB) against both Hull and Stoke. He did fine.

1862~~~
he can, but he isnt as good as Shaw there.

1863~~~
Just quoting Van Gaal, thats the reason he gave for playing wingbacks.

1864~~~
2 terrible teams though.

1865~~~
Hull are garbage but Stoke are decent. That was a tough game.

1866~~~
We were hugely dominant that game. 65% possession, just struggled to kill the game off. .

1867~~~
We had to clear two chances of there's off the line (Ashley Young at left back responsible for one of those blocks). They pressed hard for an equaliser in the last 5-10 minutes and had more shots on target than us. It was definitely a tough game, and they are a good side. They should have been 4 up against Arsenal a few weeks ago. They beat City at their place. They're far from terrible.

1868~~~
I thought Stoke were poor against us. Youngs average position was that of a left winger, and not of a left back. He had a good game to be fair, but i didn't think there was much of a test of his defensive abilities. LVG seemingly hasnt seen enough to be convinced either as i dont think he's played him in a back 4 since.

1869~~~
2 best left backs in the league. Who needs Azpilcueta, Kolarov and Baines when you've got these two? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1870~~~
Good to see him get some minutes under his belt, probably not ready for a start yet but could be pushed into it if we return to the diamond against Stoke.

1871~~~
I want to see him as lcb if we keep the 352 and see how he does. Young should not be dropped in this system, he's been one of our best players since november.

1872~~~
You want us to play him as a CB? No need for that whatsoever, he's a LB.

1873~~~
Needs to win his spot back from Young who has done brilliantly. Although if we go back to a back four then Shaw will probably get the nod.

1874~~~
How was he today?

1875~~~
He looked a bit rusty to me.

1876~~~
Hope he didnt get a new injury, heard sthing about that.

1877~~~
It didn't seem like it but you never know. Overall he clearly showed a lack of match sharpness, which is understandable.

1878~~~
Nah, LVG said it was a planned substitution. He was never going to be fit enough for 90 minutes so soon

1879~~~
Looked rusty but still quite good in my opinion. Some good runs and always alert.

1880~~~
He is not a Wingback.

1881~~~
He defended well and that's the main thing. Attacking will come but atleast he was solid which is what we need.

1882~~~
He's great. Just so solid and dependable.

1883~~~
Decent game, he is a bit overweight

1884~~~
Needs to stay fit now with Young out for a while, I know Rojo can play there but he looks better at CB.

I wonder if with all the CB now fit (Rojo close), & midfielders coming back whether we'll go back to a back four, espcially with Valencia, and now Young out.

1885~~~
I doubt it with his training regime. I was impressed with how strong he looked today versus Stoke's ogres.

1886~~~
He won more headers against Crouch than Evans managed!

1887~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Very good description. They all look like they belong in a Hammer film.

1888~~~
Fantastic player. He will be world class one day in the not too distant future.

1889~~~
A little rusty with his first touch but looked solid defensively in the first half. I agree with whoever said he's not a wingback though, he needs to be able to overlap to be an attacking threat.

1890~~~
I think that's an important addition, with proper instruction he'll do well there you'd have to assume.

1891~~~
I think that Shaw handles himself like a top player, he plays without fear. I feel that he needs to work on his crossing a bit. I would actually like to see him drive and shoot at goal a bit more often too. When he makes those Bale style powerful runs I feel that he is usually looking for a pass rather than going for glory,

1892~~~
I don't think so, a wingback needs a trick as a lot of the time he has to take on the opposite fullback, to me that is not in Shaw, he is a strong defensive FB with the overlapping pace and decent crossing ability to be a great LB, not a wingback.

1893~~~
I think he's class. Love watching him play, we need to start getting the ball to him more though when he gets himself free.

1894~~~
Exactly. So far, he has shown the attributes of a full back rather than a wing back. A wing back is supposed to be quicker and more tricky in their approach. From what I've seen, wing backs are quite good as dribblers, and Shaw doesn't have the quickness and dribbling ability of wing backs. His speed, defensive ability, and crossing is all good for a full back, but I think that, given that he's still a teenager, he has quite a lot of time to develop his attacking game to become a good wing back.

Having said that, I really get annoyed by the lack of support he gets whenever he receives the ball. Mata/Rooney are poor at supporting Shaw, whilst Evans rarely pushes up to help him out and offer him a good back-pass option. This is more of a team problem than that of Shaw.

1895~~~
Yeah. I actually think that we missed Young in that position today. He had been creating a fair few chances for us in recent game on the left.

1896~~~
Shaw is better at beating a man than you're giving him credit for, watching him at all last season would tell you he's got plenty about him going forward. If anything his weakness is his delivery at this stage, which might be a touch inconsistent for what's required of a wingback.

1897~~~
His first touch is quality too, as good as I seen on a full back. I first noticed it in pre-season and he had a couple of Mata-esque pieces of control today.

1898~~~
He's a very solid & reliable defender, but he needs to be more assertive going forward. Too often, he's afraid to take on his defender going forward, and putting in a cross. With the type of pace he has, he can be a lot more effective going forward, even if his actual dribbling and crossing skills are currently limited.

1899~~~
That's a good point about the lack of support he gets, we never seem to have a player offering the wingbacks an option for a give and go, the only player who did properly was Herrera but he hasn't played much since we started using this system week to week in the PL. 

I wasn't saying he is bad going forward, just to me he's a classic FB, he has the pace and power to run into the open space behind an opposite fullback on the overlap and to me his delivery is quite good, he rarely just hits it over and tries to pick out a player. I just don't see the dribbling side to him and in truth I really hope we don't need to find out as the sooner we go back to a back 4 the better IMO.

1900~~~
He's terrible on the ball. I don't know what games people watch to be honest. He really needs to work on that a lot because it's just not up to standard.

He gets free into good positions but there's no threat because he'll just play an aimless ball or give it back to the opposition. At United as a fullback or wing back you're going to be expected to know how to attack.

Defensively he was ok today. Doesn't look overweight to me but probably spent most of the game worrying about what the rain was doing to his stupid ubergelled hair.

1901~~~
I thought he played decent today. Gave away a few cheap passes and was quite relucant on going forward but defended really well

1902~~~
Just found out he went off injured <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jesus Christ. This season...

1903~~~
No he didn't?

1904~~~
Defenders are in the team to defend - cue some jumped up moron telling me about the modern day football environment - and he does that. He does that very well.

Not a wing back in the slightest, however. Play him left back in a formation that actually benefits the team and we'll see the best of him.

1905~~~
Young, you mean?

1906~~~
No the sub was planned, he's not ready for 90 minutes.

1907~~~
Not true according to Van Gaal

"Luke Shaw's substitution was planned. No problem with him, he's okay. But he needs playing time."

1908~~~
He was my MOTM today. Glad he is back, missed his directness.

1909~~~
He did as well as we could expect after a long layoff. His crossing was ineffective, though.

1910~~~
The stupid hairdo is a valid criticism, but the rest is way off.

Shaw was a bit rusty v Stoke -- fully expected -- but has been very solid for us this season since he was released from Louis's doghouse.  

The problem you've identifed, noodle, is actually a function of the absence of a proper midfielder to partner with Carrick.  Shaw has been in and out this season like many others but he hasn't had a natural attacking midfielder to work with on his advanced play.  He's forced to make solo runs and that's really not his game. He's no Gareth Bale going forward and maybe not even a Patrice Evra.  He's useful going forward, but by himself he's not a mortal threat. But give him someone to work eith up front beside Rooney and he'll give us good service.

1911~~~
He's not terrible on the ball. If you'd seen him for Southampton you'd know that. He's just not used to playing as wingback and being the main wide threat as opposed to overlapping and cutting in when you have a wide player to work with who makes space for you. He was class for Southampton at both ends. Of course he doesnt have Evra's level of ability on the ball but few do. The likes of Asspilldavidguetta who are hailed as top fullbacks arent like Evra one on one against defenders either.

1912~~~
I think defensively is very good. 

Have to agree with observation on his ability on the ball. It's poor and needs massive improvement.

1913~~~
noodle <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1914~~~
I think he's been dodgy defensively and poor going forwards. Yesterday was probably his best defensive performance. In other games he's cost us goals or given away stupid penalties, and each time it's because he hasn't been paying attention or has been caught ball watching. He hasn't really done anything for me to think "yeah, he's good"...though obviously at his age you can't demand that right away and have to expect there'll be limitations and errors.

You make an interesting point with the bit about him having no adequate support and it probably is a big factor when he's on the ball. There were loads of times yesterday that he was left with no pass to play at all unless he beat a defender first, which is an ineffective situation to leave any player in, let alone a defender.

I did watch him at Southampton. Why does everyone on here (a football forum) presume they're the only one who watches football?

I agree he's not used to playing as a lone wide player, but, that's what he is being played as, so it's what he needs to be effective as. When he's been played in a back four for us he's been in the same situation and has also looked suspect defensively.

He needs to improve on the ball significantly. He has time to do it. It looks like a confidence/composure thing as much as anything to me. There's times when he's left with no support or out ball, which is the fault of the system, but then there's other times (including a number yesterday) where he gets into a position to play a ball, and doesn't, or plays it really badly.

I didn't think he was nearly as amazing at Southampton as people on here seem to like to pretend. I was confused at the time what the fuss was about. He looked like a promising young player rather than the messiah. He just seems to be another of these players where it'll take months of obviousness for people to begin to admit any limitations.

1915~~~
Such a good defender and also brilliant on the ball with his first touch and short passing. His crossing and final ball could still be a lot better though

1916~~~
Thought Shaw was cutting back far too much still, this is in line with LVG's possession theory so he may be pleased with him. But as a WB he is also our main wide threat and he gets the ball in good positions and first half especially spent 90% of the time cutting back and passing to Carrick or Evans which allowed Stoke time to get back into position and then easily clear their lines! 

This was my thoughts on Shaw earlier in the year, I just want him to use his ability and running power to get into attacking positions, but maybe he isnt confident enough yet after injury to do so. Nice to see him back hoping he shows his full potential here, just needs the confidence to push on in my opinion.

1917~~~
I don't think he is 'bad on ball.' He is less threatening in attack than say Evra, Shaw's 1 assist only at Southampton suggests that, but he is not 'bad on ball.' Carrying the ball deep into opposition half, control, making quick runs, these abilities he has displayed satisfactorily but his final ball hasn't been up to the mark. I am happy that we have a LB who is good and solid at defense because that is their primary responsibility. Yes if he plays wing back we need more from him in attacking sense, but for that he needs to improve on his final ball/cross etc. On the ball skills are decent to good.

1918~~~
He's a very, very good full-back. All that 'potential' talk is another conversation entirely, largely due to his age as opposed to his flaws. He's very good now.

I believe he's best in a back four though. Tbh, I don't like the back 3 at all anyway. It is essentially a formation for a supposed top-level team that competes with the likes of Ribery, Hazard, Bale with Young and Valencia, or Rafael and Shaw. Our wing-backs have regularly gotten into good positions for actual wingers, and there lack of talent has cost us in that area. We have basically reverted back to a set-up that many of us spoke loudly against which is Young and Valencia as our first-choice wingers.

I don't think it's good enough for us.

1919~~~
Can't believe someone thinks he's dodgy defensively and poor going forwards. You'd swear be bought a dud going by that. Yet I actually rate the lad. Had a slow start with us, but been getting better and better - then got injured. 

Was actually very good vs Stoke.

1920~~~
I'm not having the "bad on the ball" criticism of Shaw.  We're judging him against the extremely high standard set by Evra, which may be fair, but I'd like to see how Evra played at the age of 19.  Give Shaw a solid 6 game run and I have no doubt he'll exceed his outstanding form of last season and these questions about his attacking will evaporate.

Like everyone else on the squad, Shaw can definitely improve his game, but what I don't necessarily want to see is Shaw just bombing forward and whipping in crosses regardless of whether anyone is there to receive the cross.  We did way too much of that last season and even though we have Falcao now I just don't see RvP, Rooney and Falcao as the kind of strikers who are more effective heading the ball off a cross than receiving a final ball through the channels at the feet.  We have to do both, but definitely not one to the exclusion of the other.

1921~~~
hes a big solid lad, I wonder how he'd be at CB

1922~~~
I think you must have got the answer yesterday when he ended up marking a center forward on a corner. He's a very poor leaper even compared to someone like Evra.

1923~~~
"Terrible on the ball." What nonsense. Shaw is fantastic. The quicker we revert back to a normal back four the quicker we will reap the benefits of his clearly obvious talents.

More than anything I just like the fact that he can defend. I expect our defenders to defend well, believe it or not, and the guy does that better than any other player on our books.

1924~~~
when Evra first joined United he was awful in the air, he was constantly targeted by other teams. However, he somehow learnt. Shaw can too. Maybe he can get his hair to harden a bit more with extra gel and use it to grow his head a few inches?

Its how Felliani gets by, he's actually only 4ft 2 but his hair is 7ft 9

1925~~~
He really is fairly useless as a wingback. He has nowhere near enough going forward to play that position.

1926~~~
He's just too content for his dribble into the middle to end with a pass backwards or his cross to end in a corner

1927~~~
Needs to work on his right foot, cut inside a lot but ends up passing back because he's not confident with his right foot.

1928~~~
Doesn't look three times the price of Ben Davies. His concentration levels in possession are quite poor.

Seems to lack Bale's attitude for greatness yet; required to make sure he doesn't repeat Nick Powell's mistakes, with so much that can go wrong for a player that age if they get sloppy.

Passing really poor and lacking focus this half. Crossing straight into the full back time and again. Miscontrolling the ball way too often. Has to be as diligent with the ball as without.

1929~~~
He is simply not a wingback.

1930~~~
He keeps making inward runs, then runs into crowd and can't bring his right foot into play so just back passes or side passes to someone. Will be better if sticks wide more until he develops his right foot.

1931~~~
What is this nonsense? Hasn't got the attitude of Bale? Remember Bale at 19? 

Get a grip.

1932~~~
Yep, simple as that for me.

1933~~~
He's been alright, just needs to stay wide rather than cut in every time he goes forward.

1934~~~
Absolute bollocks.

He's just back from injury and it's showing. He's already a good player though and is going to be class, so I see why you'd be bitter about it.

1935~~~
He was crap today. We've seen he's a better player than this though. When he's not playing this woeful fecking formation, for starters.

1936~~~
Jesus, you won't last long on here with that kind of WUMing. A couple of Spurs wins and you think you can come on here and talk crap.

1937~~~
He is going to be fine. Just needs a few matches under his belt and to get a full understanding of this 3-5-2 bullshit.

Play him as a proper left back and watch him thrive. He has bags of pace which we need to utilize more. However, in this wingback nonsense its clear he doesn't know whether to commit to getting forwards as there is nobody in front of him to overlap.

1938~~~
very true.

1939~~~
So him and Rafa have gone off.

1940~~~
But him and Rafael need to play well for this formation to work.

1941~~~
They need to play well for any formation to work.

1942~~~
I like him; he's fast, strong, doesn't shy away from a tackle and is <span style="text-decoration: underline">very</span> solid in defense. Needs to work on his attacking though.

1943~~~
true, but 352 makes even more demands on them than 442/433 does. However they are demands they both should be capable of meeting.

1944~~~
It is a formation that does not really suit their strengths as players.

1945~~~
Shaw and Rafael are both capable of being attacking threats.

1946~~~
As Fulbacks not as Wingbacks.

1947~~~
The same Ben Davies that couldn't even get a game in the first half of the season? Give me a break.

1948~~~
Am I the only one find it weird that Blackett was preferred over him when we switch to a back four?

1949~~~
Injured again apparently. Worrying to be honest.

1950~~~
Oh god we have cursed him.

1951~~~
Jesus what the hell is wrong with our players.

1952~~~
He's caught the disease.

1953~~~
They're injured.

1954~~~
Soft as shit.

1955~~~
Perhaps it was the head injury he sustained in the first half, he does appear to be soft as shite though, like sick note da Silva.

1956~~~
They're cursed. We should start buying up all the horse placenta we can get our hands on and start sacrificing goats to every god going.

1957~~~
Think it was just the head collision he had earlier, seemed a bit dazed all half. Hopefully not a muscle injury or anything like that.

1958~~~
Played 35 league games last season. It's definitely something going wrong from our end in terms of training/whatever. Can't be a coincidence.

1959~~~
Shaw's injury record was fine last season

1960~~~
Please read a couple of my posts and you'll see I'm really not here to wind people up. This just happens to be one of the most reasonable, active and intelligence forums I've read (did so for a year or two before deciding to join). I've written very considered stuff in every post and most of what I've written has been on general football topics. Don't judge a poster off about 0.0001 of the time I've put into watching Luke Shaw's game, with a dad who supports Southampton and watching well over 20 of his matches. 

The Nick Powell comparison is too harsh and early I'll admit (looked bad reading back) so apologies if that got anyone's back up, but I don't think it can be underestimated how driven Gareth Bale was and how much you need to be to get to Alaba level. I hate the assumption that a talented 19 year is "position sorted for the next 10 to 15 years" before they've proven any consistency or sustained ability to improve. If sustained success and professionalism was that easy, we wouldn't praise players so effusively when they achieve it.

Shaw only makes it on matching Bale's diligence, fitness and focus levels and Bale had less hype, early money, didn't drink, had a solid relationship and is generally quite boring (professional) as far as footballers go. Davies is another who's extremely hard working and down to earth; very focused and regimented, with the ball and without and a really talented player in his own right. Would personally prefer a less talented (though there's not much in it) but super focused and undistracted player than a guy being offered the world at his feet and playing sloppy passes and weak crosses.

Today he had loads of passes that were metres short or wide of their intended targets. Not taking his time, playing balls without thinking and taking silly chances with what should have been basic routine ball retention. In some ways it highlighted a player thinking bigger than his feet can yet deliver, which is a good sign of potential growth, but there's a fine line between ambition and repeated underdeliverance with the ball.

Also a number of crosses straight at a stationary full back, rather than a dribble or sidestep to improve the angles. Either happy taking corners or just not doing the effective things, though on this you can bring up the fitness issues as he didn't reappear in the second half and there's talk of him being hurt with an ankle problem. It's basic wing play though, which Blackett did in the second half, despite being way less talented. 

<b>Been very impressed with his defending, which has genuine quality about it, but he lets himself down when he switches off with the ball at his feet, especially in a possession team. It's like he plays off instinct with the ball and off learned and rehearsed skills and hard work without it. One aspect very good and the other quite weak and done too much on the fly. </b>

Apologies again the Powell comparison because it's unfair to say so, but he is there as the cautionary lesson and it'll still take a lot of hard work for this transfer to work even now. Will stick to game by game performances reaction now, don't worry, essentially the middle section of this rather long-winded reply. Not looking for arguments, quite the opposite, just thought he was one of your weaker and most lax performers today in quite a disappointing performance until Herrera's screamer.

1961~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">@DTguardian: Louis van Gaal here in press conference says Rafael da Silva has a fractured cheekbone and Luke Shaw has ankle injury #mufc</span>

1962~~~
Well it's been shite this season. Dreadful.

1963~~~
What? Is there a source? We are cursed! I thought that him and Rafael were supposed to have only 45 minutes of football today.

1964~~~
Jesus fecking christ. That's demented.

1965~~~
How the feck has he fractured his cheekbone?!

1966~~~
Feck. Neither of those sound like minor knocks.

1967~~~
Aaaaaand again his ankle. feck off honestly.

1968~~~

1969~~~
He took a smack when making a far post clearance in the first half.

1970~~~
The guy certainly has all the talent just now needs some of the luck, terrible run of injuries.

1971~~~
Once again he started 35 league matches last season.

1972~~~
I'd probably injure my own ankle if I was told to play in that joke of a formation, too.

1973~~~
injured ankle? which one? the same one that he had injured against arsenal.
i guess we will have to wait and depend on rojo and blind to take that LB spot now.
Quite sad, Shaw, had looked quite good whenever he played for us. A solid solution at LB who had a classy touch on the ball.

1974~~~
Either we have players that's made from glass or we've the worst luck going.

1975~~~
Feck sake, I wonder if some of the rust on Shaw stuck in his ankle, unless he was injured from minute one.

1976~~~
i thought so <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1977~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1978~~~
How many games did Rafael play in during his one great season?

This is becoming worrying, and very frustrating, with Shaw.

1979~~~
Thanks. I can't fecking believe it <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1980~~~
This is absurd. I'm starting to worry that Southampton overplayed him last season now, a bit like Arse did with Wilshere at first.

1981~~~
Well they did not play in Europe and it looks like they did not play him that much in cups. 38 appearances total for him last season.

1982~~~
38 games is quite a lot for an 18 year old.

Maybe I'm just trying to find excuses for all this nonsense!

1983~~~
We have 4 players who can play Left back/wingback Shaw, Young, Rojo and Blind and they are all injured. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1984~~~
3-5-2 continues then noooooooooooooooooooo <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1985~~~
I'm quite sure Evra did some voodoo shite while he was here. All our defensive injuries over the years are consequences of the cast off dark energies from Evra's injury immunity.

1986~~~
He played ~ once a week. Definitely wasn't overplayed IMO.

I think there's something massively going wrong at the back. Who hasn't suffered an injury so far this season? Van Persie? Rooney? De Gea? That's about it no? Everyone else has been dropping like flies.

1987~~~
There needs to be a serious review of our injury recovery practices and training programs. 

This simply cannot go on.

1988~~~
Get an injection in him and play on. Sick of these pussies in our team.

1989~~~
RB/RWB too. Rafael, Valencia, Young all inured.

No idea who is going to play full back or wing back against Southampton. They have a lot of pace outwide. They could tear us apart.

1990~~~
Jesus fecking christ.. we finally get our two fullbacks  back to change to a back 4 and they get fecking injured? What the feck are we doing wrong as a club?

1991~~~
Pussies. Pure and simple

1992~~~
Hope it was just precaution why he was taken off, maybe just a bit of discomfort. 

Rafa did get head-butted though.

1993~~~
I'd be tempted to write Luke Shaw's season off and make sure that he's fully recovered for next season. We don't want a Jack Wilshire situation on our hands. Its extremely frustrating because he's a really exciting player, but we need to be protecting his future. You don't mess about with ankle injuries.

1994~~~
This.

Ha.

1995~~~
I've only just noticed Rafael got injured followed by Shaw about 10 minutes later. There was me watching the rest of the game in ignorant bliss. Hopefully this is more of a knock than an injury. Otherwise we have a serious full back problem for Southampton.

1996~~~
How? Young and Valencia are out too, no?

1997~~~
How did Shaw get injured? I didn't notice anything.

1998~~~
I'm confused by what I'm hearing about this injury, LVG was supposed to have said Shaw had an ankle problem but yet the quotes I found he said Rafael was brave to play on with an injured cheek bone and Shaw came off because was not 100% fit (match fitness) so which is it?

1999~~~
Who will play as fullbacks or wingbacks vs Soton..

2000~~~
I saw that quote too. So is he injured or wasnt 100 percent fit. I hope its the second.

2001~~~
Blackett and Janko? Jesus bare bones stuff.

2002~~~
The latter seems more believable which would mean both are likely to start against Southampton. (If Rafael plays with a mask or injection)

2003~~~
Yeah, Rafael could really start with that mask. But I fear for another 3-5-2 unfortunately even if both start.

2004~~~
Jones and Smalling can both play right back. Need to not play three central defenders though (although that's true, in general!)

2005~~~
Back to Smalling or Jones on the right? Though you'd think Rafael might want to play through a cheekbone issue (never having had one, have no idea how doable that is).

2006~~~
I imagine a facial fracture like that takes 4 weeks or so to heal completely. The swelling goes down after a week, so I see no reason why he couldn't play if it's only a light fracture. He could wear a guard over it, like Hannibal Lecter!

2007~~~
If this could be the injury to force us to play with 4 at the back, I'm calling it a blessing in disguise.

2008~~~
How? It could be the injury cause of which we'll again play 3-5-2.

2009~~~
If Young, Valencia, Rafael and Shaw are all injured, I'd guess he'd play 4 at the back with maybe Jones at RB and Blackett at LB. Don't see how you could play 352 with those 4 wing back options injured?

Edit - Plus he switched to 4 at the back when he took them both off, which is a good sign he'll continue with 4 at the back if they aren't fit for Southampton.

2010~~~
Yeah when you put it that way, it makes sense. Rafael will probably or should start. Dont know whats the problem with Shaw yet.

Although it wouldnt surprise me if we'd start with Adnan as a wingback. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2011~~~
Rather have Pat here. At least he stayed fit.

2012~~~
This guy didn't sneeze while at Southampton, comes to United now he can't stay fit for more than 2 games. Incredible.

2013~~~
I think he's referring to both. Ankle problem and not being 100%

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Jan/Rafael-and-Luke-Shaw-injured-at-Yeovil.aspx?newsid=D7ACC12B-34C1-40A7-BAFA-CC504E2EF599" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...x?newsid=D7ACC12B-34C1-40A7-BAFA-CC504E2EF599</a>

2014~~~
I'm hoping that means it's just a lack of fitness then.

2015~~~
That makes it sound more like LVG's message has been lost in translation. This bit in particular sounds promising:
Hopefully the ankle problem he refers to was the injury he was recovering from... Maybe?

2016~~~
Yup, LVG didnt mention an injury so there's hope.

2017~~~
After seeing there is "Chris Smalling and Phil JOnes injured at the same time thread". I htink we should have Rafael and Shaw injured at the same time thread as well. This is bloody ridiculous. I just hope that we will give a chance to Lingard at least not playing Jones or whoever as fullback or even wingback..

2018~~~
Yeah back four with Smalling and Blackett as fullbacks I call it aiuaofhwuedjtcycowothing

2019~~~
Nah. Evra was struggling in his last few seasons. Some times when he played it was like having 10 men on the pitch as he couldn't defend if his life defended on it.

2020~~~
Yeah, that makes sense<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2021~~~
Evra was well past it in his final 2 seasons.

2022~~~
At least he stayed fit.

Shaw so far is soft.

2023~~~
Get over it and help us.

2024~~~
What?

2025~~~
See also Ashley Young and Marouane Fellaini.

2026~~~
We should never have allowed him to leave.
He thought that Shaw was going to monopolise the LB position. LvG shouldve explained that Shaw would get injured and Evra would get playing time.
The funny thing is that if Evra was still here, he'd be our most experienced and most played defender (as he is not made of glass).
At present, the only requirement to play is, "are you injured?" If "no", you are playing.

2027~~~
Before Moyes arrived, we won the league by 9 points, so he couldn't have been so bad.
And under Moyes all our players regressed (Januzaj, De Gea, excepted).
Evra could do a job for us.

2028~~~
On MOTD he was very clear "Rafael got injured and Shaw got injured".

2029~~~
We have two other guys who can play LB. They also happen to be injured.

2030~~~
Jamie Jackson from the Guardian is reporting that Shaw should be fit to face Southampton as his ankle injury isn't as bad as first feared.

Would be a big boost if it's true.

2031~~~
Oh, please be true. I can't keep watching this turgid 3-5-2 nonsense week after week.

2032~~~
I'm sure you don't need reminding but he started the last game we played 352.

2033~~~
Really is a shame we couldn't convince Evra to stay 1 more year as he and Shaw could have worked together and covered eachother nicely. Glad he is back though, defensively he is superb.

2034~~~
That would be brilliant, if true.

2035~~~
True. Though with Young, Valencia and Rafa still out wouldn't van Gaal pretty be forced to use four at the back? Jones at RB and Shaw at LB?

2036~~~
I said that at the time, but I didn't expect Evra to have been as useful as he would have been. If only he'd known how much game time he would have got... And hopefully it would have been enough to keep him fresher for each game, rather than the tired performances he was showing playing week in week out for us.

2037~~~
That's Shaw out for the season then. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2038~~~
Good, plus Rafael should be able play with a mask. He's a touch little cookie.

2039~~~
Evra was the biggest loss of the summer in my opinion.

2040~~~
With the way Young has come on this season have we really missed him at all? Perhaps in those early games when it was Blackett or Rojo playing there but when it's been either Shaw or Young I've never thought that position has been much of a problem. Suppose there is a case to be made of the back line lacking a leader and the effect he would have in the dressing room though.

2041~~~
I think Young has stepped up and done really well, but he has rarely been challenged defensively so far that I can think of, I just think Evra would have been perfect for that wingback role also. He loved bombing on and with the knowledge of having cover behind he could have been even more effective.

2042~~~
I assumed we may have kept 4 at the back if we'd had fit full back options, but perhaps LVG would have used 352 regardless.

2043~~~
It's hard to know what LVG thinks at times. He came out and said our lack of full backs was the reason for 3-5-2 yet with both Shaw and Rafael fit and against weaker opposition we still played with 3 at the back.

2044~~~
Pictures on Facebook of him training with the rest of the team today so hopefully he'll be fit for Sunday.

2045~~~
Its very possible he didn't expect either of them to complete 90 minutes though, we'll find out in the coming weeks.

2046~~~
If that was the case then we could have started with four at the back and then switched formations when they came off. As it turned out he did the opposite.

2047~~~
Not really no, it would have handicapped him if we were chasing the game, as he would have had to sub in 2 defenders to switch back to 352. Again I'm only speculating but we'll know more in the coming weeks.

2048~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/xr6oMMCDHP/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

2049~~~
Did he miss the last Southampton match?

2050~~~
Yup. Ashley Young played in his place.

2051~~~
He is seriously poor in attack as a wingback, even in some simple stuff as passing. I hope he will improve attacking wise when we move him back to fullback because he'll need to.

2052~~~
Yeah, I don't think he suits the role. Full-backs spend all their time practising overlapping runs and quick crosses. Very few full-backs are capable of beating a man when they have the flank to themselves. We've seen the same with Rafael who is extremely dangerous when overlapping but not a threat at all as wing-back.

2053~~~
Doesn't really have any support out there.

2054~~~
Great cross the one that skimmed off Van Persie's head and fell for Valencia.

Overrun the ball a few times. Doesn't seem to trust himself beating his man and crossing, prefers to cross with the defender still infront of him, so he has time to set himself.

Kept Clyne quiet pretty well.

2055~~~
Mata needs to come down on the left and help him. He has no options in front of him. He's not Valencia, who can beat a man.

2056~~~
We miss Ashley Young. 

6 months ago I never thought I'd say that.

2057~~~
I hope he can go onto be a terrific fullback for us for a long time but I can't really understand where the £30 million and reportedly huge wages came from. For that money you would expect a young fullback who is really exciting going forward but still a bit green defensively. At the moment he looks quite strong in one on ones defensively but really quite limited on the ball. This system clearly doesn't suit him given he's expected to produce all of the threat down the left hand side and he needs a lot of refining offensively.

2058~~~
I'd love to see him get a chance to play as a LB with a wide attacker in front of him to overlap, he is not a wingback.

2059~~~
Defensively he's showed some good things, though he's also been sloppy at times. Obviously difficult to settle into a new side, that keeps changing and repeatedly coming back from injury. But I've yet to see anything promising in an attacking sense from him. Doesn't really fancy taking his man on and seems quite one-sided.

2060~~~
In his shell.

2061~~~
Maybe that's it really. Would also love to see 4 at the back, with more space for the attacking players to run into.

2062~~~
A 19 year old fullback who is defensively strong is a very rare trait. Normally, as you say, they are exciting going forward but weak defensively like a young Rafael. To be fair to Shaw he is a LB not a LWB and still finding his feet in a new team after some injuries.  With a good LW ahead of him I think it would suit his game better

2063~~~
He's looking for the link up, but no one is helping him. Needs a runner around him to give him an option other than the pass back. Not like Clyne is an easy guy to get around to pump in a cross (to no one might I add).

2064~~~
Offers zilch going forward at the moment. We'd be better off with Young there for a year or two while Shaw develops more of a rounded attacking game. He's probably only ever really learnt the overlap which he doesn't get much chance to do in this system.

2065~~~
Evra would have been useful, or dare I say it, Young...

2066~~~
He's not an attacking full back is he?

2067~~~
This. Ask him to be the only outlet on that side and he's gonna struggle but put him with a winger ahead of him to link up with and he's more than adequate in an attacking sense.

2068~~~
He's not a wingback. Defensively he's very good for someone so young.

2069~~~
He's rubbish going forward, at least on any showing so far this season.

2070~~~
You're too fat!!! Do you think you can just come back after the summer as if you were Eric Cantona?? Get in the gym and start working or find yourself being shipped out of the club in the summer you big baby. Can't stand players like you!!!!

2071~~~
I am almost 100% sure Luke Shaw is not reading this.

2072~~~
what

2073~~~
He's not a wingback. It's been pointed out for a long time now. He's been excellent in his proper position. Another reason why I don't like the 352 with our players.

2074~~~
Exactly look at Chelsea's two LBs. They are both good but, if you used them as wingbacks they would probably struggle. Shaw is a good defender already but, this system puts too much of an attacking onus on him.

2075~~~
His block on Pelle was fantastic, but Blind's crossing is different level to him.

2076~~~
I like Shaw but he can't play this 352. I mean what do you expect him to do when he's 45 yards from goal with no support. Beat two men and put a cross/shot in? Not going to happen. Needs a winger he can overlap.

2077~~~
He's a very solid player but offers nothing going forward at all. If we're sticking with this 3-5-2 nonsense it should be Young or Blind playing there.

2078~~~
Great defender, average in going forward. back 4 suits him so much better.

2079~~~
Is he hurt? Commentator said he was hobbling when he came off.

Feel bad for him that not only does he have to adapt to a new club, but also a new position as a wingback in a horrid formation.

He was excellent in a four man backline and would probably provide more danger on the left flank if he had a winger to play off.

2080~~~
Haven't seen someone so young be such a rock defensively but he's not got much going forward at all. That can be rectified as he ages. I feel very assured when he's on the pitch.

2081~~~
Most players who spend their careers playing as a left back with a wide man in front would struggle to adapt to a system where you're the sole wide-man on your side. 

Evra always looked good because he had someone to link up with, whether it was Ronaldo, Nani, Giggs or even Ashley bloody Young. Overlapping is such an underrated attacking tool.

2082~~~
I would gamble quite confidently, that he's in much better shape than you, and is about as close to being "fat" as you are close to being a sensible poster.

ie not very.

2083~~~
He's not a wing back, he did well when we played with wingers and even in the diamond. He's not the one who can play on the left on his own though. He's class defensively but needs a lot of work on the ball going forwards.

2084~~~
really going to have to work to be the answer in a 3-5-2, but more alarmingly is how few times he finishes a game.

is it bad luck, or something we're doing, as he never had this problem at Southampton

2085~~~
Baines and Neville would struggle in this formation. Both defenders who rely on overlapping to get their crosses in.

Don't know what people want Shaw to do when he's literally got no support.

2086~~~
He was excellent but his crossing and finishing were still very average, so this lack of attacking presence isn't a new thing. Clyne's a much better attacking full back.

2087~~~
<img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/><img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/><img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/>

2088~~~
Then we need to buy a couple of proper wingers instead of trying to get players to play in a way they aren't capable. He will ruin them all before he has finished.

2089~~~
Is it just the formation or is he really not <i>that</i> good going forward? I've been very impressed by his defensive duties, but not much going forward. A lot of times, he doesn't seem to know what to do with the ball when in the opponent's half. Not to mention, most of his crosses are wayward. I'd expect fullbacks at United to be equally good in the attacking sense.

2090~~~
That's why he needs a good winger in front of him, we are asking too much of him attacking wise. If that is what we want from him we should have bought somebody else.

2091~~~
I always saw Shaw as a LB playing in traditional back 4, with a winger in front of him playing the give and go.

2092~~~
But that's no excuse for his wayward passes and crosses. Maybe I'm forgetting something, but I still haven't seen him assist once with a good cross, despite getting into crossing positions a lot of times.

2093~~~
Watching him at wing back reminds me a bit of when Evra was playing on the wing. Overlapping a winger is much easier than actually having to beat a man. 

He's a full back, not a wing back.

2094~~~
He's probably not 100% match-fit

And i don't blame him.....he isn't a wing-back (Rafael will look bad as wing-back too)

2095~~~
Formation didn't suit him, was almost certain nothing would happen when the ball went to Shaw, didn't look like having the beating of his defender even once. Young has had some success recently because he would try and take his man on, and Valencia did the same yesterday, Shaw didn't look capable at all but hopefully its down to fitness and sharpness. I thought Blind was actually better in that left wing back position.

2096~~~
Whats everyones opinion on him so far.

Obviously he is young. But big price tag and for me has a fair amount of improving to do to live up to that kind of value. 

My biggest problems with him are in attack, which the modern day full back (And definitely wing back) need to be good at, the fact he nearly always cuts back is too frustrating I find it hard watching him when he gets the ball in a decent position and just cuts back and passes backwards to a CM or CB. Its infuriating. My other issue is how bad his crossing is. Im not sure he's put in a single ball that has beaten the first man or found his target. Really bad. 

Want him to do well though so hopefully it clicks. He was so highly regarded at Saints and by all coaches etc so he must have something, and clearly he's young so a lot of maturing to do. He seems like he has the ability to attack the player and beat a man, Im just not sure why he doesnt do it, the one time I can remember him doing it cutting inside and a long run into the box he looked good. But can only think of one instance of this.

2097~~~
1st season and has looked solid defensively. That's all I ask. 

His attacking power will get stronger the more he feels settled in the team IMO, less scared of losing the ball and looking bad. I think many people would question him more if he was defensively suspect, so that's a good sign.

2098~~~
He's bloody brilliant, and the sooner we stop this wingback nonsense the better he'll be.

2099~~~
He's the signing I'm most excited about from the summer, and I include Di Maria in that. He's a bit rough around the edges but he's already defensively superb. Hopefully he can get a run of games without being disrupted by injury because that's what he needs now. He's going to brilliant for us. Agree with the sentiment of most that he needs to be playing left back as opposed to wing back.

2100~~~
It's his injury record that worries me, he's clearly quite injury prone, unless he can shake that off he'll never be worth it, we need fit players

2101~~~
He was hardly ever injured before he joined us though right? This is what I find worrying, same with Rojo

2102~~~
Bit of an overreaction, no? Anyone no matter how strong their body is can roll over on their ankle. 

For me he's an excellent signing even at his price, he clearly is gonna achieve great things. With his ability, sky high potential, age and two years PL experience under his belt the price was more than fair.

2103~~~
Evra was also originally a winger.

2104~~~
Yes, it was frustrating. But Young was doing the same thing all the time too. Too much of a coincidence? Is this an instruction?

2105~~~
I'm pleased with him overall so far. Looks like a fairly mature player for his age, and is very solid defensively which is often hard to find in a full-back these days.

His attacking game hasn't been up to much so far, but he's still young and that should improve. And he's definitely not a wing-back, judging from how he's played there.

2106~~~
Not nearly as much as Shaw... and when Young cut back, more often then not he was putting it on his right and whipping in a dangerous ball.

Shaw on the over hand was cutting back then passing it 5/10 yards backwards/sideways... there was no real penetration from his side. Not his fault really mind you - he's used to have a winger in front of him to play of off.

2107~~~
Shaw is only 19, not a wing back (yet anyway) and I'm pretty sure he's never played in a 3-5-2 formation before joining us. At Southampton he was played as a left back in a flat back four with a winger in front of him but lately he's been played as a wing back with no winger in front of him to support him in attack. It's no coincidence his best performances for us have came when he played in a back four. I remember him and Januzaj had some good link up play going earlier on in the season. Yes he has to improve his attacking game but he's very young and all that will come. The fact that he is defensively sound at 19 is a massive positive, I would rather him be better defensively at this stage in his career rather than be a better attacker and crappy defender.

2108~~~
Young cuts back to put it on his right foot though to cross right, as he did all the time as a winger, relatively effective at it. Shaw cuts back and hits a 5-10 yard ball backwards. 

I agree with all those saying defensively he looks sound, which is true. He did get caught sleeping a bit when Saints had their first chance at the weekend. But then he put in a great block on a Pelle chance I believe. He slots in nicely and is quick to get back positionally which is good. Sure they are working on it in training. G Nev's wasnt the best crosser but then worked on it and became a great attacking full back in the end, one of the best IMO, hopefully Shaw does the same.

2109~~~
I remember Young cutting back and passing it square nearly all the time. Though not so much lately it's true.

2110~~~
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="font-size: 12px">He's actually quite a similar player to Joel Ward at the moment (albeit half a decade younger). Great defensive, solid build and limited on the ball. </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="font-size: 12px">Gibbs probably the best all-round of the young British left backs. Close to Shaw defensively, but much better in attack. </span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="font-size: 12px">Rose and Cresswell great going forward but little else. </span></span></span>

2111~~~
He isn't limited on the ball, he's good going forward as a left-back, if he has a left winger, or at least a floating Di Maria from the centre supporting him, like almost every full-back, the wing-back role is just too much to ask from a full-back who's admittedly better defensively than going forward.

2112~~~
Shaw was quite comfortable on the ball last season, I can remember very good attacking displays vs United and Arsenal, I just think the 352 doesnt suit him, in a back four, he did alright attackingly. Almost our whole squad does better in a back four but who cares?

2113~~~
I miss Evra <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2114~~~
Why? He was a great lad and all, but in terms of actual performance he became shambles defensively, offensively it was still very good but defensively he became a bit of a liability.

2115~~~
Certainly not Van Gaal.

2116~~~
He was excellent offensively. He would have been great in this system as defensive duties aren't as important.

2117~~~
Well, he's really struggling at Juve in a similar system, I dont know it for sure. And I dont really trust those CB's without solid defensive backs.

2118~~~

2119~~~
Shaw is already proving to be more solid defensively than Evra was in recent years.

2120~~~
But he can't finish 90 minutes or stay fit...

2121~~~
Evra was a machine for us, totally unbreakable, like that robot on the Terminator.

2122~~~
Give it time, He was boss for southampton last season.

He is just going through the norm for defenders at our club.

2123~~~
We bought a proper fullback. Not a converted failed winger like many clubs have. Very pleased we did. He's a young player who actually knows how to defend and is more than good enough on the ball for a fullback.

Three at the back messing about with players who can't play it.

2124~~~

Guardian interview.

2125~~~
Injured again?

2126~~~
Another injury prone player. Can't we sign, you know, players who don't collapse with ever little contact?

2127~~~
I agree with this, obviously. The sooner we ditch that formation the better.

2128~~~
The most annoying thing (as usual with us) is that he played something like 36/38 PL games last season.

2129~~~
He wasn't injury prone when we signed him.

2130~~~
He just missed 2 games for Southampton during his time there according to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/luke-shaw/verletzungen/spieler/183288" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/luke-shaw/verletzungen/spieler/183288</a>

2131~~~
Is he actually injured again then or just dropped?

2132~~~
We've got no idea for now.

2133~~~
But with neither him or Rafael on the bench something's up.

2134~~~
Surely he's injured. And Rafael's still recovering from his fractured cheek bone. It would make zero sense to have no back up in either full back/wing back position on the bench.

2135~~~
Posted this two days ago.

2136~~~
It's a strange one. Look a few posts up where he's interviewed by the Guardian. Guess he must have got a niggle. Has LVG discussed his absence?

2137~~~
In a strange way, I really hope it is an injury.

2138~~~
Is he injured?

2139~~~
I'm hoping that given Rafael is injured, he didn't see the point in rushing Shaw back early from his knock. Hence why he stuck with 3 CB's.
Clearly, he is holding both back to play in a 4 man defence.....I hope.

2140~~~
Probably not, just van Gaal being himself.

2141~~~
A question for football fans:
If a player aged 18 is already injury prone (as Shaw is now), does it mean that his body cannot handle the stresses of football and never will?
As a former athlete myself, I remember when I was young - i was bullet proof. I could run/cycle/weight-train, from cold,without a warmup. As I got older, things changed, so I learnt how to prepare my body for physicality by warming up properly. IME, injury proneness, gets worse, not better, with age.

Phil Jones is 4 yrs older and is a great example of this.
He started off strong (low injury rate). But as he is getting older, he is getting more injury prone.

What do you guys think - can Shaw get over this injury hoodoo or will he head in the same direction as P.Jones?

2142~~~
He played 2 years at Southampton and was hardly injured. I'm willing to bet his injuries are due to the new training regime at United. Hopefully his body adapts.

2143~~~
Bale had loads of (non Charlie Adam related) foot injuries as a kid, and his style of football puts ridiculous pressure on his ankles. Sometimes things get better; sometimes worse.

Sorry for how vague and incomplete an answer that was.

2144~~~
Well all of his injuries have been to do with the same ankle from that challenge have they not? He could just need more time for it to heal or something.

2145~~~
looks like the fat kid picked last at school and playing him at wing back is mental. 30m quid for a lb. ffs that's mental.

2146~~~
He coped fine at Southampton, with hardly any injuries. I agree with Cassidy, the issue is more likely to do with the training regime here, plus like limerickcitykid said he might not have got the time needed for his ankle to heal.

Only thing mental is this post. "Fat kid picked last at school"?

2147~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>



-so is he injured or not?

2148~~~
he does to me , he looks totally gassed playing at wing back. and IMO 30m on a lb is crazy money with all the holes in the side. he's clearly not ready to play and LVG said as much at the start of the season and maybe this injury(s) come down to his fitness or lack there of.

2149~~~
Nope, just fat.

2150~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2151~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I guess you might not have realized I was being sarcastic and slightly mocking the post above about being the fat kid that gets picked last at school.

2152~~~
Oh good. You can never be too sure these days given some of the recent posts on this forum.

2153~~~
Just keep in mind that I'm a brilliant poster. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2154~~~
Still feel this lad will prove a great long term investment for us, looked eager to get on tonight and hopefully will start against Leicester.

2155~~~
Did he even reached his 20's yet ? I thought if he could be longer on the pitch today he could produce some chances.

2156~~~
Playing his way into the team, decent performance today.

2157~~~
Think you may be right, but I just don't see him reaching the heights that Evra had for a couple of seasons where he was unreal. Shaw lacks that sparkle that Evra had and that extra bit of pace and acceleration combined with terrific link-up play and great timing. Shaw can most likely improve on Evra's crossing though.

2158~~~
I think our midfielders neglect him too much going forward. He has the pace and strength to be a real threat with his link-up play.

2159~~~
Best defender at the club. He gets it.

2160~~~
Hopefully he doesn't pick up any more injuries for the remainder of the season and gets a run in the side.

2161~~~
he is much better in a classic 4 across the back. as a wing back he's not nearly as effective. i think it gives hi more space to work in going forward. got caught looking the wrong way once but played very well.

2162~~~
Yeah there was that annoying moment when Di Maria took fecking ages to play the ball out wide to Shaw, which inevitably was too much for him.

2163~~~
Is he actually as fat as he looks or just one of those "husky" guys? When I see him running I can't help but picture him with a big belly and a plate of sandwiches.

2164~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/MQhpdWz.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/MQhpdWz.jpg"/>

2165~~~
He's obviously not fat. He just has a massive ass.

2166~~~
He looks like a royal bellend in that photo, mind, and I say this as somebody that backs up his skinny jeans.

2167~~~
I'd say that is a fair enough view, although he is still young enough to develop a lot further. He hasn't got the dynamism or technique of Evra and I doubt he'll ever be as exciting to watch, but I think defensively he'll be a stalwart for us.

2168~~~
He doesn't look fat, just not as toned as some players.

2169~~~
Look like moobs to me.

On a serious note, the kids 19. I know welbeck is more lanky but at the same age he was still filling out too, I suspect its the same for shaw. Yeh he looks big at certain angels but when he's at his peak he'll be strong as hell.

2170~~~
Quite excited about him and Adnan forming a left-wing partnership.

It's clearly nowhere near there yet, but it was great to see them trying to link up.

2171~~~
I don’t know why he can’t get close to Evra really. He has developed the defensive part of his game, plus he has good technique and is very fast. Evra link-up play was terrific I agree but his crossing was poor, if Shaw improves in that regard I think he can be as good as Patrice.

2172~~~
this. he does look very good with a partner on the left hand side. it was di maria earlier this season and januzaj today.

2173~~~
Thought he was ok today. Still trying to find his full fitness. He'll shine a lot more when we play with wingers, in my opinion.

2174~~~
Plus when Evra was Shaw's age he was a striker struggling to get playing time in Serie B.

2175~~~
Thought he was poor. His crossing was crap and he took an age to get the ball out of his feet.

2176~~~
He's pretty solid defensively so I'm happy to give him time to find his feet going forward. He needs a run of games and I see no reason why he won't get that.

2177~~~
I thought he was pretty solid. Obviously the opposition didn't test him a lot. Has to keep working on his attacking play but I am confident it will come. Really needs to sort that hair out though!

2178~~~
He did okay, he had one defensive brainfart where he was done on the overlap, where somehow he and Falcao(!) chased the same ball and man. Other than that, he did fine. Put in 2 or 3 good crosses, but we look pisspoor at attacking crosses these days anyway.

2179~~~
He's 19 and a million miles ahead of McNair and Blackett. I don't really get the criticism of him not adding enough going forward. For a start he hasn't had anything like a winger to support and overlap (and as a result hasn't had a chance to build an understanding), when Januzaj did use this width he assisted him well with some dummy runs and overlaps. 

The most important thing for him to do right now is defend well which he has been doing, there is enough creative players on that pitch to take attacking responsibility and especially when the L+RCM is Januzaj and Di Maria.

2180~~~
There was one lapse of concentration that almost cost it, besides that he was good. Hopefully he can stay fit now.

2181~~~
I feel relaxed as feck with him in the team, I think to the point where he's the least of my worries. 

Limited a bit going forward is my only real issue but it's that long from I seen a fullback of ours defend properly that I'll spare him that.

2182~~~
I'm so confident in him blocking crosses. I just know he'll make everyone look like Valencia.

2183~~~
I'd love to see those two facing eachother in training.

2184~~~
As noted by others, I don't worry about that position with him in the team either. Maybe he's limited going forward, but I put defence first in his position, and I think he defends really well. Hope he can stay fit!

2185~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2186~~~
Hope he improves going forward and I reckon it's just a matter of timing his runs a lot better, something Evra was brilliant at.

2187~~~
Di Maria just ignores him more often than not in every game they've played together, its annoying.  He's always there in space, just give him the ball!

2188~~~
He has lost so much confidence in an attacking sense, shame to see. At Saints, he was a tremendous crosser of the ball and really good at picking out runs into the box.. now he is like a left footed Valencia. I think he is either over thinking it or he is just feeling anxiety about keeping his place in the side.. or it may just be he needs a consistent run of games with a wide man in front of him. Either way he needs to up his game in an attacking sense because he can't be playing for Manchester United's first XI and be a shit crosser.

Time is on his side however.

2189~~~
He's 19 and already very solid defensively which is the important part for me. His attacking game will develop and people shouldn't be blinded by his fee. He's only 19 and has a lot of time to develop.

2190~~~
If he doesnt improve defensively, it wouldnt be a shame. So solid already, rhat's very rare. If we maintain this system, I think he'll make progress attackingly, he can overlap,  henis fast and has shown previously at Soton that he can pick out a cross, quite low on confidence and rythmn but it will come good.

2191~~~
Thinking back, how many top quality fullbacks have actually been this good defensively at his age? His strength, stamina and confidence will improve as he ages, he's going to be one monster to try get past.

2192~~~
He's going to be a very good full back. The way he picked out RVP from a cross from the wing showed real calmn and awareness. Most fullbacks just put it into the box without looking up.

2193~~~
Completely agree, I never think that he's going to get skinned!

2194~~~
Evra regularly got accused of being exactly that. Crossing was never one of his strong points.

2195~~~
True, but tbf Evra was a brilliant dribbler so he added an attacking dimension in that sense. Shaw is struggling to beat players or put crosses in, but the thing is I have seen him do both in the past. He needs a boost of confidence.

2196~~~
That much is true.

Doesn't mean Shaw doesn't have to improve his attacking play.He is looking very awkard in the opponent's half and for me, the reason why his teammates overlook him at times has to be that he also looks a bit lost going forward in training.

2197~~~
Some see Januzaj as a sure thing. I personally don't. 
But Shaw? Yep, I'd definitely put him under that bracket.

2198~~~
We will see the best of him just in 2 years.

2199~~~
Valencia is doing alright i think.

2200~~~
That's the thing. . He shouldn't be.

2201~~~
He's good defensively and it's what we need.

He's also good at making overlapping runs, it's why his best performances going forward for us came when we were playing 433 with a winger.

2202~~~
TBF Valencia was a great crosser for 2.5 - 3 years..then some doppleganger replaced him and now he murders shins for the most part <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Shaw does look lost in attack and not only yesterday. I'm hoping that is down to his stop-start season and not having an understanding with our other attackers, but he can improve. His defending is by and large very good though apart from one or two moments this season (when he's played).

2203~~~
Very strong defensively, but could work on his attack capabilities.

Just me who thinks at a young age, that that isn't the worst thing to be for a left back? It's a lot easier to find attacking full backs than genuinely strong full backs. Shaw seems to link with Rojo well as well.

2204~~~
I'd take a full back who's excellent defensively but average going forward over a defender who's excellent going forward but average defensively. Provided we have a good attacker down his side, I don't think his lack of attacking capabilities will be that big of a problem.

2205~~~
Definitely agree with you. Having a good, defensive foundation at a young age will certainly make life easier for him as he develops.

2206~~~
The thing with modern day footballl is players are pigeon holed into a position at a very young age now.  Those positions are also very specific.  You cant just have a lad who is a midfielder, he must be a Dm, AM, LCM etc etc etc.  This can result in players not full filling their potential, or certainly not showing all of what they can do.  Anderson being brought up as an attacking midfielder but us trying to show horn him into a defensive midfielder for example.

With shaw, this is a positive thing.  He's a left back.  Its clear that he's been a left back from the very first school U8's game he played.  As a result, even at 19 years old.  He knows the position inside out.

I personally think he's an excellant left back and one that will only get better.  I agree with the consensus that he offers more in attack when he has a winger infront of him.  He's not exactly lightening quick or as tricky as an ecra say but he makes the right choices when attacking.  So when he has a winger infront of him, he knows when to overlap, when to use the wingers run and cut inside / carry the ball.

Fingers crossed him and rojo stay fit and continue to improve.  If that happens i'll be happy that the left side of our defence is taken care of for a good few years

2207~~~
Where is he this evening?

2208~~~
He was with the squad in the team hotel yesterday

2209~~~
Rules out an injury?

2210~~~
Maybe he's ill like me.
But if he was there (like Januzaj) then i doubt there is an inury.

2211~~~
Not fit enough to play two games in three days?

2212~~~
Our players always seem to get injured during the last training sessions.

2213~~~
Not doubting you but how do you know this?

Edit: Never mind I've just seen your post in the Januzaj thread.

They would not have been a training session today I'm pretty sure.

2214~~~
Doesn't sound like it.

2215~~~
Not saying he got injured in training, but how many times have we heard the press conference of LVG on a Friday, then it comes to game day and we find out someone got injured in training. 

Hope he's not injured, would be smart to have given him a bit of a rest tonight.

2216~~~
The thing is going by the above tweet he didn't get injured in training yesterday and we wouldn't have had a training session today.

2217~~~

Yeah, seems to be the case. No real point in playing him against Cambridge and possibly picking up another injury. He'll have trained as normal as said previously and watched the game from the stands or whatever.

2221~~~
At a Q&A for manutd.com both Young and Wilson said Shaw and Smalling were the fastest players at the club. Wilson and Young also got a mention, from both. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2222~~~
Has anyone here doubted his pace? Even running with the ball at people he's like Bolt.

2223~~~
One thing I've been wondering: Didn't he make a lot of assists for Southampton last season?

I've been quite disappointed with his attacking contribution so far. He looks very solid defensively but in modern day football, I personally believe the attacking part of the game is slightly more important for a full-back. He doesn't seem too keen on taking his man on, usually preferring the early cross which mosten often leads to nothing.

2224~~~
Just two according to transfermarkt

Attacking side of things will improve, just needs two things:
1) to regularly play in a back four, the wingback role doesn't suit him and the little injuries he's picked up so far don't really help.
2) for whoever is on the left flank with him to use him more and build up some sort of understanding... as it is, in the past di Maria has been on Shaw's side and Shaw runs forward only to be ignored completely.

2225~~~
Okay, just me then, I remember him getting into crossing positions a lot when I watched Southampton last year so I've erroneously believed him to be an attacking full-back. He clearly needs to work on his crossing.

Agree on point 1, time is on his side and I'm sure he'll be great for us. Would have been nice to have Evra for one more year, though.

As for 2), one of the big issues have been that we haven't had an actual left-winger in many games.

2226~~~
Is his crossing really bad? I think not, I actually think it's better than the likes of Evra(which isn't hard tbf, but he was here for lot of years and build his career on attacking strength), Rafael(inconsistent), and Valencia from our team. Nothing worse than the likes of Zabaleta and Ivanovic who are first choice in City and Chelsea. He can swing quite decent quality cross at times, but his decision making isn't the best in attacking third(which doesn't have to be his fault).

I think <a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a>  is spot on, he doesn't really need much work on training pitch, he needs to develop understanding with other players by playing football matches in same position and with same players around him.

2227~~~
I remember when he first signed at being shocked by the amount of people who thought he was an attacking full back. The comparisons to Ashley Cole seemed in my opinion to be because like Cole he is great defensively and in particular in 1v1 situations is incredibly hard to beat. Cole never contributed massively to Chelsea's attacking which is fairly evident is his goals/assists/chances created numbers and in my opinion never got the criticism he deserved for it. 

As for Shaw playing him as wingback where's he's expected (at a minimum) to be taking on the opposition fullbacks isn't a role he's suited for. I agree he needs to be working on his delivery as it's been quite poor so far.

2228~~~
The sooner we nail down a style of  play and system and see some consistency in selections, players like Shaw will benefit.

Of course he will need to stop getting injured.

2229~~~
He's very solid defensively, but I think he's at least as bad as Valencia when it comes to crossing. He almost adds nothing to the attack and having Januzaj play on the same side doesn't help things. At least he's not being played as a wingback these days, because whenever he played there, he's been awful!

2230~~~
His crosses are so fecking weak. At least Valencia smashes in and they go out for a corner. His crosses trickle into the box.

2231~~~
West Ham's left back Cresswell much better going forward, but nothing like the same class defensively. Shaw great defensively and I still believe that matters most. Other areas of the team need to create; not everyone can be as good as Evra in that department.

2232~~~
I have no confidence in him when he gets into attacking areas.

2233~~~
Thought he was our best outfield player to be honest.

2234~~~
Very good match for him. Can't fault him for the red card. He was taking one for the team.

2235~~~
He was our best player today.

2236~~~
Unneccasry red card but he was solid.

2237~~~
I think he was one of the better players today. His second yellow was stupid but it is to be expected from a young player.

2238~~~
Decent performance today, he's better as a full-back than wing-back by a long distance.

2239~~~
Considering he got sent off, this may sound weird, but I thought he was by far and away our best player today.

2240~~~
Deserved red card (although Clattenburg's inconsistency and leniency towards Song annoys me). Other than that, our best outfield player today. 

Was never going to lay on a chance for Falcao or RVP because those two weren't scoring today!

2241~~~
Would like to see how he would link up with a winger in front of him.

2242~~~
Despite the second yellow at the end I thought he was one of the better players out there today.

2243~~~
Idiot. So we're either playing wing backs again.. or Rojo at LB.. Great.

2244~~~
Yep. Feel really calm when he's playing, very solid.

Red card was silly but understandable, we wanted the ball back as quick as possible to get the winner and didn't want them running into the corner.

2245~~~
Was our best outfield player for sure

Deserved both yellow though

2246~~~
Easily - by a long, long distance - our best outfield player. Not even a contest.

2247~~~
Will learn from that silly mistake. Sometimes you have to remember he is still a teenager and that second yellow showed the inexperience.

Other than that he was fecking immense. Had no help from Januzaj when it came to defending that left flank.

2248~~~
He was our best outfield player along with Valencia IMO, I don't even mind the red as it was a moment of rashness born out of him being so desperate to compete for the ball and the team, young error but not a bad one in terms of the mentality shown.

2249~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2250~~~
Deserved sending off, but a good performance. His crosses were good, and he worked hard. Good positioning defensively, and he knew when to take a risk, come off his man and clear up danger elsewhere. A very intelligent defender.

Shame about the red, but it was a strange game in that respect. How many did Song get away with? Song made 3 challenges worthy of a yellow before finally getting yellowed, and then made another one after that.

2251~~~
He was really good today and getting two yellows was both a consequence of trying a little too hard and naivety.

2252~~~
He's a red, he's a red!

2253~~~
He was one of our best players today, shame about the red card.

2254~~~
Great player. Routinely ignored by the superstars in our side.

2255~~~
I worry about his lack of pace. He also seems to be carrying a few too many pounds. Given his age (and the investment of course), he gets time to sort it all out and grow into the team. I think he could do with a commanding presence in the heart of the defence - a real leader.

2256~~~
He's so good defensively . Think he could probably do more attacking more often though, still seems to be a bit slightly off the pace.

2257~~~
I am still as excited about this lad as the day I was when I found out he might be joining. Deserved the red card today (although so did Alex Song who committed more than just the two fouls) but apart from that he was decent again.

2258~~~
Good game and took one for the team. Shame that we'll miss him in the next game though.

2259~~~
Sorry what <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> lack of pace?

2260~~~
He's bloody rapid!

2261~~~
If there's one thing he isn't lacking, it's pace.

Definitely isn't carrying a few too many pounds either. Just his body shape.

2262~~~
Did well today, promising signs for the future. It was a pretty ludicrous tackle for the red, but that rush of blood to the head is to be expected from a young full back from time to time. Hopefully the attacking side of his game will develop in the coming years.

2263~~~
It's easy to forgive his second yellow. He was dying to get the ball back after the equaliser...excitement got the better of him!

I'm only gutted because I'd like to see the Shaw/Januzaj partnership giving a extended run before LVG inevitably changes his mind/formation/philosophy again.

2264~~~
Really good defensively and much better playing as FB, he's good with the overlaps.

2265~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Lacks pace

2266~~~
I really like him, he played well, showed some bollocks today to boot, justifiable red.

2267~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How the hell can you watch him play and decide he lacks pace? Criticize his attacking contribution, fair enough, but that's ridiculous...

2268~~~
It's amazing how much he's settled in for a 19 year old. Very excited about his potential!

2269~~~
My opinion as well.

2270~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> lack of pace. It's frustrating coming onto these threads and seeing people being so wrong about a player. Similar to those who thought Smalling was a snail. Anyway, thought he was good. The red was annoying because now we have to shuffle things at the LB position. A few passages where he linked up well with Januzaj too.

2271~~~
Average 1st half. Fantastic 2nd half.

Stupid sent-off.

2272~~~
Amazing how good he is defensively for his age. One of the best defensive full backs I've seen in the PL since Cashley's best days.

2273~~~
Exceptional talent

2274~~~
One of the bright sparks in the game.  His defensive work is excellent and that run into the box before clashing knees with Kouyate reminds me of a certain Evra

2275~~~
Played with much more passion and willingness to run unlike his team mates

2276~~~
He just needed to cross it first time! no need for that touch <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. That will come though, nobody expected him to be flying up and down the wing getting assists. The main thing for me is he is solid in defense, he can work on attack.

2277~~~
I hope his progression isn't hampered by a constantly changing team/formation/manager(?)

2278~~~
So who plays LB against Burnley? Ashley Young?

Or will this mean we're back to 352 and wingbacks again?

2279~~~
Probably Rojo, and then Smalling/Evans as CB.

2280~~~
He favourited this last night:



I'm happy it's just one game he misses, though hopefully he can get back into the team.

Looks like the formation issue is getting sorted, though with him missing our next game we'll probably end up going back to 352 again...

2281~~~
probably be a headfvck like playing Januszaj there <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2282~~~
Thought he was solid yesterday. As long as he can stay fit he will be great for us. But that's a lot to ask at United.

2283~~~
I'd assume Rojo moves out there and Evans/Smalling comes in.

2284~~~
I can only assume that you don't watch us play at all if you think that. He is one of the fastest players in the team. 

Also the weight thing again! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2285~~~
Am I wrong in missing Evra? Shaw may be better defensively, but Evra carried an attack twice as well. Shaw is still young and learning though.

2286~~~
Came in to say exactly that, he was very good as usual but the sending off was a silly challenge. Just needs to be a bit more decisive with his crosses

2287~~~
I thought he was our best player too.  For a 19 year old his defending and positioning is absolutley fantastic.

He also brings the ability to put a tackle on a player.....something we have missed since Wes Brown leaving

2288~~~
I loved the part when he was on the left touchline, and he had like 2/3 crunching tackles in a row and came out with the ball. Proper little battler we need more fight in team like him.

2289~~~
Ya that was brilliant! Like others have said he was our best outfield player today. Deserved the red but I won't hold that against him.

2290~~~
Don't think that does it justice. Evra was such a liability last season. Sure, he is better going forward than Shaw is but i'd much rather Shaw's solid defensive work.

2291~~~
Stupid second tackle, but was a lazy tired one, he was doing doggies up and down and had just been on a tiring run and gave up. Silly really as he'll miss the games now. Again good defensively poor going forward again for me. 

Cant believe he was one of the top dribblers last year for saints, and literally looks completely afraid to do anything at Utd. Potentially tactics and the move to bigger club bigger pressure etc etc but some natural flair you would have thought.

2292~~~
I don't think the second booking was a stupid tackle, as such. I'm not sure it was a tackle at all - I think he was trying to cut the ball out before it even got to the West Ham player in order to launch a final attack. He just mistimed the interception and clipped the player's trailing leg.

As said, no real concerns over it and I actually think it was the right thing to try. Shame he mistimed but it was a last ditch thing to try and win the game.

I forget he's still so young, he's so composed on the ball. His attacking needs to improve but he's hardly got a great deal of quality around him to learn from out wide at the moment. I love how much ground he covers to make saving interceptions and blocks when it's seemingly a lost cause.

2293~~~
Still can't get over Shaw having "a lack of pace" haja funniest thing I've seen all night.

2294~~~
You get these from time to time. Shaw lacks pace,Smalling bring poor in the air and lacking pace etc. It is quite funny.

2295~~~
He really is fantastic, especially for a 19 year old. One of the most composed 19 year olds I've seen.

Hopefully the club actually progresses him properly now because he clearly has it in him to be one of the best LBs in the world.

2296~~~
Good player

Gay hair

2297~~~
You probably shouldn't look at pictures of him walking around in his "normal" clothes, then.

2298~~~
If he improves his crossing half as much as Gary Neville did in his time here he will be a great player.

2299~~~
That's what I think it'll be and the philosophy means it will be Evans.

2300~~~
I've said it before, I'll say it again... Shaw is just ridiculously solid for a player of his age, he's one of the few player's in this squad I feel completely comfortable with.

2301~~~
Even last season Evra's performances were far superior to what we've seen from Shaw so far. Evra got a few goals, some assists, started moves on a regular basis as well as the defensive errors. Shaw has spells of looking superior defensively then he'll make a stupid error like gifting Everton a penalty, being at fault for Everton's goal and West Brom's first. To match Evra's contribution, Shaw either has to be error-free or vastly improve his quality in the final third.

2302~~~
Yep, I think it will be Evans...unfortunately.

2303~~~
Yeah, I'm sick of the anal obsession with one right footer and one left footer.

2304~~~
He's the best defender at the club and he's 19. His physicality and maturity for his age is madness, to be honest.

2305~~~
Evans is naturally right footed though

2306~~~
He's pretty two footed and has been use4d as the LCB before.

2307~~~
Very, very good player and the best defender at the club.

2308~~~
Yes I think you're wrong. Conceding our left side whenever Evra's matched against a moderately fast winger was one of the most frustrating things about our team in his later years.

Shaw was very dangerous on the attack anyway.

2309~~~
Wish we had a Shaw for RB.

2310~~~
It's only a one match ban so he will just miss the Burnley game at home tomorrow. We should easily beat them without him. With Young playing last night I'd imagine Rojo will be playing LB.

2311~~~
You've got to remember he's only 19! He's already one of the best LB in the league, he's outstanding defensively and with time his attacking will improve too. I honestly think he's become the best B in the world.

2312~~~
Evra was defensively gone his last seasons here. Aaron Lennon is probably still a Premier League winger because of him, the only left back that made him look like a world beater. Evra was one of my favorite players here, (If anyone is interested in what I'm wearing, I'm actually donning an Evra shirt right now) but Shaw is such an upgrade on the defensive side of the position. Have patience on his attacking side, he's still only a teenager.

2313~~~
The youngster most likely to become a top player from our squad. He also seems very passionate and determined, I'm really happy with him.

2314~~~
his red card has really irked me

in the opening minute Song is let-off a blatant yellow card but he doesnt let shaw off for an equally blatant yellow in the last minute
clearly clattenburg sees that song has the whole 90 mins to get through and so he doesnt want to potentially affect the game so early on but surely the same logic applies to shaw, his tackle was in the last minute so sending him off couldn't have made any real difference to the outcome. also song hadn't been booked already so would still be able to play but shaw who had been booked and was clearly making a tired attempt at a tackle and yet he's sent to the stands. its bollocks double standards shaped entirely by the time of day and not by any means aligned to the laws of the game

i'm not saying it's not the correct decision and i know you see this sort of thing all the time (there's also no doubt my dislike of clatteknob is clouding my judegement) but seriously why let off one player and not another? no one would of minded had he let shaw off for that.

just needed to vent that.
cheers for listening

2315~~~
I think Shaw not looking that great in attack is largely down to our tactics as we just don't seem to be using our fullbacks on the overlap like we used to.

2316~~~
I agree, and I also agree that Clattenburg is a massive cnut who is buying into his own hype.

2317~~~
I like him but he is awful going forward. We've really missed evras link up play at left back. Hit one good cross today but far too often he just turns back in and we lose it.

2318~~~
Evra was great, but not sure how he would cope without a winger in front of him. Di Maria seems to sometimes ignore Shaw when he makes good runs. His link up play does need to improve though.

2319~~~
Yep he really really needs to step up his offensive duties. I feel going from Paddy and Rafael to Shaw and Valencia is really affecting our attacking play because their first instinct is always to stop in their tracks and cut the ball back.

2320~~~
He is so much faster than he looks like he's going to be, a bit like Rooney. You could see that PNE RB thinking he was going to burn past Shaw, but Shaw outpaced him in 2nd gear. Very strange. 

Seems a bit scared with the ball, but I'm still encouraged by his past few performances (even with the red card). Once he settles and maybe once he has a more permanent partner out on the left I think he's going to be genuinely excellent for us.

2321~~~
I just came here to post this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Doesn't look like he's moving quickly but seems to catch his man regardless!

2322~~~
After a good first half was disappointed that he stopped pushing on in the second. Showed good speed and put in decent crosses early on. Looks like he has very few weaknesses and is one of those players who improve game by game. Not sure Di Maria is the player to have combination play with but he has looked good offensively with Januzaj and I think he can do what Clichy does so well in getting to the byline and putting a low ball in for a tap in.

2323~~~
Hopefully his attacking play will improve.

2324~~~
I love seeing bomb down our left flank, with his dreadful hairstyle bobbing up and down. Probably my favourite player at the club now.

2325~~~
He's the only one of our back 4 that doesn't make me panic, as for the attacking aspect, all the best fullbacks have good understandings with the wide attacker in front of them, given Di Maria constantly floats centrally he has no one to link with to use the overlap and when Adnan plays there he is much to slow in releasing the ball, so personally I don't blame him for the less than stellar attacking aspect of his season.

2326~~~
So relaxed about him defensively he's a natural in that respect. But he does need to show more personality going forward.

2327~~~
He's not the mae west going forward, is he? Yong and lernin but still, it's a bit of a problem for us having a LB with such a poor final ball. Something for him to work on anyway.

2328~~~
His crossing is pants.

2329~~~
You wouldn't know he was a kid by the way he defends. I agree he'll have to improve going forward but he's a player I've a lot of confidence in.

2330~~~
I think its unfair to criticize him on his attacking ability when most the time's its Di Maria on his wing who ignores him.

As for defensively he's such a beast, you just know no matter how fast the opposing player is he just won't get beat for pace.

2331~~~
Doesn't seem to link up with di Maria that well. Hopefully in the next game he'll have Young ahead of him and AdM plays on the right.

2332~~~
One too many pints for the match, Pogue?

2333~~~
He's quick as feck and manages to win tackles on the left side quite frequently. Just got reminded of that guy in this thread saying he has no pace <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2334~~~
Yeah, looked very solid defensively and showing a lot more intent going forward. Final ball will improve, I'm sure.

2335~~~
We have finally a very solid defensively full-back. That alone makes me very happy.

I'm sure he'll improve his attacking play over the next months.

And like i've said many times.....we'll see the best of him just in 2-3 years.

2336~~~
Final ball was gash but fecking hell the kid can run quickly.

2337~~~
I remember that Humphrey guy when he was at Motherwell and he is very quick. Shaw had him quite comfortably. Someone needs to teach him hot to cross a ball though.

2338~~~
Really needs to sharpen up his attacking game. Could be a huge asset if he's more lethal going forward.

I think it's confidence more than anything. Looks good when he has the opportunity to overlap.

2339~~~
Well pleased with the way his kicked of his UTD career, we have to remember his a kid who's just moved from his boyhood club to a massive club! Once his settled in he will be world class for us for many years! I thought I'll miss Evra for a long time but Shaw has been a breath of fresh air!!!

2340~~~
He's almost like the reverse of Evra in the last few years. I much prefer a full-back is brilliant defensively and shite at attacking than vice-versa though. He should improve in attack too.

2341~~~
The quickness to get positioned for a cross is there, just a matter of making the right one.  It will come.

2342~~~
Agree with the general comments on here. Defensively he's good, and will only get better, but he needs to be a lot better in the final third. Give the ball away a lot yesterday, after getting into some good positions and his final ball was lacking.

2343~~~
He is fantastic defensively, he's a very natural defender and has a lot of tenacity & aggression. He has a great stand-tackle & ability to jockey a winger (the most important things for a full-back, in my opinion), combined with unbelievable speed. He's like a street footballer, minus the natural ability on the ball. He has a huge amount of work to do with regards to his crossing and dribbling - they should improve over time, but I doubt he'll ever be an Evra. Defense can be trained into you (to a certain extent - not everyone can practice to become Cafu), though I feel it is much easier to see a player's attacking potential from the start. His final ball is severely under-par & he isn't so technical in the final third, but he bombs down the wing and finds himself in those positions, at least.

I really like him & think he looks like a genuine 'Manchester United' player. Huge talent & he is already making himself one of the first names on the team-sheet, when fit.

Edit: The amount of people who think he has no pace <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> He is Valencia-quick, he's like a steam-train once he gets going. Don't be fooled by the massive ass.

2344~~~
Yeah, he's fast as hell and is class defensively especially in one v one situations. Problem is attacking ability is such a big part of fullbacks who play at United so he really needs to improve that if he wants to be a top player. Not just his final ball, that's not the problem as Evra's was pants for a long time. It's his link up play and actual dribbling on the ball. His link up play is almost non existent. He gets the ball and is pretty hesitant on whether to try and do a run, or cut in and play a pass but then goes back and always delays if he should make the overlapping run, things like that. It'll all definitely improve with experience so I'm not worried, it just has an impact on the side, especially as we had Evra who was one of the best fullbacks around at linking up with his winger for so long.

2345~~~
Don't expect anything from him going forward until he gets a winger ahead of him on a regular basis. 

It's a fullback's role to support not attack.

2346~~~
Superb defensively but crosses like a 5 year old girl.

2347~~~
Maybe in days gone bye but not nowadays! But given that he is still a baby we can forgive this, a wonderful prospect imo.

2348~~~
Im very surprised with this guys pace.

He has such acceleration.

2349~~~
Give him a break. Ivanovic was poor going forward as a right back and now he's pretty good. Our own Gary Neville was average going forward, when he started.

If Rafael actually stayed fit or Valencia was decent going forward then it would compensate for Shaws lack of attacking abilities.

2350~~~
He's getting in consistent defensive performances and that's lovely to see. Don't forget, he's still a teenager!

2351~~~
Yeah I'm not worried about him or his development at all. 

He's a defender first and foremost and he does that very well; I'm sure his attacking game will develop in time.

2352~~~
Uh. What?

2353~~~
Reminds me of Ashley Cole. Huge defensive talent, probably will be capable of marking out the best wingers in world football with experience but overrated going forwards. I think we need a attacking talent on the other full back position to cancel out Shaw's lack of flair going forwards. He really needs to pull his finger out in this regard. Struggling with his dribbling is one thing, but not being able to cross is inexcusable.. he used to be able to do it with the Saints. He is over-thinking everything too much.. almost as if he has a case of the yips.

2354~~~
Looks like you wrote that comment by rolling your forehead against the keyboard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2355~~~
I'm praising him Bojan not sure why you are saying give him a break?

2356~~~
I still can't get over how fast he is, mainly because he always looked fecked and like he should be really slow.

I love him though, he's really going to be a special player for us. One of the most defensively composed teenagers I've seen in the game, that's for sure. Just needs to learn how to cross a football.

2357~~~
He's still growing into the club, I think sometimes you can see that in his attacking play, he's happier to pass it off than attack but in time it will come. The fact he looks solid in defense, really calm on the ball and has pace to burn is hugely encouraging for a 19 year old who's played what 14 games for us?

2358~~~
He's so good and composed defensively that I'm not too fussed about his contribution to the attack at the time - that will come soon enough. Easily one of my favorites here!

2359~~~
His style of play really reminds me of a young Abidal at Monaco and Lille more-so than an Evra at the same stage in his career. Similarly tall for a fullback, not the greatest going forward at this point but an effortless defender who is also generally reliable in possession. Eric made impressive strides at Barcelona and was a fixture as a left back who could control possession and made attacking contributions with intelligently timed runs without compromising on his defensive positioning.

Shaw could easily become a player like that with proper tutoring and maybe even more given his superior physical skill-set. Will be interesting to watch him develop over the next decade. Wouldn't be surprising if he even contributes as a central defender at times. Shaw certainly has the defensive awareness and presence to do a job there, just like Abidal did.

2360~~~
Expect a lot more from him than he showed yesterday but I think his confidence is low and tbh he wasn't bad at all, I just think he's capable of much better. Excellent talent.

2361~~~
His defending is so good and just rock solid. I'm never worried when a player is taking him one-on-one.

He will improve his attacking prowess over time, but I'm not even worried about that because he defends like he's been playing top-level football for 10 years. Amazing talent.

2362~~~
I don't worry about the long term, because actually when he does attack he does okay. The problem is just being a little over-cautious and that's probably a combination of being young and new to the club.

However, I do worry short term because with him on one side and Valencia on the other we're painfully narrow in attack.

2363~~~
I'd rather have a young fullback who is a natural defender than a converted winger into a full back. The attacking aspect of his game can be coached into him, looks an exciting player. 

By the way, he's a quick stocky looking bastard.

2364~~~
He'll improve offensively, I certainly remember him making impressive runs at Southampton and he's got himself in good positions this season, his delivery is lacking but he has it in him to improve significantly in that aspect because he's already shown glimpses of genuine quality.

2365~~~
And like Abidal, Shaw looks like he could fill in almost as a left sided CB in a lopsided 3 back with his height and defensive prowess if we get a marauding right back like Alves was at his best. I really do rate him highly, and he's only 19. Injuries will be the only thing preventing him, his potential is sky high.

2366~~~
Ha, it's almost De Gea like in a sense that I always think  "go on shoot from there, you'll never score!". When I saw their RB who obviously fancied himself as pacey try to knock it passed Shaw, I literally had a little giggle as he got into stride and realized nope not getting passed.

2367~~~
Watching Chelsea play they do alright even though their three main FBs are not that great attacking wise. So even if Shaw does not turn into a great attacking threat I am not too worried.

2368~~~
He was playing well and LvG took him off, unless he was injured I don't get it.

2369~~~
He was replaced because LvG wanted the attacking thread that Young offers on the field. I doubt it had anything to do with his performance.

2370~~~
Him and ADM is not really working yet but I also thought it was a poor sub. Rather have Young playing upfront for Fellaini

2371~~~
Maybe because he always looks like he's just ran a marathon.

2372~~~
Young should have came on for RvP and played ahead of Shaw to double up our attacking threat.

2373~~~
Baffled as to why this didn't happen

2374~~~
Thought he had a good game. Was shocked when he came off.

2375~~~
The same reason RvP didn't come off for Wilson to play on the right head of Valencia...RvP appears to be Loui's lovechild!

2376~~~
Agreed.

2377~~~
Disappointed in him for the Ki goal, I'd rarely expect him to be beaten like that defensively.

2378~~~
I don't think he's particularly brilliant positionally, I'm sure that will develop as he matures, but he's already really strong in one-on-one situations. If he matures as he should and we can refine his game going forward then he'll be a fantastic (albeit very expensive) full back for many years to come.

2379~~~
He seems to make a lot of defensive errors. Not only the Ki goal but the other big Ki chance that was saved too. Going forward he was better than usual but a horrible defensive display.

2380~~~
Seems most here is positive, which I find strange. I thought he did well going forward but was poor defensively. Strange because it is usually the other way around. He lost his man a few times when they made runs across him, especially on the first goal. I would have kept him on the field though.

2381~~~
he was no better than most. which isn't good enough.

2382~~~
He had a good game IMO, getting better going forward, solid defensively, quite unlucky with the goal. He must have gone out as we were prepared to stick to the hoofing tactics so Van Gaal tweaked some areas he could like wing play, Young is obviously better going forward, he used to be a winger/striker for once..

I hope Shaw will start next game anyway. He needs to have a run of games, to gain on confidence. Shame he could be utilized better if he had winger in front of him

2383~~~
Lots of potential, don't think we are seeing enough from him, made some good driving runs, played a good pass in our goal but should have dealt better with their goal, he is young and you expect that so not overly concerned.

2384~~~
The jury is still very much out of him. Decent defender, timid going forward and far more likely to play an easy side or back pass than he is to do something attacking. When he does try and play the ball forward his delivery is poor and it's not difficult for defenders to block his attempts.

£30M seems a bit much for what we're seeing from him at the moment. I'm also not happy with his fitness given his age and level he's playing at. He's looking a bit chunky which is unforgivable for a professional footballer.

2385~~~
Decent defender? Please watch the majority of the games before you say something. As a left back he has shown very much defensively already, he can play 90 minutes and is one of our fastest players, so what do you have to moan about physically, his looks? Other than that is has no effect.

2386~~~
Because of yesterday???

2387~~~
Are we still doing this?

2388~~~
We payed for his potential not for the player he is right now. No doubt he needs to work on his offensive contributions but he has the Tools as we saw yesterday.

About the chunky bit, this has beeen discussed so many times, go backa afew pages and you'll see that he's pretty ripped. He's strong and fast, couldn't be in a much better condition physically.

2389~~~
The chunky/overweight stuff is nonsense. He is naturally quite solid. Don't see any issues with his size, still seems to run like the wind.

2390~~~
I remember reading that at Southampton's academy he had faster sprint times than Bale, Walcott or Ox had when they were at Southampton.

2391~~~
Going to be awesome, would like him to do more overlaps even when he doesn't get the ball. Hit the byeline son!!!

2392~~~
He is great for a 19 year old. Dont know what the moaning is about. His pace is fantastic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2393~~~
I'll be honest-I'm not convinced by him.

Too often he ends up ball watching when the play comes in from the right. Going forward, he's not penetrative enough (maybe this is a tactical instruction, though). Defensively, when the play is in front of him, he's quite composed and reads the game well. When the play is beyond him, he often ends up giving silly fouls.

But as others have said, he's only 19, debut season with us etc. So, I hope he does improve.

2394~~~
Defensively he still needs to develop in terms of his defending inside the box. Reacting to crosses etc.

2395~~~
I very much doubt he was faster than Bale. Bale broke all sorts of records as a kid.

2396~~~
People saying he looks fat, if he was stick thin like Di Maria they would say "too thin, needs to bulk up". 

So he bulks up and now they're saying he's too fat <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2397~~~
People still banging about his weight. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2398~~~
That is the one thing I noticed as well. Lost his player 2-3 times, one of which they scored from. That could be a lapse in concentration. He is still just a kid. But from the looks of it, he seems a very solid defender.

2399~~~
He's always going to have the weight label, since the whole not being fit enough thing during pre-season.

2400~~~
Yeah, when it comes to one on one defending he's superb. Probably as good as any other leftback in the PL. Definitely needs to work on his marking, though. In set-pieces and open play. Been caught napping a few times. As well as Ki's goal at the weekend, Daley Blind gave him an awful bollocking for losing the same player when he had that near post chance in the second half.

2401~~~
I'd be surprised tbh. Read through any of LVGs long pieces about tactics and having full backs that push really high up the pitch is an essential part of the way he does things.

I think he's still just figuring out the balance needed between attacking and defending.

2402~~~
In terms of 1 v 1 defending vs a winger, he has exceptional talent. I am sure we do not mean to overrate him but he is arguably better than Evra ever was at it and he's barely begun his career. He is a world class talent in this regard.

Not reacting to crosses etc he is a young lad and the knowledge he needs to be able to deal with such crosses and situations is more that of a centre-back. It is why someone like Gary Neville was so rock solid, even Evra too.. Evra was so good in the air and in the box, so he will hopefully pick up a few tricks of the trade in that regard through the right coaching.

The basics are all there, he just needs to be taught never to let go off a runner in the box. Someone like Ronaldo wouldn't tear him apart 1 v 1 down the flank, but he'd still score a hat trick by targeting Shaw.. making diagonal runs from wide positions and getting in on the far post.

This is the era of the wide forward who gets goals, so Shaw definitely needs to up his game in this regard.

2403~~~

2404~~~
If true, he's had a frustrating season on the injury front. As soon as he hits any kind of form and consistency he's pushed back to square one. Real shame for him, as well as us.

2405~~~
That's shite news, he is easily our best full back.

2406~~~
I just shake my head at our injuries these days. He hardly got injured at Southampton! What do we do in training!?

2407~~~
This is where Evra's invulnerability to injuries would come in handy.

2408~~~
We really are cursed with injuries. Shaw barely missed a game last season yet the instant he joins us he becomes injury prone. There must be something wrong with our training methods. Most of the injuries are suffered in training rather than matches.

2409~~~
What has happened to him. One day he played for Southampton, and then appeared to be an ever-present ever since. Joins us, becomes injury-prone.

Fills me with confidence defensively...well mainly the 1v1 situations. Has slowly been coming out of his shell going forward too...looked alright in the first half in particular last week. Hopefully it's just a stupid little niggle and nothing to keep him out for another few weeks.

2410~~~
Next Hargreaves

2411~~~
It's even worse than Rafael. Hopefully it's just a knock.

2412~~~
fecking tired?! Please tell me this quote is bullshit.

2413~~~
That's good news then.

2414~~~
Tired! Who does he think he is? Raheem Sterling?

2415~~~
It's his first season for us trying to learn to cover that entire left side on his own every game for 90 minutes. It's not the worst thing in the world that he's tired, and at least he told van Gaal rather than play and have it affect his performance.

He should've gone to bed earlier though, tbf.

2416~~~
I'd rather see him dropped sporadically than overwork him. He's only 19, and whilst he has come from a Saints side that was very aggressive and high paced, expectations and fitness levels here are needed at a whole new level. Let him rest, I have time for Shaw.

2417~~~
Tired? How's he going to cope when we hopefully have 2 games a week with the CL next year.

2418~~~
He's probably in the 'red zone' as Arsene Wenger would say.

2419~~~
This seems even more pathetic when compared to Evra, who played twice per week throughout the season with only a handful of rests. Hopefully just a youth thing for Shaw and he'll eventually live up to the high standards Evra set in his peak.

2420~~~
He's still a teenager. Nothing wrong with taking it easy on him. Especially with his injuries this season.

2421~~~
Tired.. Don't give me that crap. He's hardly been on a huge run of games.

2422~~~
I agree it is important to remember he is only a teenager and frankly comparing anyone to Evra in regards to fitness is a bit unfair. Still, not being able to play 1 game a week without having to sit out due to being tired? it's definitely unusual for someone with 2 Premier league seasons under his belt already and someone who was an ever present for an intense Poccetino side last season. I think it's fair to be slightly concerned that our £30 million pound left back prospect might be going down the same shaky road as our other young defenders in recent years, Smalling, Jones, Rafael. It has plagued them all and I am beginning to seriously question our fitness and training regime.

2423~~~
We could also say Denis Irwin-type standards as well. There is a reason why he was called M. Reliable almost to the very end of his time at United.

2424~~~
Tired = Tight hamstring

2425~~~
Exactly, it is mind blowing to read how some can criticise him for this! 

There are far too many young talents who have been overplayed in their youth.

2426~~~
If he was feeling fatigued then I'm glad van Gaal has let him rest. Too many young players these days are burned out from being over-played. 

Hopefully he'll be feeling full of energy come Wednesday.

2427~~~
I like the fact he has the balls to tell the manager he's not 100%, shows good character.

Far better to have players like that, then players that will play on through everything and end up injuring themselves/playing badly/or both.

2428~~~
Want him back in the team asap, he would do much better than Rojo who offers almost nothing coming forward. You'll see he will do much better in 4-2-3-1 with Young in form..

 I can't wait to see finally playing with wingers on regular basis. Valencia-Januzaj looks like a great pairing too on that right hand side

2429~~~
He is 19 years old so obviosly he will get tired when he plays a lot of games. Newxt season when we have more games, he won't play in all of them and get rotated.

Nothing shocking here that a young player is tired.

2430~~~
He's 19 and has an entire flank to defend and attack by himself. I'm guessing his workload off the pitch is fairly high as well as we're probably getting him to fill out a bit more, as we do with most new players.

2431~~~
Shaw isn't/wasn't tired!!!!!

2432~~~
Almost never injured for teh Saints, comes here and he can't play more than 2 consecutive games without getting injured... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2433~~~
Completely agree, especially at his age. Last thing we want is for him to play and injure himself.

2434~~~
I hope he's not tired, he shouldn't be he's only 19!

2435~~~
Is he still injured? Surprised not to see him start tonight

2436~~~
After Herrera, I'd say I'm most troubled by LVG in his rating of Shaw. The Fellaini usage at least has a rationale to it. 

I'm assuming Shaw wasn't 100% tonight, but in general I think he's a really good all-around player and will be the best English LB since Cole was good.

2437~~~
I'm not concerned as he has been played when fit. I reckon hamstring problem was more serious than LvG let on. 

Only thing I find a bit weird is Luke Shaw's social media blackout for the past week. Even when not tweeting he's usually favouriting something or other.

2438~~~
We need him back for the game on Monday. Arsenal have some world class attacking players and Shaw is very good at defending 1v1's.

2439~~~
He's dead so. van Gaal has clearly killed him in a fit of rage and is now trying to cover it up.

2440~~~
He's obviously rated by van Gaal and is just carrying a hamstring injury at the moment. I completely agree with the bolded bit.

2441~~~
Rojo does a job at LB, but we definitely do miss Shaw there, just show's how important it is to a decent fullback. I would personally prefer Young to start at LB next time. Hope Shaw is back soon though!

2442~~~
The lad is definitely a class player or will be soon. 

Still think Van Gaal should not have publically said he was unfit earlier in the season. He should learn to be a lot more diplomatic in public how he talks about players. Players are the clubs most important assets along with fans. Criticising them in public causes their confidence and values to dip.

2443~~~
Tough first half so far. Continuing a worrying trend of offering little going forward, even more so considering Bellerin is on a yellow and there for the taking. He has also been unusually destroyed defensively too by Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Hope he has a blinder soon, in an attacking sense, he's a very good defender on the whole and we could do with unleashing a beast like Patrice from left back at times again.

2444~~~
He somehow manages to be worse than Valencia going forward which is really annoying.

2445~~~
Chamberlain looks like Garrincha

2446~~~
He's having a tough night against Oxtail soup, that boy is powerful beastly young scamp.

2447~~~
We've turned him into a crock.

2448~~~
Most players do when they join United, in fairness.

2449~~~
Not surprised to see him come off at half time, he was all at sea in that half. Hopefully it is that and not another injury.

2450~~~
Tactical sub or because of injury?

2451~~~
What a waste of money. The lad just isn't fit, he's 18 or 19 and has the fitness of a pub team player complete joke.

2452~~~
It's amazing how many times I have read "pub player" or "pub level" in the player threads tonight. Anyway, he wasn't great. First game back though.

2453~~~
He hasn't had fitness issues until he joined our club... hes also not the only one having them here...

2454~~~
Really struggled with Ox, right call to switch him and Rojo but then Ox got injured so it didn't matter, I think Rojo is better going forward right now though.

2455~~~
Ay, that's nonsense.

First game back and he struggled. Unless you include a dead rubber against Costa Rica at the World Cup then tonight's match is possibly the biggest he's played so far in his career. He slipped a few times, too, which won't have done anything for his nerves.

2456~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Dear God...

2457~~~
He has to come off in most games and was apparently "tired" and didn't play another game as a result. For his age and the price we paid it's a disappointment. This isn't a knee jerk because of tonight's loss more of what I've seen over the season so far from Shaw.

2458~~~
Really does need to get a string of games going, really worried for the lad.

2459~~~
taking him off was scandalous unless he was injured.

2460~~~
I seem to remember he was good outlet on the left for Southampton with good technique on his delivery, but his crossing is even worse than Evra's now.

2461~~~
Having him go off injured was a complete waste of a sub we could have used. Sick note and so far as big a waste Of money as any of our new signings.

2462~~~
I wonder if he actually is struggling or if LvG just see's someone with that body-type and dismisses them as "unfit" and sends them to Fat Camp. He was apparently a lot less fit than he is now when he was at Southampton but attracted admiring glances from everywhere … we paid lots for him to beat off the other suitors and then LvG came in pre-season and decided he was fat!

2463~~~
I'm a Shaw-boy but he really needs to support the winger better. Especially with Young opting for going on to his right he needs to be there for the overlap. They were often waiting for him to come or basically telling him to move further forward, it slows us down and lord knows we could do without further pauses in our play.

2464~~~
It's getting really frustrating at this point. From a coaching standpoint I'm not sure why he continues to start when we know he almost always one of the subbed off players. Until he is fit enough he shouldn't be starting. If it is due to chronic injuries than why is Rafael banished to the bench?  He is a quality player but until we can rely him he needs to be benched. Subbing him, a left back, means we usually have to shift in defense and/or midfield. That is too much disruption just to start a second half.

2465~~~
Wasnt surprised he got taken off, kept falling over and Ox was causing him a bit of bother, most surprising bit though was LvG put Rojo at LB instead of moving Blind over and putting Carrick in his place.
Do we have confirmation if it was tactical or injury?

2466~~~
Blind would have been a disaster vs Ox tbh

2467~~~
Fair point, Blinds distribution would have been several hundred percent better than either Rojo or Shaw from the left though that was my initial thought.

2468~~~
What on earth happened to the player we signed from Southampton? Why do we always get conned? Or is it something we're doing wrong? I dont understand, why does he look shattered after 5 minutes of every game he plays? He's never in the opposition half anyway.

2469~~~
So word is he's injured....

2470~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> couldnt make it up. Now we have to rely on Rojo as our left back. Or better, lets revert to 3-5-2.

2471~~~
He was very, very good last season for Southampton (and England). This season he's injured every other game. Don't know what the problem is, but so many injuries so early in his career is not a good sign.

2472~~~
Groin injury is the speculation.

2473~~~
Makes you realise just how spoilt we were with Evra from a fitness and attacking pov.

2474~~~
Never stopped many fans from labeling him lazy when he was struggling to get back after many forward runs.

2475~~~
Seems like our worst signing this season so far. I wasnt following him when he was at Southampton but I heard really good things and I thought we were set, I sincerely hope that this is not the best he can do otherwise we're going to need to buy another LB this summer.

2476~~~
Wouldn't mind something like this:

2477~~~
Ugh, Valencia and Young as wingbacks again...

2478~~~
Does this guy ever have healthy life habits or not? I'm really fed up with his injuries. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2479~~~
Don't exaggerate please.

2480~~~
We had Evra for 8 and half year, and I can't remember when he was injured to be honest. Shaw has been bought 33M this summer, no assist, no goals, can't play 5 games in a row.

What's the problem with all the English player now ?

2481~~~
Not exaggerating at all, based on his performance he has not been good enough and is constantly injured. I dont know how good he was with Southampton so if this is as good as it gets with him then yes we should get another LB IMO.

2482~~~
You're dissing player after one season, that hasnt even ended yet? 

He's 19 years old ffs.

2483~~~
How exactly am I "dissing" him? He has not performed well this season or at the very most he has not reached the levels expected of him and the constant injuries have not helped either. Sure hes 19 so? Since hes 19 and has not proven to be a top LB why is he our first choice LB? Shouldnt we have another lad to compete with him so Shaw can actually improve? I'm not saying "oh feck this lad ship him off" he just needs to improve a lot.

2484~~~
He hasnt reached the levels expected but he's a new player, very young player and time is on his side. Does he have to prove he's a top LB in one season?
We have Rojo to fill in if he's injured, or when he's not on form. 
He's our first choice LB cause he's our best LB. 
I'm sure this season is not as good as he gets..

2485~~~
Hes our best LB because we dont have another option except for Rojo who is imo our best CB and thats where he should be playing for us. Obviously I do hope that he has more to offer and im counting on it because otherwise it would be a massive letdown.

2486~~~
He's perfectly fine I think. Just needs to sort his injury issues out.

2487~~~
Why was he rushed into the side, if we knew he'd only be able to play 45 minutes?

2488~~~
This pretty much

2489~~~
Been a frustrating season for him. Every time it looks like he's picking up some real form and consistency he gets injured. Let's hope he doesn't become another Smalling and Jones.

2490~~~
Some people are beyond reason.

2491~~~
Tough first season for the lad. Lots of injuries and mostly uninspiring performances when he has played. Obviously got plenty of time on his side though so no need to worry too much as of yet. Hopefully he really kicks on next season.

2492~~~
Was he injured or was it prepared in advance that he would only play 45mins ?

2493~~~
I am his fan but he shoul be concentrating on football. He seems like he's not on the pitch in his mind. I am very disappointed with this. It's his mentality but he shall be fine, should not be scared of Van Gaal that much and play his game..

2494~~~
Exactly the reason you don't spend  near £30m on potential, at least he should have been Englands no1 left back before we decided to do that... Jheeze anyway hes a good player and hopefully he'll sort out his fitness issues and show it. Awful lot of pressure on him though, people saying hes going to be the best LB in the world etc... I can see him ending up like Jones tbh

2495~~~
Just watch the first half again. Shambolic going forward, it seemed like he didn't want to help Young at times. Defensively, though, he wasn't as bad as I thought. He got skinned once by the Ox but aside from that he was solid enough.

2496~~~
No guarantee he'd still be available since someone else could've easily bought him instead. Spending that sort of money may be a risk, but sometimes it has to be done if you want to acquire a potentially top player at a young age. I feel more confident about him than Jones because when he's been fit, he's looked like a fairly mature and consistent player for his age, at least in the defensive side of his game.

2497~~~
I think he has generally been decent for us this season. He has just been managed poorly this season.

2498~~~
Poor old Shaw, needs to sort his attitude and dedicate himself to getting and staying fit. They've got to find a way to get through to him because his brain is non-existent. He's such a simple soul. Last night he had no end product. I wasn't sorry to see him go off. He'll come good eventually, but honestly he needs some kick ass direction. The day before the match he's sending stupid tweets to the English Arsenal players, 'see you tomorrow' or whatever. He should be concentrating on what he has to do, not send childish tweets. Someone should tell him, when you play your England pals in the league, they are your enemies. Treat them as such for those 90 minutes.

2499~~~
Not sure if serious. He can tweet whoever the feck he wants.

2500~~~
The point of talking about the tweeting is it shows you his level of thinking. The day before a huge match he's acting like he's meeting up with the lads. I may be too old for this kind of attitude. But I'd prefer some intensity instead of that softly softly crap mentality of some of our players.

2501~~~
He really struggled yesterday. There were times in the first half Young got the ball and was waiting for the overlap which didnt come and you could see Young (and at times Herrera / Blind) were frustrated.

It seriously did look like he was moving like hes overweight (even if he doesnt look it). Not sure if its injury, fitness or what? Quite bad.

2502~~~
Normally I'd agree with you, but the lad is 19! Come on..

2503~~~
Has it been confirmed that he came off because of injury last night?

2504~~~
Managed poorly? How so? His injuries and generally being unfit are someone else's fault?

2505~~~
Yeah and what was De Gea thinking hugging Cazorla in the tunnel before the match. He would have got a clean sheet if he told Santi to feck off. The best players in the world hug and share laughs with opposition players in the tunnel every match. Sending tweets the day before a match isn't a problem. He isn't slapping them on the ass and telling jokes with them in the middle of the match.

2506~~~
He can't have a joke with his friends a day before a match? I think some of you would prefer if footballers were robots with the way you go on.

2507~~~
Don't think it has been confirmed, but MEN wrote this: 

"It is understood Shaw, who was sidelined for the wins over Sunderland and Newcastle, was not 100 per cent fit and removed as a precaution."

Which makes sense.

2508~~~
I assumed as much at the time. Which could mean it's the truth or could mean it's an educated guess by MEN too <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2509~~~
He comes off as quite a shy guy in interviews, and it shows a little bit in his play. Still not playing with full conviction, in my opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if he's still very overwhelmed by this whole move.
He's also one player who might not benefit hugely from van Gaal while he's here.

I think he needs to be given freedom to express himself to be at his best, rather than being loaded with instructions (which I'd assume is the case.) Pochettino was a great coach for him in that regard.

And obviously we're used to Evra, who could spin on the ball and dribble from a standstill, but Shaw is very different.
I think (even from what I saw of him at Southampton) he looks/looked a more convincing attacker when the tempo is higher. He's not really a dribbler, but more of a runner. If that makes sense.

2510~~~
Van Gaal criticizing his fitness during pre season, the extra training(which could have lead to his injury), playing him as a LWB, the early subs.

2511~~~
Roy Keene would send tweets if he was playing these days.  He'd be saying, "I'm  going kill you bastards!"

2512~~~
Nah, Keano doesn't act so visible. He's more the type to break into players houses at night and whisper "I'm going to kill you!" into their ears.

2513~~~
Y'all gimme a break over my tweeting comment. I'm old, have some respect<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2514~~~
You are clearly not in a position to judge him.

2515~~~
I can judge him based on his performances this season. Others would know his potential better if they've followed his career prior to United but that doesnt mean I cant look at how hes done this season as a standalone. I doubt that many people have watched Rojo, Herrera or Blind play in their former clubs last season but that doesnt mean we cant evaluate them based on their performances this season.

2516~~~
If you said he has been poor this season and left it at that then fair enough. You are entitled to your opinion based on his performances this season alone. However, you suggested that we should get another LB. That's not something you can say if you've only seen him play for us. He went to the World Cup and got in the PL Team of the Season at the age of 18 so he's obviously an incredible talent and certainly not someone we should be looking to replace. In fact after De Gea he is the last player that needs replacing.

2517~~~
Shaw is our only proper left back don't you think we need some cover in any case? I've already said that Rojo shouldn't be used there so that's my take on that. Obviously I need to see more of him but he's not been convincing and what I'm saying is we need to bring in another LB for cover. It's at the very bottom of our squad needs for this summer so I'm not expecting anyone to come in even though we should have at least two options for every position. From what everyone is saying he was brilliant last season and I'll take that at face value but he's been average and sometimes even shit this season. Point is he has to work hard and prove himself at the very top level he hasn't done that this season so far but hopefully he can turn things around sooner rather than later.

2518~~~
Generally sluggish.

2519~~~
But that seems to be what LVG is trying to do and it is wrong too. Also 19 year olds are somehow expected to act like they are 30 and all mature, except that if you are really 30, fans would rather get rid of you.

2520~~~
I can't stand the immediate gratification some modern football fans demand, particularly from extremely young footballers.

2521~~~
poor lad,he's supposedly fat,simple,not good enough and shouldnt tweet cause it means he isnt serious....

Some of the posts here were wov.

2522~~~
is he expected to play the 'pool game? are there any fitness issues, of was he just not selected?

2523~~~
Definitely related to his hamstring being tight the other week, he'll play when fit.

2524~~~
Shaw doesn't look anything like a 30 million pound player but he is still a boy so has more years than most to prove himself.

2525~~~
it seems to me hes starstruck. He's having trouble coping with the pressure of millions and millions of people watching him every week, looks to me as if he's restricted cause of that but im sure he'll get over it and become World class

2526~~~
He trained yesterday, so hopefully should be available for Sunday.

2527~~~
Would defo play him, I wouldn't be comfortable with Blind v Sterling.

2528~~~
No point in playing him. We'd have to haul him off at HT after he gets injured....again.

This season has been a write off for him. Every time he looks like he's getting in the groove (he even looked half decent going forward at one point) he gets injured again.

2529~~~
It still staggers me we spent £30million on him. Amazing. He's been garbage so far, but I do appreciate he's 19 and it's a big step up. Even so, we got absolutely fleeced by Southampton (not that it's Shaw's fault).

Personally, I don't think he'll ever make it here. None of the ex-Southampton players that moved in the summer have gone on to make a big impact anywhere else (Shaw, Lallana, Lovren, Chambers, Lambert etc.), despite being great last year. And now their replacements in the Southampton team have all suddenly become really, really good players overnight. It strikes me that it's the system and the setup they have there that gets the best out of good players, rather than those players being almost world class individually.

I imagine a load more Southampton players will get moved on for mega-money in the summer, and we'll see them under-perform for their new clubs whilst their replacements at Southampton tear the league up.

2530~~~
Just go away.

2531~~~
we need his pace and defensive solidness v Sterling. Just hope that hes fit

2532~~~
Me too, it's not just Sterling and I'm not confident Blind could handle them.

2533~~~
Couldn't disagree with you more. He's been very good defensively it's only going forward he's lacked a little but then it's very difficult without a winger like he has had all season. All he has really struggled with is fitness and the continuity that comes with it.

I'm pleased with him so far and at £19 he's got a lot of years to earn his fee so there's zero point discussing it now.

2534~~~
He cost a bit more than that to be fair.

2535~~~
I have absolutely no idea where that came from. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's not even a typo!

2536~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2537~~~
Can't see LvG dropping Blind.

2538~~~
I hope he doesn't. Blind was fantastic and LvG should try to build on last weekend's successful formula.

2539~~~
Shaw will be class signing, not worried about him in the slightest.

2540~~~
I remember reading similar arguments about Dortmund. Their case would imply that selling your best players, even in a controlled manner, will eventually take its toll.

2541~~~
That arguement doesn't really back up when Lewandowski and Gotze went to Bayern, and are doing really well, while Dortmund have suffered majorly.

Shaw has done fine for us, people are expecting him to turn into Maldini and Cafu overnight but that doesn't happen, just like De Gea took a few seasons to sprout. 

Once he settles into life here and becomes more confident his attacking play will grow remakably I am sure. He has the technique, he just needs to be braver to take people on and not be scared. To me he looks like he is playing it safe and not wanting to lose the ball, but you can't do that in a top team.

2542~~~
Playing Liverpool is very different from playing Spurs though. Blind didn't need to do much defending during the match, coming up against Sterling is a different matter. On the ball and going forward Blind is much better than Shaw though.

2543~~~
I don't see much of a difference, especially since we've already murdered the dippers once this year, and are finally beginning to look like United again.

2544~~~
I disagree mate, Liverpool at Anfield is a whole different game. Our record there is poor too.

2545~~~
Considering that both Blind and Rojo are better than Shaw as a LB, I don't see any reason why we should rush Shaw on the first team. We should give him all the time he needs and consider him more as a signing fir future rather than for now.

2546~~~
Me too. Blind/Young on the left was amazing. Carrick/Herrera in midfield excelent.
Agree. He'll come good, he has talent and age to.

2547~~~
Absolutely agree. Watched him last season and he was exceptional for his age. He's already proven to be very solid defensively, just needs to work on his attacking game more. By the age of 24 I expect him to be a beast for us.

2548~~~
I worry about his dodgy hamstring against Sterling.  If Shaw hasn't fully recovered, I wouldn't risk it.

2549~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's been great 90% of the time. Just injured way to much.

2550~~~
They're definatly not. In fact Rojo is quite considerably worse. 

Blind is much better on the ball and going forward, but Shaw is much better defensively.

2551~~~
Shaw is better defensively, both of them are considerably better attacking-wise. I think that both of them have performed better than him in that position this year (although Blind played only once there).

2552~~~
Shaw was (and still is) a prospect when we bought him. I always maintained we would have done well to try to keep Evra on for another season to smooth the transition while Shaw adapts and matures. As it is, we bought two players also capable of playing LB (Blind and Rojo) which provides good competition for the spot.

Shaw is without doubt the future first choice LB, but personally I think people are expecting too much if they expected him to instantly come in this season, nail down the position and play every game. He is young and has had a considerable step up in coming to United - it is stupid to put so much pressure on him this season.

2553~~~
Why is he always injured?

2554~~~
Reminds me of Phil Jones; Physically miles ahead of his age group so got his chance in the PL much earlier than others. As to whether he has the talent and mentality to be a United player, I'm not sure.

This season too many defensive errors given his productivity in the attacking third. The comparison with Valencia is not a favourable one. For a player with a reputation for being good defensively, Shaw has really underperformed in this respect.

Needs to cut down the number of stupid errors, especially poor marking, and try to contribute more in attack, better final ball especially.

2555~~~
Shaw is defensively very good though (by any standard, not only as a young player). Jones never looked as good at anything bar making weird faces.

2556~~~
I tend to be a big Phil Jones defender on this forum but, Shaw's composure and positioning are better than what Jones was at that age.

2557~~~
I think I would play him against Liverpool. It is a big decision for van Gaal though. Not sure I would be comfortable with Coutinho and Sterling drifting out wide down Blind's flank. Shaw's defensive solidity would probably be enough to get the nod for me.

2558~~~
defensively he is solid, he's rapid and covers a lot of ground and imagine if he can cross like blind!

shame he just can't stay fit since joining us.

2559~~~
To prove he's a United defender.

2560~~~
Id agree with that. Yes we paid a lot, but thats what we expect to do with top top young talents. People have just had the wrong idea about him when the transfer went through, people kept harping on about him being an attacking fullback which just isnt the case. He's an athletic defence first LB, who needs to work on his attacking game which will come in time. He's somebody in 2-3 years time we wont mention in matchday threads because he will just do his job consistently.

If im honest? i think Ricardo Rodriguez will end up being the best fullback of this younger generation and i wish we had gone for him, but shaw will definitely be up there and english <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2561~~~
I'm not entirely convinced hes an LvG fave, in the same way as some others, saying that, when hes been fit he's usually appeared,
Having said that... LvG has needed to use Blind to anchor our midfield for most of the season, now that Carricks back, I get the feeling LvG would rather play Blind at LB over Shaw, but thats just my guess, we'll find out soon enough I suppose.

2562~~~
Agree with this. Rodriguez is both better and has more potential than Shaw, but Shaw will likely become one of the best in that position too.

For the best LB in the next 10 years, I think it will be between Alaba and Rodriguez though, and I doubt that Shaw will become as good as them. But he can be our new Gary Neville for the next 15 years, which would be fantastic.

2563~~~
Most likely, though doesn't Alaba want to play in midfield long term? I think I remember one of the Bundesliga posters saying on here <a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a>

2564~~~
Yeah, I think he said so in the past. Will that happen though is a different matter considering the numbers of midfielders Bayern have, and considering how good Alaba has been as a left back.

2565~~~
I don't think he's played as a leftback much this season (might be due to the injuries they have), though again that's something <a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a> would be able to confirm or not.

2566~~~
What a strange comment. Of course he is not a 30m player, but we invested not in the Shaw of 2014 but the Shaw of 2020. He's just a boy, same age as Januzaj, and needs a lot of time and progress

2567~~~
Rodriguez really has progessed brilliantly and even though he signed a new contract, he will be at a top team in 2 years. I would never have expected him to improve the way he did. Tbf to Shaw, he's also older than him

2568~~~
Almost three years older iirc, which is a lot at this early stage in their careers. Shaw will be a massively different player in three years.

2569~~~
We also have Bernat at leftback, who has been excellent. Wonderful player, what a bargain he was for 10m Euro. I'm not the slightest bit worried when Bernat starts and he's only 22 years old and in his first season in a new league in a foreign country.

Alaba is up there with the greatest midfield talents of this generation, I expect him to take over from Schweinsteiger as our leader in the middle over the next few years, can't see him staying at leftback for all his career. He's already the key player in the center for a very good Austrian generation in the nationalteam and said a few times, that he wants to play more central at Bayern, so that he can influence the games a lot more.

2570~~~
Alaba is a good player but up there with the greatest midfield talents of his generation is way over the top.

2571~~~
I knew Bernat would be a bargain, god knows how you cnuts got him for like 7 million quid, steal.

2572~~~
Southampton certainly did some good business selling Shaw for £30m and buying Bertrand for £10m. 

Not to mention selling Lovren for £20m and getting Alderweirald for nothing.

2573~~~
LvG confirmed he bought Blind for a spot in midfield. He's played most of his carreer at LB so he can certainly do a job there if Shaw isn't fit.

2574~~~
I'd rather have the security of Rojo at LB on Sunday. Let Smalling and Jones continue their partnership in the middle. Blind and Carrick in midfield, with Herrera just ahead.

2575~~~
I think that he was great (one of the best LB in the world) last season too. And didn't even heard about him until last season. If Shaw develops as fast as Rodriguez, then we will be very happy.

2576~~~

2577~~~
What the hell? Let us all remember he was practically unbreakable at Southampton.

2578~~~
Looks like it'll be Blind for tomorrow then.

We should just give Shaw an extended break to get over his injury problems. The amount he's had this season is too much.

2579~~~
Always was going to be Blind anyway. van Gaal said Shaw was going to be on the bench in the prematch conference.

2580~~~
Ah, didn't know that. At least we know Blind can perform well in that role.

2581~~~
Odd as he was in yesterday's training pictures but maybe just our luck something happened later in that session!

2582~~~
Paddy McNair also had a good debut at RB. We were always on the front foot, everyone had a good game.. Liverpool is different league, Blind's lack of pace and strength is worrying, hope he does well tomorrow as it looks like he will start there..

2583~~~
Let's get Rojo back and then give Shaw an early end to the season, so to speak. Give him a proper break. He's been non-stop for a couple years now. He needs a break. Ideally he wouldn't play for the u-21s this summer but he will, so give him a solid month or 2 beforehand.

2584~~~
Bit of a stop-start season for him, as if he is picking up the curse of Carrington.

2585~~~
From what a newbie said, it doesn't necessarily sound like he withdrew because he was injured

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9771391/england-boss-roy-hodgson-add-trio-to-his-squad-for-european-qualifier" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...-add-trio-to-his-squad-for-european-qualifier</a>

We'll see tomorrow anyway whether he's on bench or not. Best thing for him right now is to just rest... ridiculous how his injury record has gone from pretty immaculate to the worst since moving here.

2586~~~
I'm starting to think we should send our players to train with other clubs during the week, then just bring them together the day before a match. Just make sure it's not Arsenal.

2587~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2588~~~
Lad turned up a fat mess in pre-season and from then onwards it's been an uphill struggle re his fitness. I think he'll come good anyway, but things like this make my blood boil when I think of all the money we spent to get him and God knows how much we're paying him weekly, and a basic thing like rocking up in at least semi-good shape he didn't do.

Also, he was coming back from the World Cup with England - what the hell do they do there in training for him to turn up like that? 

This season keep working on the fitness and start of next season, no excuses.

2589~~~
Some say it was a big mistake from him and the club that he has made just one week holiday after the World Cup

24/6: He's played against Costa Rica
27/6: He has signed for us
29/6-6/7: Holiday in Spain
7/7: Back in training at Carrington

2590~~~
Is he still alive? Really surprised at how lightly he has been treat by the media in comparison to our other Summer signings.

2591~~~
That's because he's done quite well, just been unfortunate with injuries.

2592~~~
Quite well as in marginally better than McNair and Blackett.

Attacking contribution: 0 goals + 0 assists.  Has created a few chances and had at least one decent shot (Palace match) that I can recall.

Defensive errors: sent off, gave away needless penalty against Everton, asleep for Everton goal, poor judgement for West Brom's first goal, at fault for Swansea goal away. Also other unpunished errors: a very similar situation for Swansea that they failed to score. That's off the top of my head.

Very low interceptions stats relative to the rest of the team. Decent in the air. The comparison with Valencia's stats is painful. Shaw is much better in the air; Valencia ahead on just about everything else.

He needs to either start contributing more going forwards or cut down the number of errors; ideally both.

2593~~~
He's 19 and clearly has a mountain of potential above both McNair and Blackett.

2594~~~
Don't recall either of the two making it to the PFA Team of the Year at age 17/18 for a midtable side.

2595~~~
Rating a FB by goals and assists is the silliest thing possible. Back when he was a FB the only season Lahm racked up assists was the treble season and Cole never really had a ton of assists. Once Luke Shaw gets over what ever injury/fitness issue he seems to be having this season he will be a great FB for us. But, he is never going to be Roberto Carlos in terms of attacking.

2596~~~
Not worried about him right now. We have strong cover for him and he's still just a kid. Plenty of time for him to settle in and come good.

2597~~~
He's 19 years old and just moved from a small to a big club. Of course he's treated differently and obviously given much more time

2598~~~
Idiot from "Full Time Reds" showing himself up, again! <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2599~~~
What was this all about? I heard Shaw said something like I wont celebrate against Chelsea because of the interest they showed in me?

2600~~~
He mentioned in an interview about growing up supporting them, that he was hoping to be involved against them, and he doesn't know what he'd do if he scored his first Man Utd goal against them.

2601~~~
He said it would feel weird celebrating against them because he grew up supporting them.

2602~~~
Cheers lads, don't agree with not celebrating a goal for your own club but you can see what he means.

2603~~~
He never actually said that, and there's a vine going around of Shaw celebrating our equaliser against Chelsea earlier in the season.

2604~~~

2605~~~
That's pretty much what I thought. He never really said that he won't want to celebrate, just that he won't know how to celebrate against them, which is fair, because he doesn't really score that often anyways.

2606~~~

2607~~~
Not sure anything is really happening to him here. He's a young player who has had a (relatively) poor season after making the step up. Hardly the end of the world. I mean we didn't sign him thinking he'd be amazing from the get go, this is a long term thing.

2608~~~
Nothing is 'happening' to him. He's a young player, bought for the long term, who's been kept out for the most part this season by a couple of muscle injuries and a couple of injuries from bad tackles. On the few occasions he's played he's been good.

'Another blow to his fragile self-esteem', indeed. Unless Neil Ashton is his therapist or his mum, he's pulling this rubbish out of his arse.

2609~~~
I imagine it was hard to write such a shit article but he did it.

2610~~~
I'm not reading that but he came off at halftime injured. Ever since that game the press have decided that he's now a flop. All things considered, he's had a decent first season disrupted by injuries.

2611~~~
Shaw will need to knuckle down and win his place back from Blind next season you'd imagine, not just because Blind has played well there lately but because hes clearly one of  LvG fave's, Shaw is certainly capeable of winning the spot due simply to talent, but it might not be the smooth transition he'd have been expecting walking in the door last summer.

2612~~~
I've not been so sure about a player having a long career at the club since Rooney. Not remotely a problem.

2613~~~
That made me laugh out loud, because it's true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2614~~~
I believe Neil Ashton,  he is a well respected journo, dont know why some of you dont believe the story. 
<span style="color: #ffffff">hahaha</span>

2615~~~
He's 19. Perfectly normal to feel a bit out of place at the moment (if he does). He personally may have benefitted more from another year at Southampton but I'm glad we've got him and hopefully he'll settle down. 

Looks like he'd be a right porker if he wasn't playing football every day.

2616~~~
He's often an inflammatory dickhead but the story has a personal touch that makes me believe he's been briefed in some way

You white text wanker!

2617~~~
What is there to 'believe' about that article anyway? It's clear he's struggled, but that's natural. van Gaal made the comments about his fitness last summer. Loads of players will get specialist dietitians, especially younger ones at big clubs.

2618~~~
I thought he was injured? But trust Neil Ashton to conjure up shite as per usual.

2619~~~
I think Shaw has looked decent in the games he's played in. It's a shame he's struggled with injuries/fitness because he really could have done with playing more games this season. He's only 19 and has already proved himself as a top left back at Southampton so I'm still confident he'll come good and be our left back for the future.

2620~~~
When he has played, I think he has done very well. The signing wasn't for this season, it was for the next 10+years.

2621~~~
Seems like a strange article. Van Gaal obviously doesn't care about how much players cost as a measure of how often to play them. Its all about current player form and how well they fit into the team puzzle. If Blind, Young, and Valencia are doing what Van Gaal wants at the moment, then Shaw, Di Maria, and Rafa are just going to have to wait their turns.

2622~~~
what he needs is a good summer rest and an undisturbed pre season.

2623~~~
Not happening. I suspect he'd be in the u-21 squad.

2624~~~
damn

2625~~~
Something weird is going on with him this season. He has not been listed with an injury for a while but, he has had some fitness issue that has lasted like half of the season.

2626~~~
He could have 4 difficult seasons from now and I'd still stick by him because he'll still only be 24 with all his best years ahead of him. 

Ridiculous to write him off now.

2627~~~
Yeah it's absolutely silly to overreact. He definitely has had a frustrating season, but he has shown glimpses as to why we bought him. I have no concerns whatsoever.

2628~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SrttVOFYMOI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

So Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain confirms what we all suspected - Luke Shaw is quite the tool.

2629~~~
What kind of team sign a player to wait for 4 years for him to be of any use? So far it's been a bit pointless. Could've done with staying at Southampton and us signing someone established because as we've seen with jones and smalling things aren't that simple in regards to making the grade just because you are young with potential.

2630~~~
No concerns? Yet any others who are continuously unavailable are crocks and should not be relied upon.

2631~~~
There is a difference between a player who just came, and players who have been at United for years. 

Why all the panic, pointless addition and all. 
He had a difficult 1st year, he'll get better and be more fit and luckily we have players who can play instead of him.

2632~~~
I am big fans of Smalling and Rafael, so there injury records don't bother me. I have question marks over Jones but have rarely, if ever, mentioned his inability to stay fit as one of those question marks. So yep, no concerns about Shaw or any of the others who have been injured this season.

2633~~~
Saying he will get better is not a guarantee though. Jones was lauded as the next Edwards when we signed him and heck he's still as rash and unpredictable as he was back in 2011. I want Shaw to do well but so far it's been a poor signing, obviously he has time on his side but I've been far more impressed with Blinds performances at full back than Shaw's, not to mention he can actually play more than 2 consecutive games without being gassed/crocked.

2634~~~
That's a nonsense article. He's had a decent enough debut season for a 19 year old lad making the transition from Southampton to United and to boot have been plagued with injuries. Said it before: So many sports journos are stealing a living - apparently one can just pull stories out of whichever arse is closest and get paid for it.

2635~~~
I guess that's just down to LvG wanting his players to be back 100% before featuring. van Persie has been back in training for almost two weeks now right?

2636~~~
Well that's not what I said is it?

I said that even in that scenario I wouldn't worry because he will still be young. It just highlights how ridiculous it is to be writing him off yet. 

There's nothing wrong with signing talented young players and then showing patience in them adapting to the quality and pressures of the club.

2637~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> no surprise on that video. Barkley and Shaw both come across that way

2638~~~
Agree. What surprises me a bit is that he had no qualms about answering who's least intelligent, but on the question about who's longest in he shower he seemed quite reluctant to "incriminate" anyone <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Consistent lad, that.

2639~~~
We've changed the setup to something more offensive, while still being a full back whos role is to support his winger rather than provide width on his own. 

Shaw got brilliant pace and overlaps so hopefully he will look a lot better like Valencia/Blind has as a result at the full back position. I hope that playing and training as a wing back has helped him out offensively a little bit too.

2640~~~
Are we still talking this nonsense even with the way Jones has been playing in recent weeks? And actually look at what Bobby Charlton actually said about Phil Jones before we continue repeating the next Duncan Edwards crap. Luke Shaw was the best LB in the league last season as a teenager. He will be fine once he gets over this weird fitness/injury issue he has been having this season.

2641~~~
Hopefully he plays tomorrow and puts in a good performance.

People would be hasty to sweep aside the contents of the article. It's written with a genuine source. Ashton, while being a shoddy writer, isn't going to speak on behalf of Shaw's parents without confidence in his information.

Worryingly, albeit it's something that can be dealt, I think the article slightly hints towards something quite wrong with Shaw. It gives the impression that he's really struggling to come to terms with the move away from home and the size of the club he's now playing at. He's 19 and his world has changed a lot. It wouldn't be at all unsurprising if he was struggling mentally. If he needs more support and an arm around the shoulder then the club and staff should be seeking to help him with that. I'm sure they are.

2642~~~
I know he's a kid but for gods sake boy get forward and do something. Playing like a total pussy compared to Blind.

2643~~~
He's going to be so good.

2644~~~
Not sure what you're watching. He had a good first half.

2645~~~
Can't believe people can doubt his talent, he's magnificent. Playing behind a winger is completely different to having to have an entire flank to yourself in a diamond.

2646~~~
He is going to be great for us. Just needs to sort his crossing out. He has no confidence in his crossing whatsoever. Nice cutback for the Rooney chance of course.

2647~~~
Bizarre post after that half.

2648~~~
He's put in about 4/5 crosses, against the best right back in the league. What are you on about

2649~~~
Wait what?

2650~~~
Not sure if serial

2651~~~
I guess you didn't watch today's game then.

2652~~~
He's really good. The injury he got halfway through the season was a bit of a shame because he was starting to hit some good form. He'll be our left back for at least the next five years I reckon.

2653~~~
Created our best chance and has offered an option for Young every time, not sure what people are moaning about.

2654~~~
Oh he's super serial.

2655~~~
Started well but got worse going forward... He can't dribble past anyone

2656~~~
Came in here to say literally the same thing. He was worse than turnback Tony towards the end of the half.

2657~~~
Needs to gain confidence and just use his pace everytime to get past people. Sometimes he seems hesitant for whatever reason.

Will only get better and is absolutely lightening quick.

2658~~~
Has the physique to be an absolute monster in a few years. Lightening quick at times. Just needs to hone his technique.

2659~~~
He's going to be superb. Needs to work on his crossing but done very well considering how long he's been out & he helped create our only real chance.

2660~~~
His technique is pretty class as well to be fair. Kills a ball dead on the spot on the run pretty easily. Just lacking a bit of confidence in his final ball and that will come. Superb talent.

2661~~~
Any one else notice him control that ball on the chest from a pretty poor pass?

He needs a bit more confidence I feel and he can be a top player. Still looks a little nervous in the final third.

2662~~~
I've never been more confident of a young player making it at United than Luke Shaw. He'll 100% do a Rooney.

2663~~~
What??

He's done well going forward considering Jose has set up to defense the left side.

2664~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he created the best chance of the half with a great cross.

2665~~~
He's done well today, especially considering he's been out injured.
As has been said a zillion times, it's just the injuries that will stop him being a United regular.

2666~~~
Oh! That run.

2667~~~
And starting second half well too. Some of the comments towards him in the match thread are ridiculous.

2668~~~
And some fans still think he's shit.

Shaw will be incredible for us for years!

2669~~~
Showing up some journalists with this performance against one of the best defences after such a long lay off.

2670~~~
needs to be first choice and rested often. could easily be the best left back in the world.

2671~~~
What a quality player, could be one of the best deals we've ever done. 

He's still young but looks so experienced. Superb tonight.

2672~~~
I think people just forgot how good he is/can be because he hasn't played for awhile.

Should always be first choice when fit IMO.

2673~~~
Our best player today just taken off. If that's not an injury with the likes of RVP on the bench and Falcoa still on I am very bemused. 

Went and sat down didn't get any treatment.

2674~~~
He's just back from a hamstring injury and spent 80 minutes running the length of the pitch, makes sense to take him off.

2675~~~
LVG is very strict with game fitness, he's only been back in training a week, that's why he was taken off.

2676~~~
Useless feck Blackett..

2677~~~
Very good game for his first one back. If he plays like that every week he's our clear and first choice leftback

2678~~~
He was very good. Dangerous runs and also played a very nice through ball to Falcao when he hit outside of the post.

Adds a different dimension to our team.

2679~~~
Class in the second half. Our only attacking threat.

Shame he had to come off.

2680~~~
Best player for us today perhaps. Constant threat. Thought he was going to struggle to get into the side with Blind doing so well but that performance simply reminded me how good Shaw can be. Impressed and chuffed for him.

2681~~~
He was great going forward I thought.

2682~~~
We lost all impetus when he came off. It would've been good to see him link up with Di Maria in the last 10. He was obviously not fit enough though.

2683~~~
I thought he was great. I hope he starts again next week.

2684~~~
He'll be a monster in future. What a performance.

2685~~~
Our best player on the pitch. Great performance. Blind back to midfield please.

2686~~~
Much better second half <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>.

2687~~~
Been very, very good today, him and McNair were probably our best players easily.

2688~~~
Looked the most likely to make something happen, beastly at times powering down his flank.

2689~~~
Where are all the feckers who were moaning about his performance today? You guys need to get your eyes checked.

2690~~~
Our left-back for many years to come. Just needs to stay injury free and a couple of years experience and he'll be a top player.

Happy to see him prove the doubters wrong today.

2691~~~
Very promising performance. He was bit shy in the first half but he was excellent later on.

When he started niggling I wanted to break my TV, but luckily it was nothing(hopefully).

2692~~~
Hopefully he will be a big player for us next season, he's a great talent.

2693~~~
I love this kid. This is why I want him to be the starting LB even when Blind is back. He has electrifying pace, he is physically strong and what I love most about him he is a fighter and not in a reckless way. He will not allow anyone to push him off the ball. I also think he should have played the full 90 minutes it might have been good for him mentally to have to push himself.

2694~~~
That showed why we paid the money for him.

I think he looked a bit knackered towards the end of the 1st half but he got his second wind. Now lets keep him fit and see him in a run of games.

2695~~~
Created two 100 % chances with inventive passing and attacking play. Our best player today I thought.

2696~~~
Serious pace. Had a few iffy moments where he looked rusty, but overall looked really dangerous. Shame we didn't see him and Di Maria together, since Blackett doesn't have a clue how to overlap.

2697~~~
Him and McNair really were our best players today which is a bit sad given that we needed a top notch performance from our attacking force. I just hope he can stay injury free now for a longer time so he can really develop properly over the next few seasons.

2698~~~
Excellent game. Should not have been taken off.

2699~~~
Heard something about a hamstring? I really wanted him to stay on but long term it might have been for the best. Was our biggest threat today, man of the match.

2700~~~
His best performance for United. Absolutely superb.

I was beginning to think he might struggle to displace Blind but he's juts reminded me of how good he is.

2701~~~
He's bloody good. Wasn't rusty at all after not playing for a long time. And he is so quick<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2702~~~
In the second half the only times we really looked dangerous was when we got Shaw in behind. I was baffled by his substitution. Blackett was as effective as a wet blanket in a thunderstorm.

2703~~~
Immense today. Best player along with Herrera. And to think i was worried about Blind not playing.

2704~~~
Great game. Stay fit.

2705~~~
I think he's shut anyone up for thinking that he's been our worst signing; terrific performance.

2706~~~
An outstanding talent.

2707~~~
I know Drogba is only slightly more mobile than my Granny at this stage, but Shaw robbing him and leaving him for dead was class.

2708~~~
Retire to count his money at 25? 

There's a lot to be said for it.

2709~~~
He's been top class defensively all season but he finally had a game where he was amazing going forward as well. Taking him off killed the game for us.

2710~~~
My thoughts exactly. I checked the Caf at half time and couldn't believe that some actually thought he was playing badly. He threatened them more than anyone else in our team imo.

2711~~~
Very promising today. Great athlete and a natural defender. Plenty of time to develop that general footballing ability and eventually he could become a very good left back. Most important thing is to keep fit though. Too many injuries can seriously stall growth so hopefully he can avoid the treatment table from now on.

2712~~~
Has anyone who wanted Blind as our first choice LB changed their mind now? Blind is a more intelligent (for now) but he's never gonna be capable of the sort of penetration and cover Shaw is, Shaw is much better at taking the ball in his stride and is simply way way faster.

2713~~~
for the first time playing behind a winger and he does well, what a surprise. It's been really a great performance from him considering how much time he was off.  I'm glad for him he was our best attacking player today, shame Valencia, Mata or Fellaini, Falcao weren't on the same level we could easily win this game with luck not being completely on Chelsea's side..

2714~~~
Plus I think a lot of Blind's best qualities would be wasted playing FB full time. He shows much more potential as a midfielder.

2715~~~
His best performance for us, and considering he hasn't played in about 100 years (it feels) it was even more impressive. He and McNair were great today.

2716~~~
Yeah this too. I've sung Blind's praises in response to people who want to buy another DMF to cover and eventually replace Carrick, its not that I dont like blind, far from it... Just not as a left back.

2717~~~
There were some strange comments in the matchday thread, especially at half time. A couple of guys were laying into him. Odd I thought

2718~~~
Amen to that. Our 2 best players today. Immense.

2719~~~
I'm presuming he's injured again now?

Shame, as he had a good game.

2720~~~
If we had no other options, I would like to see Shaw at left wing and Blind at left back for once to see how they match up.

2721~~~
No I dont think so. I think it was a precaution he came off.

2722~~~
Shaw was very good today. Not sure how he can be critiqued after not playing for so long and then walking straight in to the toughest fixture of the year and then doing this. He was good regardless of circumstances and I loved the way he just kept on getting forward even just before being subbed.

2723~~~
Excellent today. Absolutely brilliant. Was our biggest threat today, and he went off, it showed.

2724~~~
Very good performance. Quite a good player we've got here.

2725~~~
I don't think so, this was his first game and LVG is obsessed with 'match rhythm' so he probably came off as a precaution.

2726~~~
He offer everything Blind does (though some at a slightly lower level due to him being only 18 years old vs a 24 year old) +  he's a much better defender, quicker and has a real ability to drive the ball forward.

2727~~~
His performance was definitely the highlight of today. Like most people, I was shocked by the sub as I fancied we'd get a penalty at least if he carried on making his driving runs into the box. After a full pre-season with Van Gaal, I think we'll see any lingering fitness issues sorted out.

2728~~~
Shame he was subbed, excellent today.

2729~~~
For someone who hasn't played much and has had questions of fitness directed at him, he did much better today than he had any right to. A real threat down the left and I hope it leads to an extended run in the team. He's gonna be one of the best in his position, no doubt.

2730~~~
I think it must have been a pre-planned sub to make sure he got no reouccurance of the hamstring injury. Everybody knows the last 10 minutes is when your the most tired/injuries happen.

Gutted though as he was the only person who was making real use of the space, and when Blackett came on it completely killed our momentum.

2731~~~
I thought he started solid defensively, but a little hesitant going forward. He looked better and better going forward as the game went on though. I just hope him going off was precautionary, rather than turning out to be an injury like all the others after the City game.

2732~~~
It was a fitness issue. Van Gaal was protecting the player. He shouldn't criticised for that.

2733~~~
very good match from him.

2734~~~
Best player on the pitch for me. I've been puzzled why hes not been in the team but i'm guessing like Rafael LvG doesnt fancy him

2735~~~
He was fecking brilliant, that's why I've been calling on him to get his LB spot back from Blind immediately! He offers so much pace and power.

2736~~~
Excellent performance from him, especially considering he was out for so long.

2737~~~
He has to get Blind in somewhere when Carrick is fit, no way he will ever leave him out when he's fit.

2738~~~
I still have to remind myself that he's 19 years old, incredible for someone his age to easily deal with the toughness of the Premier League.

2739~~~
He clearly fancies him, but LvG likes his players to have trained sufficiently after being injured.

2740~~~
Forget the comparisons with Ashley Cole. He's more Luke Maldini in his style of play. Ok maybe that's a bit too much too soon, but he really has a similar throwback no nonsense approach to the game, maturity and composure beyond his years, effortless balance in defense and attack, and almost identical physical stature in an era where short, nimble fullbacks are considered the norm. Just needs to stay fit and we don't even have to worry about the left back position for a long long time. Heir to the consistently excellent and reliable Irwin, Evra role. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2741~~~
Why did he go off? 

Was great today, just needs to improve on his crossing

2742~~~
Very good today,being subbed is also a good thing and good decision. You need to tick few boxes in LvG world so you say that you are fit also you need to do few things after injury if you want to be fit to play.

2743~~~
LvG protecting him from injury.

2744~~~
Sometimes I think GUardiola and LVG have the same thought process.. pack the team with as much midfielders as you can...  See Valencia play right back as a midfielder... Blind plays left back as a midfielder.. See McNair and the way he plays CB, as a midfielder....

2745~~~
BEAST MODE

2746~~~
Nah, a lot of the time when fit, Shaw has played. Problem has been around the Arsenal game it looked like he was slipping over the place a fair bit and might have tweaked something hence coming off around half time and not playing since, just to try and build his fitness back up I guess.

Yep, with the amount of running Shaw was doing on his first game back, no point in getting him to play the full 90 and risk an injury. Guessing RVP wasn't used as any of the subs as he wasn't fit enough and was just on the bench as a last resort.

2747~~~
He's fast as shit. It's almost like he doesn't believe it himself sometimes. I just wanted him to keep running and get behind Ivan, but he kept stopping. I don't know if LvG has his full backs on a leash in certain situations, but I'd like to see him just go at his opposite number more. His pace is something else. Looking forward to seeing him when he's 100% fit and is in good match rhythm.

He's got a good head on him too, seems to always make the right decisions, his link up play is good, and he keeps the ball well. Defensively strong too. He's a tough little blighter. Hope he can stay fit and see out the season strongly.

2748~~~
Proper perfomance.

2749~~~
Nothing needs to be said about his performance that hasn't already been said, but...

what about his first touch? Can't think of a full back with a better touch.

2750~~~
It would be harsh to leave out Young though.

2751~~~
Needs to start vs Everton

2752~~~
Just a far better left back than Blind. His pace on the overlap is brilliant.

2753~~~
Yep when he's playing one 2 or running in from deeper his pace and then composure on the ball at that pace is great.

But when he comes face to face with a defender due to lack of dribbling ability he checks back too much. What i want him to do more is just kick the ball in behind and chase it like Bale does. Just use your raw pace, nothing fancy.

2754~~~
Decent first half, better second half. Lost momentum when he went off and pretty much killed our chance of an equaliser when it was Blackett that came on for him.

He will get better especially with a preseason with us. Looks like he could take over Evra long term especially if we play a possession based game like the game proved.

2755~~~
He's scarily good for his age.

2756~~~
Was class for the most part. Started really well, then was frustrating for the second half of the first half as he turned back every time and never looked to run past someone. Second half was really good though. Now if only he can stay fit.

2757~~~
Really took his chance well and far better pass/cross selection than I remember in previous games for us.

2758~~~
"Oh Luke Shaw/oh Luke Shaw/how lovely are your surges"

2759~~~
Very good performance for his first match in a while, such a talent this lad.

2760~~~
His burst of his speed is ridiculous. Needs to use to more often.

2761~~~
We have some competition for the left back spot <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2762~~~
Think we've finally seen the real Luke Shaw, and the reason why we spent so much money on him. A lot of people remain skeptical of him but he's clearly going to be a top class player.

2763~~~
Needs to stay fit and in five years there may be no match for him on the left.

Ridiculously big potential for his age.

2764~~~
I'm not one to criticise LvG but I can't help but think we could have been much better had Shaw and Rafael been playing when fit.

Thought Shaw was brilliant today, such drive and power when surging forward. Gets us on the front foot.

2765~~~
For the most part Shaw has been playing when available, it is just from the Arsenal match he stopped being played, with the reasons around that not entirely known, but he wasn't looking great in that game and the time out seems to have done him good.

2766~~~
when we create the space for him so he doesnt have to dribble he is absolutely fantastic. The thing i love about him is that he doesnt just cross the ball into random area like most of our players, he looks before he puts the final ball.

2767~~~
He's already good enough to be a regular starter, but if he improves his attacking play, he's gonna be one of the best full-backs in the world.

2768~~~
And based on what he displayed today when he cut towards the inside, he will be getting there for sure.

2769~~~
Would love to see more of Shaw/Di Maria linking up down the left

2770~~~
He was absolutely class, the cut back for the earlier Rooney chance was great. Something which I thought he lacked but he proved me wrong.

More of this Luke!

2771~~~
Any word on his injury?

2772~~~
Not sure he was injured as he just sat on the bench. Think it was something planned, and with him running as much as he did, best not to play him full 90 mins on his first game back in action

2773~~~
I think this was his best game for us, Chelsea struggled to keep up with him at times and he created one of our best chances! 

I just hope LVG is doing to him what he did with Herrera and then let him loose!!!

2774~~~
Yep, looked like a textbook pre-planned substitution to me. Shame for Di Maria, if he'd come on ahead of a marauding Shaw there would have been real holes to exploit. You could see how frustrated he was with Blackett repeatedly neglecting to overlap.

It's easy to think of Shaw as just fast and strong, but his delicacy of touch and range of passing are superb. And he seems to have that Rooney quality of being thick as two short planks in real life but having oodles of 'football intelligence', because his decision making really stands out too. The way he chooses his passes is almost like a Carrick type player sometimes, reading the game and taking the right action to help the whole team into the right shape or position.

2775~~~
He started off like a train, great work and linkup play down the left before then fading away and taking the sage option. But fair play to him, he turned on beast mode in the second half and was deservedly the man of the match until Van Gaal decided to take him off for the hopeless Blackett. 

Going forward, he was miles better than any other performance we've seen from him so I'm glad we've got a solid option there should Blind be injured. In fact, if he keeps this going, Blind may have to play elsewhere or on the bench altogether.

2776~~~
Top class performance, barring any injuries, we're sorted on the left hand side for the next decade.

2777~~~
Should always start when fit, will probably finish his career with 100caps. Just a mega talent really.

2778~~~
This place is maddeningly bipolar. He was great today, but there was no element of his performance that hasn't been on show a couple of times at least in the season already. Yet before the game loads of people seemed to have written him off and wanted him replaced by Blind for good, and now everyone thinks we're definitely sorted for 10 years and he's nailed on to be a star.

He's had an injury-plagued season but been good when he's played, with moments of real promise, and today was the first time he showed it consistently for the entire match. Opinions definitely shouldn't have yo-yo'd so violently.

2779~~~
I thought he was excellent and easily the best player on the pitch when he was taken off. Regardless of whether or not the substitution was planned, he should have stayed on, he was running the show. And even a half fit Shaw is a far far better option than Blackett.

2780~~~
That's absurdly short-termist. If Shaw had stayed on against medical advice to not play the full 90, and then picked up a stress injury in training next week, everyone would have been throwing up their hands, bemoaning our injury record, writing him off as a permacrock and whining that we should have signed Rodriguez instead.

As a manager if you've decided that a player isn't fit enough to play the whole match, you have to stick by that decision and take them off no matter what's happening. This wasn't the CL final, it was a game which LVG will have been expecting us to drop points in, and we're in a position where we could afford to drop those points. Getting Shaw injured on the off chance that he'd create a goal in the last ten minutes wouldn't have done our season any favours.

2781~~~
Funny reading some comments and only having to go back to last week to hear the same people saying Blind should be the LB next season.

Was a great display from Shaw and exactly what you want from him.

2782~~~
That's what I was thinking. A week ago he was a flop that we overpaid for and was a long way off first choice, now he is back to being a top prospect who should be playing more regularly.

2783~~~
Good in patches, wouldnt say he was any better than good but he did well at times. Think he will improve next season as he will take better care of himself over his summer break after the u21 championship.

2784~~~

2786~~~
I missed the first 15/20 minutes of the match today, when I started watching all I saw was Shaw doing his usual run down the wing, stop, cut back or pass back, slow down the play and end another one of our possible attacks. I was a little hasty and posted in the match day thread saying that he is overrated and I have never seen him do anything to warrant a place at United etc I was quickly shot down in the thread for criticising him so I must of missed his moments of good play up until that point. Anyway I do take most of that back now as after that point and especially in the second half he had a great game and I guess that is the real Luke Shaw that we saw some of today, hope he can keep it up.

2787~~~
Yeah he did very well in the first 20 mins, then tailed off a bit for the rest of the half. Here's a very good chance he created for Rooney:

2788~~~
Not to rain on anyone's parade in here because Shaw was good today, but Ivanovic has been getting absolutely destroyed pretty frequently for quite a while this season. Even by subpar players he's been getting skinned. Anyone with decent pace can have the better of him.

This is why Willian is so important to our team. Think Shaw would've had a much tougher time of it today had he played. He's constantly putting a shift at both ends of the pitch and would've stuck to shaw much better than Oscar and Ivanovic did.

2789~~~
Do you think Mourinho misjudged how effective our left side would be? Alright, Shaw's only just come in for the game but most of our attacks have been on the left side of our team for a while now. I thought it was a bit weird having Oscar when Willian would have been more suited like you say.

2790~~~
I think he was very concerned about Young as he's been arguably your best player over your recent run. We basically shut him down which was obviously something the team worked on a lot during the week.

Shaw clearly caught us off guard. Don't think any of our players really knew what to expect.

2791~~~
Like I've said many times before, I haven't seen a better full back at that age. Like many I thought no way he could come in and produce to the extent Blind has done during this run but he comes in and puts in a performance like that. It was criminal that left side domination did not lead to goal and Rooney robbed him of an assist he thoroughly deserved for his performance.

2792~~~
He probably focused more on Young, not knowing what to expect from Shaw.

He has showed today why i wanted him so much 10 months ago <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2794~~~
We didn't miss Blind as LB because McNair was taking that role as the passer from the back. If we go back to have Jones as CB, Blind should be back as LB.

2795~~~
Great performance from Shaw. Has natural acceleration. Will get even better once he clears these niggling injuries and lose another 3kg.

2796~~~
He was bloody brilliant.

Defensively he has always been solid for his age and his pace, My god.

Just need to be lucky and stay fit now.

2797~~~
Played well can't wait till he learns the timing of the over lap he's going to be awesome for us!

2798~~~
Bloody love Luke I do.

Not so much his haircut...

2799~~~
That article on page 66 is bullshit, Shaw came straight into the team and played as if he'd been playing all season.

2800~~~
For some reason his talent doesn't seem obvious to a lot of people. I really don't know why. I think the kid is going to be great and on the whole barring a mistake here and there he's been good whenever he's played. Yes sometimes he's not been great going forwards and not crossed well but he's only a kid and his game is extremely refined for a teenager. 

If he isn't one of the best left backs in the game in a few years I'll be surprised.

2801~~~
The most positve aspect of his performance was his ability to keep the game moving forward even when closed down. 

I loved it when he would fake to go back but then nudge it inwards and use the space within the midfield to drive into space and regenerate momentum for the teams attack. He made it look easy and it is something he used to do all the time at Saints but too nervous to do it here.

2802~~~
His poor performances have come when he's been asked to play as wingback and nobody is in front of him.

He's much better when he has a winger in front of him. Even Gary Neville would have  looked poor as a wing back because he won't have anyone in front of him to give space to cross.

2803~~~
Thought he was impressive in his first game back. Will be interesting to see what happens when Blind is fit again.

2804~~~
It's ridiculous that he's so good at 19. Fitness permitting he'll be the best LB in the world in 2 years time.

2805~~~
I think that Shaw could be an excellent wingback if he had more confidence in his obvious ability to leave people for dead.

2806~~~
Just watched MOTD and I'd forgotten just how many times he was excellent going forward. It'll be good to give Blind a bit of a rest... He's had a busy season!

2807~~~
Thought that was his best performance of the season. So much so that subbing him off really robbed us of our impetus.

2808~~~
Keep on forgetting he's 19. What a talent.

2809~~~
I think we would be awesome with both Shaw and Rafael in the fullback spots.

Shaw took us up a notch yesterday and really got us on the front foot.

2810~~~
Great to see him having a good game, can understand lvg subbing him off given the time he's been out. With the injuries we'll no doubt need him for the run in, so really wasn't worth pushing him to 90 mins just to chase a point.

2811~~~
Completely agree that it changed the game but let's be honest, that has as much to do with Blackett being a really awful LB. He was scared to even go beyond di María and looked incredibly timid on the ball. 

Still, that's the kind of performance from Shaw that we expect and should expect for years to come as the bare minimum. He really is very impressive technically. Even more so than Blind IMO. Lovely first touch, great weight of pass and controls the ball well at great speed. He's a better defender than Blind too. The biggest difference between them has been confidence and a willingness to impose themselves on the game. At the moment Shaw still seems a little timid whereas Blind is making an impact over and over again.

2812~~~
Unfortunately people see his frame and start saying the lazy rhetoric that he's fat, or has lack of pace like this:

2813~~~
Partly that, as well as partly the fact that Blackett and Di Maria had no communication and rhythm together, whereas Shaw and Young were much more effective, as we are Blind and Young.

2814~~~
I remember that, what an absurd comment.

2815~~~
If we do get Depay, that could set our left side up for the next 10 years. Vital that he forms a good partnership with whoever is ahead of him. With Di Maria, he ignores him too much and opts to cut inside. Young is great at allowing overlaps and Shaw looked great due to it.

2816~~~
Indeed, everyone was grill Shaw about going forward when he played with Di Maria when in truth he used ignore his overlap runs 95% of the time.

2817~~~
I thought he was brilliant yesterday. Very good going forward and solid defensively. He's a very talented lad and I'm sure he'll be our starting left back for the foreseeable future.

2818~~~
Yeah, Young and Shaw are suited to one another... Di Maria and Shaw not so much as Di Maria ignores the overlap runs for whatever reason.

2819~~~
The amount of times he was free in space only for Di Maria to ignore him was annoying as feck. One of Youngs best features is how well he links with the full back, be it Blind, Shaw, or formerly Evra.

2820~~~
That was an impressive game by Shaw against Chelsea, especially in the first half when him and Young were tearing up the left flank. Need him to stay fit and get some game time now. Did not look like a player who has conditioning issues playing the way he played yesterday. Needs to work on his crossing on the run in the summer and he will be ready for next season.

2821~~~
Really? I haven't been watching him that closely but I could have sworn everyone's been going on about how he's one of the most solid defenders in the league this season? I've always had him down as a brilliant defender, particularly against pace and strength, which was part of what was so pleasing about the way Shaw tore past him.

2822~~~
Yeah, it's literally been the opposite of what that poster said. He's extremely solid defensively, and never tends to have a problem against pace as his positioning is great and once he gets his body in between he goes down very easily for a routine free kick. I think Shaw was just simply TOO fast for him, once he got going there was nothing that Ivanovic could do. Also, Shaw's first touch is quality - he often brings it across the defender meaning he's in complete control (Ivanovic's yellow card yesterday)

2823~~~
Ok, thought so cheers. Yep, he's got an incredibly delicate touch when running at pace. The two touches which took him clean round Ivanovic and forced a foul in the second half were superb. And he's the perfect build to be a running fullback in the modern mould - pacy but with a low centre of gravity (so good acceleration and balance), powerful but compact, so it's hard to knock him off course when he's running but he's not clumsy or top heavy.

2824~~~
Played yesterday pretty much exactly how he's played every time this season at left back in a back four. I.e very bloody well. Its just that people were ignoring this. 

I honestly haven't got a single worry about him. The kid is fantastic and will be our left back for many years to come (barring injury or the like)

2825~~~
Basically this, he's mint! Easily one of our players that I'm most excited about.

2826~~~
Bang on.

2827~~~
To be fair he always got huge praise on the Caf for his defending, it was his going forward people used criticize which I don't agree with. It was more so Di Maria ignoring his over lapping and forward runs.

It's scary how good he is at 19, he can easily be the best left back in the world if he puts in the work and avoids injury.

2828~~~
I was about to say the same. And there were numerous games earlier in the season where he didn't offer much going forward - there's no getting around that.  However in hindsight I think this was because of his poor partnership with di Maria (aka di Maria's greed on the ball) and the 352 not suiting him.

2829~~~
He's feckin rapid!

2830~~~
Wrong. I've obviously watched every second of every match we've played this season.

Over on the Chelsea forum I post on the vast majority of us have been calling for him to be dropped, Azpi to move to RB, and Filipe Luis to become a regular. Ivanovic was a beast defensively during that period of the season where we were flying and couldn't be stopped. He's been very poor for months now.

He gets caught miles out of position thinking he's a winger and leaves that side of the pitch vulnerable. He then either gets burnt by a pacey winger or a ball from midfield over the top (like you guys did repeatedly yesterday). This is the main reason our defense has looked much more susceptible compared to last season. Ivanovic gets caught out and Cahill gets exposed.

He obviously has it in him to be fantastic. Best in the league when on form. But for much of this season you can tell that he isn't a natural fullback.

2831~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-manchester-united-move-9075119" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...news/luke-shaw-manchester-united-move-9075119</a>

2832~~~
Could be one of the greats. Potential is pretty frightening watching him yesterday. Has had a few very public knocks this year and has coped really well with them for such a young guy. Excited to see what sort of a season he has next time out.

2833~~~
People questioning his pace? He's rapid!

2834~~~
He was pretty good but his final ball was awful and he needs to start practising how to put in accurate crosses. No good doing a fancy dribble into the box if you're just going to waste it by giving the ball back to Chelsea or giving them a goal kick.

2835~~~
Are you serious? I was looking at his performance again, he provided Rooney with that only good chance, he played a good pass to Falcao, he cut back for Mata, he put in crosses for Fellaini to pass on to Rooney. That's good decision making to me.

2836~~~
I remember the Rooney chance but don't really remember those other moments you mentioned. In the second half he could have provided Falcao with a tap in but instead cut it back to Rooney for no reason.

2837~~~
I thought he was fecking fantastic on Saturday. I haven't been worried about him coming good eventually anyway but it was still nice to see him play so well and give everyone a glimpse of how good he's going to be. 

Injuries have ruined his debut season but he should be our first choice left back for the next 10 years at least. Signing him will be a great bit of business.

2838~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2839~~~
Perfectly put Djemba

2840~~~
Fantastic tweet. Just the sort of thing the players need to hear publicly.

2841~~~
it doesn't work on football manager... every fecking time i praise a player publicly they react negatively to it. since i learned my listen i only berate my players publicly - never, ever praise them.

2842~~~
Good to see, I am sure LvG knows he has a player he can mold into a top LB on his hands.

2843~~~
Really impressed with his performance v Chelsea. Consistency will come, but the talent shines through. Can see him being our LB for the next decade.

2844~~~
Agree.

For most of the season Shaw has underwhelmed going forward. Too often he passed the ball back to a teammate instead of trying to run down the line. When he's got into good crossing positions, most of his crosses failed to beat a defender or he took too long and the chance passed him by.

The Chelsea performance showed not one bit of any of that. And its nothing new to me, because I saw him do the same things - dribble past players and pick out a teammate very well - when he was at Southampton last season. These werent things that came from nowhere, these were things he's already shown he can do. He just needs to believe in and want to do that more often than earlier in the season when he was content not to penetrate down his wing and just keep the ball by passing it inside.

2845~~~
Lads, he's 19 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Plenty of time to work on his forward game, especially with LVG as his coach.

2846~~~
Age has nothing to do with repeating what you've already shown

2847~~~
Age and consistency are obviously linked together in sport.

2848~~~
Thats nothing to do with repeating what he's already shown he can do with consistancy.

He's done it, so he can do it again. Doesnt matter if he's 28 or 15

2849~~~
Of course it matters! Expecting a 19 year old to consistently maintain a top level of performance across multiple seasons is unrealistic. We've seen many young players have a great break out season followed by a slight dip in performance. Consistency comes with age and experience.

2850~~~
Of course it has. Inconsitency is much more common in young players than in older more experienced players.

2851~~~
Its not consistancy

Its belief

One season he consistantly does something, the next he doesn't try it. Is Antonio Valencia inconsistant?

2852~~~
He's played 19 games and has been a sub, or subbed off very early in 7 of those. He hasn't really had a season, it's been wrecked by injury. Can't judge him on anything yet imo.

2853~~~
I dont know why nobody is bothering to read the whole post. I'm praising him and saying it shouldnt be a surprise because thats what he was doing at Southampton. He just needs to believe in the ability he clearly already has because he's already shown it, which is what he did against Chelsea and that was fantastic.

2854~~~
I'm with you on that one, at times earlier on in the season he's seemed a little overwhelmed by the scale of the club and this has hit his confidence a little bit, choosing the easier option to avoid making mistakes. There's no doubt he has it in his locker as proven by the Chelsea game, more performances like that and he'll be our first choice left back for the next 10/12 years.

2855~~~
Just like De Gea was supposed to be our Goalie for the next fifteen years? The fact is we could help him be the best in the world and in three years he could stall on a new deal, force his dream move and we are back to square one. From now on we need to reserve that priveledge for our own graduates like McNair and Blackett.

2856~~~
Okay <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2857~~~
Had the same problem as Smalling, constantly had to cover for the defender next to him and at times for Blind, but also looked the most likely to set up a chance for us.

2858~~~
Thought he was one of our best players. Have no issues with him in the long term, think he will be brilliant for us.

2859~~~
2 posts today?! Posters love focusing on the negatives, eh?

Him and Smalling were the stand out performers today.

2860~~~
Very good again today. Solid defensively and probably our best player going forward too

2861~~~
Agreed.

2862~~~
He's going to be a star here. 2 games back and he was our most dangerous player.

He sounds like the thickest footballer out there, but his footballing intelligence is wise beyond his years. His runs towards the bylines, both the timing and the pace at which he does it, is on the same level that Evra used to do, and that guy has over a decades' more experience than Luke. Right now he seems like our best outlet by far, and we should focus on our attack coming predominantly from that left hand side next season, hopefully with Depay coming in to add extra threat.

2863~~~
Indeed, a new CB and a new RB and we'll have a very solid defence. Shaw seems to have gotten a bit of confidence after his performance against CChelsea, he was good today.

2864~~~
a real highlight recently. I just hope we can get a RB equivalent

2865~~~
He's stupidly quick. He breezed by one of their players into the box in the opening ten minutes. Eating the ground up!

2866~~~
Along with Smalling he is probably the only one who can hold their head up. Was quite good today, is getting better at going forward and is almost impossible to stop he is so fast and strong. Got burnt a couple times by Lennon but then Lennon used to routinely roast the shit out of Evra consistently. Just going to be and already is a great player.

2867~~~
Put in two scrumptious tackles today. One on Lennon and the other one on Barkley (?) where they got a bit hurt. First one was especially terrific to be honest, made it look so easy.

2868~~~
Really excited about Shaw, if he can get over his injuries he will be fantastic for us.

2869~~~
I can't remember exactly who it was but around the time of the World Cup an Italian legend highlighted him as one of the world's top young players, he said that he already plays like a veteran at 18.

2870~~~
He is brilliant. Our left side scary good once we play a world class wide player in front of him.

2871~~~
Frustrating.

2872~~~
Injured ... again.

2873~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2874~~~
His groin? It must be from wearing those skin tight pants.

2875~~~
Groin injury.

2876~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2877~~~
Terrible buy so far, needs to sort out the injuries and go try a personal physio or something.

2878~~~
Gash statement.

2879~~~
Averaged 33 league games over the past two seasons. Signs for United. Boom! Sicknote. What the hell?!?

2880~~~
Is it ok to lump him in the same category as the rest of out sick note defenders yet?

2881~~~
He's played 3 brilliant matches for us so far, and we paid over 30 million pounds. So far, that is terrible. But yeah he's 19, still has enough years to make that fee worthy.

2882~~~
33 games a season is an awful lot for a 17/18 year old. I wonder if that's played a part?

2883~~~
He's so injury prone now. Ridiculous

2884~~~
He's like the anti-Evra... burn him with fire!

2885~~~
I'm probably one of his biggest fans on this forum but to be honest that he is now again injured is really a joke <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2886~~~
Which he clearly will, his talent undeniable.

He will get over this period of injury and settling in and become a fantastic left back I'm sure.

2887~~~
The fact he is injured again is very frustrating. He has shown his quality though, so hopefully over summer he can get his body right.

2888~~~
He arrives less fit than we need him to be > we presumably put him on a more intensive fitness regime than he's used to > he picks up more injuries than usual.

He's a young player, maybe he just needs time to adapt to the increased intensity here?

2889~~~
Not yet.

2890~~~
Every time this thread gets bumped I expect to read that he got injured again. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Unfortunately that's almost always true. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2891~~~
Maybe after five years of always suffering injuries, we will review our training methods? Maybe? Especially given players who are picking up injuries werent picking them up at their previous club as frequent as they do with us.

2892~~~
I love how "match rhythm" has now become the official way of saying match fitness. Philosophy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2893~~~
Probably an excuse to move Blind back to LB as he was poor in midfield last week.

2894~~~
feck sake, Shaw is the one I want the most to succeed of the new lads. Gutted with his injuries.

2895~~~
This is how I see it. He played a lot over the past couple of seasons, then last summer went to Brazil for the World Cup. Though he didn't play much, he'd have been training a lot in circumstances that probably wouldn't exactly be comfortable to someone who is still pretty new in senior football. After that he decided to cut his holiday short to join our pre-season tour, van Gaal wasn't happy with his fitness and put him on an intense program, then over the course of the season he'd have been taking part in the regular double training sessions van Gaal does... I think all that would have put way too much strain on his body, explaining the number of injuries he's had this season compared to previously in his career. What he needs more than anything is a good rest this summer and come back to next season better for it, but unfortunately he'll be with the England U21s

2896~~~
You'd have to wonder. Sod's fecking law that he only hit a wall after signing for us.

2897~~~
8 seperate injuries this season apparently. Hopefully it's just one of those things and next season we get a full campaign out of him. His potential is massive.

2898~~~
A long summer without football should set him right, he was at the World Cup last summer which may have played a part.

2899~~~
Let's not forget his body is still growing, could be a reason he keeps getting muscle injuries.

2900~~~
He'll be off to the Czech Republic this summer to take part in the Euro U21 finals unfortunately.

2901~~~
He is injury prone like Jones, Evans and Rafael

I think it's due to their bad life-style.

2902~~~
Well that sucks.

2903~~~
And the Scousers reckon we don't have anyone like Daniel Sturridge...

2904~~~
It's pretty shitty that England will be taking him to the Under 21 world cup considering that he looks like he's in need of a rest. Why risk a player becoming injury prone just to try and win a competition of no real importance

2905~~~
What do you mean?

2906~~~
Have we had the same training methods across the three different managers we had in those five years?

2907~~~
I doubt it. Didnt Moyes do training without a football or something? Anyway, maybe all the players are being worked too hard. All three managers seem strict (though its probably been worse last few years and getting worse).

Either way, you would think this will be reviewed within a club as big as ours and methods would be looked at. You hardly see the likes of Madrid, Barca, Bayern, even Chelsea suffer as many injuries as we do.

2908~~~
Well he's hyphenated lifestyle into two words, so might be a fashion thing. Something to do with skinny jeans?

2909~~~
You'd hope so. You should pop Ed Woodward an email, just in case this hasn't occurred to them yet.

2910~~~
what bad lifestyle?

2911~~~
Hes too busy making it rain money to be bothered about little things like that.

2912~~~
Bayern's had it worse than us in terms of injuries this year

2913~~~
But how many years running has that happened? Granted yeah they might have beaten Dortmund had they had their first team, but this year seems more than a freak than anything for them. Might be wrong but cant remember it happening to them before. (especially in terms of volume of players)

2914~~~
is he?  didn't he play pretty much the entire season last year with Southampton?

2915~~~
And the year before.

2916~~~
The new Rafael?

2917~~~
yup,after all its a groin injury..

2918~~~
Keep on wearing those and a second career as a choirboy might open up.

2919~~~
19 years old, tons of potential. Terrible buy my arse, just needs to sort out his injuries.

2920~~~
Fergie talked about Henderson's running style would give him lots of injury problems....

I think that could actually apply for Shaw and his fat arse.

2921~~~
If you cant play for the club because you're constantly injured, you're a terrible buy so far. Sorting out injuries isnt the easiest thing ever, ask Robben or Hargreaves.

2922~~~
He's a young lad who just moved to one of the top clubs in Europe. Referring to him as a terrible buy in his first year here at the age of 19 is ridiculous to be fair. I'm willing to bet he will turn out to be an excellent left back for us in the future. Vidic and Evra struggled when they first came here and Shaw has arguably been more impressive at a younger age, in his debut season at the club. He does need to sort out his injuries in the future but the talent is undoubtedly there. Has all the attributes to make it here.

2923~~~
The words ; so far, isnt so difficult. So far, he hasnt played many games for us and has been injured more than he's actually playing, so far he just isnt a good buy. He could prove to be that in the future, but his first season here has been a failure.

2924~~~
The new Darren Anderton that lad

2925~~~
I don't recall him being injured as much last season.

2926~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2927~~~
The way things are going I wouldn't be surprised to see him having to sit it out due to injury. Although knowing our luck he'll be fit as a fiddle for them and get injured upon return.

2928~~~
We know Van Gaal wasn't happy with his fitness levels. Maybe whatever training scheme we set up for him causedthose  problems. Question is if he's going to come out on the other side of it a fitter player who doesn't get injured regularly.

2929~~~
I recall he had a couple long layoffs. Watched him a lot because of all the speculation at the time. Also been watching Clyne this season and he's as reliable fitness/availability wise as Valencia

2930~~~
He never missed two matches in a row, hardly long layoffs.

2931~~~
I love Luke Shaw the player.....I think he could surpass Denis Irwin...That's how highly I rate him...

But, these injuries are beginning to take the piss

2932~~~
He was a big loss for the West Brom game.  Would have given us a good overlap with Young and allowed Blind to play the holding role and Herrera to play in his normal position.  That said he would have been told to keep possession at all costs and be patient!

2933~~~
Wouldn't wanna get him confused with the other Luke Shaw.

2934~~~
Well Luke Shaw the man...Wouldn't want anyone getting the wrong idea.....

Although, I have had women with fat arses like him

2935~~~
I have a friend called Luke Shaw and a friend called James Wilson.

True story.

2936~~~
What ideas could anyone possibly get? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Bet you could bag a few birds by telling them you're friends with them <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2938~~~
Irwin was much more hardy and not prone to weak injuries. He is good but I don't think he will reach the level of Irwin.

2939~~~
He's Brit erm young just give him a 2-7 chance won't you!!!

2940~~~
One has to say we were very lucky to have both Evra and Irwin as our full backs. Superb players and very rarely injured.

If Shaw can even get close their levels he will turn out to be worth the money paid.

2941~~~
well you obviously didn't watch him that closely as he never had long layoffs at all.  Like someone else said, I don't think he ever missed more than 2 matches.  

Just look on wiki - he played 35 matches last season....25 the year before that.  

With you lot...15.  He wasn't injury prone till he joined you.

2942~~~
I said so far, so far he's been injured more thsn he's been playing, everytime he finds a little bit of form, he gets injured. For so far that's terrible, if he sorts these injuries out he'll be a star. Im not saying we should sell him or something.

2943~~~
He has clearly got the ability, its just the injuries hindering his progress the slightest. Unfortunate.

2944~~~
That's cause teams try against us <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2945~~~
Hope he is back for Saturday, will really need his speed/strength against Zaha/Bolasie.

2946~~~
Young players who are plagued by injuries never seem to achieve the heights. Seen a number of full backs since Tony Dunne and Shaw has the makings. I just think it's going to be a challenge now for him to cross the threshold into greatness. Mind you I hope he does.

2947~~~
in all seriousness - isn't it mostly in training he's getting injured?

That never happened to him at Southampton (not as often anyway).  Your players (especially defenders) do seem to be very injury prone.  Are you guys torturing them in training?!

2948~~~
Horribly unlucky season for Shaw. Feel sorry for him.

2949~~~
This one can't be blamed on him, very unlucky. Elbow/arm to the nose can do damage.

2950~~~
Unlucky and hoping these are just for this season.

2951~~~
RIP

2952~~~
Might not be his fault, but he is making a habit of this.

2953~~~
Aye, awful habit of being elbowed in the face receiving what looks to be a broken nose and a bout of concussion.

2954~~~
Isn't there a mandatory no-play period if it's confirmed as concussion?

2955~~~
Yeah let's throw him under a bus because he gets a freak injury that has nothing to do with muscle or ligaments or something affecting his movement. He gets hit in the face, draws blood and is concussed. Grow up

2956~~~
Couple of weeks or something I think. Pretty sure other players have received concussion this season and have been able to play in the following week though. We'll see what happens.

2957~~~
It's a disgrace, I'm not having it from Luke.

2958~~~
I'm pleasantly surprised, I was sure people would somehow be blaming him for the injury.

2959~~~
Poor lad can't buy a free from injury spell, he looked concussed.

2960~~~
Looks a proper fanny to me. May be a broken nose but he looks like he has just been 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.
The girl needs to drink some Iron Bruce and man the feck up. 
I bet LVG hates him for been such a soft cnut.

2961~~~
Unlucky season for him. Came back unfit from the World Cup and then the constant injuries.

2962~~~
If he was concussed then he had to go off, end of.

2963~~~
Let's hope he has better luck with injuries next season, unbelievable how many he's gotten this season. More injury prone then Rafael at this point.

A proper pre season will do him the world of good, hopefully he doesn't go to the u21 championships.

2964~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nonsense. Hopefully someone elbows you in the face soon-ish.

2965~~~
Just so long as he never spars with Rooney. Kid's got a glass jaw.

2966~~~
Hope he's alright. Looked pretty out of it.

2967~~~
Aw, does your Mum know your online?

2968~~~
Your mum does.

2969~~~

2970~~~
<img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/>

2971~~~
I think he needs to change his name to lucky.

2972~~~
He's starting to make Rafael look like the Man of Steel.

2973~~~
That elbow was barely an elbow. If he was concussed off of that, he should retire immediately because heading the ball will concuss him and quickly give him severe brain damage. 

You're a professional athlete. Are you injured, or are you hurt? He was hurt. Stand up, change shirts and get the feck on with it. Honestly I was embarrassed for him.

2974~~~
at least he's having a wide variety of reasons to come off.

at 19/20 it'd be pretty worrying if it was the same injury each time.
a season to forget, but only way is up!

2975~~~
This lads career better not carry on like this. Similar to Phil Jones imo how he can't seem to go a few months without an injury. It really hampered Jones i think not being able to get a consistent run of games and still looks to have barely improved from the first day we signed him. At least jones has been better this season but i don't want to wait 3-4 seasons before Shaw starts to get better then he is already.

2976~~~
Getting an elbow smash in your face is bad luck, not a sign of recurring injuries thankfully. Hope he has some better luck next year before we coin him as the new Rafael.

2977~~~

2978~~~
Weird injury. It looked like something and nothing that just caused a blooded nose. Hard to see why he was so groggy from that, but I guess that's the way his luck has been going this season.

2979~~~

2980~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I've been competitive in Thaiboxing for many years now and I can guarantee you that an elbow/arm in full motion into the nose can be ridiculously painful.

2981~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2982~~~
Do you play sports?? It's all about speed of the impact, if that arm or elbow hit him in the right spot at high speed of course it's going to do feckin damage. It's not because it does not look serious on TV, that the impact wasn't severe. I've seen scrappy body shots do more damage in sparring before than a high kick to the face.

2983~~~
fecking hell some of you lot.<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

Get well soon Luke, love you.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2984~~~
he's like Rafael this season but left back, incredibly unlucky with injuries, how's he with his right foot? or Rodriguez?

2985~~~
If there were a 'yawn' picture you would be getting one x 10.
That looked naff all that he got today.

2986~~~
I guess it's better for him to sit out for the 2 remaining games of the season. It's obvious that he has a concussion and that usually requires him to follow a strict recovery protocol for the next 10 days at least.

2987~~~
I would reply with a smart comeback if only I knew what the feck you are talking about.

2988~~~
Agreed. I'm one of Shaw's biggest fans and love when he plays, though we should not put his mental health at risk for the sake of a game.

2989~~~
Didn't he collide with the Palace player when Fellaini sold him short? That was what I thought caused his injury at the time, not that (what seemed an) innocuous elbow.

2990~~~
Think we need to look into another left back. I like Shaw, but he needs competition, and he can't stay fit either. 

Ricardo Rodriguez depending on the fee would be ideal. If too much, a few years of Coentrao would be decent enough as well

2991~~~
Surely that will be Blind's main role next season if we sign midfielders in the summer?

2992~~~
Possibly yes, but Blind is too slow for me to excel as a full back. Good technique, but it'd be a major worry about getting caught on the break.

2993~~~
Also Young with Memphis coming into that left wing position.

2994~~~
I no longer play sports.

However, I have played both American Football, and Basketball with; 

Multiple broken noses sustained while playing.

1) Chinstrap broke on hit which resulted in helmet pushing back and breaking nose. Kept playing.
2) Broke nose running into team mate (point guard) after coming off of a tight screen. Broke nose in provincial tournament, kept playing after bleeding stopped.
3) Broke nose when another guy got a rebound, came down off his leap and caught me flush on the bridge of the nose with his elbow.

A completely torn ACL while playing football (played entire basketball season senior HS year played with a don joy ACL brace, was a provincial allstar had reconstruction with a patellar graft about 2 weeks after the season once fluid and swelling cleared)

A seperated AC joint. Football.

Sprained Ankles. Basketball.

Broken fingers. Basketball and football.

Sprained fingers. Basketball and football.

I don't consider myself to be a hardass, it's a question of, can you play or can you not play. A nancy little elbow to the face like that, and then to act like you've just gotten head kicked. Sorry. That is some weak ass shit.

2995~~~
They never really showed it much but, where was he bleeding from?

His jersey was stained with blood but I saw nowt on his face <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2996~~~
Probably a bit of a busted up lip. He might have bitten his tongue. Might have been a minor nose bleed, but noses usually bleed more (usually) if they bleed. That looked busted lip/bitten tongue quantities of blood.

2997~~~
Hope he is not going to be at the u21 championship.

He needs a proper summer rest for a start. Incredible to think he rarely missed a game for 2 years at soton but cannot even stay fit and finish a game without injuring himself now.

2998~~~
But the fact remains, it is impossible for us to know how hard or where exactly it hit him.
Like I said if it hit him in the right spot, it could have done damage. You could be right that it is in fact nothing but you can't know that for sure, considering I've seen people get knocked out/get dropped by the shittiest punches you can imagine, yet take all the big blows like it's nothing.

2999~~~
I was wondering if there was another incident that didn't get shown in the replays, so you could be right. It wasn't much of an elbow and it didn't seem to rock him much when it landed.

3000~~~
The NFL has been sued for $750m for not protecting players with concussion. The culture has changed. If he was concussed he was concussed and shouldn't be on the pitch.

3001~~~
fecking hell the caf medical experts are out in full force <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Shaw has shown nothing to be thought of as a 'nancy'. Nothing wrong in taking extra precautions when it's head injuries we're talking about.

3002~~~
This. It's not brave to grit your teeth through injury (or just being hurt lol) it's just stupid to take unnecessary risks. There is a season coming for him after this one, and more importantly there is a whole life after a football career.

3003~~~
He got concussed that is game over as far a as any doctor is concerned.

Its a Different injury.

3004~~~
Why do you call it football if you rarely use your feet? It would be the same if you called handball football.

By the way, clubs are fined and even further action can be taken if found guilty of not taking all precautions possible when handling head injuries. People have died from ignoring such injuries.

3005~~~
That's how I saw it as well, definitely looked like he took a second knock right before going down.

3006~~~
The player doesn't even have a say in it. There are new rules in place to which all Premier League clubs have agreed.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2014-15/aug/premier-league-announces-new-medical-rules-and-policies-for-head-injuries.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/...cal-rules-and-policies-for-head-injuries.html</a>

3007~~~
Very good and sensible rules that.

3008~~~
Completely agree. There's so many things we don't know about the brain yet, we simply can't take the risk.

3009~~~
Hope to see Shaw actually play a game or two next season

3010~~~
Nucky is a proper warrior. not like pantsy tantsy shaw.

3011~~~
How much compensation did you get for the brain damage?

The origins of the word "football" were for something played on your feet, with a ball... hence why you you have Rugby Football, American Football etc.

3018~~~
I've played on with a fractured ankle, sprained ankle and torn ligaments (all on the same glass ankle) but I'm not worth £30 million pound.  

These players are investments for the clubs and they want to get the best out of them so if they take any sort of knock and you have a player on the bench capable of doing the same job then you take them off to protect them from further damage and risk them being out longer than needed.

Broken noses are rarely a problem (as long as the bleeding stops). The rest of your litany in a perfect example of everything that's wrong with High School sports. Irresponsible coaching with no regard to the long term well being of the players. And, as an aside, I'm a little freaked out by the idea of using a patellar graft in an ACL reconstruction for a patient of High School age.

3022~~~
Hope to see him in a proper run of games next season, he's been unlucky.

3023~~~
fecking glass jaw on this lad.

3024~~~
I called it American Football. Yes, it's a silly name, yes that is what it is called.

The reason why it is called Football, is because it was originally a form of Football. You see, it all started way back in like the 1860's and early 1870's. US colleges played a form of association football/rugby hybrid. Princeton and Harvard most noticeably. Then in like 1870(something) Harvard played McGill, both schools had their own rules, and McGill introduced the idea of running with the ball, tackling and "downs". Harvard then took the new rules they got from McGill, introduced them to their own rules then went and played Princeton and the rest is history.

The point is, they started with association football, and kept adding stuff till the game was primarily played with the hands. The name was obviously football originally so they just kept it.


To reply to the people suggesting he was "concussed" if he was actually concussed, then he should retire. He will take headers harder than that elbow and if that elbow legitimately concussed him, he is glass chinned and is liable to be rendered completely unconscious fielding a DDG kick.

For the sake of his health and his brain if he was actually concussed he needs to seriously consider retirement.

Or, as I suspect, he was being a vagine, he should grow a pair and get on with it. I'm no stranger to concussions myself, and yes they suck, it took me almost 8 years to finally stop getting what doctors consider post concussion migraines. However, there is absolutely no normal person that would  a concussion or be concussed from that blow.

3025~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This forum at times.

3026~~~
Playing with a torn ACL is no big deal. It is a matter of pain. You've already done all the damage you can to the tendon, and the donjoy brace takes care of the potential for any other injuries. Yes, it hurt at times. There were times when I would make a cut or plant and I experienced severe pain. I'd get subbed off. Limp to the bench, and literally walk it off. Good to go. 

The graft took fine, however I do have the unfortunate but not uncommon side effect of the dull pressure pain on the outside of the knee. Makes kneeling a pain in the ass. I feel like you got the wrong impression. Every time I carefully weighted the decision, can the injury get worse? Can I injure something else? In all of the cases where it ticked all the boxes and the only negative was pain, I played. My coaches were always in this discussion looking for reasons to NOT let me play.

3027~~~
Solid zinger.

The dude came at me with a "do you even lift bro".

My question is, how much per month do you spend on tampons, not for your missus if you have one.

3028~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ffs.

3029~~~
I read somewhere (internet, probably) that Football, and its many variations (association, rugby, gaelic, american and so on...) were named as such because they were played on foot, as opposed to being played on horseback. Was that a myth?

3030~~~
If only we were all such bad asses.

3031~~~
methinks we have a very expensive sick note...

3032~~~
Indeed..

3033~~~
I’m fed up with him. While we can see potential in him, it’s already his 9 injury for the club, and it’s clearly annoying. Annoying because for what he produced so far, he’s not better than Blind… But Blind is needed in midfield now…

It’s frustrating because we know that he has a big potential, and he has the power and speed to be good enough at the higher level, but he’s too unlucky with his injuries….

I just hope that next year will be his year and he will be back better. For the moment, even if he's bad defensively, I still miss Evra

3034~~~
A completely ruptured ACL won't cause any pain actually. Not once the acute injury has settled anyway. The only symptom is joint instability. And it's a ligament, not a tendon. The clue is in the "L" in "ACL". 

Some awful posts from you in this thread btw. Well done.

3035~~~
I'd pay to watch American Football played on horseback.

3036~~~

3038~~~
Can one of you gif geniuses did through your footage of the game and find the incident where he collided with a Palace player <i>after</i> the elbow and before he hit the deck? That might well have been what did the damage. He didn't look too bothered by the elbow in all the replays I saw.

3039~~~
So good! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Also Nucks you carried on playing through your injuries, sure, but it was while you were playing shit pretend sports. This is football we're talking about, take your pretend sports examples out of this thread please.

3040~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

But seriously, it goes without saying you can't do that in pro sports. Luke Shaw is a huge talent and a massive investment for the club, they're not going to let him risk anything. And that's not even mentioning the human perspective, in terms of that there is a life after an athlete's career.

3041~~~
All non-horseback sports should be played on horseback, and vice versa.

I for one am looking forward to watching former jockeys have a foot-race across a stretch of marshy grass, leaping over a hedge, and falling into massive puddles. The loser gets the lethal injection.

3042~~~
Who cares about american football, lets stick to the subject. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3043~~~
He's been much better than Blind at LB to be fair.

3044~~~
Yeah, he's considerably better than Blind at LB - and I love Blind!

3045~~~
Blind is far too slow to be a LB. Only an option there if we are stuck. I'd play Rojo there ahead of him. No way has he been better than Shaw.

3046~~~
He is much better than Blind, there is a reason we started struggling against Crystal Palace after he left the pitch. Defensively he is very composed for his age, the pace on him is ridiculous as well. Was our best player against at the bridge as well, which is impressive considering that was his 1st game in over a month. If he sorts out his injuries and works on his crossing he could potentially be the best left back in the world, that's how highly I rate him.

Quoted the wrong guy apologies

3047~~~
Wow, Blind vs Tottenham, City, Liverpool forgotten already? Impressive Caf.

3048~~~
30 million so far for a crock who had contributed very little apart from keeping the medical staff busy for god knows how many different injuries. It's alright he will be fine and be the best left back ever, based on what exactly. A good promising season at Southampton? Jones had that at Blackburn. Lallana was also this Southampton teams best player last season and has looked bang average at Liverpool. Shaw has been promising in some games and nothing special in others then falls over with another injury. Hopefully it sorts itself out soon. Not a good signing so far.

Also, blind was very good in those games. Don't know why people are forgetting that.

3049~~~
Do you know how old Shaw is? Google his age. It will help you put things in context.

He had two very good seasons at Soton, by the way.

3050~~~
Do you know how old Jones was when we signed him? Do you know how many injuries shaw had had this season? Do you know lallana was their best player before he left?

Blinds performances in those games were probably the best left back performances we've seen this season, and Shaw has put in that really good game at Chelsea. I'm not caring about his age when discussing his price as age doesn't mean he will be automatically brilliant, it's not a football manager game file.

3051~~~
Ironic that you focus on how much he cost, then accuse others of having a Football Manager approach. 

I was just discussing his performances.

3052~~~
Yes and people are dismissing Blinds good performances at full back whilst declaring Shaw the next best full back in the world.

3053~~~
one year at the club and he's a crock...

This thread is truly amazing.

also Blind has been quite good at LB. 

But in this forum its either + or -, black or white it seems.

3054~~~
Even more amazing when you consider that the latest wave of complaints was triggered by him taking an elbow to his face, like that makes him more injury prone!

3055~~~
Yeah, that's the best part. He lands akwardly and suddenly he's not only a crock, he's a coward too.
Get rid!

3056~~~
The question remains, was he injured or hurt? <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3058~~~
So, whatever happened, its serious enough to mean he misses this weekend's game too.

3059~~~

3060~~~
Good news for us. I hope Shaw's ok with it though.

3061~~~
Hope LVG gets his way.

3062~~~
Thank feck, it's the obvious decision but I'm glad to hear it!

3063~~~
As an Englishman I think we should take all our best players to the U21s (Kane, Sterling, Shaw etc.).
As a United fan I'd rather Shaw got the summer off.

So to summarise...
Feck England.

3064~~~
Also as an Englishman. Yep.

3065~~~
I'd very much like England to take all it's best eligible players, but I don't think there can be any arguments over Shaw. He has had a very stop/start season with injuries and fitness concerns, and that needs to be addressed. He's only completed a full 90 minutes for United 8 times this season. He surely cannot be considered fit enough to play in an international tournament.

3066~~~
He is looking like a poor signing, always crocked up and injured. Hope he maintains his fitness levels better next season.

3067~~~
He wasn't last season though. Go back a few pages and see for yourself, but there's a theory that Southampton overplayed him at a young age, when he's still growing. Coming back unfit and early to pre-season didn't help I would think. That's why a summer off will do him wonders.

3068~~~
As long as he doesn't use the summer to binge drink and rock up at every McDonalds.

3069~~~
No chance.

3070~~~
I'm still certain he'll be a top player for us for the next decade plus, he's had a growth year and those can bring injuries for young players, not to mention he seems a quiet lad so the move away from home has probably took time to get used to for him as well. LvG and the club will look after him and we'll see him ready to show his best on the pre-season tour IMO.

3071~~~
If he's fit in a couple of weeks then he should be 100% in the U21 squad for the Euros!!!

3072~~~
Shaw is obviously the future but in terms of actual performances, Blind has been a better LB this season.

3073~~~
Hmm in terms of team performances I would say Blind has stood out as a better option for the "triangle" on the left side, but individually Shaw has never been made to look weak by any attacker, and his performance at Stamford Bridge was the best of the season, higher than any Blind made IMO. We need to see that side of him consistently, and he will be the new Evra/Cole etc.

3074~~~
Shaw is the future and has some very good potential. At the same time, he is a bit overrated. Hopefully much better fitness levels from him next season.

3075~~~
I suppose it depends what you mean by overrated, he is fantastic defensively 1v1, his positioning seems fairly good but he needs to improve on tracking his runner on crosses. Attacking wise he needs to improve on when to make a run and how to take on a man, but his final delivery does seem good, and he generally looks to pick out a player than just bash it into the box.

Obviously though this year the injuries have really slowed down his progression and we need to get that sorted ASAP.

3076~~~
He should not play again until the preseason starts. After the amount of games he has played and the amount of injuries he has had in the last 18 months he really needs a long rest I don't think it's very smart for players his age to play season after season without a good rest in the summer.

3077~~~
Blind was better vs Liverpool and Spurs imo, especially Spurs where he didnt get passed once and linked up so well with Young continuously.

3078~~~
I'm normally for players to go to the under 21 tournaments but with Shaw I really think it's important that he needs to rest up this summer.

3079~~~
If Shaw can stay fit he will form a deadly partnership with Memphis on our left side. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

No, van Gaal said he's been overworked the previous season and he needs rest.

3080~~~
No way, he should get a good rest and be raring to go for next season.

3081~~~
He's not going to the U21's. Wonderful.

3082~~~
Good. I'm sure he'll be deeply disappointed but its for the best

3083~~~
Is it confirmed? 100%? Source?

3085~~~
Good news. He'll be better with a decent bit of rest.  Has he had any recurring injuries this year? I seem to remember an ankle injury happening a few times?

3086~~~
Oh yes.. feck yes!

3087~~~
On the FA site is the squad and Shaw is not in it.

Should just go. Doesn't even need to play every game, but it's in England's interest for him (and the rest of them) to go. If he's unable to actually play, then that's fair enough.

3089~~~
good news.

he needs a full summer rest.

3090~~~
No, it's not. And thank feck that common sense won here.

3091~~~
Absolutely wonderful news. Now he'll be ready go for pre-season instead of picking up small niggles during an international tournament.

3092~~~
How is it not?

3093~~~
Because he has played a lot football, at the age of 19, and suffered a lot of niggeling injuries. The best thing for the player and the club is that he get to rest for the summer and then come back raring to go for pre-season.

3094~~~
Good news. But considering our luck he'll injure himself in the next game again which will keep him out for whole summer anyway and he'll start the season unfit.

3095~~~
Hopefully this rest benefits him more than Rafael's rest did last summer.

3096~~~
I can't imagine that he'll play against Hull, no point.

3097~~~
From United point of view this is good news. He needs a good rest before he can get into the groove during pre-season.

3098~~~
He'll injure himself playing beach volleyball in the summer then. There are always many options for our players to injure thselves, don't worry.

3099~~~
That doesn't explain why it's not in England's interest for him to be there. If he's fit, he should go, in my opinion. He doesn't have to play every full 90 minutes. People wouldn't be happy to see him left out of the full senior squad this summer for a tournament (if the scenario was exactly the same) so why here?

3100~~~
Of course people would.

It does. He should absolutely not risk getting injured for an U21 tournament when he has had the issues that he's had. It is also in England's best interest to take care of him physically so he can develop the way we expect him to do. Shaw can potentially play LB for United and England the next decade.

What's the big deal with this tournament? It should be for players who need it, not for players who are established at top clubs.

3101~~~
Fair enough. Most will agree with you, but not playing when fit in order to not risk injury doesn't seem right to me. It's not even like he has to play every game. But it's in England's interest to have their future tournament players getting experience, under low pressure, as a group. In my opinion, anyway.

As for the bit in bold. Who is this helping? How do they need it? The likes of Redmond, who'll end up like Noble, Muamba etc.. who got thumped by Ozil, khedira, Hummels and Neuer, and never saw a senior tournament. Who is it helping in any way?

The players who need it are the ones who'll use the experience later on. There are maybe three players who'll become anything good for England, being realistic (and I can say that without watching most of them play): Stones, Chambers and Kane.

3102~~~
My meaning was that Luke Shaw (I only care about United's interest here, nothing else) is first choice at LB for Manchester United and next season he'll play in the Champions League. He doesn't need to play for the U21's and risk burning himself out - there is plenty of football ahead for him. He's probably the best English LB in the PL now and if he's going to play international football it should be for the first team, not wasting his time with the U21's.

I guess you are a huge England fan, and thus want to see the best players turn out for even the U21's which is a fair opinion but I only care about United and that Shaw was omitted from the squad was in the club's best interest.

3103~~~
It's not because of a risk of injury during the tournament, but because he needs rest, he needs that rest in order to not destroy the rest of his career.

3104~~~
They spend half the time lounging about bored, and he doesn't need to play 90 minutes, or even every game. Just my opinion, and obviously I'm alone here.

3105~~~
Great news. 

Now Luke just lay somewhere during the summer and move only to go to toilet.

3106~~~
He needs complete rest, not half rest, he has been playing like an adult for the last 3 years. He needs a sustained period of time without competitive training or competitive games, in order to regenerate his body and his mind.

3107~~~
This.

English starlets have been overplayed before (Owen, Rooney being rushed back for, what?, two international tournaments?) so I really hope that's not going to happen with Shaw, because he is a very special talent.

3108~~~
Wilshere too, and we know whats happened to him. Seems eternally injured.

3109~~~
Yes, I forgot about him. Absolutely.

Remember how Ferguson used to give Ronaldo a mid season vacation for his first two-three years in England. He was a special talent who was always going to play a lot of football - so Ferguson knew he had to give him a good rest at some point.

3110~~~
Was he injury prone at Southampton? or is it just the United curse?

3111~~~
Yeah, and liked the fact that Moyes decided to rest Januzaj too.

3112~~~
Nope, no history of injuries there. So hopefully it should clear up next season. But he had played two (?) full seasons for Southampton and then straight in as first choice at United at 19 - so it's not that much of a surprise that he's been struggling a bit. 

Aye, fair fecks to him for that.

3113~~~
He wasn't that bad this season to be honest, slightly regressed, but i dont think there should be any cause for concern regarding Shaw just yet.

3114~~~
Plus he was at the World Cup.

3115~~~
Good Lord! That too, yeah.

3116~~~
Must have been fatigue,just like Oscar.

3117~~~
He's not injured but his body can't keep up because he was overworked before joining us.

3118~~~
I enjoy watching him play so its a bit disappointing in that aspect, but it's better if he is fresh for our season.

3119~~~
Excellent.

A good long rest followed by a proper preseason will hopefully do him a great deal of good.

3120~~~
Couldn't possibly care less!!!!

It's on Manchester Uniteds (and i believe his) best interest not to go!

3121~~~
Good article.

3122~~~
Good article and it makes sense, it's easy for us to sit behind our computer screens and criticize him for not looking like a £30m player but we don't know what happens in the background,  I have no doubt he will become a fantastic LB and the amount we paid will look like a bargain at one point.

3123~~~
The only time 30mil quid for a left back would look like a bargain is if we have the next maldini or roberto carlos, don't think this will be the case here. Think in the end we'll be happy about the investment and pretty much that.

3124~~~
Why not? he's still 19 and has plenty of time to develop.

3125~~~
Aye. If he's our first choice LB for the next decade then 30m will be a bargain.

3126~~~
Yep.

Ashley Cole cost Jose £5million + Gallas (total ~£18million) almost 10 years ago and was totally worth the outlay for Chelsea. Shaw is 7 years younger than Cole was back then, and if he can be part of the solution for 10-12 years, the fee will be more than justified.

3127~~~
LVG get's his way Shaw not in the U21 squad for this summer. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32807828" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32807828</a>

3128~~~
Some excellent news if i'm being honest, after being a part of the world cup squad last summer, he really needs a rest to recuperate after the season he's had.

3129~~~
Let him have a proper rest
 Whoever does that is an idiot. Of course he doesnt look like such a player, we bought potential and it will take at least another 3-4 seasons until we see a more finished product

3130~~~
Thank feck, he needs a rest clearly.

3131~~~
How people can even question this guys ability or even his £30m price tag is beyond me. Watching him play you can see he is years ahead where he should be, he is solid as a rock defensively and we've seen what he can do running at people or overlapping (most recently against Chelsea).

People had a few issues with him not getting involved in attack that much too which is fair judgement until if you watch any time he played with Di Maria, Angle pretty much ignored all his overlaps or gave him a nothing pass.

He will add to his attacking game and defensively I cannot think of a better young full back in the world and the scary thing is he'll get even better defensively too, he's 19, he has an amazing 7-10 years more learning before he 'peaks'.

3132~~~
I agree, he is a signing that i'm very happy with, the talent is there for all to see. Great that he gets a good long rest now, clearly needs it.

3133~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-_Nqbu16ww?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3134~~~
He shrugs of Drogba as if he wasn't even there. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3135~~~
He's a beast. His touch is class as well, kills the ball dead - sometimes too well even. Great to watch him bomb down our left flank.

3136~~~
Navas couldn't go past him.

3137~~~
Getting Cole for £5m plus a 3 year older and significantly worse Gallas was a tremendous deal.

3138~~~
What a highlight reel. He really deserved getting some assists this year and I can't believe he had so many good moments when he played so little. 

With a proper left winger who can do the dribbling and providing the real width for him he'll get to use his pace and off the ball runs even more hopefully.

3139~~~
This video shows to me how promising Shaw is and how bad our strikers were, missed sitters after sitters.

3140~~~
Yeah he created some excellent chances. Hopefully next season he'll have better luck when it comes to injuries as we'll see the best of him when he gets a run in the side - though that said his best performance came in a game right after he returned from one of his injuries against Chelsea.

3141~~~
So far he's seemed pretty good at coming back from injuries at a decent level which is really important if/when he picks up more injuries. Hard to allow defenders warm back in to the team like you can do with a Rooney even if they are playing sub par every time they return. 

In the end he only managed to participate in 16 games, as much as McNair and just two more than Evans. But he's just been substituted in once which says a lot about him being first choice when he's fit rather than struggling to break in to the team.

3142~~~
This video really highlights he has massive potential. He rarely failed to deliver when he was actually fit. Deserves a good rest for the summer now and hopefully he will come back fitter and stronger.

3143~~~
The video highlights his incredibly stumpy legs moving at high speeds. Great work nailing Willian

3144~~~
He's played 20 games and has been subbed off/subbed on a few times (mainly due to injury) but I get what you mean. Even when he got sent off, he was back in the starting line up the game after his suspension was over.

Hopefully summer off will do him the world of good.

3145~~~
He makes feckers look like Valencia <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> He is just so good at defending.

He gets a lot of shit on here for his crossing too but I actually love the way he crosses. He tries to pick a man out and even when it doesn't come off you can always see what who he is trying to pick out. The same can't be said for most of our other players who just smash/whip it in. I prefer Shaw's method, especially with the options we have in the box.

I don't think he was actually seriously injured most of the time but van Gaal's extreme fitness expectations and Shaw being young I feel he was saved for precaution and to make sure not to do lasting damage. I've seen plenty of people say about him always being a doubt in fantasy football last year at Southampton. I think the big difference is Southampton played him with slight knocks and tight muscles whereas van Gaal only plays you at full health.

3146~~~
He's undoubtedly a great talent, but it sucked that he had so many injuries this year. Though when he played, he played well and was consistently one of our better players in my opinion. 

He'll be a big time player for us if he can stay healthy.

3147~~~

3148~~~
The bromance has well and truly formed.

3149~~~
Awww they're already in love!

3150~~~
Looking forward to see him play as much as our recent signings.

3151~~~
Brilliant. I'm really looking forward to this partnership, with the hope that Shaw can stay fit as well.

3152~~~
Looks more like Shaw has been Friendzoned to me. He doesn't call him his friend or anything he just says happy birthday.

3153~~~
Left flank sorted for the next decade <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3154~~~
Memphis with either Shaw or Blind behind him should be a great left side

3155~~~
Do we think that Shaw is going to be first choice at left back this season?  Blind looked pretty solid there as well, and he is going to be squeezed out of the midfield situation, hopefully!

3156~~~
Shaw staying fit will be key to our ability to go for the title this season. Like Evra, he adds another dimension to our team attacking wise when he's playing. Chelsea just couldn't handle his runs last season.

Of course, Shaw is one of our most talented players. It's just a question of fitness. Hopefully with a good rest he will go back to the way he was at Southampton. Blind will play plenty of games with all the competitions we have. I don't think van Gaal would want him to play 45 games a season until he's a bit older.

3157~~~
If he can stay fit he should start. He's shown he has the intelligence and crossing ability to play there but what he can also offer is the ability to carry the ball forward which Blind can't. We've missed that since Evra left.

3158~~~
Yes, 100%.

3159~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3160~~~
Yes.

3161~~~
He won't get to have sex with Depay? Poor lad will be heart-broken.

3162~~~
More like an unrequited bromance

3163~~~
Memphis and Shaw is a duo chock full of blistering pace. I hope they instantly become first choice for the left hand side and gel from the off. It has limitless potential.

3164~~~
Surely if Memphis called him his friend he'd have been friendzoned?

3165~~~
Same here, didn't see nearly enough of him last season, but every time is as him play he looked impressive

3166~~~
Van gaal chose him every time he was fit, Shaw will be our starter.
