It has now been confirmed by Athletic and Herrera on his Twitter.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/anderherrera8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/anderherrera8</a>

Welcome, Ander!

Edit: United too.

2~~~
We'll love him instantly.

4~~~
Excellent!

Hopefully he settles in quickly and makes an immediate impact.

5~~~
I can only see pictures no tweets.

Thrilled about this.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
About fecking time we signed a midfielder though, a good one. We've clearly needed one and it's been our weak point for 7-8 years now.

9~~~
From what I've read, this lad was desperate to play for us.. just the sort of player I want at this club.

Welcome Ander

10~~~

12~~~
Brilliant signing. Really made up with this.

13~~~
Sir Bobby is looking well.

14~~~
This thread needs more wank gifs than the World Cup Babes thread.

A midfielder, ffs! I can't believe my own eyes!

15~~~
Welcome Ander and good luck!

16~~~
Weird that he has just posted these pictures without saying anything or anything from the club, but whatever. Very excited about this. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

17~~~
Immense feeling having with us! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

18~~~
shit, I hope he wasn't just on a tour of Old Trafford in those pics...

19~~~
That's a bad photoshop.

20~~~
He changed his twitter profile pic but not his bio.

21~~~
Not a bad day at all. A week ago I would never have believed we were going back for him.

Bilbao are a strange bunch of feckers.

22~~~
Great buy!! I'm ecstatic!

23~~~
Excellent! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

24~~~
It's good enough to fool Herrera, who has it as his Twitter pic.

25~~~
Welcome to THE United, Ander!! Oh and thanks LvG!

26~~~
You know, I think having a dynamic, mobile midfielder next to Carrick will help him return to his previous best. That is of course assuming Ander is the only midfielder we sign this summer.

27~~~
<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

28~~~
Already our best midfielder, before he's even been given a squad number. Hurrah!

Considering Athletic are a ballache to negotiate with, this came together quickly. Good stuff.

29~~~
I could swear that looked like an oversized Herrera head on Juan Mata's body. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Also I don't know why they present him with last season's jersey.

30~~~
Great news. Now we need another one.

31~~~
Awesome. Fun day.

32~~~
Judging by his own club, he was prepared to pillage their village, stab their leader in the back, rinse their food storage so that their children and women would suffer over the winter and execute someone named Klaus - just to be with us.

To say he was desperate is an understatement.

33~~~
Good signing. Hopefully he excels here. Excited to see him.

34~~~
Well, this is exciting. Hope he settles in quickly, been a long time coming this one.

35~~~
That was quick. Guess United media department had been waiting since yesterday with one finger on the Enter button. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

36~~~
GET IN 

I love this guy already.

37~~~

39~~~
They haven't officially unveiled the new kit yet have they?

40~~~
Great news.

41~~~
So it has least 1 other good memory, other than Mata, associated with it.

42~~~
That's his official twitter.

43~~~
Did he say anything on Twitter? Or just images?

44~~~
Delighted! We're clearly waiting for something to happen before we announce this! Off to the Luke Shaw thread!

45~~~
Yasssss

46~~~
Wonderful stuff. A fine day. A fine day indeed.

Spelled his name wrong in the thread title but <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

54~~~
I cannot believe it, we have singed an actual, proper midfielder.

55~~~
We've signed a midfielder
Suarez gets banned

What a great day it has been so far and a ball hasnt even been kicked yet!

56~~~
Welcome to OT . Let's see what you can do.

57~~~
Yes!! Well done woody!

58~~~
Fantastic news, hope that he's just the beggining of our signings, can't wait for new season to begin.

59~~~
I'm not sure the corporate people would give Aon publicity beyond their contract when Chevy's contract started already. I thought they'd introduce him with a scarf or something if the new kit is not ready.

60~~~

AWHOOOOOOOOGA !!!!!!

61~~~
My mistake, Anderson must have left it lying around anyway looking at the bloody size of it.

62~~~
For the people who've questioned the price tag it's worth mentioning that United scouted him for 2+ years and he was recommended to Moyes by SAF, now he's the first major signing under LVG so I doubt both SAF and LVG can be very wrong about him. Just what we need in this team young hungry ambitious with the best yet to come.

63~~~
Welcome Mr Herrera ! Brilliant signing so excited for next season.

Next in line : Shaw. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

64~~~
Typing while having an orgasm is a hard thing to do.

65~~~
He looks awfully like Robert Lewandowski or is it just me? Anyway great to have a signing in the door at Old Trafford but hopefully many more to come

Welcome Ander <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

Should be ready for Hollands game against Mexico on Sunday <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Wait what......

67~~~
Delighted with this signing. I really thing he could be the dynamic midfielder that we've been crying out for.

68~~~
18 matches worth of individual highlights on Youtube if you have the time.

I'm over the moon, fair play to Woodward for pulling it off so quickly! <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

Lads, we finally have a proper midfielder. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

70~~~
He's Spanish

71~~~
Why haven't United announced this yet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

72~~~
Okay. I'm off to wake the wife up. What a great day.

73~~~
Brilliant <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

74~~~
Delighted, really like the lad.

75~~~
Its a pity Iker Muniain release clause is €45million. Wouldnt mind him on the wing for us. 

Looks like he is about to sign a new contract anyway.

76~~~
<a class="username" data-user="87540, @goldenstatesplash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87540/">@goldenstatesplash</a> is still sceptical. Ander is just part of the MIRV.

77~~~
Finally it's done and I think he'll do great. Welcome to Manchester Herrera!

78~~~
Finally we have our three amigos. So refreshing seeing a player really wanting to join us. I mean after last years farce, not many would want to come here again, let alone pay the payout with a bit of their own salary. I'm so excited.

Welcome Ander!

79~~~
This is how you sign a player. Quick and early in the window - he'll get a full pre-season with us now!

80~~~
New kits have not been released yet?

81~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6Sxv-sUYtM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

82~~~
And in good time too. Will get the full pre-season to bed in properly. Can't wait to see the hug threeway between him, Dave and The Juan.

Louis van Gaal 1 - 0 Moyes.

83~~~
Herrera and Suarez.  Curry for dinner and if I get a nosh from the missus tonight it'll be THE perfect day.

84~~~
Oho! I'm having a scorgasm.

85~~~
Why would you want to spoil it?

86~~~
Hopefully not a flop.

87~~~
Can I just have this one:

88~~~
Jesus fecking Christ, let the lad kick a ball for us first.

89~~~
Well this is bloody fantastic.

90~~~
He's so excited to be here he's jumped the gun and announced it before the club has. I really like the guy already.

91~~~
Thank feck from that, 1 down 4 to go. The engine room finally gets an upgrade

92~~~
Delighted, seems to genuinely be a huge fan of the club and I wish him all the best here <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

93~~~
I don't think it has though...otherwise they wouldn't have done it. Multi-million pound deals like that are too important to mess up on, so I'm sure they're well within their rights to present him with what is the current kit.

I remember replica kits used to have a life date a few years ago. More often than not it said 30/06/insert year here on the little tab.

94~~~
Keep them good midfielders and signings coming woodt.

95~~~

96~~~
First signing of the LVG era and the OP can't even get the name right.

I can see it now. Herrara picks the ball up, passes to Goggs, Goggs to Wellbeck... GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!

97~~~
So happy we got this settled so quickly!

Next up is another CM, LB, CB and maybe a winger.

98~~~
Glad my info was correct. Top player.

99~~~

100~~~
Welcome to Manchester United, Ander. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

101~~~
Shouldn't this thread be called 'Ander Herrera' not 'Ander Herrara'?

102~~~
Finally, a quality midfielder! A year late, but I'm over the moon.

103~~~
COCKS OUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

104~~~
What a day. We sign a cute midfielder and gnasher gets banned too.

105~~~
We signed a midfielder. What the f*ck is going on.

106~~~
That team will take us from 7th place to 6th.

107~~~
No idea what any of you mean regarding the title <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

I was excited!

108~~~
Sexy as hell.On to the Vidal thread caftards!We Go Again!<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

109~~~
Yeah, Scorgasm made a typo while in an orgasm over the signing.

110~~~
Delighted with the news. We have a new manager, and just signed mobile midfielder who is also very good with ball at his feet, not bad at all. One player more(LB) and we are set to go.

111~~~

112~~~
In fairness I can appreciate that.

113~~~
Good to see Daniel Taylor at the sharp end.

114~~~
Pretty chuffed, feck yea.

Big fan of his & thought that boat sailed last year.

115~~~
TBF United haven't said anything about it yet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That's hideous!

Or are you joking? ...

120~~~
Seriously?!?! Just 1 player more?

121~~~
Welcome Ander!!! <a class="username" data-user="49749, @Ish84045" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49749/">@Ish84045</a> You must be over the moon buddy, you've been wanting him since last year

122~~~
24 million quid apparently, where did the 30 plus million price come from?

123~~~
Hes a central midfielder

124~~~
"Mufc family" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

125~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

126~~~
He should have monitoring RedCafe

127~~~
Great that this has actually gone through and we can be a lot more confident about next season. I have to confess though that I am not as up to scratch on matters of european football and have not watched much of this lad. I'm sure I fill you all with shame for that. But from what people here are saying, he seems more in line with what we have been pining for. Is he a box-to-box midfielder we have all been screaming for or is he more of a playmaker? I've read some scouting reports that seem to suggest that he has spent most of his season with Bilbao as an AM. I'm sure he'll need to be converted to a straight CM as we have the likes of Kagawa and Rooney occupying that position. But his passing is accurate and he can put in a tackle as well. But there'd be people here more well up on La Liga, particularly the wonderful <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> who would have a more accurate assessment of him.

The one thing we need to be wary of is his development with the team which may need a bit of time. It's possible he won't quite fulfil his full potential in his first season and it might prompt some to panic and deem this a bad buy. But hopefully he can at lest have some positive impact initially.

128~~~
He's making a joke.

129~~~

130~~~
This is genius.

131~~~
Silvestre, he is now working a Bureau De Change after wrecking that one Arsenal season.

132~~~
Good lad, now we just need a few more.

133~~~
Good signing. A proper partner for him and we're in business.

134~~~
Ander Herrera said: "Signing for Manchester United is a dream come true. I have played at Old Trafford for Athletic Club in the UEFA Europa League and it was one of the highlights of my career so far. I have joined United to do all I can to help the team reach the club's objectives. Having arrived on Tuesday, I’m excited to now be living in Manchester and I can’t wait for my first game in United’s famous red shirt. I will never forget my time with Athletic Club and I’d like to thank the fans and staff for all their support and, above all, wish all my fantastic former team-mates all the best for the future."

135~~~
He's so dreamy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

136~~~
Excellent. Seems like a great lad and I'm sure he'll do well here. 

Hopefully he's the first of many signings this summer.

137~~~
Yes get in!!!!!!

138~~~
A complete midfield player. I think he will be a great player for us. We immediately improve our first 11.

139~~~
Welcome to the greatest club in the world.

140~~~
He's so skinny. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

On the other hands why do all Spanish lads look so good?

141~~~
Is that it? I thought it was 36m in Euros, about £28.8m. I think some of the confusion was over the currency used when quoting the price.

142~~~
Excited to see him in action. Don't know a lot about him but he is a Spanish midfielder, what could possibly go wrong?

143~~~
His head is disproportionate to his body. Don't want anymore. Sell Herrara, sack van hal

144~~~
Hands off, he's mine. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

145~~~
He's facing side on.

146~~~
No, obviously our team is shit and I want at least 9 new players. I wouldn't change de Gea though.

147~~~
How class is that statement?

148~~~
24? Says who?

149~~~
Where's that price from?

150~~~
That photo is clearly just an edited watch advert.

151~~~
Great news!! It's been a pretty great day all round!

152~~~
Hahaha, of course.

Bit of a fanboy if I say so myself. 

Can't believe we pulled it off. Thought the deal was dead last season for sure, especially with Moyes gone. LvG must have really wanted him if we paid the buy out clause (which Moyes didn't) & passed up on Cesc (allegedly).

Chuffed.

153~~~
Oh my god!!!! 

It's done. He's finally here!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

May there be more to come!!

154~~~
Fantastic statement from the bloke also, very good signing..

Oh and well done Ed.

155~~~

156~~~
Fabregas and Kroos were a smokescreen for Herrera. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I hope he writes just "Ander" on his shirt.

159~~~
Finally, a quality midfield signing.

160~~~
Finally tracked down his actual agent this time then.

161~~~
Maybe Essien's been giving off interviews again.

162~~~
Maybe to let Liverpool have their day in the sun.

163~~~
Great news.

Hopefully a few more to follow.

166~~~
Moyes partly blamed our Transfer fiasco last summer on the fact that he only started working for us on July 1st. This year our manager is in Brazil and working with another team and it's already a better window!

167~~~
Just heard Natalie Sawyer say we've "Bought out the buy out" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

168~~~

169~~~
They call him Dithering Dave for a reason...

170~~~
Not been this excited about a signing in a long time.

Glad we've signed him, not only because he's quality, but I was pissed off at how we fecked him about last summer. At least we've finally righted that wrong and hopefully he'll enjoy himself here.

171~~~
Suarez has hogged the limelight on this. No websites reporting this news as their headline.

172~~~
Finally confirmed by Man Utd. This is how you do a bloody transfer!

Cannot wait until pre-season now.

173~~~
immense feeling having him on board<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> now sign the other herrera to make the best herrera-herrera midfield duo in history of football! Good job Ed anyway.. three days ago nobody knew thing. today he hold the red jersey. Cant wait to see him. I am curious which number he will take

174~~~
Full muppet now, posted this thread within seconds of him updating his twitter and posted the official tweet within seconds too. My first full muppet saga since I've been active on the Caf... it has been fantastic. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

175~~~
does anybody know whether he speaks english?

176~~~
Even more excited about this then the Mata signing, we signed a player we actually desperately needed for once <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Now if we sign another midfielder and a center back, it'll be a dream summer. Actually the only way to top this would be to sign Alexis Sanchez now too

177~~~
He does yes.

178~~~
Oh well. Who cares. We have finally signed a decent CM! (At least I hope he is decent).

179~~~
He does, IIRC he tweeted Rio in English.

180~~~
Welcome Ander, I wish you well and hope you can bring us something we haven't lacked for a long time.

181~~~
Awww, his goodbye Athletico video.

182~~~
His first touch and passing always goes up to 20 on FM by 2017 so in three years time he'll essentially be the best midfielder in the world.

183~~~
Fan fecking taslic , will be a cracking addition to the team.

184~~~
So what did we end up paying for him? Around £28 million?

185~~~
This is great news. What was Athletic playing at with that tweet earlier today?

186~~~
Nice of him to make a farewell video like that.

187~~~
Welcome Ander, I'm very excited about this. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

188~~~
Not believing this until I see him on the pitch.

Refuse to buy into the idea that we've signed a midfielder

189~~~
He bought his own clause
He bought his own claaauuuse
Ander Herrera
He bought his own clause

190~~~
So happy <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

191~~~
Excellent news, great signing. Welcome Ander.

192~~~
YEY YEY  JUST F**king YEY!!!!!!!

193~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

194~~~
Does he speak English?

195~~~
#madbantz

196~~~
Just shows the difference in mentality between the two. Moyes is such a negative, self-defeating twat.

197~~~
I thought we were never going to speak of him again?

198~~~

199~~~
That's a bit harsh when he still hasn't even started as our manager...

200~~~
Welcome to the jungle. We've got Young and Bebe.

201~~~
With this signing we've already gone from seeing a midfield 3 of Carrick, Fellaini and Mata to Carrick, Herrera and Mata. I still can't believe it, 2 Spanish lads in our midfield. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

202~~~
Mata loves it.

203~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

204~~~
He loves a through ball <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

205~~~
Herrera, whoa.

Moyes gave him the fear.
So he said "i'll wait a year"

206~~~
Fantastic news. But we mustn't stop there in the midfield department. We need to sign another quality CM too.

207~~~
Announced while the NYSE was open I believe? So we can put that myth to bed.

208~~~
Mata, Herrera and De Gea - the three amigos! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

209~~~
Let's sign some German and Dutch players too!

210~~~
Bienvinido crack? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

211~~~
Herrera, uh oh uh
Herrera, uh oh uh
He comes from Basque Country
F*ck your buyout fee!

212~~~
Racist.

213~~~
We need to sign someone that will be able to succeed Carrick now and our midfield will be complete!

214~~~
Indeed, turns out these things get announced whenever the hell they feel like it.

Feck me, turns out there is some football on too!

215~~~
The pic with Sir Bobby is brilliant! Can't wait to see Ander next season.

216~~~
Someone on Reddit translated his video interview:

217~~~
Delighted, that is a very promising start to the Van Gaal era! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

218~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

219~~~
Absolutely delighted with this, especially after last year. I felt so sorry for the lad, so he must be absolutely buzzing right now.

Welcome to the club Ander.

220~~~
Feels weird, this feeling of optimism. I've missed it.

221~~~
He's won me over, is he married by any chance?

222~~~
It's class isn't it? from Moyes and Fellaini to Van Gaal and Herrera...

223~~~
Bless him. Probably kind of relieved there's no chance of playing against them next season.

224~~~
We couldn't have asked for a better start to his reign. Central midfield has been our biggest weakness for around 5 years or more now. At last we've bought somebody worthy of stepping into the shoes of scholsey.

Better late then never though.

225~~~
Don't know that much about him as a player, but I've got confidence in his personality. Everyone we've heard and seen points to him having the right attitude.

226~~~
Absolutely buzzing over this signing, De Gea, Mata and Herrera the 3 amigos haha

227~~~
Nice one..... How much more optimistic are we all feeling this close season to last?

With Van Gaal managing a revamped team, Giggs as assistant, this kind of signing to add to the now settled Juan Mata.

A few more exciting potential signings around the corner, the improving Januzaj, Van Persie etc...

Cant wait for the new season.

228~~~

229~~~
Great news. Just find the guy a midfield partner and we instantly turn a shite midfield into a very good one.

230~~~
Brilliant news - united look as though they mean business...

231~~~
This is his carta de despedida on his official twitter account.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BrEc6SOIQAAqdNs.png:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BrEc6SOIQAAqdNs.png:large"/>

I'm not sure, but you better get there quickly!

Reminds me of Mata a bit, seems to be a sensible lad. Happy to have them in the team.

233~~~
Made  sure to get the AON in the picture <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Two Spanish midfielders and a Dutch coach.

237~~~
Welcome Ander!

This summer is already looking better than the last one. We have a midfielder who will ideally make a difference right away. He is very good with the potential to be class. Let's try and develop him into something special.

238~~~
Yep, we can do with a CB now I feel... I was warming to the idea of Vermaelen. I think we could do with a leader, lot of young players there now and after offloading the heart of the defence this summer we could really do with top defender in there now! 

Exciting times!

239~~~
How quickly things change.

241~~~
Imagine turning up to your new club and being shown around by a footballing legend like Sir Bobby! Then again could be worse, you could get Mike Summerbee giving you the brief tour of the Man City trophy corridor.

242~~~
He looks like guy who wants to bite someone.

243~~~
Back to doing it properly and no cringey bollocks involving a helicopter.

244~~~
Answers a lot of questions. Can Woodward complete a high-profile signing for an overseas player?  Will United splash the cash to improve the squad?  Can we attract top-level talent?

Bodes well for other activity.

245~~~
i am 90% sure we will sign strootman if he recovers well but unfortunately not this summer.. he is carricks natural succesor.. till that time we either buy another good CM or stick to what we have now, van Gaal will hopefully make wonders with fellaini or cleverley give a chance to pearson, rothwell or someone else or even rooney in midfield... whatever but its great we signed a first choice midfielder!

246~~~
Talk sport said it was confirmed by the club around 30 mins ago.

Is it incorrect? Was just relaying what I heard

247~~~
And this is how you conduct a transfer. Welcome to the greatest club in the world, Ander.

248~~~
Avoiding Champions league games. Sounds like a slacker.
<span style="color: #ffffff">.</span>

249~~~
So... can he play in centre midfield?

250~~~
good to get one in, should calm the muppets down a bit. I think he'll do well for us. 

Just a LB, a RB, a winger, a CB and maybe another CM needed now.

251~~~
What make a last ditch deadline day attempt to buy out somebody's release clause, let some random imposters confuse everything so much the deal collapse, and then finally wrap it up a year later?  I see!<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

252~~~
I was never over the moon with any of our signings since Ronaldo left. Because I was always worried rather we'd sign a proper midfeilder.

Extremely happy.

253~~~
LB: Shaw
RB: No need
Winger: Sanchez/No need
CB: Vermaelen/No need
Another CM: Carvalho/No need

We're almost good to go!

254~~~
Any news on shirt number?

Guessing that may well be at his PC

255~~~
Great. Next...

256~~~
I don't want fecking Shaw if he costs in excess of £25M, that's just ridiculous.

257~~~
Very happy with this signing, felt so sorry for the lad after what happened last year and for him to finally sign is great.

258~~~
Gary Neville wasn't good enough for Aaron Ramsay it's not like he hasn't won every trophy you could  and a club legend.

259~~~
Mata 7, Herrera 8. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I want it to happen.

260~~~
He needs a proper shoulder workout. His delts are embarrassing.

261~~~
Of course we need a RB. Rafael is a sicknote and we can't put up with Jones or Smalling "doing a job" there anymore.

The idea that we're fine now at CB and at the wing is laughable.

262~~~
Signing another central midfielder is more urgent than any of those other positions, besides left back. The aforementioned position along with left back are absolutely critical areas to address. I don't think we need a right back, but I agree with the rest of your assessment.

263~~~
Rejoice!

I work nights so sleep in the day. Looked like a blessing this morning when I found out that Bilbao had rejected our bid. Now I'm gutted I missed out on all the excitement. Oh well, great news to wake up to.

264~~~
De Gea, Mata and Herrera, the three musketeers.

265~~~
Holy shit! A signing! And a midfield one at that too!

Excited by this, lets see who else we bring in.

266~~~
Sure, but it's your opinion. I'm entitled to mine.  I'll be baffled if we buy another 4-5 players.

267~~~
I fear people are fine with Valencia being our back up right back...

268~~~
Well, I was referring to his pursuit in this window only. We did it without much fuss and finally added a CM.

269~~~
Sorting our back 4 must be priority now. Rafael and one of Jones or Smalling injured and we're screwed and back to playing Carrick as part of the back 4 with Smalling or Jones as RB. The amount of goals we leaked last season was just that bad.

270~~~
feck YEAAAAAHH!!!!

271~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DtSTqGiZnMg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

^My thoughts coming into next season.

272~~~
Wasn't Gary at the time still playing though? Anyway not arguing, you'd have thought even that would have convinced him but never mind.

273~~~
feck yeah it's official. Finally we have signed a (good) midfielder. Some might have reservations over his quality and what we need but I think because of the type of player he is he will still improve us by quite a bit. Genuinely excited by this.

274~~~
Is he that good? Never really seen him play but I remember last time we tried to sign him some people questioned whether he was good enough

275~~~
I'm not. I think we should give the chance to the youngsters like Varela and Janko.

276~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/~/media/55930044C652493CB1895A96B0E38800.ashx?mw=500" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/~/media/55930044C652493CB1895A96B0E38800.ashx?mw=500</a>

Lots of things have changed. Hope we start this new era in style with title #21 right next season, remember when we signed Robin as our #20. Wonderfull feeling to make him wear united shirt:-)

277~~~
Are they any good? Last I heard they were a long way off being ready to be second in the pecking order.

278~~~
Delighted. Can't wait to see him play for us.

I think this probably means an end to the careers of Anderson and Fletcher at least.

279~~~
Maybe LvG will actually give Varela a go....

280~~~
He must have been so disappointed about last time when the move didn't materialize but it's turned out better signing him now. He probably just had his best season and we now have Van Gaal as manager.

281~~~
Those people were retarded.

282~~~
Four should be the absolute minimum. I don't want to be a buzzkill in what should be a positive thread, but the signing of Herrera and the appointment of van Gaal doesn't detract from other areas that are either far too weak, lack depth or lack experience.

I get the impression that some people are so relieved once we make a very good acquisition, they instantly lower their expectations on what else the team needs. I'm not saying you necessarily, but I will be quite annoyed if we make just one or two signings on top of this guy.

283~~~
He paid his buyout clause?

284~~~
They've been very promising, but it can be a huge step up from reserves. Hopefully we can gauge their talent from pre-season and see if they're ready to handle a backup role.

285~~~
This. I do think Valencia could prove useful as an auxiliary right back if LVG ever opts to play three/five at the back also.

286~~~
The club paid it via him.

287~~~
Fair.

288~~~
-----------DDG---------------
Raphael----Jones----Smalling----LB
-------Carrick------Herrera------
Nani---------Mata-------Rooney
-------------RVP------------

289~~~
Don't know much about him but from the youtube he looks like a Modric type which is just what we need to finally link midfield and attack. 

Still need a Carrick replacement, someone who can sit and keep things ticking over. 

Exciting times....

290~~~
Fans quibbling over transfer fees is ridiculous.

291~~~
Donatello at left back?

292~~~
We'd be set for Lb for over a decade if all goes well worth the investment IMO.

293~~~
We've singed a midfielder, I must be dreaming. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

When was the last time we did that?

294~~~
Welcome Ander. 

And well played United, that was a very quick move. I'm so happy this didn't drag on to eternity. One deal done and the transfer window hasn't even started yet. There's so much to be excited about. Bring it!

295~~~
Last summ... it was Carrick, definitely Carrick.

296~~~
This.

297~~~
Agreed. I just don't understand it.

298~~~
When is the press conference ?

299~~~
And that worked out fairly well didn't it <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>!!

300~~~
So... 

Ander's red?

301~~~
Yep, what is it to us if United pay 25 or 32m? Shaw is one of the brightest talents in England and he would most likely make sure that our LB spot would be sewn up for the next decade.

302~~~
Gaining and Ander and possibly losing an Anderson.

303~~~
Will he wear Ander or Herrera on his shirt I wonder?

304~~~
Can he play in a 2 man midfield though?

305~~~
Koke to follow! GTFI!

306~~~
If that performance where he tore our midfield a new one was an indication of his quality then he'll be great for us.

307~~~
Excited for the new season <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> now just need a central defender and left back.

308~~~
I think he usually has A. Herrera?

309~~~
And still keeping an Anders (Lindegaard)

310~~~
We need another midfielder to get the best out of Herrera someone more defensive.

311~~~
Love to hear the background story on this transfer, this time on monday no one had a clue about it.

312~~~
Welcome Ander Herrera!  I am made up right now, great day for Man Utd fans!

313~~~
And he can actually play in midfield! I'm amazed!

314~~~

315~~~
fecking brilliant news! Glad for the bloke after the shambles of last summer as well.

316~~~
If we sign Indi we'd have Indi, Ander, Jones.

I'll get my coat.

317~~~
That's a start!

318~~~
I would prefer someone who can play on both wings to replace Nani and Young.

319~~~
This was posted 18 minutes after United announced the deal and after Herrera posted the pics on his own twitter.

320~~~
To the Vidal thread!!

321~~~
Ok, we'll have to see I guess.

322~~~
Lovely signing. Delighted too the deal was under the radar it was until leaked from Spain. Further proof all these reported transfer targets stated by the press are often bollocks to begin with.

323~~~
Think he's an indication van Gaal will play 4-3-3. He works best as either box to box or a playmaker in a midfield 3.

324~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

325~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Reminds me of when I was almost convinced SAF was chatting up with Toni Kroos´s agent at Old Trafford last match of the season.

326~~~
Midfield would be my priority but I'd get a wide player.

327~~~

328~~~
Have you read the rest of that guys feed and recent retweets? Bitterness.

329~~~
This is brilliant. Pity we sold Batman and only have Robin left.

330~~~
Who's that bloke with Ander? Surely De Gea should be the one holding the shirt with him.

331~~~
It gets better

332~~~

333~~~
Only thing that worries me here is that last year we signed a guy who hadn't been playing regularly in CM and stuck him there. He's not looked at home, despite CM being his supposed natural position. We could do without Herrera taking a while to adjust.

334~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

335~~~
Should've added this hashtag: #MissionAccomplished

336~~~
thats fecking creepy

337~~~
Hooray! Shaw next please!

338~~~
De Gea is going to be here for the rest of his career isn't he? he clearly loves the club and the more Spaniards that arrive at the doorstep will only help that cause.

339~~~

<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

342~~~
Ander doesn't skip leg day...

343~~~
YES! A MIDFIELDER

! <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.imgur.com/frnXxyM.gif" src="https://i.imgur.com/frnXxyM.gif"/>

344~~~
Had no idea this was confirmed! Great! Finally a midfielder!

345~~~
De Gea should commission...

346~~~
It's pretty obvious, to be honest. When you support a club, you want it to allocate its scarce resources as productively as possible. 30m, or whatever, on a LB is a lot of money, especially when there might be an equally talented, or more talented, LB available for less.

United doesn't have the luxury of endless bankrolling and so mistakes, particularly expensive ones, are damaging to the club. 

It's all very well saying, "It's not my money," but it is the money of the club you support.

347~~~
And I can just imagine the welcome a response of plugging every hole with cheap £6m-£9m players would receive.

348~~~
Great news, i can't believe we've signed a midfielder, and he seems like mata, a bright and decent guy.

Happy days!

349~~~
Delighted. Not only have we signed an actual midfielder but he's one who will fit the team and club perfectly, I think. The fact that he was so determined to join us is a good sign too.

Good first move in the transfer window, now lets see what we follow in up with.

350~~~
FFS Dave, get off Twitter and tap up your buddy Mr Resurrecion! We all know the contract renewal with Atletico was all a smokescreen.

351~~~
I think the people in charge are aware of how much or not we can spend. If we end up buying Shaw for whatever million pounds it is because we can afford it.

352~~~
What's that go to do with anything? 

I'm not suggesting the club shouldn't spend big. I'm saying expressing concern for the club spending big on an 18-year old LB is perfectly natural.

353~~~
In the same way we could <i>afford </i>Fellaini, doesn't mean it was a good use of money. I'm well aware the club's managers will know the club's financial position. I'm saying I want our resources to be put to the most productive use. 

It's not a difficult point I'm trying to make.

354~~~
Exactly. Also, we shelled out 27m for fecking Fellaini. That's evidence enough that we have a lot of cash to burn.

355~~~
Im glad for the lad after all that happened last summer. There were rumours of him being "distraught" when the deal never happened so it would at least appear that he is desperate to play for the club. The fact that De Gea and Mata are in the squad will hopefully mean a smooth transition plus he will have the experience of Carrick to help him.

Exactly what we need too in the fact that he is a box to box midfielder and will improve us  immensely in my opinion. Ok he didn't get into the Spain squad but that is very politically motivated when you see the likes of Casillas and Torres getting game time. 2-3 more good signings and im pretty optimistic we could mount a title challenge

356~~~
Midfielder. Midfielder has signed. ggagagknihiafagaga

357~~~
Fellaini was obviously not a good use of money. Securing the left back position for the next decade would be very good use of money.

358~~~
That calf <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

359~~~
Not really my point. I'm saying <i>it is understandable that people express concern over transfer fees</i>. I'm not just talking about Shaw, or whoever, here.

360~~~

365~~~
That helps, but still overall fails because Carrick can not close the ball down. We need a ball winner. Herrara helps, but this is why I want De Jong or Strootman.

366~~~
Made my day!! Fantastic news, all
is forgiven Mr Woodward. Now go and sign a top quality central defender or two, a left back, a world class winger, oh and another more defence minded CM! 

Seriously though, this lad looks quality. Really pleased.

367~~~
What sort of input did Van Gaal have in this transfer ? Just wondering because he was a target last year.

368~~~
Just wait, you'll all be hating Woodward tomorrow!

369~~~
Im happy with this, just need to wait and see who else we bring in now.

370~~~
I don't think you should be worried in anyway....Comparing Herrera to Fellaini is like comparing Xabi Alonso to Djemba Djemba

Anyways this is absolutely wonderful news. It's the first time in ages that we've signed a highly rated talent for a position that we badly need fresh blood in

371~~~
Hooray

372~~~
Which one?

373~~~
When we've sign all the others.

374~~~
With 2 full years of scouting and the endorsement of SAF & LVG, we must have acquired a genuine high potential player.  

If Fellaini or Cleverly play to their full potential, I don't think we need another midfielder next season.  We can then aim to acquire a fit a healthy Strootman in January and phase out Michael Carrick.  That allows us to then acquire another genuine world class midfielder next summer (Kroos, Gundogan, Pogba or Vidal) with the promise of Champions League football.

A central midfield stock of Herrera, Strootman, Vidal and Cleverly/Fellaini would be as good as any across elite Europe.

Lots of ifs and buts in this, but I think its somewhere close to our plan.

375~~~
Vidal, Hummel, Shaw, Sanchez
Then we go for title and not CL spot.
Keep dreaming.....

376~~~
Spanish dynasty is clearly upon us.

377~~~
I know the transfer was in an advanced stage but it was a pleasant surprise to see the confirmation on the clubs website just now. Especially after seeing on the BBC website Athletic had rejected our bid despite us meeting the release clause from him.

378~~~
Completely different situation as a year ago we signed a target man who never showed any qualities that would make him seem like a good player for United. Herrera played as an attacking midfielder a decent amount last season but is still mainly a central midfielder, very energetic and excellent technically, which is something our midfield lacks. I've got no doubt that he'll be a success.

379~~~
Welcome Ander.

Promoted to the mains, RAWK in meltdown and a new midfielder all on the same day. Life is good.

380~~~
Nah, it's a fair comparison. Both midfielders who ended up playing further up for a while, as it suited their teams needs. Very different players but there could well be the same issues of getting the positional awareness/discipline back.

Touch wood, Herrera stays fit, so he can settle in. Really didn't help our elbow wielding Belgian that not only did we sign him on deadline day but he then had injury problems. Looking nice at this world cup, as it happens. Fair bit better than the Djemba twins ever looked.

381~~~
Welcome.

382~~~
He played more in attacking midfield for Everton in his final season than he did right up top, didn't he?

383~~~

387~~~
This is a fine day for football in general and a damn fine day to be a United fan, hope he works out for us and I am sure he will. I am off to steam the word "son" off the back off one of my united tops.

388~~~
WELCOME TO MANCHESTER UNITED !

389~~~
Nice read. Does anyone have links to the Andy Mitten interview of Herrera? From a few months back.

390~~~
So what's his best position? Box-to-Box? Attacking Mid? Anyone on here who has regularly followed him and can give us some info?

391~~~
To take on those evil blokes across the way, Negredo, Silva, Navas, and Garcia.

392~~~
Rumour is that LVG gave the move his seal of approval.

393~~~
Think we all want to, mate - but we'll be reminded by the world cup in an hour <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

394~~~
Hoorera And er Hoorera.

395~~~
Good article, got a feeling that he'll become a real fan favorite at Old Trafford.

396~~~
Welcome!

397~~~
Translation please?

398~~~
three fecking clowns voted for bad buy <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

A plethora of Spaniards <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

401~~~

402~~~
He seems so genuinely excited about joining us, which is refreshing to see in this day and age of football.

403~~~
Wherever he played, he was still used as a target man more or less. He definitely wasn't a defensive midfielder and wasn't used for his on the ball ability. Same with Belgium really, he isn't used as a box to box player or defensive midfielder, he's the most advanced one usually.

404~~~
You have to consider the matchgoing fans, after all, it's their pockets that finance the transfers.

405~~~
He's going to challenge Mata and Chicha for most likeable, loveable little chappie at the club.

406~~~
Yeah, alright. That's a pretty good case.

407~~~

Great signing, few more of those and we are in business.

LvG, Herrera, Shaw next? Couple more signings after that? Is this real life?

410~~~
They couldn't have gone just a little bit further back and got the 'M' in shot?

411~~~
I'd say he feels amazing. Welcome Ander!

412~~~
I'm trying to not get ahead of myself but with this signing and the potential for more to come added to how impressive Van Gaal has been in Brazil it's very hard not to be very excited for the new season.

I remember the feeling of desperation when it looked like Moyes was going to be here for a while, it's so different right now.

413~~~
They should have used Paint to include it.

414~~~
Yep, I'm trying to not get carried away. But the difference between now and the 'Moyes era' is just night and day.

415~~~
They could have held the camera fecking level as well, to be honest.

416~~~
Delighted with this signing and also the speed at which it was wrapped up. Less than three days from the story breaking to the deal being announced.

417~~~
Well, quite.

Who do we write to about this?

418~~~
Welcome Ander Herrera! Looking forward to this one!

419~~~
Moyes

420~~~
I've already sent an email to Points of View. I don't think that it's on TV anymore, but I'm just so furious that I don't care.

421~~~
We're acting like Manchester United-again.

422~~~
Good signing. Gave us the run around a few seasons ago and should add more quality to our midfield. He might not be the big name but I'm sure he will improve his game at United and have a very good career here!

423~~~

Interview at 8.30 for those with MUTV

426~~~
I know this has probably been asked somewhere but can he speak English?

427~~~
He's 6 foot, he's not little!

428~~~
Very happy that we managed to sign this lad. Great player though I think we need one more in midfield to sort out our issues but Ander instantaneously makes us better which is always what you want from a transfer. Cant wait to see him start in a red shirt!

429~~~
Please stop <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

430~~~

431~~~
STAHP!

432~~~
Welcome to the club, Ander!

433~~~
They're removing it so we can afford Luke Shaw.

Should we want a third player, they will have to sell our U.

434~~~
The sort of good news I needed today. Van Gaal will definitely get the best out of him.

435~~~
Three man midfield, surely? From whatever I've read or heard on him, he suits it perfectly.

436~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

To be fair to him, this deal is very different to most transfers, where several clubs all buy the same player, because they all rate him equally.

437~~~
It was like we'd stepped in dog shit. The stench was everywhere.
Teams breaking their ducks against us. Cup exits. Transfer messes. Awful press conferences. Players leaving. etc

It is like someone has opened the curtains.

Thanks
Thanks

439~~~
So this is what it feels like to sign a quality CM? I can only liken it to the first sighting of boobs! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Oh yes!!!!!

440~~~
Well done Woodie for going back in for him after last year, when he clearly wanted to join but it didn't happen for various reasons! Felt sorry for him at the time.

441~~~
Better than Paddy Crerand's.

442~~~
I'd love to see a three man midfield of de Gea, Herrera and Mata just for one game.

<span style="color: #ffffff">White text, but no really, it'd be great.</span>

443~~~
That FLoyd Cooper sounds a twat.

As does this genius on his page

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Anyone But United</b>@AnyoneButUtd </span>  ·  <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/AnyoneButUtd/status/482205268869398528" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline"> 2h </span></a>
£29m for a 24 year old who hasn't played for his country yet. How did the last 2 big money signings work out for you?


Erm, Mata has done pretty well so far.

Fair does on Fellaini, but we can't all be as lucky as they were with pretty every striker they've signed for big money in recent times, Torres, Shev, Sutton etc. Hope Costa follows suit.

444~~~
Indeed! I'm really pleased for the lad. It's refreshing to see someone who wants to play for us so badly.

445~~~
Later than hoped but he's here now, welcome aboard Ander. 
Seems keen to want to play for us and that's always a plus. Now hopefully he can put us back on the right track to where we belong again.

446~~~
The anticipation and excitement is definitely back.  Can't imagine how bleak things would be around here if Moyes was still our manager, even with new signings.

447~~~
My god, he's a cutie.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

448~~~
We'd been heavily linked with Kroos and Fabregas prior to Van Gaal turning up, the links suddenly went cold and we signed Herrera relatively out of the blue. Given he's the kind of centre mid Van Gaal would love, I'd say it's a fairly good bet that we'd told Van Gaal of the various players we'd been targeting, and he gave this one the thumbs up.

449~~~
RVP didn't turn out too badly either! 2 out of 3 aint bad <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

450~~~
Let's not forget he has given up Champions League football with his hometown club to join us.

451~~~
Havent read through the posts when the story broke that Bilbao have rejected the bid this morning, but i'd say there was some amount of panic on here - poor feckers <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Fantastic that we got it sorted in the end & it was all just about Bilbao keeping face / political posturing & gettin us to pay the 4% fee to Zaragoza etc..

Great signing & he's already a starter ahead of everyone else in CM. More of the same in that area please United.. 

Shaw up next by the looks of it. These are the kind of signings that we all cry out for & i hope they keep coming over the course of the window..

452~~~
Probably better than most English footballers is my guess..

453~~~
<a class="username" data-user="70302, @Sixpence" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70302/">@Sixpence</a>

Well he had a conversation with Rio in the drug testing room when we played them a few years ago and I don't see Rio being a master of foreign languages so I guess he has pretty good English.

454~~~
Nice. Well we will soon see at 8.30pm.

455~~~
Totally agree man, but that doesnt really matter to me that much as it used to. Its just gettin top-class deals done & when the player is in the door - he'll see the full-scale of the transfer & the history / traditions of the club. Evra is the classic example of that mantra..

Gettin Anders & lookin good to get Shaw, really sends out a great message to all those top-class players we're interested in signing - "we mean business, so come & join the party too.."

456~~~
Genuinely know next to nothing about him other than he's Spanish and looks like a lesbian, but since we've spent an entire year trying to sign him, presumably he's fairly decent at this foot kick thingy. Big ups.

457~~~
Liverpool have got to be looking over their shoulders and concerned about top 4 now. Without their main man, rammed fixture list, us with a top manager and getting some good signings done.

Let's hope it pans out like that

458~~~
Interesting to see who's gonna bite from that post <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

459~~~
Yay!  New player! Seems a good lad. Only remember him from the matches against us but I'm sure he'll do well here as by all accounts he loves his football.

460~~~
Happy the midfield situation is finally being addressed. Poor old Bobby Charlton presenting him, what a legend. The mood is great in here now compared to this morning. It was suicide watch here this morning, people were calling for Woody's head. Welcome Ander<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

461~~~
He's a very good midfielder already. Some Spanish friends spoke highly of him (Barca and Madrid fans) and said that there is no doubt that he will be in Spain's squad soon

462~~~
Liverpool finished a strong 2nd lest we forget. They will also add to their squad. I'd be more concerned if I was an Arsenal fan <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

463~~~
Any streams for the interview will be welcome!

464~~~
This is all good, pictures with Bobby Charlton etc, but does Golden slash whatever believe this now? That's where it's at.

465~~~
They did, but Suarez was the difference, not to mention their lack of games versus everyone else, and an outrageous run of good luck, which only stopped when Stevie slipped.
Sterling will surely not have the same impact when people know about him a bit more, and Gerrard and Henderson, well you saw their true form sans Suarez in Brazil!.

Arsenal will always get top 4 under Wenger. It's written.

466~~~
What a day! Finally catched up with the Herrera transfer thread and now the Shaw thread has already grown in the last few minutes/hours! I fully expect us to complete our transfer business by this Saturday at this rate <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

He's a GTAM.

Does he play at 10 or is what I'm hearing rubbish?

Maybe it isn't the skill factor, with the Mata signing and him we are raising the IQ of our team.

489~~~

490~~~
Naturally a number 8 but he can play deeper as a 6 or further as a 10 as well (according to himself).

491~~~
Big Dave will show him how to nick donuts.

492~~~
Mata already picking up Dave's business habits. Herrera will to, we'll have a fleet of Spanish player/agent/scouts.

494~~~
Isn't he a little sweetheart.

495~~~
Agree with that Sand.

But i dont think we need to tell any clued-in scouser any of that, its pretty obvious that they must be shitin it now. Sadly, many scousers still remain deluded about all things regarding Liverpool - no common-sense about how last seasons 2nd place finish was achieved. 

I dont know the stats, but i'd say Pool played the same team for atleast 2/3's of the Prem season? They also got out of all domestic cups asap & had no European football either, so players had a week to rest for most of the season. Gerrard had a good season but i think his performances were exaggerated somewhat. Henderson - not a player we'd want at United thats for sure.

Suarez & Sturridge were the difference in them winning so many games last season & Pools defence is the main reason why they should have won more games or hung onto a win. 

Suarez was a massive draw for them to attract quality players & now he's missing until 25th October. Thats not to say he will be there anyway, but while he is - targeted players (in this window) can be convinced he wont be sold & with his form from last season & new additions coming in - players will have their heads turned if the money's right aswell..

496~~~
Love it!

How many players would say that about David Moyes...?

497~~~
Came home to see in my email from Manchester United that we'd signed him.
Feckin awesome!

feck mate, get to the Shaw thread.

504~~~
I know what you are going to say, RVP was just being polite. But that's the thing about Moyes, people will ask questions like you did but then when a top player has complimented the man it's a case of that player telling lies. Moyes is basically damned even if a player says good things about him.

Louis van Gaal is on another level to most managers, he is on the most elite level however let's not forget despite not being on that level, David Moyes is still a very good manager and I'm sure Hererra also could learn things from him, just not the same quality he could from Louis.

505~~~
Welcome Ander Herrera. Looking forward to see him playing for us.

506~~~
Did someone upload the interview? I missed it.

507~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_OhObYeGEs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

508~~~
What number will he wear?

509~~~
21 probably. I would love if he could get 18.

Depends if someone will go from midfield.

510~~~
A bit worrying that he's best deployed as a #10 but hopefully LvG can bring the best out of him deeper.

511~~~
Just heard the news, absolute awesomeness. Welcome Ander!

I have high hopes for this one. I'll e the first to admit that I haven't watched more than a handful of matches where he's featured, but he strikes me as a proper midfielder. How awesome it will be to have one of those in our team again, as opposed to the last few years of having to pigeonhole players who don't necessarily excel in those roles.

I'm properly pumped!

What was the fee, by the way? Everyone just state that we've payed the release clause, without actually mentioning what it was.

512~~~
Henriquez is 21 but I suppose that isn't really set in stone when he is away on loan so often.

513~~~
There's nothing to worry about. Ander's best position is at #8. That's where he played for Bielsa and in the Spanish U-21 team alongside Thiago + Javi. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

514~~~
Let's hope he gets 18 then.

515~~~
Not quite as worrying as signing no actual quality midfield player for years. 
Stahp

516~~~
LVG didn't seem to have any problems turning Bastian Schweinsteiger in to a central midfielder from a wide man so he has form for doing so.

517~~~
Beautiful! A season to late! But better late than never. Welcome lad!

518~~~
He wont need to do anything with Herrera since Herrera has played all of his career, except last season, in centre midfield.

519~~~
I go out for the afternoon, and come home to Herrera signed. Couldn't be happier
Awesome buy if you ask me, he's going to be a great player for us, and I hope he has many successful seasons here!

520~~~
I don't think he is a 36 million player, but he is a good player, creative and much better than anything we have in CM, so yeah I am happy that we signed a player like him, a little bit surprised too. With him, Shaw and van Gaal as manager I am much more positive for next season.

521~~~
He should have little trouble turning a central midfielder into a central midfielder really.

522~~~
I think it was 36 million euros or around £28.8 million.

523~~~
It's almost unthinkable that we neglected the most important part of the pitch for so long. I suppose when you had a player like Scholes, you didn't need a midfield. Absolutely delighted we've signed a genuine bonafide midfielder in ander Hererra. We have our very own Three amigos, and it feels great.

524~~~
Just read that he paid his own release clause. He must be loaded. 

Certainly can't be accused of being a mercenary.

525~~~
Has David Moyes any sons? 

Good to see agent De Gea and agent Mata doing their jobs.

526~~~

527~~~
Maybe it's both, it's surely the latter.

528~~~
Didn't United pay him the release clause so he could deposit it himself? Isn't that how it works?

Or am I totally wrong here?

529~~~
He doesn't have 36m so yeah United gave him the money.

530~~~
Can i see the full interview anywhere?

531~~~
Well that's just not true.

535~~~
Yes but we're a publicly listed company now, I bet the shareholders are keeping a close eye on value for money.

I'm not a shareholder nor a match going fan so I don't care as much. But it goes to show, transfer fees are not irrelevant.

Revenues from tickets should not be view in isolation though, it is all connected, commercial revenues are correlated with ticket revenues I would assume.

536~~~
Great great point and one many people may not have thought of. Both players known for intelligence along with RVP

A quick eye-glance at his handle could read 'Paul, UtdRacist'

That's most certainly true mate but then it's better to spend 100-150 odd million now and guarantee success for the near future than to risk losing out on European football that might end up costing close to 70 million per season with the new television deals. Just look at the likes of Real that netted almost 45 million from UEFA alone not to mention matchday + TV revenue. We'll be missing out on that next season. Also more success on the pitch = more prestigious sponsors. I'm sure there's value in that.

539~~~
The full mutv interview? Where could one find it?

540~~~

541~~~
Can someone help me. 

Herrera doesn't have £29m so we had to give it to him. This money, would be Herrera's income, and therefore taxable. 

However, if we instead 'loaned' Herrera the money, would that be taxable? For example, if we gave Herrera a €36m interest free loan then nominally set his signing on fee at €36m -€36m loan repayments then would that not be considered a liability rather than an income and therefore be nontaxable?

I've pulled this from my arse, someone tell me why this won't work

542~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

543~~~
I think they could argue that Herrera never actually had the money, it was given to a representative on his behalf who then paid it to the LFP.
Therefor they could say that seeing as Herrera never had the money, he can't be taxed on it. I'm not sure how it works though, but I'd think it wasn't actually Herrera that paid the money into the LFP, just someone acting on his behalf

544~~~
Oh is that what Paul looks like. I haven't listened to that podcast since Ed's outburst about Fergie and the Glazer's IPO.

545~~~
It's good, you should do. I'm more curious as to what Ed looks like.

546~~~
delighted! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> great young midfielder who can defend and is good going forward, just what we need for the new season, can't wait to see him in action under the new manager!

547~~~
Basically no. It can't be a loan, a loan that doesn't have to be repaid is what's known as a tax fraud.

However the wording of the LFP clause is such that it can be interpreted in various different ways. You hire tax lawyers to decide which is the 0% tax route most likely to be approved. All of them are framed around the idea that the player is never actually the owner of the money, he's either not involved in the money transfer or he is a passive intermediary in the process.

548~~~
Politeness or not. I think its safe to say no one would call Moyes " one of the best manager in these world". He's not that level, just "good"

549~~~
Thats not really what I was advocating, you could physically loan him it and then go through the formality of him 'paying it back'. I live in the commuter belt and loads of companies loan money interest fee in London to buy season tickets with which you pay back whilst working there, surely something along those lines would be legal even if you're effectively giving €72m (without half of it really leaving your possession)?

Either way I guess its an exercise in getting on the right side of the avoidance/evasion divide.

550~~~
Very happy with this signing!

551~~~
The wait for a player like this has been an odyssey, I still can't quite believe it's happened. I don't think it'll fully sink in till I see him out there playing and the impact it'll have on our play.

552~~~
Why wasnt Giggs there to greet him?

553~~~
Great to wake up to this news. 

Welcome Ander!

554~~~
Ditto.

Should've bought him last summer, paid the price. Finally we've got him sorted and with a great manager to coach him too.

Now one more midfielder, centre back and left back and we'll be golden

555~~~
He's off negotiating with another player?
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

556~~~
So Herrara, will prob take up no15 after Vidic or no18 from whenever Young leaves?

I dont see him taking 7 9 or 11. He could possibly take no5, but I doubt it.

557~~~
Quick 1. Did anybody watch his interview with MUTV at 20:30. Can he speak english? If so, how well?
Cheers

558~~~
Probably better than most of the Englishmen at the club.

559~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

560~~~
Youtube the interview... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

561~~~
Yeh, my money would be on 15. Just can see him with it for some reason.

562~~~
I can't stand Ed, I called him out on his bullshit and he was incredibly arrogant. If I remember correctly he was calling me delusional and brainwashed by the glazers <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. I haven't exactly been into contact with any propaganda that's for sure.

563~~~
Yeah, poor guy having to wait for so long. After   seeing how bad the team was last season might be a good thing the deal only happened now. And it's great when players really wants to come to the club. Looks like we have two signed up in Herrera and Shaw and 2-3 more to come I hope.

564~~~
This signing just pleases me so much. I'm under no illusions that he's going to be a world beater, but from what I have seen of him (admittedly not a huge amount), I'm excited to see a midfielder who will add some energy and dynamism to our midfield again. A player who can pick out an incisive pass and a player who wants to move the ball forward. All of these have been missing from our midfield since Scholes left, (save for the odd Giggs cameo). He's not the answer to our problems on his own, but he's a huge step in the right direction.

565~~~
Can anyone see Rio rejoining us on a 12 month contract as backup? I can see it if we can't get Mangala or Hummels, neither of which is looking likely.

566~~~
He's already signed for QPR

567~~~
I thought that wasn't official yet?!

568~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

569~~~
?

570~~~
It is yes, QPR announced it after he was released by us.

571~~~
God i love this signing. Another well-rounded midfielder at a young age (<26) and we're set for some time at a troublesome position. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

572~~~
Can't believe it! Elated.

573~~~
Welcome Herrerra to Manchester United.

574~~~
Firstly, he has agreed a deal with QPR. Secondly, the club didn't offer him a new contract, obviously not wanting him this season. He and the club have both moved on.

575~~~
Nope, nothing official confirming that he's joined QPR nor have QPR announced anything on the matter. Link?

576~~~
Very interested to see how van Gaal uses him.

577~~~
What was so funny about it though? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

I can't find anything official saying he's agreed a deal with QPR.

If we're lacking in numbers at the back, and can't find someone suitable to bring in, then there's a possibility we might bring him back. It's not something alien either; you see all the time clubs releasing a player only to then re-sign them a few days later. Just this season, Carlton Cole, Brad Guzan and Stuart Taylor were re-all signed by their respective clubs after they failed to sign a adequate replacement. Scholes came back from retirement also when we all thought each side had moved on.

578~~~
Very pleased with this deal and hopefully we have three or four more in the pipeline.

579~~~
There was nothing official on Herrera joining us but you knew it was happening.

If we wanted Rio, he would have been offered a deal to keep him here incase we didn't get our targets. Obviously the club has decided even if we fail with our targets, we have other CB's ahead of Rio. I don't know why I'm even discussing this.

Scholes was a very unique case.

580~~~
Despite me saying at the start "when he's signed and it's announced is when I'll believe it.." Yep..

Nope. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

581~~~
How is that obvious? You know feck all what happened behind closed doors with Rio and United. For all you know, LVG might bring him back if worse comes to worse. Not saying I want him here but as a last resort, if we fail to bring in an adequate defender, we could do much worse with a player that obviously loves the club and was trusted enough to start United's biggest game(s) of the season.

You don't know why your discussing this the same reason why you put up a smiley face in reply to my original post, because you've pretty much got nothing to say in your defence. Players get re-signed all the time and it's not entirely out of the question with United, with Scholes recently having come back after retiring, after we failed to fix the glaring hole in our midfield. We have one in our defence now, and Rio still ain't signed that QPR contract, no matter what "Sky Sources" tell you.

582~~~
What exactly happened? Didn't Bilbao release earlier today they rejected a bid? A few hours later they confirm he is off? Makes 0 sense <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Glad we got him anyway, welcome Herrera !

583~~~
I don't know but what I do know is that the club didn't want to renew his contract. He will get more at QPR, as he is getting nothing from United. Rio confirmed that he has played his last game for United, the club has done so also.

I am willing to make any bet that Rio does not play for Manchester United next season.

584~~~
That's all fine and dandy but no matter what you <i>think</i>, there's a possibility, no matter how small, that we could go back for him if worse comes to worse, so to laugh at like you do is just plain stupidity. You know nothing about the clubs plans' nor our defensive pecking order yet you go on about it like you do. West Ham didn't want to renew Carlton Cole's contract and released him but guess what? They ending up re-signing him because they found no one to replace him. It's not out of the question that we'll be unable to replace both Ferdinand <i>and</i> Vidic in one transfer window.

He obviously loves the club and you get the feeling if LvG wants him, he'll come back to us in a heartbeat rather than earn however much he could do at QPR. That tweet up there tells you everything you need to know.

585~~~
We bid. They rejected it. Herrera bought out of his contract with a briefcase full of money that he got from Woody. Herrera met Bobby Charlton.

586~~~
Everyone had ice cream.

Bilbao had none.

587~~~
Paddy Crerand didn't. He's lactose intolerant.

588~~~
Man Utd can afford special ice cream for him, and probably Darren Fletcher.

589~~~
Unfortunately it was Swaggy, rum and raisin flavour.

590~~~
Don't compare Carlton Cole and West Ham to Manchester United and Rio Ferdinand.

I understand how much he loves the club, that has nothing to do with any return. I will give into any bet if Rio plays for United again, just name it.

Apologies for discussing this people in the Herrera thread, I just can't get over the idea that someone thinks there is a chance Rio will play fo us next season.

591~~~
Yeah we can! Woody and his warchest.

592~~~
Swaggylicious.

593~~~
I hear you, but I dont think they'd let him go without being certain that someones coming in. The signings will become more evident as the targets get knocked out of competition or at the end of WC.

I think stating the obvious, expect to see at least one dutch signing, and potentially a couple Germans?

594~~~
From what I've seen, he's a great addition but I think he'll need the right partner to compliment his style and therefore we require at least one more signing to play alongside him. 

We'll have to see how it goes but the thought of a Vidal with Van Persie and Mata is mouth watering. Lots to do (hopefully) in the market but it's amazing how quickly an 'average' squad can look so potent. 

Makes the Champion's League omission more depressing although I think one year out if it will improve our league form and ensure investment for future success. Much to be excited for.

595~~~
Why not? Do tell... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

You're actually hilarious, mate. You know feck all about what goes on around United so who the feck are you to say if there's a chance he'll come back or not. Everyone expected us to sign someone a few midfielders to finally replace Scholes, Hargreaves and co. and guess what? We signed fecking Fellaini, failing to sign Herrera, Fabregas, Thiago etc.

I don't see how you can be so stubborn and narrow minded that you can't see the club going back to a player if they failed to buy a defender to replace him. 

Wait, you can't get over the fact that I think there's a 1% chance Rio could come back to United on a shot term deal? As I said, hilarious, guy. I can't get over the fact that you find it funny/shocking that someone thinks he might come back as a last resort if worse comes to worse and that you're so certain he'll never play for United again, knowing the square root of feck all on what goes on at United.

596~~~
Where's the interview?!

597~~~
Yep, I'd go along with your viewpoint. But we were pretty certain we'd get a few midfielders last year and we ended up with Fellaini. You can never be sure with United under our new CEO Woodward.

I find it hard to believe how <a class="username" data-user="74337, @Eric'sCollar" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74337/">@Eric'sCollar</a> can't even entertain this notion but rather than just simply disagree with it which is fine, try to ridicule me for thinking such a situation might arise. I'm not saying it will happen nor am I saying I want it to but none of us thought Scholes would come back, but he did and it made sense when you realised what a cesspit our midfield was. If our defence is still fecked and we can't get a experienced replacement, I don't see why Rio might not get another opportunity under the new gaffer LVG.

598~~~
Nah, he's right, Rio's obviously gone for good. Not sure where you've got the idea that we might do some weird U-turn and bring him back...

599~~~

600~~~
There is a 1% chance he will return? Ok, I'll cop that. Well there is a 1% chance Fergie will return. Also Giggs could possibly lace the boots next season and there is a 0.5% chance we will sign Suarez. I can guarantee you none of those will happen.

You accuse me of not knowing what goes on around United. Do you? I feel I can make educated opinions like anyone who supports the club and that's what I'm doing. I can't see anyway that Rio lines up for United next season.

On Cole/West Ham v United/Rio. I don't know where to start, I will just kick off with the negotiations and how it seems Rio has already agreed a deal elsewhere.

601~~~
Well, that's your opinion but at least you haven't laughed at it or tried to ridicule me for it. I don't think he will come back either because I'm hoping we sign at least one top class defender. But if worse comes to worse, and we don't, don't you think the club <b>could possibly</b> give him a short term contract as a stopgap? He obviously loves the club.

602~~~
By the look of it QPR will announce him very shortly. He's in Brazil, will formalize the deal when he returns to England - so they say.

Anyway, that Herrera, eh? A midfielder! And not a bad one either! I'm just about moved to tears here.

603~~~
This makes me happy. Really looking forward to see how he will ply his trade at the club. These are the type of players we should be going for, under the radar, humble youngsters who haven't peaked yet. Can't wait to see him in action.

604~~~
Why the bloody hell is the Ander Herrera thread being bastardised with idiocy about whether Rio Ferdinand will come back to United, having been told he was no longer wanted? 

There must be some other place for this stupidity to go? Like the Spastic posts in the Football Forum thread, or something.

605~~~
A Liverpool blog and their view on our latest midfield addition, seems like they're getting worried. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://anfieldbanter.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/united-buy-ander-luke-shaw-for-60m-way.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+AnfieldBanter+(Anfield+Banter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://anfieldbanter.blogspot.co.uk..._campaign=Feed:+AnfieldBanter+(Anfield+Banter</a>

606~~~
Back on Herrera, feck he looks cute. Just want to cuddle him. Must be something about the Spanish.

607~~~
I love the way it starts by saying by the start of the season he will be 25 as if we have bought a player nearing the twilight of his career. I stopped reading there.

608~~~
I'm really happy with the signing. Like everyone already said, I don't expect him to become a world beater, but he addresses exactly something that we have lost over the years in central midfield such as the ability to pick the right pass forward and energy. With Van Gaal coming in as manager at the helm, I'm sure there will be more to come and next season will get very interesting indeed.

609~~~
I think some ppl will be surprised when they realise how much he will actually bring to our midfield. While offering creativity, possesion and energy especially in attack, he is very strong defensively at the same time. Our midfield with him won't get overrun that easily anymore.

610~~~
I think people haven't realized just how slow and immobile our midfield has been for the last 7-8 years, and it makes a huge difference having an energetic midfielder with quality in there. Carrick had a good season in 12/13 but he was probably one of the main reasons as to why our play was so slow and static, zombie passing and all that. Now we'll have a player who likes moving with the ball and releasing it quickly, which will be a huge boost to our style.

611~~~
Is it just me, or is anyone else starting to feel a bit tingly inside?

612~~~
Does anyone remember the forward pass?. THe Old trafford faithful are goung to explode with excitement.

613~~~
Yep! Can't wait to watch him play for us!!! Still over the moon!

614~~~
The amount of buzz this lad is going to cause because of his creative intellect on the ball.  <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

615~~~
His first touch is like Fifa 14( the video game stuff). When receiving the ball,  joggle the left stick intelligently and you can effect damage. He can't shoot nor volley for shit, but I guess you can't have it all.
One day we may be able to clone Scholes, but for now, I wll make do, I will make do.

616~~~
Can't wait for the likes of Pearson,Rothwell or Goss come through to play alongside this lad.Should be a breath of fresh air compared to how immobile and dreadful our midfield was in the past few years.

617~~~
You can feel that the club as a whole is moving in the right direction. Getting in a superb manager, addressing midfield issue with buying an up and coming player.

This is the type of player I'd like United to get in. Player that has shown quality with other team, but not yet on the 'world class' bracket. Thus there's room and motivation for them to make their name at United, and for us fans (and my personal egoistical feel) to say that United 'make' them become one of the best.

And this is how the 'transition' is supposed to be. We may not win the league for a couple of seasons or more, but you just know that it's a matter of time before United back to become a league champion machine.

618~~~
One thing we can both agree on hopefully. He's going to be a star. everythings in place.

619~~~
No, not at all. We've let him go already. It's done. It would be like selling your old computer on eBay then asking for it back a month later. You obviously don't sell it unless you're certain you don't need it anymore, and the same would obviously have been true of Ferdinand.

Besides, since when would not buying a new CB be such a disaster that we'd be trying to claw back released old players? Evans has been better than Rio for a few seasons running now, and all three of our senior defenders were better than him last season, in which he was regularly disastrous.

Anyway, this is wildly OT. But it was just such a bizarre suggestion I couldn't leave it unrefuted.

620~~~
We may have the future Spain NT squad. Any suggestion for available good young Spanish wingers and leftback?

621~~~
Round Imogen' gaff.

622~~~
So if players re-signing for a team they've been released from is bizarre, then why is it a relatively common occurance. Guzan, Cole, Wright just off the top of my head. I wasn't being entirely serious with the suggestion, just saying it could happen.

Not sure why it's so bizarre though but then again you think Valencia is an intelligent footballer, despite him showing lack of an actual brain on more than a few occasions, so let's just agree to disagree.

Anyway, apologies to everyone, too many posts have been spent on Rio. Back to Herrera...

623~~~
Exciting times!! Really happy that the deal has been sealed!!

What number will he be taking? Has that been announced yet?

624~~~
I'm gonna be generous and say about 30% of this forum have ever seen him play more than twice.

625~~~
I'm part of that 30%. I've seen him play three times! Expert.

626~~~
Then you sir, are my go to guy in this Andermonium.

627~~~
I have not seen Duncan Edwards play either but I am told that he was a pretty useful player.

628~~~
He's the new Duncan Edwards you say?

Well that's it. Anything less and he's a dirty, dirty flop.

629~~~
Finally we sign someone and a midfielder as well, and now it is looking like few other deals are starting to be finalised as well. Good signs at last.

630~~~
<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/><img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/> I ought to get a ladle for you to stir!

631~~~
He'll make Duncan Edwards look like a playground 5 a side player. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/><img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

632~~~
So what? If he can have a good few games against United then there's no reason he can't step up and join United. He's already proven himself on the pitch with our players.

Check our transfer history, it's sound logic and it never fails.

633~~~
So according to my Spanish friend he is a really good player but not what United need. "Too offensive".

634~~~
maybe we should wait to see him play for us before deciding he's "not what we need"

635~~~
Waiting for everything to play out would be really boring. 

Anyway, it's not my opinion. I've never even seen him play properly.

636~~~
Last season he played at number 10, but was used as a deep lying playmaker and box-to-box under the manager before. His favoured position is a more box-to-box. He's dynamic, and puts himself about a lot - he averaged more tackles a game last season than any United player.

637~~~
I guess this has already been posted but this channel has lots of video of Herrera

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DesportivoMUFC/videos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/user/DesportivoMUFC/videos</a>

638~~~
Yeah....did you eat a Taco Bell tonight too?

639~~~
Was great to see Sir Bobby welcome him too.

640~~~
Yep. Personally, to me he sounds exactly the player we needed.

641~~~
Still need another midfielder , but this is a good start.

642~~~
Freaking fecking finally

Extremely excited with the new season

Did we officially get Shaw as well? I can't seem to find the news

643~~~
Everything pointing to Shaw being announced on Friday <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

644~~~
We didn't sign Shaw yet.

645~~~
He's on medical "cocks out" set and ready <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

646~~~
I've watched him play in every game in the season just gone after our interest last summer, if we could've signed Ander Iturasspe aswel, then our midfield would be in absolutely wonderful shape overnight.

647~~~
Looks like it will be announced today.

648~~~
from what I read/have seen of him he can play quite advanced but also is good at dropping back to help out defensively, I think we can use him pretty well because of that as a CM <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

649~~~
And then the papers will be calling it .....

"The Ander's game" 

I'll get my coat ..... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

650~~~
With Ando back from loan <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

651~~~
Now Van Gaal needs a number 6 in midfield. Luis Gustavo? Herrera and Mata will light up Old Trafford.

652~~~
Well, I guess we can forget about the new and old Holy Trinities then.

We've got the "Triple Anders".

*runs and hides* <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

653~~~
Any songs for him yet?

654~~~
Must be mindful though, we don't have that much game without Europa.

Mata / Kagawa / Rooney / RvP still needs to play.

Unless we go nazi and simply bin the rest of our previous midfield, I don't think buying too many players at once is the way to go. Subjective though, unless the said players accepts getting limited game time and started to get slotted slowly into becoming the first eleven.

655~~~
3 Cheers for Herrera, Hip, Hip, Herrera.

656~~~
I mentioned Iturasspe because he is a player who plays as the deep lying playmaker for Bilbao and would really add something to our midfield. But having said that, Bilbao would probably hire a hitman to get Woody if we tried to sign another first team player from them.

657~~~
People have asked, is he good?  It appears to me that this is an example of a player being undervalued and under appreciated because he played on a small stage at Bilbao.  If he played for either of the Madrid clubs or Barcelona, he would be mainstream based on how observers have described his game.  Now that he plays for a massive club in Man United where there are always eyeballs watching, he will get to truly showcase his talents.

658~~~
i hate to be greedy but i'd like to see us bring in another CM, someone dynamic to fit with Herrera.

659~~~
Luis Gustavo would be my suggestion.

660~~~
I agree with this post

Herrera is going to surprise alot of people when the season starts. He has all the qualities that a real top cm needs and he will be fantastic for us.

661~~~
^ Yep. If you look at Herrera's stats, they are very similar to Modric's at Tottenham. Now he's at Real Madrid, he's recognised as one of the best midfielders around. A lot of similarities between him and Herrera.

662~~~
I missed all fun.welcome Herrera.

663~~~
Hmm I've been reading the other locked thread, and it seems a lot of people are wondering how Bilbao can reject a buyout clause. They didn't reject a buyout clause. The offer that was rejected was United's<i> direct</i> offer of 36m i.e. not the buyout clause. That was the bid reported to be rejected. Then United moved on to getting Herrera to activate his buyout clause, which is why the stories 24 hours before we signed him were about him going to the Spanish tax office to hand the money and documents in.

Funny how Bilbao chose to publicise the rejected bid right before the announcement, when in fact they had most likely rejected the bid earlier this week and not yesterday as they made it out to be. I'm imagining the people running the Twitter account sitting back with a bucket of popcorn watching the chaos unfold after they tweeted about the rejected bid.

I suspect United didn't even expect Bilbao to accept the direct offer, it was more of a 'why not? Might as well' scenario, as evidenced by how quickly we moved on to the buyout clause after the direct bid was rejected.

Either way, we signed a CM! Ed is love. Ed is life <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

665~~~
Finally, a proper centre midfield signing. Brilliant.

What happens to Fellaini now? Will Van Gaal "Schweinsteiger" him as a centreback? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

666~~~
I think that would be catastrophic given how clumsy he can be. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

667~~~
what shirt number do we think he will get? our new #7 or something else?

I think Luke Shaw will get 5 for now as it's the only defenders one unassigned

668~~~
I'm guessing he gets #8 and Mata gets moved to #7.

Everybody is happy that way.

669~~~
Shaw will be 15 I reckon and will take the number 3 when Evra leaves/retires. I would like Herrera to take 18, but I guess he'll stick with his number 21.

670~~~
I'm not happy with Mata number 7 though. He's more suit for number 10 or number 20. Unfortunately, Rooney and RVP have them.

671~~~
Excerpts of the interview for those who missed it yesterday :

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/NewSignings201415.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/NewSignings201415.aspx</a>

Not the whole thing I guess..

672~~~
Is it just me or I feel that Herrera is not that good in his passing so I though if we want another centre midfield, we should looking at great passer and can control the midfield like Scholes or type of deeplying playmaker like Alonso or Pirlo.

673~~~
Actually the last part was quite true and a good point to make:
And that is exactly the positive side of us overspending (from the viewpoint of other club's budget).

674~~~
I think he's a great passer. The problem is many people look at his stats and don't see a Barcelonian success ratio of +/-90%. But they fail to see how many through passes he plays. He plays way more risky passes that obviously don't connect as many times as the short, safe back- and side-passes do.

675~~~
Indeed. If you go by passing stats, Tom Cleverly looks a good midfielder.

676~~~
Plus it also depends on your teammates / on ppl who are available or make themselves available to receive the ball and also who are capable of receiving the ball in tight positions. I mean look at Alex Song. Despite Arsenal also being a possesion team his passing accuracy with Arsenal was "only" 84-86 %, while at Barcelona it was 90-94 %. Of course your passing stats will improve if you have players like Xavi, Iniesta or Busquets to pass to.

677~~~
This is the way I see it. Lets say Rio hadn't been a utd player but had played at the same level for a club for the last 10, he would have been the perfect signing for us to bring on the younger players wouldn't he, in the same way as the Larry White cameo.....?

678~~~
Its just you.

679~~~
It's not. I've watched Herrera since he was 21 and I don't think he's a <i>great </i>passer at all. He's certainly not someone who's going to control the midfield for us.

680~~~
He is a good passer. Always looks for a good ball , (loves a through ball). Stats don't mean anything without context. But he is no worldie who is going to light up the PL with gobsmacking passes and control the midfield.

681~~~
yeah I guess it's just me. I watched his compilation in YouTube. He missed some of easy passes which what make me worry. And he's not a typical of Carrick or Scholes passing and vision. His playing style is also more likely a box to box midfielder if I have to say. But he's obviously what we need. An energetic midfield. We lack energy in midfield last season.

682~~~
I haven't watch his stats yet though if anyone knows the website. I only watched his compilation matches in YouTube. That's where I'm judging his passing.

683~~~
Excellent stuff, well done Woody!

Ideal in a midfield 3 he is IMO, hopefully the Chosen Van will herald a shift to a 4-3-3

684~~~
Oops.. I guess it's not just me.

685~~~
Good start to the window with signing Herrera and Shaw <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

686~~~
He will no doubt stick with 21.  Especially coming to a new country, for a bigger club.  As strange as it sounds he will desperately want to keep hold of that number.

687~~~
He's not a player who needs a play maker besides him. I never said Ander Herrera was the next Iniesta. But to say he is "not that good in his passing", as the poster I responded to did, is simply wrong. Herrera's passing is definitely above average. As I've stated before there is more than one way to skin a cat. Not every side has someone who puts their foot on the ball, Bayern didn't when they won the treble they used the power and presence of Schweinsteiger and Martinez. No Herrera isn't a metronome but he doesn't need one next to him to be successful.

Again, no dispute from me here. However, City just won the league with Fernandinho and Toure in centre midfield. Holland blew Spain out of the water without a deep lying playmaker, as did Chile. Having Pirlo didn't really help Italy cope with the energy and pressing of Costa Rica etc. Herrera isn't the next Xabi Alonso, he's not going to hang back and pick out long passes. However, that isn't going to be an issue. Herrera will carry the ball forward with him, and in and around the box he is more than good enough at picking his passes.

Herrera maybe doesn't come across best through compilations but this is my favourite:

I'll <i>have</i> to start supporting United soon.

You mean you don't, yet hang out in here? Even PeterStorey is a wannabe United fan.

690~~~
Bienvenido crack!

691~~~
Means nothing unless we sign another midfielder.

692~~~
Yeah, we might as well not even play the lad if we don't sign another CM. He means nothing. We might as well just play Ando in that case.

693~~~
Maybe we can sign another Basque in Iniago Martinez...

694~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

695~~~
fair enough, that makes sense that he will take 3 eventually, Henriquez is 21 right now isn't he? do you think he will go on loan again or?

I'd love Adnan to be our new #7 tbh <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> You are missing my point man.
What I mean was if we are planning to sign another midfield then we should target a midfield who can pass the ball. I'm okay if we stick with Carrick Herrera and Mata in trio, and also I'm trusting our youth players to shine in the future. But I'm just saying if we are going to sign the 2nd one then we should sign someone who can pick a pass. I don't really care what kind of role he plays even if he's deeplying midfield or Scholes type. As long as he can pick a pass. May be like Ryan Giggs.

698~~~
I don't get it. Clearly LVG only use 352 just because the absent of Strootman. And try a formation which he thought really good against a team like Spain. It's not like he will stick with 352 forever.

699~~~
This. People need to get the 3-5-2 out of their system. Most likely formations for united next season: 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1.

700~~~
I'm really struggling to get on board with one - more so than the Luke Shaw move (which I'm struggling plenty with).

It's a feck-ton of money to be spending on someone who isn't anywhere near the top bracket of midfield players in the world. It almost feels like we're signing the Spanish equivalent of Fabian Delph (If you go with the idea that Jesus Navas is the Spanish equivalent of Ashley Young... in that he's very quick, and can decieve you into think he's good, but he's actually quite rubbish... though Navas is of course better than Young, because Spaniards are better than the English at football... so he's a better footballer by the standard incremental amount) ... which isn't really the world beating centre midfielder I had hoped for, or that we deseperatly need.

701~~~
Maybe to some extent I missed you're point. However, I don't think we need the player you're saying we do. Look at how football is changing. The most successful sides in the last couple of years have not been the ones using deep lying play makers. The exception is Juventus, but they have Pogba and Vidal to do Pirlo's running for him, and they hit a roadblock in Europe.

You are saying we should buy a type of player that has been going out of fashion since Bayern Munich beat Barcelona by 7 goals on aggregate. Atleti got to the Champions League final, eliminating Barca on the way, with a solid 4-4-2 playing Gabi and Tiago. There is not a single team left in the World Cup who use a proper deep lying player, with the possible exception of Cabaye in the French midfield (again someone who has Pogba and, in this case, Matuidi, to do the heavy lifting). Most sides use aggressive pressing and hard running to dominate games as Holland and Chile did against Spain. Brazil are advancing mostly through the ability of their midfielders to nick the ball high up the pitch and get it fast to Neymar. Pretty much nobody is using the Carrick type metronome who sits back and sprays passes. A new football cycle has begun. 

If we are going to sign a second midfielder it should be someone like Javi Martinez or Fernandinho who is strong, powerful and can get up and down the pitch alongside Ander.

702~~~
I don't think you're actually disagreeing with what him. He's simply saying that Herrera doesn't look like a Scholes-type passer and that if we were to add another midfielder it'd ideally be a playmaker. He doesn't need one to play alongside him but I personally think we need a playmaker with the way our team is set up. I agree he's an "above average" passer but I don't think anyone was suggesting otherwise. He's just not a great passer. I love Vidal but it would be a little frustrating for me to see us spend £60m+ on two midfielders and still lack a passer in the middle.

703~~~
Neither was Fernandinho, neither was Martinez, Modric was only slightly more highly rated at Spurs. You don't need to sign the best midfielders on the planet to get a quality player. Have you ever watched Herrera?

704~~~
Welbeck when alternatives include Mata and Januzaj? Did you mean to put De Gea in or is that a typo for 'Amos' ?

705~~~
We still have Carrick - he is that player. He's had a woefully bad season which really exposed his lack of character, but I think in a good team he'll return to his controlling, incisive style.

I actually think with Mata/Kagawa/Rooney vying for the 10 spot and all preferring to drop into midfield to receive and link the play we do need a more Vidalesque midfielder to round off our summer signings (CB too & a winger, sure why not.)

I've been impressed with Carvalho so far in his limited outings - big, strong and technically decent - best thing about him seems to be his reading of the game and positioning. I'd be slightly wary of buying two less established CMs and throwing them right in, but I think he's a realistic target and could grow into a real Rolls Royce.

706~~~
Swap kags for j.mata.

707~~~
Also would be more than happy with Strootman, if not just because he looks like RVPs midfielder brother.

708~~~

709~~~
Oh take that fecking England shirt off

710~~~
Yep - I watched him in about half a dozen or so games this season - largely due to our interest in him last season. Wanted to find out what all the fuss was about - and I've found him to be good (very good at times actually ) without exactly blowing me away. Still, by all accounts he's had a very good season for Bilbao - but he still has to kick on from that.

And I'd say Modric and Martinez were certainly more highly rated before their big moves - especially Martinez, who got non-stop rave reports.

711~~~
You're really underrating Herrera here.

712~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the things people choose to get riled by

713~~~
Koke is actually really good for picking a pass. Gabi has decent pass as well I think. We have Herrera. And he's not a great passer and we need to fill in that weakness, but as what you said before he can carry the ball forward with him. I'm just saying what happen if we face a team who does a bus. Surely Herrera won't be able to carry the ball forward beating 9 defenders. What happen if we face a team who has very solid and tough midfielder. Just carrying the ball forward isn't enough. We need a plan B then. Make someone who can deliver a great ball like Pirlo. Like Scholes. Like Alonso etc. Or even the pass like what Carrick did to Chicharito against Chelsea. And also we need a centre midfield who switch the ball from left to right or right to left. I can see a reassemble Henderson with Herrera. Just imagine what happen if Gerrrard is actually Alonso or someone who can pass the ball like Scholes. Liverpool would probably have won the league not City. 

As I said before it doesn't matter what role, as long as he can pick a pass. Scholes and Ryan Giggs are another example of player who can pick a pass and they are not a deeplying midfielder who just sit back like Carrick or Pirlo

714~~~
Koke doesn't play in centre midfield for Atleti, he plays off the flank. I'm not certain Gabi's passing is better than Herrera's. In fact, having watched them both a lot, I'd dispute the idea that Gabi's passing is better than Herrera's. They're both above average passers yes but neither is the kind of player you're referring to e.g. a Scholes or a Pirlo.


I think to be fair to <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> its that his response to my posts shows he and I have a slightly different perspective on the game, same with <a class="username" data-user="84880, @JSMHE" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84880/">@JSMHE</a>.

Carrick, good as he is, is coming to the end of his career and there's a question of where we go next. For me, the answer is more energy, more running, more power. <a class="username" data-user="84880, @JSMHE" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84880/">@JSMHE</a> and <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> seem to be making the case for style and guile and a bit of the unexpected from the base of our midfield.

Looking at Van Gaal's teams of recent years he hasn't tended to use a deep lying play maker. It has mostly been destroyer, box-to-box, creative force. Carrick is a bit different to that, he's not a De Jong or a Van Bommel. I expect that if Van Gaal adds a midfielder it will be one that fits that template, and to me that will be fine because its that template that's been dominating football for the past couple of years.

715~~~
As I said, Spanish equivalent of Fabian Delph (but a lot better due to the Spanish/English incremental increase in quality). Known for being box to box, working hard, generally playing quite well all the time - but not breaking into the national side or played at the top level yet.

Nah, I fully realise I'm doing him a disservice - I've seen him play a full game of football about  7 or 8 times, which isn't enough to build an opinion of a player on - so all I really have to go on is reports/opinions on others. Still, if my personal feeling is to be cocnerned, I can hardly change that until the lad puts a United shirt on and proves me wrong - which I have no doubt he's capable of doing.

716~~~
Wouldn't Felling be a decent partner for him?

717~~~
I don't think there's anything wrong with either of their passing abilities (obviously not scholes esque) but it's just we won't have a player who dictates the tempo of the game more then anything, like scholes used to do, or Carrick used to do. It's not necessarily a bad thing really, it could go either way, it's just a change in style and goes a little against Van Gaal's usual style I think.

718~~~
I reckon so Vatsy - 90% of the Caf have written him off as the worst player ever though.

719~~~
He might not be a massive twat though

720~~~
He plays!! Not all games but he plays as a centre midfield for Atletico. Not so sure if I'm asking a player like Scholes or Pirlo. I'm just talking about their pass. And I don't think I said Gabi's passing is better than them. But at least we know that Koke's passing is better than any our last season centre midfield passes including Herrera. Which we can say Atletico has a great passer in their team.




Herrera is energetic judging from the compilation matches I watched. He can do both defense and attack. And obviously he does running as well. So I guess there we go we have your answer now Herrera. A midfielder who can do both attack and defense, energetic and more running. But just imagine if LVG have Pirlo or Alonso or Scholes or Giggs or even Koke in his Netherlands team a centre midfield who can switch the ball flank to flank and a long beautiful ball. Man, he's probably will be more pleased.

721~~~
Not exactly what I said is it, he needs a midfielder to compliment him, one which we don't have have. But then again I forgot that a few days ago you thought that Herrera was Modric reincarnated which says it all really.

722~~~
Herrera seems a perfect fit for the 4-3-3 LvG still prefers. Let's wait and see if another CM will be signed.

723~~~
You must be mistaking me with somebody else. A midfielder to compliment him would be ideal, but he'll still improve us regardless, so it doesn't mean nothing if we don't sign somebody else. I was half joking anyway, I know you didn't literally mean that.

724~~~
Poor lad if he has to rely on Fellaini as his partner. Really don't think so. But maybe LvG is a magician and could turn even Fellaini into someone who could look remotely like a midfielder.

725~~~
Lets not get picky, him looking remotely like a footballer in any position would do.

726~~~
Still won't stop some saying Van Gaal will play 3-5-2. 4-3-3 is the way forward.

727~~~
He'll def improve us but midfield still needs additions for sure. I don't get jokes this early man!! Gimme another 2 hours for my brain to engage.

728~~~

729~~~
Herrera's stats should improve now he's going to play with RVP and co.

730~~~
Poll says Herrara.

731~~~
I have rarely seen him play, but I'll just add some generic praise to fit in and make me sound knowledgeable.

He'll be a star, he'll change the midfield, I don't even think people realize how much of a good signing this will turn out to be. Really good player.

732~~~

733~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Hush. We don't say such things out aloud. Just play along.

734~~~
Well, if reports are to believed, LVG turned down Kroos which basically is one of the best playmakers in the game, so he clearly feels he doesn't feel he needs one.

From what I've seen in LVGs teams he never used a deep playmaking midfielder. It's always 2 energetic midfielders(usually one more defensive and one box to box) and one that plays in a more advanced role that usually is a playmaker or one that plays behind the striker.

I personally think that if we're going to buy another CM, it's gonna be a defensive midfielder or somebody similar to Ander that is strong both attacking and defensive.

Anyway, we have no idea how the team will be set up under LVG, we can't even be sure what formation he is going to play. So, we're basically just speculating. Can't wait to see how it works out.

735~~~
Is there a link floating about to the full interview?

736~~~

737~~~
Does Ander give hugs like Mata?

738~~~
This I don't agree with. Koke's role at Atleti is very similar to Silva's at City. He comes into central areas off the flank. Atleti play a compact 4-4-2 that makes them tough to break down and opens up triangles and passing angles going forward. Its a hallmark of theirs which everyone in Spain recognises because 4-4-2 is so alien to La Liga. Koke can play in centre midfield, Del Bosque used him there in the World Cup against Australia. However, Simeone tends to use him off the flank.

How would Van Gaal use the players you mentioned? I dunno. He got on well with Guardiola and Xavi when he was Barcelona manager. It has usually been Van Gaal's preference to use powerful, technically gifted players like Davids and Seedorf but he made Guardiola his captain. Still, I doubt he would have done that if Guardiola would've been like Pirlo e.g. a pure play maker instead of a tackler with vision. Alonso, who is similar to Guardiola in the sense that he puts his foot in, I could see as a number 6 in Van Gaal's system. Maybe he would've dropped his 10 to include Pirlo, Scholes or Giggs, as its never been a hard rule that Van Gaal's creative midfielder operates in the hole as opposed to as part of a genuine midfield three. 

Anyways, all of that is irrelevant. We have Ander Herrera, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2130019/Manchester-City-United-want-Ander-Herrera-Athletic-Bilbao.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the so-called Spanish Steven Gerrard</a>.

Question is, does he do blogs like Mata?

745~~~
Thanks!

746~~~
Amazing questions there:

Will Mata and De Gea help you settle in?
Are you excited to work with Van Gaal?
Are you excited about the new season?

Questions to which there can be only one answer, always the vital ingredient for any fascinating interview.

Actually, there was one good bit of that:

Q: What is your style of play?
A: Im a midfielder, that is one of my best qualities. And I always like to participate.

Cant be denied that a midfielder who will participate is exactly what many of us have wanted for a long time. Feels like he knew his audience with that one.

I cant wait to see him let his football do the talking.

747~~~

749~~~
Every picture with Booby Charlton gives me that feeling! I said it last year, from the soundings after the screw-up last year, that there were no bridges being burned. I felt that this was a player that wanted to play for United. Delighted to see him here and hope he's a success.

Still not a punch-the-air type signing, but it's close! However, after last season, the unveiling of a new kit would nearly make me do that.

750~~~
It does seem that way doesnt it. You can ask exactly the same questions but in a less leading way to get a more considered answer:

Would you have come to United were it not for Mata and De Gea?
How much do you know about Van Gaal?
United have just had a very poor season by their standards. What is your target for the club next season?

Not the best questions, but better than the ones he asked. 

Its a bit of a bugbear of mine but the quality of journalism in football is scandalous in the UK. If you see a really good interview you really notice it because most of it is complete dross.

751~~~
Right at the wrong time too. That takes some doing.

752~~~
Well, at least he didn't ask his usual trade mark shite question this time: "How much are you looking forward to play with Wayne Rooney?" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

769~~~
I like the stats for tackles and interceptions, now hoping teams won't just be allowed to walk through our midfield.

770~~~
That's the key isnt it. They are just butthurt that they cant financially compete with us.

771~~~
Has anyone said his english is better than Rooney's yet?

772~~~

773~~~
We bought a midfielder. I will tell my kids of this day

774~~~
Carrick tweeting about his midfield partner!

775~~~
Edited <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

776~~~
Was close to saying that myself <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

777~~~
I want to know one thing before I watch him for the first time. Is he two footed?

778~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I think with the right midfield partner and some rest between games Carrick still has a couple of good years left in him.

779~~~
Oh Young.

780~~~
Hinted at.

781~~~
Nice stats, although you have to be wary of reading too much into comparisons like that, because there's so much more to what a player's doing on the pitch than just the numbers. Fabregas plays for a better team so would be expected to have more impressive stats. But Herrera is much more of a key player in midfield than Fabregas, so might be expected to be more involved. All those sorts of considerations make stat comparisons difficult.

Still, taking Herrera's stats on their own, they've very impressive indeed. The kid sure can tackle!

782~~~
Good point. 

I think Fabregas is clearly the better player regardless, but since we couldn't get him Ander is a very good alternative.

783~~~
Would Herrera be best utilized in a two man midfield or three man?

784~~~
Surely our days of playing 2 man midfields are now over?

785~~~
nice stats there, although to be fair to cesc last season was probably his worst in a while.

ander's stats seems to be well balanced too. certainly he is capable of creating chances and not afraid to get stuck in.

786~~~
He speaks good english

787~~~
4-3-3, the most advanced one or a right-sided CM.

788~~~
So chuffed  for him, and greatful he gave us the time of day after we dicked him around last summer

789~~~
Indeed. 4-4-2 is a thing of the past. You just get overran in midfield.

790~~~
Ashley young <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

791~~~
De Gea, Mata and Herrera were all part of the same Spain team at youth levels. Javi Martinez was in the same team and also played with Herrera for Bilbao. Just putting it out there....

792~~~
I was sad that we did not get him last year, but better late than never.

793~~~
Welcome to the club lads who I'll probably never play with.

794~~~
surely won't be the most advanced one, as that's the position we already have a sh!Tload of players for, Mata, Rooney, Kagawa and even fellaini!

795~~~
He's just asking for the "See them soon?  So you're signing for Swansea, Sunderland or Burnley then?" comments...

796~~~
Lovely - who's next Ed?!

797~~~
If Liverpool is going to sign Lallana for 25mil pound, I don't actually feel Herrera was any expensive anymore. Herrera is younger and have much more potential.

798~~~
They're only a year apart to be fair.

799~~~
A midfielder? What sorcery is this?

800~~~
Thought Herrera was 24 and Lallana 26?

801~~~
I'm going by wiki here but Lallana was born in 88 and Herrera in 89. Ander's the same age as Cleverley.

802~~~
Ander will be 25 on the 14th August. Lallana turned 26 on the 10th may

805~~~
He's got everything we need in a midfielder. Seriously can't wait till he's bedded in and pulling the strings for us.

806~~~
Wonder how our season would have turned out if Moyes secured Herrera last Summer. Was a good spot from Moyes tbf, he looks a great fit.

807~~~
Moyes didn't spot him.

808~~~
He was pulling strings like that against us, way before Moyes joined.

809~~~
Who did?

We all knew he was a good player. I meant in terms of being the right fit in our team.

810~~~
Martin Ferguson iirc.

811~~~
Yup. By all accounts, including the journos favourable to Moyes, Martin Ferguson had been scouting Herrera for two years before Moyes arrived. Herrera was recommended to Moyes when he became United manager, but Moyes wanted to scout him himself before committing to the transfer: Moyes was worried he would get blamed if he spent £30 million on Herrera and the transfer didn't work out. So Moyes went for Fellaini instead... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

This was all reported, again, earlier this week by Graham Hunter, Adam Crafton etc.

812~~~
Didn't realize he is 6ft. Also we do love baby faced players, don't we?

813~~~
#07 is right.  Moyes shat in his diaper on Herrera and instead went for the "safe" bet in Fellaini.  Fukkin clown.

814~~~
I would like to be positive about Moyes but the more I think about it the more amazed I am that he was ever appointed United manager.

815~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This summed up Moyes problem during his time with us. He didn't trust the people who were giving him advice. Martin Ferguson had been scouting players for United way before Moyes was failing to win a trophy for Everton.

816~~~
Really? Wow. Thought he'd be one of those diminutive types from his pics. Even better then!

817~~~
Good spot from Moyes! Oh the irony!

818~~~
I don't want to derail the thread so I'll keep it brief.  What I truly believe fukked Moyes was the 7 year contract.  He must have truly believed he would be given 3-4 seasons to establish himself.  He took that stupid vacation then he dithered in the summer, then he panicked.  He failed to realize that 2013 was not 1986.  Oh well, shit happens.

819~~~
In that video at 3:01, that's the first time I've ever seen a player use the Zidane roulette while defending. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

820~~~
That flick at 4:55 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Looks like a really smart tackler as well. Oh, and his first touch is incredible. Overall looks very confident on the ball going forward, which is something we've been in dire need of for quite a while. Can't wait to see him play, delighted at the signing.

821~~~
Noticed that too, so cocky <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

822~~~
Carrick does a surprising amount of roulettes, but it's more when he rarely gets forward.

823~~~
Did Buttner never try it? I remember him doing a few stepovers right out by his own cornerflag. It sounds like something Buttner would do, and probably cock up

824~~~
It's not just that mate, it's that Moyes was scared. Remember when Moyes said he hadn't subbed Van Persie against Newcastle because of what people would say? For me, that set off alarm bells. How can the manager of Man Utd be afraid to make a decision because of what the media might say?

Moyes was paralysed by fear. He dithered over transfers, he wouldn't drop big names, he failed to give certain players a chance, all because he was afraid to get it wrong. Sadly, his refusal to try anything different led him to retreat into his comfort zone and behave like a small time manager at a big time club.

There's a line in Sir Bobby's book where he says fans will forgive you if you take a shot and miss, what they wont forgive is if you have the chance to shoot but don't. That's why Moyes gets so much flack: He was presented, over and over again, with chances to save our season but he didn't. Instead he hid behind excuses.

Had Moyes signed Herrera we'd have finished fourth and Moyes would still be United manager, no doubt about it. But, true to form, Moyes was too scared to take the chance. In the end, and deep down Moyes must know this, it wasn't Woodward, the players or the fans that did for him. Moyes did himself in by bottling it so often everyone at the club stopped believing in him.

825~~~
I'm glad we got him a year on for that reason, as bad as that sounds.

826~~~
The assist skills video mentions that. Same, I thought he was average height at best but rewatching some of the clips he did seem big enough.

827~~~
Same here. I thought it was a strange thing for a Manchester United manager to say. Regardless, I stood by him but lost patience after the City/Liverpool home games. The Bayern away game was also the start of it, with his refusal to sub Rooney out. In fact, his pandering of Rooney throughout the season and the looming prospect of Rooney being captain (this could still happen, mind) for the next season made Moyes' sacking much much easier to accept for me.

Well, that was cathartic. 

Can't wait for the season to begin.

828~~~
I watched a bunch of Youtube videos and a fair few Bilbao games last season and his first touch is sublime.

Always appreciate a good first touch. One of the reasons to love Berba and destroy Rooney (yes I'm aware you shouldn't).

829~~~
It's true there is something about instantly controlling the ball that is a joy to watch, I'm thinking of a particular occasion when Berbatov took a ball coming high over his shoulder and just seemed to cradle it with his foot. I can't remember who it was against but it was probably one of the most memorable moments of the entire season.

830~~~
For no rational reason i like that United didn't give up on this signing, it is character building and shows how much Herrera is wanted here!

Reminds me of the Ruud signing.

Looking forward to seeing him kick a ball now!

831~~~
Thanks, ThanksBoss26, appreciate it.

832~~~
yeah I just said where he's best played.

833~~~
Speaking of Moyes, I read somewhere that he's sharing "ideas" with Galatasaray. Maybe they want him for a pre-match sacrifice or something.

834~~~
Here's hoping the first thing Moyes does is makes a £40m bid to take dear old Wayne off our hands.

835~~~
Van Gaal might let him go for less than that. To be honest, I don't think Rooney's going to prosper under the new regime.

836~~~
From Youtube it's evident he has a great first touch and eye for a through ball, van Person will love him no end!

837~~~
I think he'll start off as first choice on the left, maybe switch with Mata in the hole. He's a top player as much as united fans like to hate him for some reason, so I think he'll make it work.

838~~~
Don't get me wrong, I like Rooney but I think Scholes made a telling comment about him peaking a year or so ago. If we get a decent offer, I wouldn't be too upset at his departure.

839~~~
Unless you're, say, Real Madrid. They used 4-4-2 to great effect on their way to the CL. Think Atletico use it from time to time too, don't they? 4-4-2 isn't dead yet.

840~~~
Atletico used it practically all the time to win La Liga. The formation's still got legs, but it puts far more individual demands on the players. There is no hiding in a 4-4-2, in effect.

841~~~
Who says Moyes didn't want Herrera? 

If Moyes had gotten Herrera and Coentrao, it would have been a very different season.

842~~~
Not really. Moyes would still have been Moyes, the players would still have been seriously underwhelmed with their new manager, those that stopped performing would still have stopped performing.

Moyes' problem here was that he simply wasn't good enough. Herrera and Coentrao wouldn't have changed that.

843~~~
If Moyes had of wanted Herrera as a priority, you think the club would have left it till the last day to sort a deal?!

844~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/1908047/hunter-herrera-the-right-man-for-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/1908047/hunter-herrera-the-right-man-for-united</a>

He didn't not want him but wanted to scout him for another year.

845~~~
It implies a certain level of confidence in their own abilities which is always good to see. I remember watching the last U21 tournament, and even players like Rio stated that England needed young players like the Spanish who were confident enough to always show for the ball, even if they were tightly marked because they had enough self belief and technical ability to do it.

846~~~
I was firmly in the "give Moyes more time camp", but since he's gone, signings aside, the whole club seems to have taken on a new lease of life. van Gaal being appointed, the general mood coming out of the club all seems better. Add that to us getting some good transfer business done early giving those lads a chance to settle in and get a good pre-season with the team and it's easy to see why we'd be optimistic going into next season. Herrera alone is such a great signing, simply because he is a quality player in an area where we were really struggling. While I want, and expect another signing or two, I reckon with the new manager and the two new additions we'd be back battling for the top four if we went into the new season as we are now. 

Obviously we want more than that, but that's how much I think we've improved already this summer, and the transfer window isn't even open yet.

847~~~
It´s sinking in.. Great, welcome you spanish gnome.

848~~~
"A couple of days later I got a text from Moyes to the effect that "the club," i.e. executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, had decided to go "all in" on the last day of the transfer window and to try to pull the deal off."

That's what the link says though? I'm not arguing that Moyes did want him. I just haven't seen enough proof that he didn't (as many here are pointing out)

I don't fully agree with that and don't really want to discuss about Moyes in this thread but the amount of goals/attacks that came through the left hand last season really damaged our chances.

849~~~
Not seen him play much but I'm excited.

850~~~
Yep, that's basically where we're all at.

851~~~
No signings and a class manager would be us in the top 4, battling for the league, with a weaker squad than City and Chelsea, but definitely competing. IMV

852~~~

853~~~
Better player than Fabregas as far i'm concerned. Herrera has superior technique in tight spaces, it's a joy to watch.

854~~~
In all honesty, he is not. Cesc is better.

855~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_OhObYeGEs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

856~~~
Fabregas is in a tier or two above Herrera even if I much prefer Herrera's playing style and think he has a higher skill ceiling than Cesc. Herrera can play as our most defensive midfielder, a box-to-box or an offensive central midfielder whereas Fabregas isn't that great defensively so he has a more unique role where you have to play him.

857~~~
Yup, agree.

858~~~

859~~~
Is it just me or does that picture look photoshopped?

860~~~
Extremely. For some reason he has no shadow the poor lad.

861~~~
Maybe he can give De Gea some english lessons

862~~~
Fabregas is a very good midfielder don't get me wrong but his technique in tight spaces was not of the standard Barca were asking from him. Herrera has sublime technique in tight spaces and is a better dribbler than Fabregas. I'm glad that we will see both players in the EPL and i'm very confident Herrera will prove to be the better player because he has a better all-round game and can play in a number of positions in central midfield.

863~~~
I think going forward Herrera will definitely prove to be the better buy than Fabregas.

Of course it won't help him being at Chelsea, playing for a manager he doesn't like and probably ending up on the bench half the time.

864~~~
Its always great to hear by players that we are the biggest club in the world... They both Ander and Luke will shit their pants once they see the support we have around the world, perhaps they are lucky that we are heading to USA not Asia like last year. That would have been insane for them..
OT: When do the players come from holiday? I just cant wait to see ANY updates especially photos from training sessions etc..

865~~~
Obviously. Cesc is the better passer. scores and assists more. But Herrera more than doubled the amount of tackles and interceptions Cesc made.

866~~~
Looking forward to seeing how Herrera vs Fabregas shapes up next season. If Herrera matches up to Fabregas' performances, I'd be chuffed.

867~~~
Poor lad seemed petrified <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

868~~~
The full story on what actually happened last year isn't known, but there were plenty of rumours that we were still interested in him AFTER the deal broke down (there were rumours we might go back in for him in the January window, as some might recall). So, unless this interest was purely on Woody's part (contrary to Moyes' wishes at the time) I think it's fair to say Moyes wanted him - not that it matters now. Both Herrera and Shaw were on Moyes' infamous "list", I think.

869~~~
It isn't a real 4-4-2 at Real Madrid is it though.

A proper 4-4-2 is two strikers and two wingers. They lined up 4-3-3 effectively.

When I watched Athletico they may be more like 4-4-2 but Costa lead the line with someone dropping into midfield when they didn't have the ball.

The reality is practically nobody uses a classic 4-4-2 anymore.

870~~~
agree with that. If you can take the champions to 7th, you can certainly under achieve with those two players too.

871~~~
So excited to see him play. Have only seen him the once or twice. Really like the way he is described as a player though. Very versatile CM. Hope he can perform well.

872~~~
To be completely honest I was never that impressed by watching the youtube vids.

In saying that it seems he has legs and energy and is a smart guy, I think he will do well here.

873~~~
I'm still in shock that we've actually bought a football player who operates primarily in the middle of a football pitch. It's been too long.

874~~~
Villa played up front with Costa in around half of their games and they won the league.

875~~~
I'm a fanboy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2 years I've been wanting him, so I'm quite excited.

876~~~
You could equate Atletico's 4-4-2 to Uniteds when Rooney + striker play, and Rooney does the dropping deep when the other teams have the ball.

877~~~
Spot on.

Moyes had the ideal opportunity to step up & vanish that "safe underdog" mentality but sadly, it summed him up. Going for Fellaini because he hadn't seen enough of Herrera (or even Thiago if some stories are to be believed - though others point it at Giggs) sums Moyes up to the tee.

No appetite for risk.

878~~~

879~~~
i m starting to like the guy










....

880~~~
I just get the feeling that Herrera will fit in well here. With the likes of Shaw and Mata as well, it seems we've signed good lads as well as good players recently. Players who really want to be at the Club.

881~~~
Every time I see pictures of him in a United gear for a second I think we've mistakenly signed Joseph Gordon-Levitt <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

882~~~
Hasn't played a game for us and he's angling for his own song. fecker.

883~~~
They spoke to Andy last night on United in Press , he was talking about Ander and that quite often when you interview footballers you don't get much that is interesting out of them. He said Messi is awful to interview.He said he spoke to Ander for, I think 90 minutes and he spoke about all sorts of things, not just football. That he is a really nice well grounded lad who will be great for us. I don't know if anyone can find a clip of the programme.

884~~~
I'm happy with his signing, although I would have preferred Kroos or Fabregas. Something that does worry me though is the fact it doesn't add goals to the centre midfield area and we have craved that for a long time. Averages around three goals a season which is neither here nor there in what we should be aiming for from that position.

885~~~
Probably about 3 times more goals that our midfield managed last season, so that is good. I think our team as a whole will score a lot more goals next season, just from a change of manager.

886~~~
I don't think it'll be that big of an issue, if he can add 5 goals that'd be a great return from him. He'll give us more presence in midfield something we've been screaming for years.

887~~~
We've got enough goals in our team with the right managemenet. Mata/Kagawa/Rooney will bring the midfield goals (one of them will probably play as the most advanced of the midfield three). He's also more than capable of upping his own goal tally in my opinion. As long as he's strong in the tackle and direct passing, which he is (only 4 key passes less than Fabregas despite playing 3 games less and great tackling stats) and can pop up with a few goals himself, I'm happy.

888~~~
Kroos and Fabregas would be the furthest man forward of a midfield 3 in van Gaal's most likely system at Manchester United and we already have Mata who's better than both of those mentioned players occupying that role whereas Herrera can play in a box to box role.

889~~~
The whole goals from midfield thing is overrated, and talked about way too much in the media. Obviously goal-scoring midfielders are nice, but when you have forwards of the quality of RVP, Rooney, Mata and Januzaj, the most important thing for the midfield to do is get the team playing well and making chances. Whether or not they score much is almost negligible by comparison, because if the team is playing well those forwards will score plenty of goals.

890~~~
Agree with the last two posts (884 and 885).  You need to look at the fit between player and team, not just the quality of the player.

891~~~
The thing is, we have very few players capable of seeing out the defensive duties, that is: Carrick, Fletcher and to some extent Fellaini. I don’t rate Cleverley in that regard, he is very easy to go past and has poor positioning.

We really don’t know what will happen to Fletcher, although I love this guy he didn’t look reliable last season, understandably so.

Carrick’s legs are gone IMO, he won’t be able to handle the midfield by himself anymore. All in all, bringing a player capable of both defending and attacking makes much more sense than bringing another attacking midfielder, even though both Fabregas and Kroos are a few levels above Herrera in that regard. Mind that we might still be in for Toni.

I don’t think goals will be a problem with players like RVP, Mata, Rooney, Kagawa, Januzaj. Right now I would say we need another box-to-box midfielder to replace Carrick, I think Strootman fits the bill (I’m not talking about muppet signings like Vidal).

Players who control the tempo of the game are hard to find these days, and usually they are top tier players, what means we won’t get one this summer.

892~~~
At risk of derailing the thread, I can't help but agree.

I think it's become apparent now that Woody can close deals if the manager sanctions them as we've seen in the last 48 hours. The fact that Moyes couldn't make his mind up whether or not to sign players like Herrera shows he was unwilling to take risks which is all what United are about.

893~~~
That is such a delicious quote. Sounds like a proper football man, a rare thing these days.

894~~~
Fully agree with that sentiment.

895~~~

896~~~
The kid knows his tennis legends. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

897~~~
He's 6ft.

898~~~
His English is excellent.

899~~~
He's not happy with Old Trafford's nickname then? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

900~~~
But he has a reflection on the car under the dodge badge, you have the top of his head, and the reflection of the tree on the roof of the car tells you that Herrera's shadow his outside the scope and toward the viewer, since we can see his feet we can't see his potential shadow.

901~~~
Was it the one here at 2:55?
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C08pZjZOmLw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

902~~~
Berbatov was a wonderful player when you think about it. Definitely not as much as a flop as he's sometimes made out to be.

903~~~
One of the best first touches I've seen. Immaculate control.

904~~~
With the Real example I was thinking specifically of the first leg against Bayern, that certainly looked like 4-4-2 to me. Pretty sure Ancelotti used that formation with PSG too.

I don't buy this idea that 4-4-2 is dead. Like all formations it'll go in and out of fashion but in the right circumstances and with the right players it can still be as effective as any other formation.

905~~~
It was a 4-4-2 in defence and 4-3-3 in attack.

906~~~
Almost mad to brand someone a 'flop' who scored a hat-trick against the red scousers.

907~~~
But still was it a classic 442? Their midfield is much more energetic than the usual midfield and mostly Koke played on the wing - but he is not a winger as we all know - so although he played on the "wing" he contributed a lot offensively and even more defensively in order to help out the midfield. With these player and that system Atletico could afford to play with 2 strikers, even in big games.

908~~~
Same, it's such a strange feeling. Can't wait to see him play for us.

909~~~
Nah he had a great touch and was great for that half season but was a flop. He broke up the Rooney-tevez partnership which had way more potential and was much better IMO and for being our record signing just was never good enough. It's not like he was ibra who is a brilliant player but before just couldn't be arsed, berbs just never put in effort and said it was his style to be lazy and walk around.

910~~~
So weird this obsession with things not really being 442. Think back to 2008 we had Hargreaves right wing so it wasn't 442. Back to 1999 we had Beckham right wing who worked hard defensively and sometimes came central so it wasn't a 442. 

It doesn't matter if some of them are slightly more or less attacking than others, ifsome of them like to drift wide or come more central. This has always been the case. If you play 4 defenders, 4 midfielders and 2 forwards it's 44sodding2.

911~~~
Actually thinking back to the 1968 United team I think muppet heads would have exploded trying to define the roles of the likes of George Best and Bobby Charlton.

912~~~
Classic 4-4-2 or not, it doesn't make much of a difference. People on here have become a bit obsessed with the actual formation rather then the players that are deployed there. Our 4-4-2 seems shit because we had shit wingers and a midfield 2 who would prefer not to move anywhere for the full 90 minutes, and we're incredibly slow when they did move. Hard to make it look good when the 4 in the middle are all pretty shit. Play good wingers and energetic/quality midfielders like we had a decade ago, and suddenly 4-4-2 would look great again.

913~~~
It's baffling that SAF let our midfield get this bad. I know that he had faith in Anderson and waited for Hargreaves to somehow magically make a return, but he was so ruthless when it came to other positions. Yet he let our midfield rot away.

914~~~
Agree! I wasn't saying I am against 442, but with our midfielders it has killed us at times! If we had Koke and Vidal in midfield, then we could play 442 or whatever you want to call it even against Barcelona, but unless you have those allround midfielders / personel who are rare to find, you can't really play 442 against top teams.

915~~~
He just looks like one.

916~~~
If you have the right players it might work, but for me a proper 4-4-2 has two out and out forwards. I don't see any top sides playing that.

Even at United with Rooney and RVP it always looks like a 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-1-1.

A proper 4-4-2 was when we had Yorke and Cole - both player as forwards rather than either dropping deep. 

Real usually only have Benzema as a proper striker, the others are wingers cutting inside or midfielders for me.

917~~~
Yeah i was amazed when i read he was 6tf <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

918~~~
Is this the first established CM we have bought since Carrick 8 years ago???

919~~~
I still can't believe his almost 25 Shaw is 18 and looks older haha

920~~~
Hargreaves in 2007.

921~~~
Forgot about him, but his United career never got off the ground

922~~~
Atletico absolutely play a 4-4-2. They just make it work because their transition link play is so fecking good. Accurate, quick, often even one touch passes to players making good runs.

923~~~
So it isn't a photoshop?

924~~~
#PlayFor

925~~~
True.

926~~~
we've just signed joseph gordon levitt and ryan gosling over the last 48 hours.

927~~~
damn, give other nickname to Old Trafford

928~~~
Yay. Finally nostalgia makes people less harsh on him. And people WERE harsh on him. Brilliant player.

929~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_OhObYeGEs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

930~~~
Still the player responsible for my favourite piece of skill from a United player during my lifetime - that seemingly impossible flicked reverse roulette against West Ham.

931~~~
It was bothering me so much what the guys name was who Shaw looked like, that's it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Looks almost exactly like him.

932~~~
Wow. Now I'm really excited.

933~~~
Shaw is more like a mix of Jake Gyllanhall and R.Gosling and Herrera a mix of Joseph Gordon Levitt and Niko Kovac.

934~~~
yeah, actually i think he looks more like jake gyllanhall than ryan gosling now.

935~~~
Nope. Shaw has one too despite not being able to drive:

936~~~
Speaks English better than I thought he would for a Spanish lad, far better than De Gea when he first arrived.

937~~~
Shaw always looks so dopey.

938~~~
Well that's a nice way to talk about our new player.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

939~~~
How old you gotta be to drive in England if Shaw can't drive?

940~~~
17, must be a personal choice.

941~~~
Can De Gea speak English? Other than his very short speech when he won united player of the season I haven't heard him speak in English.

942~~~
Don't blame him. You can get a permit at 15 here, license at 16 but I didn't start driving until I was 18.

943~~~
Liverpool should be very very worried next season. That they failed to win the league, Suarez situation is a mess, and with that leaky defence, and united becoming ruthless in the transfer market again by signing the right players, expect their one hit wonder season much like the 2008/09 season, to give them a reality check

944~~~
As long as Scholes was fit, i think he was just happy to shoehorn other players into midfield with a bit of versatility. Still no excuse not to invest in that position though. Thankfully it looks as though we're adressing those isssue. It's about bloody time!

945~~~
That dribble at 1.05 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Was that against Real?

946~~~
Yes

947~~~
Oh he's won me over now <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

some interesting stuff which won't please everyone over here...

949~~~
Typical Hunter. Not content with pretending to be some kind of all-knowing expert on Spanish football, he always has to put himself in the middle of the stories. I can't stand these guys trying to be 'celebrity journos'.

His actual opinions are probably sound, but it's just the way he writes every article as if it's about him. In my book, a good journalist should be invisible.

950~~~
The key to where he seems happy to play (But he thrived in the matches when he was given a controlling "pivote" role in the middle two in front of the back four)

951~~~
Comes off as an absolute git. Apparently we should thank him for passing on to Moyes that classified info about Herrera's release clause going up. All that being said, I'm pretty excited about this signing. I haven't seen anything of the player (I wasn't able to watch our Europe League tie against Bilbao a few years back,) but it sounds like he's exactly what we've been missing.

952~~~
Nothing wrong with that article. Some of you have incredibly thin skin.

953~~~
What's it got to do with thin skin? He's not <i>offending</i> anyone. He's just a terrible journalist, more into advancing his own celebrity than actually writing good articles.

954~~~
He actually is dopey apparently, I was reading it somewhere

955~~~
Do you not watch United?

If only Berbatov had passion he could have been a United legend.

Herrera and mata in midfield, and that is not even a FM muppet wish, its real LOL

965~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I cant wait to see Mata, Herrera and Big Dave all together. Spanish Love Trio.

966~~~
Can't help but love how he has his photo with Sir Bobby as his profile picture.

967~~~
So is the poor lad going to be the target of all the teams practical jokes.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

970~~~
Really seems a lovable lad. Can't wait to see him.

971~~~
Hopefully we sell Young and give the hallowed #18 to Herrera, a much more worthy heir to the shirt.

972~~~
Hallowed?

973~~~
To be honest, I'm pretty sure we're the victim of age fraud with this Shaw deal. He's definitely in his 30s.

974~~~
I'm 22 and Shaw looks older than me for feck sake. That cnut has probably never experienced playing Pokemon Yellow on a Gameboy Colour.

975~~~
Or 8.

976~~~
Mata is number eight. A lot of people seem to forget this.

977~~~
Dang, how did i forget that?!

1:46 is hilarious.

979~~~
So glad that we have signed him, i really felt bad for him last summer it was mentioned that he was even willing to take a pay cut to join us, seemed like a really great guy and someone who desperately wanted to join us. I have followed him since and he had difficulties at the start of the season but gradually became an integral part of Bilbao side that finished in champions league places , the fans will love him he loves a slide tackle, great offensively and defensively, technically very sound loves to play outside of the foot passes which are sexy when they come off, and he tries very difficult through balls from plenty of weird angles and he loves to circulate possession ala kagawa he will enjoy playing with him, i heard people comparing him to cleverley he's nothing like him great buy.

980~~~
His earliest World Cup memory is Lampard's disallowed goal versus Germany. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

981~~~
Oh feck.

982~~~
I'm only a few days older than Luke and mine is probably Cole's goal against Sweden. What's wrong with that boy.

983~~~
What is it with the Shaw mocking in the Herrera thread?

984~~~
Shaw must remember world cup 06, he's only two years younger than me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

985~~~

986~~~
Good read

987~~~

988~~~
A good little insight there. Seems to be a bright kid.

Scared of sharks though? Better rest him when we play Liverpool if Suarez is still around.

989~~~
Three back to back statements. All unsequenced and random. Shit journalism

990~~~
I like him, and excited to see him play for us. Lets hope LVG can get the best from him. Hopefully we sign someone to go alongside him and he can form a partnership.

991~~~
Didn't someone say up thread that he's a bit dim? Doesn't come across that way.

992~~~
Shaw's the dim one, Herrera's the smart one.

993~~~
Glad I'm not the only one who thought it was a poorly written article. It ends so abruptly as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

994~~~
Ahh, must have misread it then, that's more believable. I assumed it was Herrera being talked about seeing as it's his thread.

995~~~
Great interview, if a player thrives under Bielsa he will thrive under LVG. Both have are very similar styles as managers and the intellectual players who enjoy putting their time in after practice with the ball is done will be the ones succeeding.

996~~~
Feck, even the fact that World Cup 2006 could be his earliest World Cup memory makes me feel incredibly old. I remember 1998.

997~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

998~~~
Really can't wait to see him playing for us now <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Totally different mould to any other midfielder we have, or had for a while.

999~~~

1000~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1002~~~

1004~~~
Those legs <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I would give him a rub down every day of the week and twice on Sundays.

1005~~~
Can't wait to see him play for us.

1006~~~
Gah! Look at his wee feet.

A competent midfielder. I still can't get over it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1007~~~
Seems a smart guy. The way he talks about Bielsa is great, he should take brilliantly to Van Gaal. I love him already.

1008~~~
Are the lads back in training then? Ander is wearing United shorts in that pic...

1009~~~
I would imagine some players who were not involved in the World Cup may have returned for fitness assessments.

1010~~~
Ander on Marcelo Bielsa and how he helped him become  the player he is now.

1011~~~
They basically just ripped off Andy Mitten's MEN piece but without attributing it to him, cheeky. Usually newspapers at least go through the effort of saying 'in an interview given to X'. Doubt Mitten cares but its still a bit impolite of the Mirror.



More praise for Ander from Graham Hunter.



More condemnation from Athletic.

1012~~~
"Their maximum aspiration has to be to play here" 
So basically Bilbao want their players to have no ambition at all and settle for a mid table team, occasionally pushing for champions league and not having big wages <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1013~~~
Great interview. Oh and Bielsa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anyway, as someone already said, his tactical knowledge and attention to detail will be immense because of Bielsa, he will thrive under LvG!

1014~~~
Athletic Bilbao are a very very strange club.

1015~~~
I really like Athletic generally but yet I have this strange desire for us to go in and sign Iturraspe this summer. Partly because he's the type of player we're looking for and partly because the meltdown would be funny.

1016~~~
Ever heard of slavery, Mr President of Athletic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1017~~~
Did he throw a similar strop when Martinez left?

1018~~~
Martinez had to sneak into Bilbao's training ground at night to get his stuff. Bilbao really don't like it when their players leave.

1019~~~
What the feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1020~~~
The basques have actually chilled out a fair bit in recent years - I remember death threats for Lizerazu not long back!

1021~~~
Bilbao President complaining again. Really upset or just to keep the home fans on-side?

1022~~~
Politics.

1023~~~
That is hilarious if true.

1024~~~
Their way of painting Herrera as the villain. Guillem and Graham Hunter have both said it's Bilbao's way of saying " we wanted to keep him, but he was forced away". That kind of politics.

1025~~~
In case people have forgotten: We have signed an actual, proper central midfielder. Felt it just needed reminding to let in sink in some more <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1035~~~

1036~~~
Our Spanish contingent are just adorable.

1037~~~
Was Herrera named in Spains 30 man provisional squad for the World Cup?

1038~~~
Don't think so iirc. Might be wrong.

1039~~~
No, but they're well stocked for midfield players, even though none of their midfielders performed.

1040~~~
This is pretty disrespectful in my opinion. There are no players with "no ambition at all", just with different kinds of ambition. You talk about ambition like the definition of it would be to hike the easiest road to trophies, fame and money.

1041~~~
I'm not saying someone has no ambition if they settle for that, but I'm sure all players would dream of playing for a top club and winning trophies one day. The Bilbao president or whoever it was said that playing for Bilbao should be the absolute maximum for their ambitions. That's not exactly very ambitious for a player if they don't ever dream or hope of improving to one day play for a top team? Not everyone can make it but those like Herrera, and others who have left the club did so to further their careers instead of sticking with them forever.

1042~~~
His attitude seems fantastic, endearing himself to fans early.

1043~~~
A bit simplistic piece but a good one nonetheless. Combined with a manager like LVG, Herrera should see some proper development and become a serious contender for the next generation of Spain's NT.

1044~~~
What midfielder past or present would be similar to Herrera? I haven't seen much of him live.

1045~~~
I've heard people say he's like a "Lite-Schweinsteiger"

1046~~~
Sounds good.

1047~~~
Think Xavi... But better

OR a Carrick type with more energy and gets forward

1048~~~
I want his kids!

1049~~~
Can't wait to see pics of him training tomorrow <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1050~~~
I think I was overly negative when we signed him because of the huge fee and also because of my failing memory, thinking he'd played more behind the striker than he actually has. But being positive, I'm hopeful that he will make a big difference to our midfield. Someone who can pass and has ability going forward, but also likes a tackle alleviating the need to play someone like Fellaini who only tackles.

1051~~~
To be fair his passing isn't anywhere near their level. Plays a bit like wilshere imo

1052~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What?

1053~~~
Does training start tomorrow?

1054~~~
You need to slow down a bit here, pal...

1055~~~
Think Ramsey without the great shot is a better comparison. Good on the ball, likes to run with it, hard worker, smart, pretty good defensively too. Just an all around midfielder, just with a brilliant first touch like most Spaniards.

1056~~~
Yes.

1057~~~
Never hes awesome!

Guys seriously we just signed a player who most have never seen play, lets big him up as much as we can and enjoy it before we see what he can do

1058~~~
I donno i think his passing is under-rated. Some of his through balls, crossing and cross field passes are pretty impressive - granted he doesnt tend to play those long balls often (probably given he played pretty far forward last season) but i've seen him launch good counters with some of his passing

1059~~~
I think that you are the closest, a very mobile Ramsey.

1060~~~
So he's just like Ramsey if Ramsey liked to dribble and couldn't shoot. ie not much like Ramsey.

1061~~~
Yeah but better then whoever said Carrick, in that the only thing he has in common with him is being pretty tall and a midfielder. Ramsey runs with the ball a decent amount though so it's not that far away.

1062~~~
It is a fact that Xavi has based his game on how Herrera would have done things. Xavi also spent the majority of his free time watching Herrera's video when he was playing as a kid.

1063~~~
Herrera isn't a dribbler, is comfortable in tight spaces but prefers to pass.

1064~~~
I've heard Modric.

1065~~~
Have a look at Herreras defense stats as in interceptions and tackles. It may shock you 

Whenever I see him play it was the thing that jumped out most about him

1066~~~
fair point

Nope he loves to drive forward with the ball. He's more of a runner than a passer. He will give us much needed pace and energy in midfield. His passing is probably whats holding him back from being potentially world class imo. Still an excellent player mind

1067~~~
For me he is between Thiago and Ramsey, in term of mentality.

1068~~~
His passing is not bad, its just because Athletic always play a bit counter like so they dont pass the ball sideways etc, they play high up the opponents pitch; that is why his passes are intercepted more often than a Cleverley for example.

1069~~~
Either way he looks great from his YouTube compilation. Not in the usual "skillz" way but in that he looks the sort of player our midfield has been crying out for. Runs with the ball, tackles, passes - the whole package. Could maybe do with improving his shooting.

1070~~~
I think this video gives a good idea of what sort of player we are getting. All involvements in a match against a certain Manchester based club...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ljy3U5OKvk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1071~~~
Yeah agree with this. I think Koke is more like Ramsey.

1072~~~
Oh I know he is very good defensively, I've actually seen him a decent amount of times over the years (in the big games though). The way he goes about his play is completely different to Carrick, Carrick defensively is all about positioning and cutting off passing lanes, and on the ball he's just a passer. Herrera defensively is a good tackler, but isn't like Carrick with his positioning, he's more of a hard worker defensively. On the ball they couldn't be more different either.

1073~~~
Are you the serious FF version of <a class="username" data-user="56298, @SteveJ" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56298/">@SteveJ</a> ? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1074~~~
Don't care about comparison, he is a midfielder - that'll do.

1075~~~
He's a more technically gifted Darren Fletcher than Carrick. He's a lot closer to Cleverley in fact, just much better at everything.

I actually think him and Carrick would make a great partnership. Carrick being a pivot on the ball and an anchor to cover off the ball, and Herrera to charge down the opposition and carry the ball about.

1076~~~
He's the welsh version of Steve. That's what the W stands for.

1077~~~
So SteveJ is Jamaican? I should've knew it! no wonder his English writing is one of the worst around.
<span style="color: #ffffff">j/k, Sir Steve. Just in case you might not get my joke in English, either . Haha..</span>

1078~~~
The irony...

Edit: Damn you white text!!! *shakes fist*

1079~~~
known..knew.. is the mystery of life.

1080~~~
I'd say he's like Fabregas positionally. Less passing range/ability but instead has more interest in tackling

1081~~~
He's a lot like Iniesta, actually. Just with more bite in his tackle but less capable of beating a man.

1082~~~
All this talk of who he plays like and who we can compare him too, just let him be Herrera and be his own player.

1083~~~
We'll be calling him Ander next season not Herrera right?

1084~~~
It's in response to a poster who never saw him and asked what type of player he's like to get an idea.

1085~~~
But it's such a common occurrence on here. So many compare players to past players or rival players and when they don't meet the high expectations, they are labelled not as good or a failure.

I understand it's in response but it will creep in.

1086~~~
Takes offence.

so far i've seen herrera compared to xavi,iniesta,wilshire, thiago, ramsey and a lite-schweinsteiger in this thread. seems we wont find an apt comparison for him then

1088~~~
It's obvious from the posters so far that we're not comparing Herrera to the quality of said players, rather the style of football that they play. That's a fairly harmless discussion right. These aren't "Anderson is the next Ronaldinho" types of comparisons.

1089~~~
Herrera is a player of similar style to Iniesta

His touch and technique is sublime, his passing long and short is brilliant and will only get better under the tutelage of LVG. The only thing Ramsey is superior to Herrera in is having a bigger goal threat. In my opinion Herrera is a better player than Xabi Alonso but the Spanish coach for some reason always picked Alonso. maybe playing for Real Madrid had something to do with it... Marcelo Bielsa said Herrera has the ability to be the best no.8 in the game and that is a big compliment coming from a coach of the stature of Bielsa.

1090~~~
Agreed. Spain won all they did and Madrid winning the league, two cups and the cl as well as getting to the cl semis three years in a row was despite xabi Alonso. The fact that Alonso has 113 caps and Herrera at 24 (going 25 next month)  has none is a disgrace. Its everybodies fault but his own that xabi Alonso gets picked ahead of him. Javi Martinez and Llorente somehow managed to get caps for spain while playing for bilbao for some reason, maybe playing for athletic bilbao had something to do with it. That, like picking Alonso turned out to be a mistake.

1091~~~
Hope that's not the only thing that's fails as you age... <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1092~~~
If it isn't 'Ander-son son son' I'm all up for it.

1093~~~
The Iniesta comparisons are not that bad actually. Similar style of play. Plays like a more defensively sound less polished version of Iniesta. Just to be clear though the comparison is purely stylistic. He's not in Iniesta's class.

1094~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> calm down now Raul <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Maybe he just meant the current Alonso, like Xavi who's both been in a bit of a decline IMO.

I think a lot of people thought del Bosque could have blooded youngsters for this WC, but it's how every cycle goes - must come to an end I guess.

On topic though, yeah, he could have worded it much better. Was a bit disrespectful to Alonso. What a player in his prime <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1095~~~
This. Also Llorente and Javi Martinez were poor examples to use of players from Athletic Bilbao who got caps for Spain. Llorente is a striker and Spain in the last couple of years haven't had the best quality in that position (hence the decision to play with a false number 9 at Euro 2012). As for Javi Martinez he is only in the squad due to his versatility in playing both DM and CB.

I think it was pretty clear he was referring to the current Alonso and not the one from 2-3 years ago which was one of the best midfielders in the game. Based on their form over the past season there was certainly an argument to be made to not bring Xavi at all and also for Alonso to lose his place in the starting XI. Herrera had a better season than both but the Spain squad for this World Cup was picked on reputation and not form (see inclusion of Casillas, Torres, etc).

1096~~~
That's definitely true, but I guess it's part of every "cycle". Managers will keep faith with their trusted players (even SAF was a tad guilty of it) who's won them everything, until it's time to move on. And WC 2014 was the end of that glorious cycle for most of those senior Spanish players.

1097~~~
Calm down, it's clear he doesn't mean Xabi Alonso in his prime. And as others have said, Llorente is a bad example as Spain has a striker problem, but too many good players in midfield. Martinez is also not the best example as he has been with the senior squad since 2010 but still only got 18 caps, and even then some are not in midfield (yes, because even he can't really get in Spain's midfield).

1098~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2682232/Ander-Herrera-Manchester-gets-used-new-life-England.html" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ra-Manchester-gets-used-new-life-England.html</a>

1099~~~
I'd say Wilshere is the best comparison. 

He's less controlling of a game's tempo than Xavi, far more direct, less inclined simply to stroke the ball around until spaces open. Iniesta is a different type of player, far less physical, silkier and has a level of passing that's above Herrera's at the moment. Thiago is also less direct and probably has more tricks and flicks to his game, Thiago's runs are less based on driving forward than Herrera's. Ramsey I think you might be able to make the case for. Although Ramsey is more effective as an advanced attacking midfielder than Herrera is IMO, Herrera is a number 8 (a point he made himself to Andy Mitten) whereas I see Ramsey as a goalscoring 10. Schweinsteiger is more robust than Herrera, Herrera has better technique in terms of close control and passing though, although Schweinsteiger can stamp his way through other midfielders in a way Herrera can't even if he likes a tackle. 

Herrera is a classic number 8. Box-to-box midfielder. Good at tackling. Good close control. Good passing. Likes to take the ball forward at feet. Can pick out a pass. He's the type of midfielder that anyone who watched football before the last century ended would recognise instantly because there were a ton of them e.g. Paul Gascoigne, Zvonimir Boban, Clarence Seedorf even our own Paul Scholes (back when he was a partner to Keano, rather than a deep lying pass sprayer). Not saying Herrera is going to be as good as any of those names just that he plays in that style.

1100~~~
Good post

1101~~~
Wouldn't Iniesta be more of a dribbler than Herrera or am I wrong in suggesting this?

1102~~~
I didnt mean for the post to be interpreted as an aggressive one, I meant it to be in a sarcastic, "tongue-in-cheek" tone. I should have put an <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> at the end. When I look back at it he probably didn't mean Alonso in his prime but I got the impression that he did from the "always picked Alonso" so I assumed he meant euro 2012 as well as maybe 2010 too. I never really agree with people saying young players are going to be better than an older player ever was as it is just speculation and bias most of the time, but as both of you said he probably didn't mean that and it was a mistake on my part to interpret his post that way.

1103~~~
Completely on the money. The fact is no player seems to have Ander's offensive attributes while also putting in a good amount of tackles. You've got players like Vidal and Ramsey, but they have different attacking skillsets to Ander and are goalthreats that he is not, whilst making a few more tackles too.

Still, joint 15th most tackles in la liga last season... Would have been 17th in the premier league. Oscar is 78th. You have to imagine Mourinho would have liked him

1104~~~
True that, if Herrera's rather broad skill-set develops here, he could end up being one of the best complete midfielders in the league if he isn't already but that remains to be seen.

1105~~~
Fernandinho got that title locked down comfortably. He is like Herrera when he reaches his peak, but Fernandinho is 29 so Herrera will probably be the next in line for that title if he continues to develop. Fernandinho has the same tackling stats as Herrera but with two times more interceptions and even from a defensive CM role Fernandinho scored the same amount of goals as Herrera(5) and got 3 assists, in comparison to Herrera's 5. 

Fernandinho also has a much better passing accuracy, same amounts of dribbles per game and just a slightly lower amount of key passes even if Herrera is an AM and Fernandinho a defensive box to box midfielder. Herrera loses the ball two times more than Fernandinho, actually Herrera loses the ball more often than Kagawa who is very heavily criticized for it. He actually has figures nearly identical to Nani, who many consider to be United's worst player in terms of losing the ball or passing it away to nowhere.

Herrera has a similar passing percentage as Nani as well. 

I don't think Herrera is anywhere near Fernandinho as the most complete central midfielder as of now, but that is normal as Fernandinho is in his peak and Herrera has 1-2 years left until he even enters his.

1106~~~
Herrera dribbles a lot for a cm. Always running with the ball. Wilshire was my original comparison and still the best one IMO.

1107~~~
Herrera is unusual in this regard. Great close control and touch but doesn't strike the ball that well leading to some wayward passing and shooting. Still think he's exactly the type of energetic well rounded midfielder we've been crying out for. Just not the finished article yet

1108~~~
There is a reason why Herrera loses the ball a lot though: he tries stuff. Herrera is seen as a more English style midfielder by Spaniards because he is willing to take risks with the ball. Herrera won't just keep recycling possession, he'll actively look for direct passes or try and take people on and that means he loses the ball more than many. Don't forget Herrera attempted more through balls than anyone else in La Liga except Fabregas last season (<a class="externalLink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2114164-why-ander-herrera-is-a-perfect-signing-for-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>). Herrera, as I've repeatedly said, is not a metronomic passer who keeps things ticking over and allows your side to control the ball. He will try and force the issue. The good thing is though Herrera's not just another midfielder who will stand there passing it sideways.

1109~~~
No worries Raul, we all know Alonso was a fecking beast in his prime. Anyone who disputes that is crazy!

I've been an admirer of Herrera for long now and I do think that he'd have been picked for most nations at this World Cup, barring Spain and possibly Germany. Just because he's not had a look in for Spain, doesn't mean he's not any good. I rate him and his got the potential to become even better. I'm sure you'd agree with that. Let's hope he wins that first cap in the near future <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1110~~~
I agree completely. He is probably underrated because he is Spanish as there is so many great Spanish midfielders at the moment and it is hard to stand out among them. If he was another nationality he would probably be at the world cup and be able to show everyone how good he is and then he would be rated higher. Playing for united will increase his chances of getting into the Spanish squad imo.

1111~~~
I actually think that was a big motivation behind his desire to come to OT. He could have worked for Barca or Madrid, but with the gaping hole in our midfield, he's a sure starter here, something neither of the Spanish giants could guarantee.

Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but he's quite a physical lad for a Spaniard - likes getting stuck in as much as he likes moving with the ball. So I think he'll do well in the English league. Or let's hope so.

1112~~~
I was referring to Ander being a better fit presently for Spain compared to Xabi Alonso.  Could he be a better player than Alonso was in his prime? I don't see why not, he is more mobile than Alonso ever was.  Ander has capabilities to beat players with a dribble, he also possesses a brilliant passing range, long and short. The only thing I would say he needs to add to his game is more goals and under LVG I see that happening. Reading some of the comments in this thread I don't think alot of posters understand what a brilliant player we have signed.

He has the stage now to showcase his ability and under a fantastic manager like Van Gaal he will be a big player for us I have no doubt.

1113~~~
Based on some of the games that I have seen last season, youtube videos and some articles written on him, I get a feeling that he is an all-action midfielder. He will give us drive, goal threat and directness. Two things that I feel he will not be able to help us with are:
1. Positioning. He will be making a good number of runs up and down the pitch. So he can't be given the role of a player who stays deep.
2. Controlling possession of the ball.
I guess we will need to buy a defensive midfielder to play alongside him.
Carrick and Anders will also work

1114~~~
He's a midfielder that is very comfortable in any midfield role. He can play very disciplined and has the ability to control the tempo of a game. It really depends on how LVG will deploy him to be honest.

1115~~~

1116~~~
33 photos. Give the guy some space.

1117~~~
I wasn't trying to downplay his abilities, I named him the second in line for the title as the most complete midfielder in the Premier League. It was a response to someone saying that Herrera is already possibly the most complete midfielder in the Premier League which I disagree with as Fernandinho mixes the best abilities of Herrera without missing every fifth pass like Herrera and with less loss of possession due to being tackled off the ball or losing control of it. 

Fernandinho is one of the worlds best box to box midfielders in my eyes, only better by Vidal and Schweinsteiger/Martinez, though so there is no slight towards Herrera to name him worse than Fernandinho. Should be remembered that Fernandinho also played as an AM in Ukraine and can play DM or CM as well, he is just very complete as a player and in his peak. 

I think Herrera has a really high potential which he hasn't yet reached which may very well have him up there as the best box-to-box in the world. He combines that energetic and combative drive with brilliant abilities on the ball. In a team which dominates more than Bilbao he can easily take a step or two and I believe LVG will do what he always does which is create possession keeping and offensive teams.

1118~~~
It's probably naive, but i can't help but think that the club cameback for him decisively because of the way the story ended last summer.
From what Mitten said it seems that the club wanted to make the things right regarding Herrera.

1119~~~
Imagine Herrera and Vidal, it'd be Scholes and Keane Mk. II. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1120~~~
Also, with all the Vidal hype I've quite neglected my excitement for Herrera to get going. He will prove to be a quality signing.

1121~~~
I know, we'll have a midfielder who likes to actually run about and pass the ball forward. It's revolutionary.

1122~~~
Well he's stood right outside Australasia, so that wouldn't be a bad place to start...

1123~~~
Just imagine how good Herrera and Vidal would be together? Both have the perfect blend of defensive and attacking attributes. I think we would have the most balanced midfield in the league.

1124~~~
We'd need another behind them (Carrick/Strootman/someone/anyone) because otherwise it'll be like Lampard and Gerrard. Not balanced at all.

1125~~~
I trust van Gaal to find a solution. Carrick is still a quality midfielder. He will thrive with better players around him.

1126~~~
It'll be Carrick until January, then Strootman.

1127~~~
Really am looking forward to seeing this guy with us <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b> New boy Herrera gets Butt's seal of approval </b></span>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-new-boy-ander-7430770" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...-news/manchester-united-new-boy-ander-7430770</a>


Good comments but that Line about Kroos and Pogba is strange and now being twisted all over the place with headlines Butt  - Herrera is not as good as Pogba, Kroos.

1130~~~
Yea, it's pretty harmless in the context when you read everything what Nicky said but journos like Jamie Cuntson are already nitpicking.

1131~~~
Welcome Herrera, but shame we couldn't have a Pogba or Kroos. Nice one Nicky.

1132~~~
Good to see Nicky helping out with stuff like this.

1133~~~
Even if Butt had said it like that, he'd be right.

1134~~~
Very naive of Butt to compare Herrera like that openly to the media. Stupid move.

1135~~~
Meh... storm in a teacup.

You could easily make an alternative interpretation that Butt thinks that Herrera is every bit as good as Kroos and Pogba, but simply has a lower profile.

1136~~~
This.

1137~~~
This is Nicky's opinion of Ander Herrera in full.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsvUOeKCIAAQmSQ.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsvUOeKCIAAQmSQ.png"/>

It's easy to take one quote out of context and make it look like he is criticising Ander.

1138~~~
Lad's going to develop into a world class CM for us. I'm sure of it.

1139~~~
These things can also motivate a player. It depends what kind of mentality the lad has, but from what I've been reading, he's an intelligent enough to not let stuff like this get to him.

1140~~~
Why is it critisism to suggest Ander Hererra isn't as good as Kroos or Pogba? Kroos was one of the standout players to help Germany win the world cup and Pogba was arguably Juventus' best player last season at just 21

Almost everyone (that isn't a United fan) would agree that Kroos and Pogba are clearly in a different bracket to Ander Hererra. And if we hadn't signed him, our fans would agree as well.

That doesn't mean Ander isn't a really good midfielder himself who will clearly improve us a lot in that area. Just because you aren't one of the world's best - yet, doesn't in any way suggest that you are bad.

Ander will know himself that he hasn't shown the same ability and proven himself like the other 2 yet

1141~~~
Regardless of how Herrera takes it, Butt is in no position for him to make such comments hes not the manager possibly trying to motivate a player hes not even sure of being a part of the club under van Gaal.

1142~~~
A bit sad that employees of this club openly admit that we are not able to pull off big signings, considering the money we can spend

1143~~~
Storm in a teacup.

1144~~~
He said its not easy to get those kind of players. He didnt say we are not able to pull off big signings.

1145~~~
I don't read it as comparison of their skills, and if those two are "better" than Herrera. More about demand for Kroos and Pogba, and spotlight on them. Especially after World Cup. We "widened the net" and got a Herrera. It's more "our scouts can beat your scouts".

1146~~~
He said they are not easy to get - which is completely true. Just look at the Vidal deal!. Stop whinging he has said nothing wrong. 

Typical Journo's twisting words to create headlines.

1147~~~
Very few clubs who aren't in the champions league have managed to sign the top players

1148~~~
Hard to get so we have to look elsewhere. That is exactly what he said. It may be true for United but it is still a bit sad considering that we have to strengthen our squad badly if we want to compete again.

1149~~~
It was probably hard for Real Madrid to get Kroos as well.

1150~~~
Certainly. Still went for him. Butt made it sound like those who are hard to get are not targets for us. We have to look for others. Not a big deal but nor very reassuring neither

1151~~~
He's a player I cant wait to see in action

1152~~~
Man City did it by selling their 'project' and throwing their cash around. We evidently have the money to spend, have a top class manager and are the giant of English football. I'm not sure why it's deemed out of our reach at all.

1153~~~
It is Butt he probably knows as little as we do about our transfer dealings.

We obviously are targeting the best players whether we get them is a different question

1154~~~
I'm sure Herrera's rocking back and forth, full clothed, in the shower. I'm sure he thought he was the best midfielder in the world.

1155~~~
Unlike City we can and will be outbid often. They had the most money at the time

1156~~~
Toure, Silva and Aguero hardly cost a frightening amount of money though. I'd say they got good deals on them considering the money everybody knew they had at their disposal.

1157~~~
feck sake Nicky.

1158~~~
Why would this bother Herrera? It's hardly a confidence killer to hear you're not as good as players who are obviously better than him. Everyone knows he's not as good as those players, it's a fact.

1159~~~
Why would he say it though? What is the point of publicly telling a player that you'll possibly be working with he's not as good as the targets that United should be aiming for?

1160~~~
Dante's post is spot on.

Everything gets misinterpreted on the net.

1161~~~
They we're steals especially Silva.

1162~~~
Eh yes. City were building from a lower base too.

We just underachieved last season i.e one season in 20 odd now ?.

It's not like we are a mid table club trying to reach the top either or have a bad squad or something.

1163~~~
Well the point was more that if someone else came in for those players, City would raise their bid. 
They didn't have to on those occasions, but they could have and in all likelyhood would have. It was only about last season that they decided there was a limit to how much they'll pay for a player, when talks about Fernando and Mangala ended in Jan. They still came back to Porto and are paying it even though they know its too much.

Unfortunately we're not in the situation City are in. We might have some money (although less now we've spent a fair bit already) but there are still lots of clubs who can outbid us and some of them can offer champions league football that we can't.

It would have been hard to get Kroos and Pogba when we're the champions let alone when we're nowhere near and not in the top competition that most players care about.

1164~~~
The man in action in training, can't work how to embed:

Meh, Fellaini's chest control is better...

1166~~~
Practicing chest control, clear proof that he's Fellaini's replacement and he's off

1167~~~
Ander looks good in the new kit

1168~~~
"In training every day we are passing the ball" yussss

1169~~~
Herrera saying we train like Bilbao, always with the ball and the manager wants us to keep possession and control games. Big change from Moyes time pretty much.

1170~~~
Man crush developing... Oh, you pesky Spaniards!

1171~~~
Amidst all the talk of Vidal, it's worth remembering that this lad is a top player and I reckon he's going to shine here. I can't wait to see him lining out for us.

1172~~~
Anyone just see some bromance between Ashley Young and Herrera there. Young, you best step the feck off!

1173~~~
Guessing Moyesy took the set pieces booklet with him after Everton away last season.

1174~~~
Did he mention anything about the byline, and the frequency of reaching it?

1175~~~
For sure. I think in time there's a good chance we'll consider him the most important addition to have come in this summer.

He'll surprise a lot of people next season I'm sure.

1176~~~
How come we get all the classy Spaniards here?

The lad comes across excellently in his interviews.

Think he's really going to give it his all here and it'll be responded to in kind by the fans.

1177~~~
I'd quite like to see Fellaini play as a pure DM once someone sits him down and gives him some actual tactical instructions rather than letting him run amok. 

He's looked positionally poor and suspect in the tackle but that's partly because Moyes seemed to insist on some bizarre box-to-box role which he simply doesn't have the stamina for. If you think back to his debut against Valencia, Fellaini got plaudits for a solid display where he sat deep, broke up play and passed it on simply but effectively to the better players. It all went tits up after that, punctuated by a few injuries.

Before he was signed, there was a bit of optimism regarding his ability to play a range of roles - as a 10, a DM and a box-to-box. As above he doesn't seem to have the stamina for the latter, he was never going to play 10 for us so DM seemed the obvious choice, but I'm not convinced he played there more than a couple of times. It's unspectacular and certainly not worth 28m - it was never going to be - but that's the only role I can see him playing. He's an obvious candidate to get the chop but if that's the case we probably need another two midfielders this summer given that Carrick is out. Might be better off giving him a shot as a more restricted DM and focusing on a proper partner for Herrera instead of forcing a massive overhaul.

1178~~~
The guy is going to start with some huge responsibility. A bit worrying really.

1179~~~
Why? He's more than capable of handling it.

1180~~~
It's not that he isn't capable but you would still want him to start his career in the most relaxing context.

1181~~~
There's never a relaxing context at Man Utd really. Ultimately he was always going to be thrown in at the deep end. I'm sure he'll do fine.

1182~~~
Louie already stated that he like Herrera. He'll give him huge boost of confidence just like he gave all less experienced Dutch players on the tournament.

Not worried about Herrera in a slightest bit. I'm actually worried if Fletcher and Carrick will keep up with his pace and effervescent energetic decisions.

1183~~~
This. At this point, he might be starting the season as United's only non-useless midfield player. Loads of expectation for a guy in his first season in a new league. Fingers crossed for him he does well or it'll shine a negative spotlight on him as he'll be the most recognizable face.

1184~~~
I'm not worried about Herrera starting the season as an important player right. He said it himself in the last interview, he's ready and eager to play as soon as possible. He may prefer an all-out approach rather than a relaxed one, and starting him in a key role could be precisely what he wants.

1185~~~
Let's say a less shitty context.

1186~~~
He needs a reliable partner and we have none of them and that's very worrying, it's asking way to much of a new signing to somehow transform our relegation like midfield single handedly.

1187~~~
Haha it's not that bad.

1188~~~
Maybe a little harsh. Mid table level <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1189~~~
An intelligent lad as well as an intelligent footballer, technically great, great work rate and flexibility and you just know he'll be a favourite of LVG's.

1190~~~
He's really got to settle into things ASAP now Carrick is out.

Looking forward to seeing him in action now. No hiding places for this one!

1191~~~
Can't wait to see him in red. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1193~~~
He looks damn good. If we could get another good midfielder alongside him we'd be sorted in midfield.

1194~~~
Slightly concerning that we're now heavily reliant on a lad who has yet to play for us or in the Premier League. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1195~~~
Probably is, I started questioning it the second I saw Charlie Adam bulldozing through us and dominating us as if he was Toure in the Stoke away game

1196~~~
I'm not "worried" about him but I'd like him to get the best possible start in a Untied shirt and that requires us buying another top CM to play alongside him, not expecting him to carry our current CM dreck.

1197~~~
I think he's been a bit under rated by everyone. I honestly think Herrera has all the tools to go on and dominate. Spanish Aaron Ramsey, with better technique but as good shooting.

1198~~~
with carrick out, who do you think will partner him, someone who should be aware of defensive duties. Cleverley would be my first option if I have Herrera and count with carrick out injured but he is awfull defensively and all the running won't do the trick. Fletcher, Fellaini? my godness.. ronney converting to defensive minded box to box midfielder<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> 

wellthis is all bull, we need to sign a midfielder or two, anyway we will see if Luis can make some wonders with the options we have. maybe he could try out something like 5-1-4 formation

1199~~~
To infinity and beyond.

1200~~~
We'll if we sign another CM it is highly unlikely they will have played in the PL either

1201~~~
I think the biggest change will be what we do with the ball. As G Nev put it, United always had 'nice' possession with the ball, but the problem was we used to just knock it about waiting for somebody to grab it and do something. I think it's why Januzaj shined so much because he was able to pick up the ball and beat men when the rest of the team were perfectly happy with playing it around but not actually doing anything.

1202~~~
I'm worried because I haven't seen him and he seems to be rated as quite average. Honestly hadn't heard of him before last year. Hope he really is as good as United think he is.

1203~~~
He'll take to the league like a duck to water. I think some are underrating this lad, he's an extremely talented and well rounded player. His passing and ability in tight spaces are his best attributes. Not so long ago I read someone thinking he could be our keane, well, he's about twice as good as keane was on the ball. Can't wait for him to get started, will IMO finish the league season as one of the best CM's in the league.

1204~~~

1205~~~
Don't worry mate, he'll be great for us. He's flown a bit under the rader because the spanish league is based almost entirely on two teams(well till recently). Quality players of other teams don't get their dues in terms of hype. Look at cazorla who flew under the radar for so long and yet when he went to arsenal was instantly one of their best players.

1206~~~
He'll be your typical United player I think. You won't see him competing for Ballon D'ors but what you will see is an incredibly hard working and talented player giving his all for United. I see him as Fletch v2. An incredibly important member of the X11 who wont ever have the limelight.

My favourite type of player in other words.

1207~~~
He's got a much higher potential ceiling than Fletcher ever had.

1208~~~
He will look so shit when he is playing next to fellaini, not because Fellaini would outclass him but because Fellaini makes it so difficult for his fellow midfield, he doesnt have any positional intelligence, he often walks in the wrong places and doesnt make himself available at the right times, hope we sign Vidal to prevent this.

1209~~~
So you think he can become one of the best midfielders in the world, Fletcher almost reached a world class level, he was not flair and certainly not spectaculair but for a while he was just very amazing. If you say he has a much higher ceiling that means he will become more than only world class, but like the best midfielder there is.

1210~~~
Vidal wouldn't solve that issue though.

His natural game and Herrera's natural game are similar. If we played them both we would need a further player behind them to make it work. Whether that's Carrick, Fellaini or someone else is obviously of no matter if we don't sign Vidal. Either way they won't compliment each other despite being extremely talented, think Lampard and Gerrard.

In any case, can't wait to see Herrera play, less enthusiastic for all the commentators that are gonna call him Herrara.

Just realised a Fellaini and Herrera midfield could be called Ferrari. Only it'll likely be one like this:

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1213~~~
Bang on mate. The only partnership I saw working for definate was Herrera and Carrick, with Carrick occupying the Scholes role and dictating the tempo and play. For some reason, many believe Herrera will be the one who will control all our play and that Vidal will be the perfect partner for him?? Are there any top teams who are successful with a midfield consisting of two box to box players and no holding midfielder? I can't think of any.

1214~~~
I don't see the Gerrard/Lampard comparison at all. Gerrard and Lampard were 2 natural attacking midfielders shoehorned into midfield together. Herrera and Vidal are 2 center midfielders who would be playing in their natural positions. There is no comparison.

1215~~~
The premier league champions. Arsenal are looking to do the same with Ramsey and Khedira.

1216~~~
Exactly. People underestimate how good defensively both of these players (Ander and Vidal) are.

1217~~~
At his peak Gerrard was Box to Box and pretty good defensively. Lampard was more a attacking mid best in a 3. Scholes with either didn't work that well either and he was Box to Box on the attacking side at United with Keane behind as well.

Vidal - Herrera would be like 2 Gerrard type players together though so it could work or Herrera can play from deeper as he did for Bielsa but not sure that would get best out either individually personally plus it would require immediate understanding between the 2 which remains to be seen. Ofcourse anyway, well worth the risk as at worst they will only have problems in the bigger games more and we can put a DM in behind.

1218~~~
But Yaya is not your typical box to box player. More often he will instigate attacks and let the other take over. His trademark runs are far and few between. Even Fernandinho is not a typical box to box player.

Arsenal on the otherhand employ Arteta in the play maker role usually partnered by a Wilshere or Flammini. What they will do next season I do not know.

1219~~~
Another good point. One would see the ball more than the other when going forward basically relegating the other to act as a DM. Would it not be better to employ someone like Carrick and give the other player freedom to get forward whenever he wants to? Like Fernandinho does at City with Yaya.

1220~~~
Why are you allowed to create ambiguities about typical and atypical box-to-box players? A pairing of Yaya and Fernandinho is far more akin to Ander and Vidal than the lazy Lampard and Gerrard comparisons made.

1221~~~
In Yaya - Fernandinho Yaya goes attacking box to box while Fernandinho sits more. Khedira  - Ramsey would be interesting if it happens but even in that Khedira is more a defensive box to box player, while Ramsey is attacking.

1222~~~
They can differentiate roles within the game. You're not restricted to simply play one box to box and one holding midfielder, they're both more than capable of doing both.

1223~~~
What is a 'defensive box-to-box player'? Again with the ambiguities. It's almost as if you people don't want us to sign Vidal to play alongside Herrera.

1224~~~
Before the rise of both Rakitic and Koke, he was the best midfielder outside of the traditional top 2 La Liga teams.

1225~~~
I'd imagine both Herrera and Vidal are disciplined enough to sit in a defensive role when the other bombs forward. Vidal especially.

1226~~~
I already said above it's well worth the risk to Sign Vidal and explained above. Anyway Defensive Box to Box player - Keane. Attacking Box to Box player - Scholes in his earlier days. Right now both Herrera and VIdal are at their best in the Scholes type of role.

Keane and Scholes were box to box when they played as a pairing. But there was a clear distinction that Keane was the defensive of the 2, even though both did pretty much everything almost.

Gerrard Lampard was even more imbalanced because Lampard was at his best almost as a Support Striker and  limited when playing deeper. So pairing him with Gerrard was bit like pairing Rooney and Vidal as a 2.

1227~~~
But then what is the point in using both? Vidal is the better player, no? What is the point of restricting him to allow Herrera to get forward and vice versa? Surely it would make more sense to partner Vidal/Herrera with someone who would allow them to play their game without hindering their own?

Vidal plays mainly with Pirlo and Pogba. They always have that holding anchor behind them which allows them to play a free game, getting forward and defending. The only way I can see it being solid enough is in a 3 man midfield but then that would require us to play with quick forwards who are willing to make off the ball runs.

1228~~~
This is where i disagree a bit with you, unless we can get a top holding mid to give best balance, Herrera playing bit deeper and Vidal more forward or Vice Versa would be better than most anyway. One would have to sacrifice a bit though in a attacking sense probably Herrera and our defense will have to up it's game but they'd still be worth it and against top opposition we can always adapt tactically if needed with a Proper 6 in Carrick coming in.

1229~~~
You're limiting both players though if you tell one to sit whilst the other goes.

1230~~~
Yaya Toure is not a box to box player, it's either one or the other with him.

1231~~~
I agree, the partnership would be 10x better than what we have at the moment because both players are very good all rounders but if I'm being 100% honest, I'd prefer... *pause for dramatic effect* for us to spend the £40 or so million on a holding mid to partner Herrera. If we get Vidal I'll be incredibly happy as he is easily top 3. I guess it all comes down to what LVG wants and the players that are available.

1232~~~
Don't worry, he's class. Not an average player at all. Barca were in for him plenty of times but never bid the release clause, which is why he stayed at Bilbao for so long. Definitely was one of the best midfielder outside of barca and Madrid last season, and barca being interested should be enough proof that he's more then good enough for us. 

I feel like a lot of people are underrating how big of an impact he will make next season.

1233~~~
I think people are under the guise that they aren't good defensively because they both played with a holding midfielder but that's assuming that neither of them have any defensive nous of their own.
Didn't Gerrard play wide in his prime? His best season was when he played off the front, behind Torres. I don't pay close attention to Liverpool so I could be very wrong but from what I've seen of Gerrard through the years, he's all blood and thunder but little defensive intelligence, meaning if he played in midfield, it needed to be with a holder rather than a Lampard-type. I don't believe that to be true for Herrera and Vidal.

1234~~~
And Lampard was always best peeling off the target man in Drogba, making use of his brilliant shooting technique and his prowess in the final third. He had an engine on him, as did Gerrard, but neither of these players were pure mobile enforcers who would do as much in their tackles and timely interceptions as they would in their final pass or attempt to score.

1235~~~
Don't think you'd find consensus on that at all, though I mostly only watch the 6 or 7 teams you'd expect.

Lots of similar level candidates the last 2-3 seasons in <i>Javi Martinez</i>, Illarramendi (at Sociedad), Iturraspe, Verdu, <i>Bruno Soriano</i>, <i>Benat</i> (at Betis), Trashorras (stats are incredible, have personally not seen much, and his Club president claimed he was better than Xabi Alonso, which is probably nonsense, but still) and whichever Valencia CM was in form at the time (Banega, then Costa then Parejo). The italicized dudes even got called up to the Spanish team on more than one occasion. 

It's Spain. They have a lot of good CM's. Herrera has all the tools to distinguish himself and become a full international, and Van Gaal and the paucity of competition here means he has a great opportunity to do it.

1236~~~
You are confusing defensive workrate and intelligence required when you play box to box with a holding mid behind you in a 3 as a 8 or as a 10 with defensive positioning as a 6 i think. Gerrard at his peak and Vidal right now are pretty similar players actually barring some differences ofcourse. Both Did/do more than enough defensively for the attacking output they produce/produced in their  roles but both are best with a defensive/deeper player in behind giving them freedom. Either 1 or 2.

Keane and Gerrard would have worked very well probably just like Keane and Scholes did. Herrera and Vidal would be somewhat like pairing the older versions of Scholes and Gerrard though which would be pretty good against most teams as well given their quality but somewhat imbalanced. Still as i said above Herrera would have to play slightly deeper which he can anwyay, as i don't even remember when was the last time if ever Vidal played a deeper role.

Martinez ofcourse was really good, but I think over a 3-4 year period since he broke through Herrera has probably been the most consistent of those players except him. Rest have had 1/2 good seasons or moved on or just had their breakthrough sort of season. He's in that 2nd tier with the most potential to go into the first pretty much given his age as well.

1237~~~
Apart from Martinez, I think Herrera was rated higher then pretty much all of them. There's a reason Barca were after him for so long but didn't want to do the release clause method because of how messy the whole situation is. Here's what a spanish journo said about him when he left:

Not ashamed to say I watched almost every single Athletic Bilbao game last season. I partly felt sorry for Ander after the way our move for him fell through at the 11th hour and I also had a feeling that we would go back in for him at some point so wanted to see how he got on over the season. I'm excited he's here for sure and can't wait to see what role he plays under LvG as the role he played at Athletic Club last season was further forward (but he definitely isn't a typical number 10 imo).

Why do some people feel the need to do some silly thing with their hand when a camera is out rather than just be normal? For example, Nani is mimicking the universal signal for a telephone there, for no apparent reason. It's almost instinctive, like the people who point at the nearest person to them during a picture for no reason at all. I blame Sean Kingston for all this.

He's Spanish, he's a midfielder, he's more of a finished article, it's no surprise. I'm excited to see Shaw play but it's nothing compared to how much I want to see Herrera

1291~~~

1292~~~
Our Spaniards so loveable and cuddly.

1293~~~
We all expect big things from Shaw. No doubt. But Our midfield have been in disarray for some time, and we're all excited to see how it pans out. But I still think the deal with Shaw was as vital as any we can or will do with Hummels, Vidal or whoever.

Friends. Football friends.

1295~~~
Some good quotes from him on the United website. I particularly liked this part:  <b>If we run, if we work like a humble team then we will play like the biggest team.”</b>

Herrera has every chance of being  a star in this team and maybe even one day Captain with that kind of mentality. More importantly, he talks like a man who understands you have to keep working to improve. I think certain players lack that quality and what with us losing Evra, it's good that we've brought someone in who could have a similar impact in the dressing room. Fingers crossed it works out for him.

1296~~~
Was our dismantling at the hands of Bilbao really the way Ander came onto our radar? If so, I've never been so happy about United losses in my life.

He's another one who 'gets' United isn't he.

1299~~~
A proper replacement for Evra in that sense.

1300~~~
Seems like it. Makes sense that we've been tracking him for a while. He comes across as a humble, hard working, confident young man, eager to learn and improve as a player. I'm quite excited to see him in action. Hope he settle here.

1301~~~

1302~~~

1303~~~
Kagawa. Always capturing the hearts of our Spanish players.

1304~~~
Very impressed with Herrera off the pitch so far. Graham Hunter isn't one to sell Spanish-based players short, but he's bang on in his assessment of Herrera when it comes to his personality, mentality and attitude. I'm sure he will become a fan favourite in no time.

1305~~~
He's the perfect character to Play for this club. If you compare his attitude to the likes of Jack Wilshere/Tom Cleverley. The difference in attitude is night and day.

1306~~~
It's just really nice to see that it all worked out after the mess of last year. It's obvious now that he really wanted to come here and it must have been disappointing when it collapsed thanks to the three muskeposters.

1307~~~
Can't wait to see in action him tonight.

1308~~~
All his moments so far scream intelligence. He's a humble, hard-working guy who is a student of the game. Not an air of pomposity of arrogance. He's destined for greatness with us - Provided of course, he plays well. That before anything else.

1309~~~
When Fergie was here, he'd talk about getting background knowledge on players (before signing them) in terms of family, their attitude etc. Herrera strikes me as a hard worker who is determined to win games. The way he speaks about the club is also terrific. No doubt that made an impression on both SAF and Gill, and then carried over to Moyes and Woodward. This is something that perhaps both Pogba and Morrison lacked.

Herrera will be a real fan favourite.

1310~~~
He counts The King among his favourites!

Great lad.

He counts Poyet among his favourites too!

Stupid, feckin' twat.

Hard to tell, really. I reckon he's fairly dim. Most players are, after all. But who cares. As long as he can play some he's alright by me - not least given where he's likely to play.

1311~~~
I'm terrified he's going to feck off to Uni with Mata.

1312~~~
I love the way he moves with the ball. Glad we got it right in a position that we need alot of strengthen in. I hope any other addition in this role would complement a player of his ability.

Can't wait to see him in a proper competition. Midfield play is refreshing to watch already.

1320~~~
He presses almost as high as the strikers at times and I really love that about him, just adds so much energy to our midfield. Very intelligent player. Come on Woody get someone reliable to partner him!

1321~~~
I love him already <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1322~~~
I'm in love with the little fecker already.

1323~~~
Hard to see us regretting this signing isn't it? A player with his skill set in our midfield can only be a good thing.

1324~~~
God it feels good to have a CM making runs and tackling hard. Reminds me of the Fletcher of old, with better technique!

1325~~~
Looking classy already. Must say it's great scouting by the club.

1326~~~
His first touch <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1327~~~
His energy is fantastic, something we have lacked for sometime in midfield. Great technique on top of that!

1328~~~
Don't want to speak too soon, but there's a bit of Scholes about him.

1329~~~
I know I shouldn't get excited just after a friendly but watching him and Mata run our midfield is just so <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> worthy especially when you compare it to our midfield performance of the last couple of season. I'm really, really looking forward to seeing more of those two this season.

1330~~~
All aboard the hype train!!

Seriously though, he looks class<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1331~~~
I hate to bring Moyes up <i>again</i> but, I still can't understand how Moyes wasn't convinced by what our scouts told him about Herrera. Moyes was sure about Fellaini but not Herrera? In what world does that make any sense?!

Tonight Herrera's giving us a taste of what we could have had last season. Does anyone really think we would have finished seventh if we'd have signed Herrera last summer, even with Moyes in the dugout? I was so angry when the deal fell through last August. Thank God we've got Ander now.

Herrera's been sharp tonight and he's not even up to full speed yet. Wait until Ander is fully match fit, properly timing his tackles and making those runs from midfield he likes to go galloping on... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1332~~~
I was thinking the same thing.

1333~~~
He really didn't get enough recognition in Spain, he's a top class player and was one of the best midfielders in Spain, top 3 outside of the big 2 clubs probably. He just didn't get noticed as much being at Bilbao, but at United I think he'll cement himself amongst the best midfielders in the league.

1334~~~
A player like Vidal would ruin him. Herrera needs a number 6, so he can play this free box to box role.

 It is still too early to judge his potential contribution to the team, but so far I am amazed that he is not even in the Spanish squad. He looks good enough to be selected.

1335~~~
I love how he's going around from player to player and getting his point across.

1336~~~
Easily. I've been saying this for ages. People took Del Bosque's sign of approval as some kind of barometer (this is the manager who keeps picking Torres...)

I'd be all for giving Herrera the number 7 shirt. No centre midfielder has worn that consistently at United since Bryan Robson but, rather than collapse under the pressure of living up to Robbo's legacy, I reckon Herrera would thrive being told he was trusted to live up to Robson's example.

1337~~~
Is he doing real midfielding?! I can't watch the game so can somebody tell me what it's like? Is he running and stuff?

1338~~~
He's running the show. Very intelligent performance by him.

1339~~~
He looks genuinely box to box, and I very rarely use that term. It's been wasted on people like Gerrard and Toure.

1340~~~
He is so cool. A touch of Scholesy i.e. he does not seem to be affected by pressure. But we still need to consider the opposition.

1341~~~
Yep, I agree. He's all over the pitch, and I mean that in the best possible way.

1342~~~
It's like as soon as he passes the ball he's in some rush to move to a point up the field, and is looking for the ball and holding his arms out begging for it to be given back.

Seems to go from a stop to a run fairly rapidly.

Then at one point he kicked the ball really hard towards the goal, not sure what he was thinking there.

"Out wide!" I yelled at my TV.

1343~~~
Need a tiny bit more work on his long passes though.

1344~~~
I don't think I've even seen him get to the byline... <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1345~~~
Absolute class.

1346~~~
It's only against LA Galaxy but he's looked impressive. He did used to play Barcelona and Real Madrid at least twice every season though... I'll be ecstatic if he carries this performance onto big games.

1347~~~
Horrayera

1348~~~
It's really a fecking shame, but a Carrick and Herrera pairing would probably work fantastically.

1349~~~
Or a Herrera and Strootman <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Carrick's a big miss though. I'm sure Van Gaal would have loved to make use of him early on in the season.

1350~~~
How could Woodward have overpaid so much for this guy? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1351~~~
This guy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1352~~~
We have a midfielder. \o/

1353~~~
I said it before, but he doesn't get loads of assists or goals really, don't think he has an assist today, but he plays the pass before the assist so often and that cutting edge is something we've really lacked.

And as I say that he gets 2 assists <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1354~~~
I will admit it,everytime he breaks forward looking for a through ball..I get a hard on<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1355~~~
omd stop pls

1356~~~
Stahp it Herrera. I can't handle this much sex.

1357~~~
FORWARD PASSES!

1358~~~
Hererra and young link up<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1359~~~
And another through ball...I'll be back in 36 seconds.

1360~~~
<3

1361~~~
Amazing first game.

1362~~~
he's a fecking superstar

1363~~~
Definitely man of the match tonight. Fabregas would have been proud of that debut

1364~~~
Impossible not to get excited, what a feckin player.

1365~~~
What a player, he played atleast a dozen through balls of absolute quality there. Best debut ever!

1366~~~
Thoroughly impressive.

1367~~~
Unbelievable. What a star.

1368~~~
What in god's name did I just watch? A proper midfield performance? Out of this world by Herrera. 

What. A. Player.

1369~~~
Born is the king

1370~~~
Heard Iniesta is studying his match already.

1371~~~
Love.

1372~~~
He's going to have an amazing season. I just know it.

1373~~~
Can pass the ball forward

1374~~~
He's gonna tear the PL teams apart.

1375~~~
Great first game and even though it's just a friendly this looked really promising. Looking forward to him and Mata tearing up to opposition defenses with their passing skills.

1376~~~
Set to be fans favourite just like Mata within next months. Wanted to come here, runs a <b>fecking</b> lot and then those killer passes, fantastic guy.

1377~~~
Him and Mata linking up was fun.

Not sure how a Vidal-Herrera midfield partnership would work but I'd definitely enjoy finding out...

1378~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1379~~~
Carrick isnt mobile enough for me.

1380~~~
He's pretty much what I hoped Cleverley could turn into. Except better and Spanish.

1381~~~
Welcome to the Ander-show.

1382~~~
Made more through balls in the last few minutes than our whole midfield combined last season.

1383~~~
Would probably make for the best match compilation, ever.

1384~~~
What a great first 'unofficial' game!

Very very encouraging start (I am very excited to say the least) but it is still early days, guys. He was sweep all the pre-season MOTM awards but we'll only see how good he in the first few games in the league.

1385~~~
Had acres to play in but used the space well and is pure class on the ball, very exciting debut for sure.

1386~~~
Absolutely ran the show. He definitely needs a high energy partner in the middle. Deservedly man of the match. Some of his play was absolutely world class.

1387~~~
Fair enough, but I don't think Herrera really needs a mobile partner, especially with a number 10 in front of them. Scholes - Carrick worked pretty well, and I wouldn't say either were mobile...

1388~~~
The sad thing is that I think thats really true.

1389~~~
This is one of those days that you just know. It doesn't matter who opposition is. His first touch is just class. I don't think the opposition will make a difference to that. The through balls might be more difficult against harder teams. I'm about this close to claiming that he can replace scholsey

1390~~~
Please stay injury-free.

1391~~~
Shockingly effective performance in his first match.

1392~~~
What a game he had absolutely bossed the midfield.

1393~~~
unbelievably good tonight, easily MOTM, passing was super, movement as well, looks like a natural United player already, so excited to see him play against the bigger teams now!

1394~~~
It really is what United could be capable of doing all these years with a proper midfielder capable of playmaking.

1395~~~
Sure as hell looked like Scholes MK II out there.

1396~~~
It is beyond belief that United backed out of a deal to sign Herrera last summer. WTF were we thinking?

1397~~~
If we would have got him then we would have done slightly better and Moyes would still be here. Be happy it took a year...

1398~~~
Ridiculously good passing and awareness from him. It's only preseason, but what a performance.

1399~~~
I wonder how different last season would have been with Herrera instead of Fellaini.

1400~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Every cloud I suppose...

Don't. I've done this to myself repeatedly. Its better just to think Moyes would've benched him for not getting it wide early and often enough. Let's leave last season firmly in the past

1401~~~
Only saw the first half, but he just seems to be several steps ahead in terms of his play.

1402~~~
After watching that performance I will be needing a match comp ASAP.

1403~~~
Still would have been a terrible season. No amount of quality players can compensate for a sub par manager, at least not at our level.

1404~~~
Herrera - Mata combination is eye watering.

1405~~~
Hard to say, though maybe Moyes is asking the same question. Have to think under Moyes system where there was such little movement, he probably would not have had a chance to show his real ability. Played a full 90, so not expecting him to start against Roma - going to be eager to see him against supposed strong opposition.  Last pre-season against maybe even lesser competition we were struggling.

1406~~~
Just imagine Vidal next to this guy.

I just came a little <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1407~~~
I don't think he knows how to play zombie football.  He was always looking for the quick forward pass and kept the tempo high.  We haven't had someone that could create space for himself like that since Scholes left.

1408~~~
Noticed during the build up to James' second goal, as Herrera was sprinting forward about to pass it to Young, his head swiveled 90 degrees left and then 90 degrees right, while going at near enough top speed, before delivering that inch perfect through pass.

Incredible.

1409~~~
Hands off bitches. Ander is mine <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1410~~~
Loved his game. Love him already.

1411~~~
His through balls are ok but they don't have that sting, that zap of Anderson's where the ball just cuts the grass and really goes!

1412~~~
Noticed that too. His awareness is top-notch. Can't wait to see more of him.

1413~~~
This guy was a breath of fresh air. Movement, looks to go forward, comfortable on the ball and happy to carry the ball forward when needed. He had a really good game, Man of the Match for me. Him coming in really shows what we have been lacking for quite a while. If we can get another mobile midfielder to go with him it would be great. Hopefully he can keep impressing like this consistently.

1414~~~
Herrera is going to make our strikers look good, he always seemed to release the ball early tonight.

1415~~~
Hell, if he manages to make Ashley Young be a standout in a game then I can't wait to see what he'll do with RVP.

1416~~~
Vidal's a terrific player, but I feel we'll be taking away a part of Ander's game if we were to get him. We need a proper defensive midfielder, who will allow Ander the freedom to go forward and create. Schneiderlin be my pick.

1417~~~
Or Gonalons, Neustadter, Kramer, or Badelj.

Seriously, just give Ander Herrera the freedom to play. His movement and attacking runs are so dangerous and bring an added dimension to the team. His close control, passing, and vision is very good. van Gaal just needs to develop Ander's discipline and defensive awareness, and he'd be good to go along with a disciplined, defensively capable midfield partner.

1418~~~

1419~~~
Agreed. I've not seen any of the players you mentioned, except Kramer, but if they're dynamic defensive midfielders, then sign em up LVG! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1420~~~
This guy can play that's for sure. Would reserve my judgement till I see him play in the PL but from whatever little I saw (and had seen at Bilbao), it looks very promising.

1421~~~
Badelj and Gonalons are more of deep-lying playmakers, but both do get around the pitch when defending rather than staying at one spot.

1422~~~
Badelj is a good shout.

1423~~~
I wonder what's moyes thinking right now.

1424~~~
. . . out for a goal kick.

1425~~~
He mightn't know how to use him.

1426~~~
Didn't he blame the players for the poor results or something?

1427~~~
Moyes claimed Fellaini was always Belgium's most impressive player when he watched them, in his World Cup Sunday Times column.

Based on that, I'm guessing Moyes will be wondering why Herrera tries so many cute through balls. Ball on deck don't play to the big man's strengths: get it wide, get it in. That's Moyes.

1428~~~
Vidal would compliment Herrera's  game absolutely fine. Vidal is a brilliant all-round midfielder.

1429~~~

1430~~~

Missed the game but it sounded like Herrera had a brilliant game, imagine when we bring in another capable central midfielder <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

<a class="username" data-user="81511, @Adnan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81511/">@Adnan</a> you beauty! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Thanks

1434~~~
Not what I expected from him at all! He has the look of a shy boy, but he is full of character isn't he? Announcing his arrival with a godly shot early in the game and winking at teammates after passes and goals. Fantastic. I might just have a bit of a crush

1435~~~
Thanks <a class="username" data-user="81511, @Adnan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81511/">@Adnan</a> 

He was fantastic, our Herrera!<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1436~~~
I always maintained that not buying Herrera and opting for the safer, more predictable option in Fellaini really summed up why Moyes was never cut out for this job.

1437~~~
He looks the real deal.Excellent from him tonight.

1438~~~
Has anyone else formed a massive man crush on this guy?

It's becoming a bit of an issue now, we've got Goggs, Mata, Van Persie and now Herrera who are all complete man crush material. 

A man crush is only made ok by it's rarity. This is becoming a bit gay. Sorta hoping we go for De Jong now rather than Vidal or I'm going to end up on annual marches in Brighton.

1439~~~
Please... let's not turn this into a Moyes bashing thread. I've looked a lot into this and there is no substantial proof to suggest Moyes didn't want Herrera. 

Staying on topic: I can't believe someone on here said he is the spanish cleverly!

1440~~~

1441~~~
Too late I'm afraid, the Moyes bashers have been out in force this morning. No doubt his name will crop up time and again as soon as LVG loses his first game....all bodes well doesn't it?

1442~~~
He's exactly what we've been lacking last few years. No more zombie passing with him in charge. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 
His style reminds me a bit of Modrić.

1443~~~
I'm calling it now, this kid will be our most important player by the end of the season . It'll be up to him to make this 343 tick.

1444~~~
Agreed with that bolded bit but what I said wasn't really Moyes bashing, was it? I simply said he wasn't good enough, which is true. But yea, not the thread or topic etc.

I'm a huge Herrera fan, so was always a bit pissed when we pulled out of that deal. But bygones. Who said he was the Spanish Cleverley? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The Caf sometimes, ey.

1445~~~
I don't he has Modric's range of passing but they do have similar traits.

1446~~~
I know... it was the day we signed him. I hadn't seen much of him and I also got disappointed by that comment! But seems like it's the opposite!

1447~~~
Anyone think he has an outside chance of being made captain? I remember van Gaal made Strootman captain despite barely featuring for Holland before his appointment.

1448~~~
Ander would make an excellent captain TBF. Always had a bit of Keanesque winner aggression in him at Zaragoza and Bilbao. That said he's too green right now even for an extremist like Van Gaal. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1449~~~
His a good shout and has the mentality to do so, but given he was just signed I can't realistically see him being appointed captain or even in the running to be honest.

1450~~~
Great performance and a complete midfield performance 

Stick Vidal next to him and we will dominate teams

1451~~~
Javi Martinez. Reunite the Basque brothers..

1452~~~
Good work <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1453~~~
To be fair he probably is the Spanish equivelant of Cleverley - but that shows the differences between our two national teams.

1454~~~
Pretty much and it speaks to Pep's comments years back regarding Wilshere as well

Herrera is a quality player, no doubt.  Plus, I think his personality will be perfect for the Premiership

1455~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1456~~~
If we signed Javi Martinez...

...pure joy!

1457~~~
Absolutely. He's got all the key elements we've missed since Scholes' prime. Proper box to box player with enough skill and ability at both ends of the pitch.

He's almost a Fabregas (in CM)/Modric hybrid in midfield, if I had to compare his skillset.

1458~~~
Happy reading lads! 

Nice way to start the day, can't wait to see some footage later.

1459~~~
A proper midfielder. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://mlkshk.com/r/J0LD" src="http://mlkshk.com/r/J0LD"/>

1460~~~
One great fella has posted some footage on the caf! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1461~~~
Adnan posted a summary of his performance which was quoted a couple of posts above yours. Check it out.

1462~~~
Some of his best performances have been against Barcelona and Madrid so I'd have no worries about is big-game mentality. In fact you'd probably struggle to find a poor performance against Barca in his career.

1463~~~
Even when you isolate his performances and disregard the opposition, you'll find him a truly enjoyable midfielder to watch. Movement, passing and vision is very good for the level his playing at and his stamina is outstanding as well.

1464~~~
very, very promising debut! A performance close to that at PL level would be fantastic!

1465~~~
I'm so glad we signed him, he's top class. I can't actually believe there were people claiming he can't be that good cause he has no caps and saying we overpaid. He'll be a crowd favourite in no time.

1466~~~
Cause Barca or Madrid weren't interested innit.

1467~~~
Why do i like the sound of Cleverley alongside Herrera? I just feel Cleverley deserves a chance next to some quality midfielders that want to play the same game as he does. And ye...I love this kid. He is a footballer with a brain!!! Humble, intelligent, bags of quality. Will see angles on the pitch. I am so pleased we got him instead of Cesc

1468~~~
Barca were heavily linked to him at one point.

1469~~~
He was absolutely majestic today. Hope he performs well in the coming few matches and goes into the season in good form. He was good in the first half but wasn't too adventurous with his runs forward, given he was in a midfield 2 with Fletcher who was rather disappointing. His movement off the ball, ball retention, dictating of play and long-range passing were terrific but it seemed as though he couldn't make as much of an impact as he would have liked in the final third. It was a different story in the second half where he played as the most advanced midfielder and really shone with his penetrating runs and brilliant through balls. With a proper holding midfielder or Vidal alongside him, he would be even better as a number 8 while still making a considerable impact in the final third with his driving runs and penetrating balls. Might be overstating things but it looks like we got a hybrid of Scholes and Keane in one, judging by that performance alone <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.

1470~~~
Gross exaggeration, it was a random rumour that never had any life to it

1471~~~
Fair enough, but I remember a lot of reports saying that you wanted to bring him in when Fabregas leaves. I wouldn't have been surprised if there was something to them considering how well he always played against you.

1472~~~
Midfielders are strange when it comes to Barcelona. Herrera would have been to direct to suit them, they would have been better off going for Kroos.

1473~~~
How is he the Spanish equivalent of Tom? His passing and movement. His close control. His ability to remain calm under pressure and find a pass. The ability to run with the ball and then make those amazing through balls. All of these are miles ahead of Cleverley. Just because both do some things which a footballer can does not make them anything remotely similar in terms of style or ability.

1474~~~
Ooooh friend. Football friend.

If you weren't quoting The Inbetweeners I must look thicker than ever right now.

1475~~~
Wow absolutely fantastic performance by Ander tonight!! He is a great player, early days but by god what a breath of fresh air he is!

1476~~~
What kind of music even is this? Is it a real thing? Do people actually go places to listen to it? Can we bomb those places? Or perhaps trap people inside whilst fumigating it? It sounds like happy hardcore filtered through 90s japanese computer game music. Or the Care Bears gon' raving. Why are people who make compilation videos without fail incapable of putting good music on things? Is it some kind of disorder?

1477~~~
From what little I have seen of Ander, he may not have Modric's passing range but his passing is more incisive than Luka.

1478~~~
Hmm maybe, Ander likes to attack more than Modric though who seems to be playing deeper these days. I remember a stat that said Ander played the most or second most accurate through balls in La Liga last season so you probably are right.

1479~~~
Completely agree! Cesc who? I think he had the best years ahead of him as well!! Very exciting for us fans!

1480~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yeah it gave me a headache within 5 seconds.

Mute, mute, mute!!

1481~~~
Welcome to middle age, grandad.

1482~~~
When we look back at this signing in five years, it could prove a bargain. He's still very young for a midfielder.

1483~~~
Hard not to get carried away after that performance, keep reminding myself it was a pre season friendly. Very promising however.

He looked absolutely amazing. But you have to remember it's only a preseason friendly against players nowhere close to the quality of the Premier League.

It goes to show how much of an idiot Moyes was by not buying him and lumping the money on Fellaini instead.

1485~~~
I go raving. I love a bit of raving. But this is mental 13 year old Japanese girl rave music. It's a loading screen from PES6 gone rogue. It's the musical embodiment of a Slush Puppie brain freeze. It's evil.

1486~~~
I know what you mean!! I am beaming from ear to ear, it feels like it did when SAF was in charge, in terms of not worrying about losing. If we lost under SAF the team moved on and bounced back and I didn't worry. It feels the same way here. Last year I hated and detested every match day. Onwards and upwards!

1487~~~
Don't get me wrong, it's awful. But you'll find yourself repulsed, frightened and confused by music more and more often from here on in. It's pretty much my default reaction nowadays.

1488~~~
I feel like people need to just understand, every good performance etc just serves to remind us how far back and how badly Moyes's set up was. I will never forgive Moyes for last season, and yes, I blame him the most!

1489~~~
Spare a thought for Chelsea who played a team from Austria yesterday that finished 5th in the Austrian Bundesliga and only managed a draw.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1490~~~

1491~~~
I think music reached its zenith with Saturday Night by Whigfield. It's been in sharp decline ever since.

1492~~~
He was class. The best thing about him was he was able to take the ball under pressure, turn and play a forward pass. We haven't had a midfielder like that in years.

1493~~~
Bloody hell Costa has had a hard life then! Jesus!

1494~~~

1495~~~

1496~~~
I can't wait to find out what number he's playing in the new season! I'm buying his shirt he's impressed me that much! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1497~~~
He's played one pre-season game against a shit midfield, lads. He was excellent, couldn't have done more, but let's not get carried away and start proclaiming that he's better than Modric and Fabregas. That's RAWKish. At least give him a full season before we start that sort of thing.

Just enjoy his performance for what it was.

/grumpysod (sorry)

1498~~~
Bloody hell!

1499~~~
Come on let us have this bit of excited ness, please! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1500~~~
I'd imagine he'd stick with 21. That was his number when at Bilbao, and Henriquez will likely be loaned out freeing up the number.

1501~~~
Cool!

1502~~~
Scholes-like the way he pinged balls around the park effortlessly. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1503~~~
Based on that performance, i'd say he walks straight into our first XI.

Question is: What kind of formation and midfield partners would suit him best? Not saying we should bend over backwards to accommodate him, but our midfield have been screaming for an overhaul for years, and Carrick isn't exactly getting any younger.

1504~~~
I was talking about his passing in general. Not just his passing against LA Galaxy. He is more incisive than Luka, though Luka's ability to dictate play from deep is better.

1505~~~
I don't think that was ever in doubt rather he played a stormer or not. Our midfield is fecking shite.

1506~~~
Just a more defensive partner that can cover him a little, but still goes forward. So basically Vidal. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1507~~~
I've seen him play brilliant against Barca and Madrid aswell. His performance earlier was something I expected from him, he's going to get better and better as the season progresses.

1508~~~
Through balls, through balls and more through balls.

God, I've missed them from our midfield, its hard not to get carried away after that performance - he was class.

1509~~~
So impressed with him. His energy, vision, passing were all great but what a huge relief to see one of our midfielders running and carrying the ball. I can't remember the last time I saw this. Hopefully the days of 5 yard sideways passes and standing still are over.

1510~~~
Anderson carried the ball at times, but that'd result in him being fecked for the remainder of the game. Also, he did absolutely nothing at the end of the runs, but was praised because he ran with it for a while.

Thank feck we've signed an actual midfielder.

1511~~~
People sound surprised.

1512~~~
Probably Giggs in the second half of 2010-11.

1513~~~
You missed my point, I meant in what they represent within their nations. Both are on the fringes of the NT, both are seen as future prospects, both creative midfielders, similiar ages.

My point is that Spain have a wealth of talent, to the extent that Herrera is the Spanish cleverley.

Anyway, was just a throw away comment.

1514~~~
In that case, I actually did miss your point <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1515~~~
Their situation was nothing alike. One got into their NT because he plays for a big club, one didn't get into his because he played for a small one.

1516~~~
"10 Months" is doing a disservice to a few millions years of evolution.

1517~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

miss that game

1518~~~
You got me, I was completely wrong.

1519~~~
Looks like he tries to #stayonyourfeet too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1520~~~
My word he was good.

1521~~~
I said I thought he would be a good signng, just the type of all round midfielder we need. Ok, it's only LA Galaxy, but it's a positive start!  He's a signing that has sort of gone under the radar in the wider football world as well.

1522~~~
Interesting that he essentially played in the no.10 role the second half. Think LVG will end up playing him in a few midfield roles this season.

1523~~~
I'm not sure if I want to see that too often though. Our central midfield is still too weak to be moving Herrera around and we've plenty of attacking midfield options.

1524~~~
True, though, depending on who we sign he could be used in a deeper role as well as playing box to box on occasions.

1525~~~
I think he moved Herrera further forward to assess our other midfielders.

1526~~~
Diego Costa looks like Trog from Sinbad Eye of the Tiger.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9_iMNcLAXpg/TKvXSzg1gwI/AAAAAAAAAyc/qhlJZAgNLms/s1600/eye+of+tiger+26.jpg" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9_iMNcLAXpg/TKvXSzg1gwI/AAAAAAAAAyc/qhlJZAgNLms/s1600/eye+of+tiger+26.jpg"/>

1527~~~
Looking at the highlights for the goals and holy hell he was immense. Serving them on a plate.

Can't wait to watch my download of the whole game later.

1528~~~
This is just what top CM's do these days, we've been starved of one for years and years we'd forgotten what one looked like. He's going to be quality, but nothing we didn't already know in this match.

1529~~~
Superb performance.

1530~~~
A few weeks ago i said that Herrera was more a passer than a runner. And he showed that today.

1531~~~
this was a really good midfield performance and of course compared to what we are used to, the difference is immense. What the fecking hell could we expect if Vidal really joins <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

A back 5, then Vidal, Herrera, Mata, Rooney and van Persie would do the rest ;-)

1532~~~
My god, what a player! Sometimes I do think football is just too simple.

1533~~~
Looks more like Moyes.

1534~~~
To think someone suggested Fellaini was an equally good player... Fecking, fecking hell.

1535~~~
Please tell me there's a highlights reel somewhere, I don't think I fully appreciated Herrera last night since I stayed up until 6 AM and got really tired.

1536~~~
Just watch the video, look a good performance - Something we've not seen from a Manchester United midfielder for a while, would be great to have someone on similar level of skill/mindset next to him, a Vidal type midfielder.   I didn't watch the game but read comments of the game and you just get the feeling sticking our current crop of shite midfielders next to him really exposes just how limited they are and that's how it sounded with Fletcher playing next to him yesterday.

1537~~~
That's what great players do, they make football look easy. If Herrera did that last night then its a sign of his ability. I think xavi was one of the best examples of a player that I have seen make the game look easy. He pretty much never lost the ball no matter how much pressure he was under and at the same time would always find space to receive the ball.

1538~~~
Never mind, just found the highlights video <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1539~~~
He looked absolutely class last night. Those assists were just... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

Can't wait to see him in the new season.

1540~~~
Just watched the match and he was brilliant, he really was. What an improvement to our midfield he looks to be. When I compare that to Fellaini...feck my life.

1541~~~
Just finished watching the Match and post match interviews here - <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.lastminutegoals.org/la-galaxy-vs-manchester-united-pre-season-club-friendly/#tabs-4032-0-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lastminutegoals.org/la-g...nited-pre-season-club-friendly/#tabs-4032-0-3</a>

What a player, didn't waste a pass and so very good assists. Fantastic, creativity form midfield. BRILLIANT!

1542~~~
Seriously, said it last night and I'll say it again, for his sake, we really need another midfielder, would be so unfortunate if he couldn't properly be appreciated because he was dragged down by the dross surrounding him

1543~~~
They worked then, but this is 2014 where midfields are being packed and 4-4-2 is being overwhelemed. CM"s are expected to cover lots of space.

1544~~~
I get the feeling to get the absolute maximum from him we're gonna need a 3 man midfield with a proper holding mid. Someone like mario suarez would be a great signing for us. 

Absolutely awesome in his first game for us. Had most of his quality out there for people to see. Classy passer of the ball and wonderful technically. He's got that zidanesque feel about him. Our strikers need to start making proper runs as we finally have a player that can get the ball to them. Also showed off some of his passing range.

1545~~~
Agree, it's very important we bring in another quality midfielder.

1546~~~
This alone should demonstrate to everyone that Van Gaal knows what he's doing. If it's true he wanted Herrera over Kroos then you can see why now. If he trusts players within the squad to perform at the highest level, then you can trust him in that judgement, too. Whoever we sign between now and the end of the summer will be a bonus.

1547~~~
This!

1548~~~
Top class player.

Great signing!

1549~~~

1550~~~
Agree. He reminded us of what a through ball would look like. The poor forgotten thing in the United land. I can only hope that he stays injury free.

1551~~~
Loved it, he looks a player!

1552~~~
I think his only been injured twice when at Bilbao so that's a positive, but we do need another midfielder because if he gets injured we're fecked.

1553~~~
Exactly, somebody earlier said oh we don't need another midfielder because Fletcher has looked solid, and Herrera is quality. Well if either of those get suspended or injured we are suddenly having a huge drop of quality.

1554~~~
Best part about it is he's only 24, going on 25 next month we'll easily get at least 7 year of top service out of him.

1555~~~
What's his injury record like? the worst thing that could possibly happen is him getting injured along with Carrick. It makes me depressed just thinking about it.

1556~~~
Yep. If Herrera was to get injured you can't expect Cleverley to reach Herrera's standard.

1557~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.com/ander-herrera/verletzungen/spieler/99343" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.com/ander-herrera/verletzungen/spieler/99343</a> He has suffered only two injuries when a Bilbao only missing 13 games.

1558~~~
I don't really know but from the looks of his match history it doesn't look like he's had any serious injuries since he made it at Zaragoza 7 seasons ago.

1559~~~
Best comment on twitter in reply to Herrera <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1560~~~
Ah man don't say that...

...Although Herrera's going to need a lot of protection this season. Other teams will know how big of a difference Herrera can make for us, and they will kick the tar out of him if the referees allow them to. Everyone we play against will try and 'stop' Herrera, fairly or unfairly they won't care.

1561~~~
Give him number 7. He's the player who can make the difference next season, imo.

1562~~~
I think cleverley is more than good enough to be his back up. Van gaal's style is right up his alley and I expect him to improve. Any team can expect a drop in quality when/if a 30 million pound star midfielder gets injured.

1563~~~
And the problem is that he will replicate, he doesn't like being bullied.

1564~~~
Look like kagawa might be his backup moreso than cleverley if we are looking for the same type of ball movement. Cleverley looks like a scott parker type of player who is mostly influential via his high work ethic. It will be a huge drop going from herrera to cleverly in this box to box role. Albeit, Kagawa is not a box to box midfielder, his movement is very similiar to Herrera.

1565~~~
Before last night I didn't know what a through ball was :S

1566~~~

1567~~~
Cleverley was totally anonymous in the second half. If he could stay fit and play in the system, Anderson would be a better choice as back up (although, as neither condition is likely to be met, we probably need to buy someone).

1568~~~
Too true. It's shocking how bad our midfielders have been besides Carrick, who's decline last season seen us become even more hopeless.

1569~~~
He did very well, personally I prefer him as a B 2 B midfielder rather than a 10 but I know he has played a variety of roles at Bilbao, now to get in some more quality.

1570~~~
Oh God no. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I want that waste of a footballer gone as soon as possible.

1571~~~
You can see that his performance is no coincidence, I watched his ScoutNation two days ago and I recongnized so many things, to do the same in your debut match shows how much of automatism the things he do are, its just his style of play.

1572~~~
he is already better than anyone we have in midfield because our board and ex managers fecked up big time. you just have to wonder what the feck were Fergie and Moyes doing <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> luckily, those days are over. now, if we could bring Vidal too...

1573~~~
<b>New midfielder Ander Herrera believes Manchester United’s current players share the same passion and determination as Eric Cantona.</b>

Spaniard Herrera, 24, shone on his pre-season debut as Louis van Gaal’s side thrashed LA Galaxy 7-0 in California on Wednesday.



Herrera revealed Cantona, who won four titles in five years at Old Trafford, is an inspiration to him both as a player and a character, and that the rest of the squad see the charismatic Frenchman in the same light.



<b>"I liked Cantona’s character, he was a winner and always worked hard</b>, Herrera said.



<b>“He never lost one ball and was always thinking about the victory. This group of players has those same characteristics. We always want to win, we want to play well for the Man United supporters.



“Of course, he had personality too."</b>



Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young and youngster Reece James both scored twice, with Danny Welbeck bagging the other, as United thrived in Van Gaal’s new-look 3-5-2 formation.



But, speaking to MUTV, Herrera warned: “Let's not forget this is a friendly and we still have many things to improve on.



“We are happy with the result but our coach is a very demanding coach. He won't let us sit back and relax.



“He always looks for perfection and for that reason he is ideal for a club that always looks to achieve the greatest things.”



Herrera’s Spain international team-mate Juan Mata also featured in the win before United flew to Denver ahead of their second Guinness International Cup game against Roma on Saturday.

And the former Chelsea attacker was full of praise for Herrera after an impressive first showing.



Mata said: "He is a great player and he showed that in the match. I am very happy for him. We have a good connection on and off the pitch.



“I have known about him for a while from our days with the Spanish national youth teams and he was very good against Galaxy.”

1574~~~
Well, Fergie was walking the league with ease.

1575~~~
I love it. Does anyone who where we can watch the video of this?

1576~~~

1577~~~
WTF is wrong with our Spaniards. Players aren't supposed to be this likeable.. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1578~~~
he still continued to sign good players, just not in midfield.

1579~~~
maybe he was angry with Young running too slow

1580~~~
You should have ordered this morning before 8am as the UTD megastore had a glitch'online and was selling the new shirt for £22 I've ordered the Herrera shirt which cost me just under £31 delivered!!!

1581~~~
Am I the only one who thinks that Pereira is a bit similair in style of play?

1582~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/M2YFeT5B6ai/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

decent ball. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1583~~~
The way Galaxy were playing yesterday with their suicidally high line, I don't think you can read much into any through balls Ander played last night.

How often would you get a situation like the one above in the Premier League? Hardly ever. 

Still a very good performance from AH, mind you.

1584~~~
It's a shame Villas-Boas is gone. Herrera would bag himself 10 assists over two games against his high line. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1585~~~
did the same, but would be surprised if they dispatch the shirts. Especially the Herrera ones will be dispatched in August when the numbers are confirmed. Plenty of time for them to find something legally stopping the sales. Should have gone for Mata and express delivery.

1586~~~
He needs to stop seducing me!

1587~~~
Our spanish players are so likable aren't they?

I'm really happy with this signing. It's brilliant having a midfielder who can actually run and do crazy things like pass the ball forward. I'd forgotten what it looks like.

1588~~~
Missed out on this but apparently United are going to honour all sales

1589~~~
He was superb to watch. I thought he was a very good player when we signed him but never believed he was THAT good. He had pretty much everything in him. Maybe I'm getting over excited by it because of the crap which was served last season. Unbelievable start , worth waking up early <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1590~~~
Yeah im waiting also on numbers as i want Januzaj's jersey and praying he gets 7

1591~~~
where did you get that from?

1592~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtUSgSsCYAIHdjl.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtUSgSsCYAIHdjl.jpg"/>

1593~~~
moyes bashing can go as far as just making a comparison between now and last season and including moyes in the sentence

1594~~~
Why is the shirt stuff in the Herrera thread?

1595~~~
Our Pereira you mean? Kind of, but he's a bit more of a dribbler and less of a passer. And, at the moment, more of an impact player but much less consistent. He does have the same quality of looking comfortable as both a tempo-setting CM and a creative AM.

1596~~~
He is fast becoming my favourite player, alongside with Mata.

1597~~~
I can't fecking believe I missed out on this

1598~~~
Pereira needs to consistantly find a teammate which he doesn't currently. Ander is playing whatever balls are on, safe ones, quick ones, one touch ones, one twos when needed but when the defence is backing off him he's looking to play the killer passes to put teammates through

Pereira is trying to play the the killer ball as much as possible and sometimes its just not on for him or its a ridiculously hard pass to pull off and he's not able to make it.

Pereira also has a much better shot imo. But in terms of technical ability and taking the ball into their feet or beating a man I'd say yes there are similarities.

1599~~~
Cantona. The gift that keeps on giving <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1600~~~
Thanks, and is Petrucci similair? (just asking, dont think he will make it here)

1601~~~
All the time when you're counter attacking. Silva at City, Mata during his time at Chelsea, Liverpool all over their squad score from countless of these types of through balls. We used to as well during our Champions league winning campaign.

1602~~~
I wonder what Moyes is thinking right now.

1603~~~
That's brilliant! I always miss stuff like this!

1604~~~
We deserve this, RedCafe. A proper midfielder.

1605~~~
"he would've been a decent partner for Marouane."

1606~~~
I bet he has all his payoff money in a room and swims around in it like Scrooge McDuck! 
I'm sure he's fine!

1607~~~
Pereira is more of a dribbler who can run with the ball, shimmy and beat a few players etc.. and also has a better shot. Herrera's passing is much better and Passing isn't the strongest suit so far like that for Pereira.

1608~~~
Just watched the match as i couldn't see it last night and Herrera was awesome, i mean really, really good. If we could just get someone like Vidal next to him, we would be a real force next season imo.

1609~~~
Slotted in like he's been a United player for years. A round peg for a round midfield sized hole.

1610~~~
*Tries to quickly think of Anderson joke... 

Fails.

1611~~~
Amazing wasn't it?

1612~~~
You have to think how much could we have won with Fergie in the latter years if he had just signed a quality midfielder. I think we settled for <i>just</i> the Premier League towards the end. Spoilt but true.

1613~~~
Finished watching my download of the full match and he just bossed the entire game. His first touch is superb and his ability to make space for himself is impressive. None of our CM's are anywhere near his level, which makes me believe we can do far better even for squad players there.

I have to say though that massive 'Ander Herrera' looks daft on the back of his shirt. A. Herrera would be better.

1614~~~
I thought you were a Liverpool fan?

1615~~~
Thought the exact same <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1616~~~
I love his attitude.  I will admit that last year this time, I was underwhelmed when we tried to sign him after failing with Thiago and Cesc.  A 24 year old who has never had a sniff with the NT, no other clubs showed any interest.  But a small part of me inside had a feeling that if our scouts were this determined to get him, they must see something in him.  Glad they were right.

1617~~~
Ye they need to change that it looks a bit ridiculous!

1618~~~
WHAT!!!???

1619~~~
Apparently so, G <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1620~~~
As a piss take, I was wondering the same. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

But yeah, it's great to see that passion.

1621~~~
He was excellent, always wants the ball, best first touch ive ever seen, love him

1622~~~
I don't know why I thought that. Maybe its your username. Y2A. Either I confused your name with YAWN or I confused you with another poster. My bad either way!

Edit: Why won't it show up as You Never Walk Alone initials? Its shows up as YAWN.

1623~~~
My username is probabaly the most unoriginal. Just the initials of my name -y, fathers name - y and surname - A.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1624~~~
By somebody you mean Moyes don't you?

1625~~~
Fantastic performance. Great mobility and passing. 

Our next big CM signing should probably be someone who can pass, sit deep and put out fires to pair with him, whether it's 3-5-2 or 4-2-3-1 or whatever.

1626~~~
Sadly didn't get to watch the game last night but fantastic to hear he played so well, he seems so well suited to us that it's an effort to stay ground about the effect he could have on the team. Delighted we were able to make it happen after last summer's shambles.

1627~~~

1628~~~
It is amazing Moyes thought signing fellaini ahead of herrera

1629~~~
Really wish Moyes could stop being brought up.

1630~~~
I like...
Herrera not Moyes.

He wanted to sign Herrera, but it's never easy to get players from his club. He tried to get a lot of midfielder and ended up with a desperate solution. Things might have not have ended yet for Moyes if he could have signed two or three great player (and Herrera was on that list).

The past is the past, and I'm very happy with us having both Herrera and LvG.

1632~~~
Anderson would fill it too. By buying a pie.

"Fellaini would have scored the header. At least my United legacy will continue with all the Chevrolet crosses on the shirts"

1635~~~
Cant remember a United player in the last years wearing his first and last name on the shirt. I dont have a problem with it, i just thought he would adapt and just put his surname there, but he kept his old printing. They have him temporary as Herrera there, which looks better imo. In the store i cant put more than 10 characters on the back of the shirt, wonder why they set the limit to 10.

1636~~~
If SAF has spent the 80m on Modric and ribery he/we would have a few more champions league titles to his name...but especially at the end he had us winning despite the players, not because of them.

1637~~~
nah...Moyes was defeatist through his sound bites practially from the beginning. He'd never won anything. None of the players were going to have the "belief" through his team talks or vision. United needed someone proven, a winner and a bloody minded one at that in order to keep the faith of the team or at least them feel a bit more secure about the future. LVG gives us that. Doesn't guarantee any success, but we are definitely going to play much more exciting football this season, whatever happens. It's in LVG's dna...

1638~~~
If he weren't just joining us, he'd be an obvious captain material. Involved in everything positive, great passing, great movement, brave, first touch immaculate..

Agree with the question marks over what the f we've been allowing to happen to our midfield in the last few years. I don't think it's as simple as SAF being stubborn. The Glazers were a presumably a factor, not to say that we couldn't have bought a 15-20m midfielder who'd immediately improve us. 

I was sat watching the game pondering what our team would be like with one or two more Ander Herraras.

1639~~~
Good start to his United career. Some lovely short and long passes he also played a few in to score and got some assists. I like the way he put himself about the middle of the pitch as well.

1640~~~
Our midfield problems the last few years have nothing to do with the Glazer or SAF being stubborn and everything to do with bad luck.

We signed Hargreaves only for to turn out to be extremely injury prone 
We signed Anderson, he turned out to be a bust.
We had a fee accepted for Ramsey only for him to turn us down.
Fletcher comes to down with a career threatening illness
We signed Pogba only for him to leave just before breaking into the first team

That's just a good ol' fashion run of  bad luck. Even if just two of those things went our way, say Ramsey signing and Pogba staying or Fletcher not getting sick and Pogba staying we would've been fine in midfield.

1641~~~
Actually no. I meant a lot of posters on here. Namely Cider, who advocated the signing of Fellaini as he was proven in the Premier League and would provide steel in our midfield.

Herrera basically showed us what an actual midfielder's performance was.

1642~~~

1643~~~
Early days but Herrera looks like the midfielder we've needed forever.  Exciting player with a great attitude.  Fecking love him already!  Gotta feeling he'll be a fan favorite at Old Trafford for many years.

1644~~~
Nothing you wrote changes the fact that it was bad luck to have the 5 situation turn out they way they did.

1645~~~
OK <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I'm just implying that to have that go on for years is not learning from mistakes or reacting to the situation in the best manner. It can be blamed on luck, I wouldn't.

1646~~~
You get the feeling Herrera really wanted to come here, and that makes him far more valuable to the team than a player of equal talent who doesn't have a strong feeling towards the club.

Early days but so far so good.

1647~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you tell 'em gramps! I don't even listen to youtube football background music now..i kind of zone it out.

1648~~~
Berbatov might disagree with you.

1649~~~
Loved that performance, really does bring some positives vibes about this season knowing we have this sort of player in our midfield now. His touch was excellent, in the way he would take the ball from behind him and spin it forward effortlessly in one motion, the through balls were very encouraging and his attitude was absolutely top notch on his first outing for us. It really showed the guy wants to impress, and by Jove did he do so. I was buzzing to see the rest of his game as soon as he took that long range shot early on.

1650~~~
Just managed to watch the full game. He looked great, completely unflustered on the ball. Definitely a big step up from our current crop but can't help feeling that we need a few more like him to get back to the top. I'm looking forward to seeing him against some of the better teams we have in preseason.

1651~~~
berb had the touch to kill the ball, but ander puts the ball exactly where he wants with the first touch, and shapes his body in such a way that it's really hard to predict where the ball will be going

1652~~~
I think Scholes would have a thing or two to say about that.

1653~~~
Great shout. His first touch was probably overlooked over the hundred other qualities he exuded as a midfield titan. 

Hmm True. It's very interesting to watch him right before he calls and gets a ball, he's always looking around him. He's very positionally aware and that's why he can make quick turns. Cleverley once said that he watches a lot of Iniesta and tries to mimic him. Interestingly, Herrera's idol is Iniesta as well and he's modelled his link up play on him. So maybe Clevs can take a good look at Herrera.

1654~~~
Yes exactly what I mean. Stood out a lot of me, how he backs into space and looks around, trying to just get an extra few inches for himself. Very like iniesta.

1655~~~
I think he's going to be quality for us. Really impressed with his vision on the ball and desire to get on it. I think if we can get another proper center midfielder to assist him we will be in business. Fletcher and Cleverley just won't cut it against the top teams. It was strange to see one of our midfielders shoot well early in a game. He seems to have a great understanding with Mata. We can't get to carried away obviously, LA Galaxy were dirt last night but you can only beat what's in front of you. I think we have a special player though and he will improve our play.

1656~~~
Ander Herrera claimed 3 assists in Man United's 7-0 win. More than Carrick, Fellaini, Cleverley, Young and Fletcher combined last season.

1657~~~
He instantly became our best midfielder the day he signed, without even kicking a ball for us. Its telling that we still need a quality player to partner him.

1658~~~
Though I love Herrera and rate him highly, the fact that he's not a global superstar, or played for Spanish National Team, and still managed to walk into a team like Manchester United to instantly become the best midfielder... is quite frankly criminal. I blame Sir Alex for not taking care of the problem and David Moyes for signing someone who just doesn't fit the mould. 

We need one more outstanding midfielder in our team. Vidal is the ultimate muppet's dream, but if not him then someone like Strootman would make our team so much better in an instant!

1659~~~
I know where you are going, but lets be fair if Ander was here last season under "you know who", he would be playing the same ways as those you named there.

1660~~~
I wonder how much of the next match he'll play. He played a full 90 minutes and in under three days has to play again? I don't think so. It's too early into pre-season for that.

I think we'll see Fletch and Clevs take up the central role, with Herrera maybe coming in the second half.

1661~~~
Didn't Fletcher play ninety minutes too?

1662~~~
No he would have got stats under moyes, the same way rooney and mata managed to score even under moyes. Quality shows.

1663~~~
That's not normally how preseason works - it's <i>meant</i> to be about a very intense level of work, to force that fitness rapidly back to peak levels. Besides, he barely seemed to break a sweat in the Galaxy match.

1664~~~
True but you can overdo it as well. We'll be playing a top-class side as well next. Maybe Herrera will play the first half in the next one.

Ahh yes he did. We definitely need reinforcements in that area and fast.

1665~~~
Among those you named, the only one without much United quality is Fellaini (and arguably Young). Not sure what you were trying to prove.

1666~~~
But he didn't name Fellaini?

1667~~~
Half as a CB, though.

1668~~~
He did!

1669~~~
Yup, only two of them played the full 90 mins

1670~~~
*Cough* Cleverley *cough* Yeah, young Tom did his usual 'hiding in plain sight' trick last night, even against opposition that had already given up playing. They basically just let us have the ball for 45 mins and he still managed to fail to make any sort of impact. If we are still considering him as a midfield option I'd be fairly disappointed. Unless the boss can get his hooks into him in the next few weeks and drag out the ability and confidence that is buried deep down there somewhere, then I'd say he should be one of the lads leaving.

1671~~~
I'm fine with a midfield of 3 Herreras. 

Let's go find two more.

1672~~~
Mexico's Miguel Herrera was pretty good in the world cup - like Vidal-lite. He'd also be cheap you figure. Had an impressive engine.

1673~~~
See above <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1674~~~
Would Fellaini work alongside Ander?

1675~~~
more than you think amigo. One main difference is you get less time on the ball in the PL.

1676~~~
To think that he costs less than Filliani!

1677~~~
What do you two think of my Herrera assessment? I have bolded my observations on how he gets into space. Keep in mind, this was written before yesterday's game.
<ul>
<li>Defensive Attributes<ul>
<li>Excellent presser – if van Gaal uses a pressing scheme with United, expect Herrera to play a key component.</li>
<li>Tackling – solid at both standing and sliding tackles. He may not seem like a physical player but the Spaniard definitely likes to get stuck in.</li>
<li>Tactically sound – Herrera was one of the key midfielders when Bielsa coached Athletic Bilbao. Under Bielsa and eventually Valverde, Herrera showcased his tactical nous through his positioning, reading of the game and anticipation which played a key part in him winning tackles.  In 2013/14 season for Bilbao, out of 33 games, Herrera won 75 tackles. Good stats for a player who was initially out of favor due to the transfer saga that past summer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Attacking Attributes<ul>
<li>Very good spatial awareness –<b> Herrera is akin to Fabregas in terms of floating into open spaces to receive the ball from teammates. However, Herrera likes to check into the space the defender is occupying before checking back into open space to receive the pass. His agility and quickness help execute the subtle movements to get some separation from his marker and is the main reason he seems so open when in possession of the ball.</b></li>
<li>Excels at linking play in transition -  If Herrera wasn’t directly setting up his teammates for a potential scoring opportunity, he was opening the door for a teammate to do the same.  Combined with his spatial awareness, Herrera’s more direct style of passing encourages his teammates ahead of him to make runs into more dangerous spaces to open up the opposition.  More often than not, he will find them.</li>
<li>Speed of thought – Due to Bilbao’s pressing, it wasn’t uncommon to recover possession in higher areas.  Herrera has a good eye for the pass but can also execute the idea quickly before the passing lane is closed.  A facet of his game which plays a part in why he was good at initiating Bilbao’s attacks or keeping certain attacks alive.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

1678~~~
I've just got to stage now where i just want to sign someone else better than what we have, doesn't even have to be Vidal, Carvalho or Khedira will do - 1 of those 2 and Herrera, i would have took that if someone said back in May that's who we are going to sign in that area, would make it no longer weak anymore and would give our midfield more a 'big club' looking midfield with Carrick there aswell fighting for his place.

1679~~~
Wonderful number 8. Now it's time to find the more defensively oriented CM to pair with him.

1680~~~
I think someone like Strootman would be ideal.

1681~~~
Watching the game again, I think I was unfair giving him an 8, he deserved a 9.

1682~~~
I think he's always had a DM behind him, but it would make sense in that he has the all-around skills to play as one of two with Herrera in the 3-4-1-2, then if//when we go back to 4-3-3 we could play:

-------------Herrera--
Strootman-----------
------Carrick/Long-Term-Replacement

and Herrera would be free to press and look to play through balls.

Assuming Van Gaal rates Carrick as a DM (as his comments seemed to indicate), and with the shift to 3-4-1-2, the logical thing would seem to be to get an all-around CM now and then sign a top DM prospect to learn from, compete with and in a season or two, overtake Carrick.

1683~~~
I dont agree with that, as "the one whose name is not spoken" only takes 33% of the blame, the rest was SAF and the players. Not many managers can make a midfield that horrible play anywhere near decent. They were simply incapable of being creative.

1684~~~
Heard some of his interviews. Speaks great English, fantastic attitude. Just radiates confidence and winning mentality. Would make a great captain someday, especially as he is likely to play every game.

1685~~~
Calm it.

1686~~~
How can I? I'm a supporter of the most powerful and richest club in the world, led by a man who could sign anybody at any time for any price. My preseason optimism has no budget <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1687~~~
I wasn't that impressed with him at all at Bilbao,

But ill happily be proven wrong! Dear god yesterday...

1688~~~
Miguel Herrera is the mexican coach. Showed a nice engine though on the touchline. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

You are thinking of Hector Herrera.

1689~~~
really? I only heard rave reviews about him, heck several pundits said he was their star player? :/

he was immense, if he plays like that for us all season we will go places for sure!

1690~~~
After the Bilbao game I used to say that we should rush in and buy their CM (Javi Martinez-Ander Herrera). The combined fee would have costed us around the 75m mark however it could be done (both players had minimum fee clauses) and it would have sorted our CM for good. The response to that was very poor as many resorted to rehashed MUTV opinions such as 'no one can replace Paul Scholes', 'this is Ando's year' and 'Basque players hate Manchester' BS.

Its kind of sad that we refused to take that option because those are two excellent players who had been playing together for quite some time

1691~~~
Hererra to me has a touch of Scholes about him.

1692~~~
And his partnership with Javi Martinez was breathtaking. They dominated us throughout the two legs.

1693~~~
You know that we refused? There is a very good chance that Martinez was always Bayern bound.

1694~~~
Considering our lack of transfer activity in CM during the last SAF's years I doubt that we really made any attempt to be honest. SAF placed alot of hope in our CM. In his biography he claimed that Clev was as good as Thiago Alcantara.

1695~~~
Wasn't there rumours that Sir Alex tried more than once to get Thiago but Guardiola wanted it to be a loan deal?

1696~~~
How often did you watch him? More often then not, whenever I watched him he played really well. Was one of the top midfielders in the league after the big two teams.

1697~~~
I don't know however he did wrote in his autobiography that he rated Cleverley at par with Thiago

1698~~~
Martinez played as a defender in those games iirc, it was De Marcos, Herrera, and Iturraspe in midfield. One of the best team performance I've seen against United, they were brilliant.

1699~~~
What a wonderful man he is!

Not only his play but is such a role model apart from it too. I am sure SAF would have signed Herrera if he was still here if he ever signed a CM.

1700~~~

1701~~~
Ohh geez <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Even Cleverleys form before his injury against Bolton he was still no way near Thiago's level.

1702~~~
I watched him pretty much every week, after EPL noons its La Liga evenings baby!

I always found his passing pretty damn sloppy. he would make a good capture, dribble and then give such an insanely sloppy pass. Nothing like we saw yesterday. He was good, but nothing really special like people made him out to be. But thats the thing with most players, you cannot show your true potential unless you have players around you that match you.

Put Messi at Bilbao and he wouldn't score 50 also. maybe its the same for him. Maybe its not him making the bad passes, but its them making no runs or not walking into created space. Who knows, but like i said ill gladly be proven wrong.

1703~~~
Scholes was the best at this; receiving the ball in tight spaces, surrounded by numerous tight markers, and somehow his first touch gave him the room to get off an accurate pass or a rasping shot. In the current squad though, for sure Ander trumps the rest.

1704~~~
Literally came in this thread then to talk about his willingness to receive the ball with pressure on him. He still asks for it when there is one or two players on him which is just fantastic as it means we have a free player or two. Makes such a difference to the amount of space and options available on the field.

1705~~~
In future when teams do well against us in a single game, we should immediately buy their players, whether or not they are willing to sell, and regardless of any previous form. That would show real wisdom.

1706~~~
Wasnt he voted into the team of the season or so and has the stats to back him up? It's the first time I hear that about his passing

1707~~~
It worked with Ronaldo so you're theory is absolutely spot on

1708~~~
I might be blinkered by the fact I have wanted United to sign Herrera since last summer but I disagree with this. I watch La Liga too and every time I watched Herrera he impressed me. I can't claim to have watched Herrera on a weekly basis, Bilbao's games weren't generally big enough for Sky Sports in England to show them that often. However, Herrera played well in all the big games I saw him in e.g. Athletic vs Barcelona, Athletic vs Sevilla. I would never characterise his passing as sloppy. He gave the ball away a bit sure, but to my eyes that was because he tended to try risky/difficult passes more than anyone else in the Athletic team.

He had great stats last season e.g.



Although he didn't manage to make the La Liga team of the year. The Athletic players that got in were Laporte and Iturraspe (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.lfp.es/noticias/el-once-ideal-de-la-liga-bbva" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>). Iturraspe would be perfect for us. With Mata at #10, Herrera at #8, and Iturraspe at #6 we would play tremendous football. My first choice #6 to play with Ander would be Javi Martinez, but that's fantasy football whereas Iturraspe is gettable. Yes, we'd have to trigger the release clause and after taking Herrera would need to be careful because if we upset Bilbao they could use the tax issue to bog down the transfer and make it hard to complete. But Iturraspe and Herrera at United with Mata would be mouthwatering. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1709~~~
Ha! Nice one... though actually Ronaldo was well known as one of the biggest young talents before that game... even if it was a call to action.

1710~~~
He's rumoured to have a release clause of around €40m.

1711~~~
I remember this place after the two Bilbao legs in 2012. It was full of posts like "Don't care what it takes, just sign Herrera." "Keep dreaming, we're never getting him but he'd be perfect."

Now he's ours. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1712~~~
I don't know if I can recall a better all round team performance then when Bilbao beat us at Old Trafford.

1713~~~
Barça beating Madrid 5-0 at Camp Nou on November 29 2010 was footballing perfection. But in terms of teams winning at Old Trafford, that was impressive from Bilbao.

1714~~~
Yeh, I remember watching when Bilbao did us just thinking, I'm not even upset, this is just a great side and fully deserve to be beating us and beating us well. They were fantastic.

1715~~~
Bollocks, SAF just put too much faith in players he was fond of. Giggs / Fletcher / Anderson / Cleverley was not a midfield fit the CL or premier league champions, I think he almost grew too close to the players, and in the end couldn't make the hard decision of cutting them. He forever thought Anderson would come good, he had the money but never wanted to upgrade.

1716~~~
Shame about the La Liga team but I knew he was one of the better players in La Liga last year.
I have not heard of Iturraspe but sounds like the player we need

1717~~~
Well I didnt know him if that helps

1718~~~
My bad, winning at Old Trafford was what I meant.

1719~~~
We were lucky to only concede twice De Gea made countless saves.

1720~~~
No worries. Bilbao under Bielsa were tremendous that season, but Ajax beat united at Old Trafford too that season, so as good as Bilbao were, perhaps United weren't great too.

1721~~~
100%. Could have been 6 or 7 easily in my opinion.

1722~~~
Definitely, I remember them pressing Barcelona to death that season and they won 1-0 with Herrera scoring the goal.

We didn't seem to take the Europa league seriously but take nothing away they deserved the win Bilbao in particular played us off the park.

1723~~~
So, anyone know why he has his first name on his shirt along with his last?

1724~~~
I was the same, I wasn't even upset (partly because it the Europa league) but was just left in awe of their football. One of the best displays I've ever seen from an opposition at Old Trafford.

1725~~~
Probably because Herrera is a common last name in the Spanish speaking countries. Still, Ander Herrera written on the back of a T-shirt looks very weird.

1726~~~
Agüera would be interesting <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1727~~~
But isn't his last name Aguera? Wiki lists him as Ander Herrera Agüera, does that make Herrera his mother's maiden name?

1728~~~
We're trying to hack the United email system to find out about Vidal, not hack Ander's bank account.

1729~~~
This name uses <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spanish naming customs</a>; the first or paternal <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">family name</a> is <i>Herrera</i> and the second or maternal family name is <i>Agüera</i>.

According to wiki.

1730~~~
I am not saying that. I am only saying that quality players who did well with us should be given a second and third look. I've followed these two players for quite some time and they looked much better then our players. Unfortunately we kept insisting on 'Basque players never leave Spain' and the 'No one can replace Paul Scholes' BS which costed us alot in the past years

1731~~~
Apparently that's a myth. Our interest was established a good while before that game.

In other news, buying players who have great games against us would result in such footballing greats as Alfonso Alves and Michael Mifsud (I think <a class="username" data-user="4448, @devilish" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4448/">@devilish</a> suggested we should be interested in the latter at some point) ending up on our books.

1732~~~
Anyway, in terms of Bilbao players we should have signed ages ago I remember Muniain being the muppet target of choice. Herrerra didn't get nearly as much redcafe love.

1733~~~
What I am saying is that considering how shit our CM was and how our players were owned by Herrera/Martinez then the latter players should have been given a second and a third look. Instead we seem to have opted not to tackle the CM issue at all. Lets face it Cleverley was as good as Thiago and no one could replace Paul Scholes right?

1734~~~
This is very true, and to be fair as good as Herrera was against us, I think he was sort of outshone by Susaeta, Munain, and De Marcos in the games against us. You could see the talent of course but Herrera wasn't the stand out when we played Bilbao. 

Thinking back to the initial CAF reaction to Ander and Javi Martinez, who at the time I had to argue constantly was actually a centre midfielder, its amazing to think what our midfield would be like if we'd signed them both. Glass half full rather than half empty I suppose. Better to have one of them than neither as we learned last season.

1735~~~

pg 112-113

Prior to the OShea incident, Manchester United had not approached neither player or agent. They simply sent a scout and involved Ronaldo's name in a conversation with Sporting (which was normal practice between United and its so called 'sattelite' clubs). During the OShea-Ronaldo game, SAF ordered Kenyon to talk to him during the half time and he told him. "We wont be leaving the ground before we signed him up"

That does look the type of knee jerk reaction you may frown about

1736~~~
Is that really a quote from Fergie's book? He needs to sack his editor.

1737~~~
I doubt he would have been worse then Ashley Young to be honest.

1738~~~
I told Albert our kitman "Get up to that director's box and get Kenyon down at half time". I told Peter "We're not leaving this ground until we've got that boy signed"

"is he that good" Kenyon asked

"John OShea ended up with a migraine" he said "Get him signed"



word by word

1739~~~
So? None of that is inconsistent with my point that we were interested in Ronaldo before that game and it's fecking daft to sign players purely on the basis of one good performance against us.

1740~~~
Not exactly.

We heard about him, we sent a scout as part of the Sporting-Man United satellite team deal and we had a conversation with Sporting regarding selling the player. However we never really initiated any deal and we have never talked to either player or agent. Real negotiations started during (or slightly after) that game.

1741~~~
Right on, thanks.

1742~~~
So we were interested in signing him before he played agains us. Which was my point. You're making this much harder work than it needs to be...

1743~~~
Let me be clear

SAF knew about a boy called Ronaldo before Queroz suggested him HOWEVER we only sent a scout after Queroz suggestions. When the scout returned we  limited ourselves in involving Ronaldo in a conversation with Sporting. We never placed a bid or involved the player/agent.

What kickstarted the deal was the OShea incident. At that point SAF refused to leave the ground until we had him signed. During that day we learnt that Real had bidded 8 million for him and SAF instructed to place a 9m bid for him.

My impression is that we had basic knowledge about the guy but we were never really interested in him. We didn't even knew that Real had placed an 8 million bid for him. Things changed drastically after Ronaldo humiliated OShea

1744~~~
Woodwards masterplan to get customers to spent an extra £5 on each shirt in the Megastore.

Genius.

1745~~~
Maybe i'ts got something to do with the fact that is father was a known footballplayer to, and there are about 50 other footballplayers with that last name.

1746~~~
It's also more than anyone at Bayern (Ribery and Lahm - 6 each). Entirely depends on the playing style of the team. Herrera and Iturraspe attempted 352 long balls between them - Athletic are more of a long ball team, which also contributes to their low pass completion rates.

1747~~~
Herrera also created 53 chances for his team mates last season (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/player/131481/ander-herrera" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>).

1748~~~
As an Herrera enthusiast in last year's transfer thread, I'll rehash some of my thoughts about him. Apologies.

Despite his Spanish skills, he's more like a classic PL box-to-box midfielder than the kind of positional specialists La Liga fans (including Athletic's) and Del Bosque prefer. He's not a Busquets or a Xavi type. He's not got the grace of an Iniesta or even an Isco. There are some similarities to Xabi Alonso, but he's far too devoted to attacking to play the kind of role Xabi now plays.

He likes to see the ball, he likes to run, he likes to try and make things happen. He plays with his head up, and he tries to respond to his teammates, whether they want the ball or they want someone to pass to. When his teammates are playing well, he usually just blends in, keeping the ball moving, acting as support. Even there though he gets criticised for impatience and trying to force things, he can play with restraint but he loses something when he does.

The times when he's stood out have been in the hard games, particularly when they needed a goal or needed to keep an opponent pushed back. That's when his energy and willingness suddenly makes him look like a special player, particularly when some players start to fade or hide. Now, to me, I think that's ideal for us. As fans I reckon we'll love that side of his game. Hopefully LvG can find a way to channel it, so it always works for us. He seems like an intelligent player, it should be the perfect marriage. I hope.

Meanwhile - what's not to love <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

I wouldn't read so much into that. I assume now he is at United he will start getting Spain cap's. Basque players are overlooked in Spain a lot. Not to mention the quality of players in front of him and the quality of players who didn't even get into the World Cup squad. All you should judge him on is his ability and how he uses it on the pitch.

1750~~~
Seems like he'll work really well with Vidal <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/><img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1751~~~
There's no argument that he is an excellent player - I'm just suggesting that you have to be a little careful to use statistics in an appropriate context. (This coming from a renowned quoter of statistics.)

1752~~~
I don't know if I agree that Basques are overlooked by Spain <a class="username" data-user="72374, @JaffyJoe" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/72374/">@JaffyJoe</a> but I agree that Herrera's inability to get into the Spain side needs to be contextualised. A lot of players who deserved to be in Spain's Brazil 2014 squad weren't e.g. Atletico's Gabi and Athletic's Iturraspe. Del Bosque chose to stick with his favourites for the World Cup, admittedly with disastrous consequences. Still, even if Del Bosque keeps doing this there aren't many top class midfield players who could make the Spanish squad.

Spain's midfield has been tremendously strong for the last six years, and the depth they have in Herrera's position is frightening. How many midfielders in the Premier League would actually get into the Spain squad? Maybe Yaya Toure. That's about it.

Players who regularly boss the Premier League like Ramsey couldn't dream of displacing the likes of Iniesta. Matic was a revelation for Chelsea but would he get in the Spain squad ahead of Thiago, Alonso or Busquets? Just because Herrera is yet to make the Spain team it does not mean he isn't significantly better than most Premier League midfielders. He is, and he'll prove it this season. If Herrera were English he'd be our first choice first XI midfielder.

1753~~~
I don't rate him anywhere near as highly as you do but yeah that's a great summary of the type of player he is. As a rival fan, I expect him to be a player that will be become a fan favourite at Utd, and will be a success, but without quite hitting the very top level.

1754~~~
The only thing Spain has lacked in a world class striker, which has rarely hampered them. 

So I'd have to say that Aguero, van Persie and Suarez (if we're talking last season) would make Spain's squad.

They could also use a goalkeeper, though De Gea may be the one.

1755~~~

1756~~~
What?! Freaking portuguese clubs!

1757~~~
Hector <b>Miguel</b> Herrera <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

1758~~~
Poor lad will have to partner one of our current average bunch next season.

1759~~~
We really missed the boat not signing David Bentley when he scored the hattrick against us.

1760~~~
If it's a myth then it's one that SAF started because I heard him say as much in an interview on MUTV many years ago.

1761~~~
That is the only concern I have about him for the season ahead, other than carrick there isn't really anyone else who can compliment his game or of any real quality but hopefully van gaal will address that with a new signing or two, personally don't think we can afford to wait for strootman to be fit and available and there are plenty of players out there who could improve our midfield.

1762~~~
Looks like a good lad, sensible hairstyle, a talented player and wears black Adidas boots. He's my favourite United player already.

1763~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the black boots put him in my top 5 before he kicked a ball.

1764~~~
Ungrateful fans like you have forgotten that under SAF, we have not been outside of top places in the PL, always competitive domestically and in Europe. Players are there to take instructions, hence a good/great manager is so important for success or not. Great managers get the best out of players. Not sure you ever get involved in sports in team sports or just an armchair critic. But you won't speak of a manager/coach's role in this fashion if you have the right knowledge! Athletes will never excel <b>just </b>by having talent and physique when you want to win (not to lose) competitively. Training regime and mental strength (spurred by manager) are keys.

1765~~~
It was obviously tongue in cheek

1766~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's a big plus point for me. Used to be that the special players were coloured boots. In a world where cloggers are wearing neon, the special players are the ones in black. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

He doesn't wear black boots.

Looks black enough for me.

You have to appreciate most fans these days live and breathe the transfer windows. Signing top players is what its all about not developing what you have......<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

1770~~~
Doesn't make them better fans than me and some though. lol 
Besides, since when United is a club which is habitually signing top players to sustain? Name all the legends we have who were top players when they arrived at OT, helped us win things, and become legendary? Name them! Please <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1771~~~
For those very reasons our fans now yearn for them even more as rivals have emerged and triumphed through muppet transfer activity....

LUCKILY fans don't run the club. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> United were still the winner overall in the past decade when Chelsea and City have deeper pocket than us. We are not changing our transfer market strategy drastically any time soon, mate.

Goodbye, Bebe. We can confirm the forward has joined Portuguese side Benfica in a deal worth up to €3million. United has the right to 50% of any sell-on fee.

1774~~~
No, we didn't.

We insisted on the same CM despite the quality was going to the dogs. Those excuses were being said on MUTV on a regular rate.

Herrera vs LA Galaxy

Morten Gamst Pedersen <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1778~~~
I know it just looks like a simple movement but the awareness at 1.05 to wrap around Mata and let Mata drift inside just opens everything up so nicely and the end result is a goal. Ok, it's a horrible mistake for the goal but the movement from Herrera, while it's still such a basic run, it really does show his intelligence.

1779~~~
Really like him. His passing is excellent and the one touch really pretty too. Fast and he can hold the ball well. Reminds me a lot of Scholes. Very Scholes-esque for sure.

1780~~~
His no Kroos according to Scholes <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1781~~~
Well Scholes is allowed his opinion.

1782~~~
Everytime I see training videos during pre-season him and Mata always seem to be together. Best buddies I guess and De Gea would have joined them if he was an outfield player.

1783~~~
Because Scholes really deserves an eye-roll...

1784~~~
I thought it was a little unfair for him to say that. Scholes is a club legend and rated very highly by Spanish players and for him to say he isn't top quality was
Harsh.

1785~~~
In a way it's good that Scholes says stuff like that. For one, he's right; as good as Herrera is, he's not in the elite rung of central midfielders (yet). For another, we already have enough ex-player ambassadors who parrot official club lines, it's good to have a guy who every now again gives a different opinion. And it all comes from someone who cares about the club; whoever he may or may not upset with his comments, he at least says them because he wants the best for United right.

And besides, in Ander's case, he may use it as extra motivation to prove just how good he is. For all we know Scholesey is a master psychologist who knows exactly how to rile players up, in ways that get maximum performance from them <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1786~~~
Don't worry he will have to eat his words come the end of the season

1787~~~
We've signed Herrera not some average player. Could have said some positive things on the player like when he outplayed us at Old Trafford not his not as good as X and Y. 

While it may be true our need for midfielder to provide some energy and guile is of more need than Kroos.

1788~~~
I disagree with Scholes on Herrera, but like you say it's good that not all ex united players think the sun shines out of Manchester United's backside, and that everything they do is correct.

1789~~~
Scholes is obviously free to say what he wants but on the flip side, people are free to think what they want of his opinion. Seems like quite a few are forgetting that second bit.

1790~~~
Kroos doesn't even come anywhere near the defensive contribution that Herrera puts into his performances.

1791~~~
Except what Scholes really said was Herrera wasn't Kroos quality. Not only was he right, its exactly what you'd expect a very straight talking Scholes to say.

1792~~~
True, and it is nice to see the Spaniards getting along.

But with senior players like Rio/Evra gone (both were great at team building etc) i hope the dressing room doesn't develop clique's, and it is interesting to read LVG's comments about everyone needs to speak in english to each other.

I myself don't think that would happen at United, but it is interesting to play mini-psychologists while we wait for the real matches to start.

1793~~~

1794~~~
Of course. It's just that the eye-roll smiley, implies a kind of 'here we go again, more Scholes nonsense' sentiment that really doesn't seem deserved.

1795~~~
Not a bad game, but a bit quiet.

1796~~~
Get him a midfield partner that isn't Tom Cleverley.

1797~~~
Played a lot deeper than with Fletcher. Fletcher covered the back 5, he had to do this today. Still managed to pull off like 2-3 through balls, one leading to Welbeck's penalty.

1798~~~
Herrera is a real presence in our midfield. He's can really get stuck in. All we need right now is a very good player alongside him and we've got a strong midfield with Mata riding up top.

1799~~~
Played a nice 1-2 with Welbeck that led to the pen but had a quite first half (spectacular goals aside the whole team did tbf). Clearly still need more quality alongside him in midfield.

1800~~~
Different roles my friend. He played further back.

1801~~~
Its hard to get a feel for the likes of him and Shaw without seeing them in a lineup somewhere close to resembling our first choice (which I am sure/hope tonight was not).

1802~~~
We need a Javi Martinez type beside him. Someone comfortable in possession who can read the game well from a deeper position. 

Obviously Martinez isn't happening but that's the type of player we should be looking for. We have enough creativity with Herrera and Mata now we just need someone to help get the best out of them.

1803~~~
He's the best midfielder at the club by miles already.

1804~~~
Yeah, the idea was to let him sit back and allow Cleverley to dictate and show what he is made of. We need him to play further up the pitch though.

1805~~~
Really nice to see his energy, and his first thought seems to be forward. A breath of fresh air.

1806~~~
True for tonight, but if you saw the Galaxy game it was easy enough to get a feel for him, practically a perfect performance from Herrera in that game. Shaw hopefully will settle down and show his quality soon.

1807~~~
Herrera and Carrick would be our first choice pairing (if Carrick was fit). The drop in quality in our second string is just ridiculous. We have no depth in midfield at all.

I agree about Herrera though, obviously. Early days and all but he looks like he'd suit the league as well.

1808~~~
Thos what worries me the most about our midfield. If Herrera has an average game, we are left playing without midfielders unless mata or Rooney drop deeps. Hopefully, we get two more addition in this part of the field. One being a number 6 (William Carvalho, Strootmam, or Ruben loftus Cheeks) and the other being a number 8 to provide competition for Herrera (Mateo Kovacic or Oliver Torres).

I do not rate our current midfielders beside maybe Carrick and Powell.

1809~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> Very inexperienced, totally unproven, and Chelsea wouldn't sell us one of their best youngsters anyway.

1810~~~
Didn't have the best of games today, made some sloppy passes, and touch was a bit off, but what I like about him is that he continued to be adventurous.

1811~~~
Thought he did quite well, played some nice through balls (though quite a few were overhit). I feel like he'd be a lot better with a great midfielder partnering him, I saw Herrera having to take over a lot of the defensive duties in the time he was on.

1812~~~
I consider both of these players to be more box to box players than holding ones. Plus, Loftus Cheek is way too inexperienced. Has he even played in the EPL yet?

1813~~~
Agreed. If you want Strootman then you might as well try for Vidal too, the former is no more defensive than the latter.

1814~~~
I was thinking that he should be utlized as a squad player till he is rippened. I agree with the latter that Chelsea would not sell him to us anyways. It is just my wishlist.

Use Cheeks and Carrcik has our number 6, until we get Strootman in January. The standard in our midfield is at league 2 level if you seen their performances last season. Herrera alone will not be enough to fix this area. 

Strootman(Carrick/Cheeks) - Herrera(Kovacic/ Powell)

Strootman can play both role. He is positionally responsible in his defensive duty, so he is capable of playing the number 6 role(the number he wears on his back). He might even be more suited in that role as he does not have the consistant key passing ability a number 8 like Herrera has. He is good at keeping the ball circulating and reading the game which are attribute that can thrieve in he number 6 role. Cheeks is bought for cover and potential.

1815~~~
Exactly, unless LVG wants to play two box to box midfielders, knowing that one of the centre back's can step out of defence and cover? I personally would want a more defence minded midfielder next to Herrera.

1816~~~
Herrera did look sloppier and misplaced a number of long passes, but what I liked was that he was still adventurous with his game. Plus, he continued to demonstrate a good amount of energy even under those conditions.

What's obvious, however, is that Herrera needs a partner who's defensively solid. Someone who can sit back and screen the defence will suit Herrera massively. Basically, a fitter, more energetic Carrick will be good for us at this point. Two box-to-box midfielders will only work if our full backs develop their defensive nous and our central defenders never step up and get forward.

1817~~~
<a class="username" data-user="76997, @Amadaeus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/76997/">@Amadaeus</a>, it's Cheek not Cheeks, mate.

1818~~~
I'd rather develop and refine Pearson rather than get Loftus-Cheek and do what we could have done to Pearson to Loftus-Cheek.

1819~~~
I haven't seen the games just the goals so is this lad the answer to all our problems?

1820~~~
Cheek ceiling is much higher than Pearson. But, I agree that developing Pearson is a great idea considering Carrick is not getting any younger. Cheek is versatile and can play both role, so the two could be a future partnership for England. Their is room for both.

1821~~~
There was nothing really knew from this game, he's obviously a class or 2 above everyone else we have there, but it's also obvious we need a more defensive midfielder to partner him. Carrick if he gets his form back could be an option, same with fletcher, but I'm not sure if you can rely on either really during a whole season. There's nobody we could have signed to fix all our problems as we blatantly needed 2 midfielders.

1822~~~
I didnt see the full game but I heard he did well. Good to see someone performing right from their debut, but still just 1 game in which we breezed through.

1823~~~
No, it's really not.

1824~~~
I thought he was playing the exact same role unless you are saying that because we had Clev on the pitch he was told to be more defensive.

1825~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1826~~~
Was OK (rather than stellar) today - he had a different more defensive role today. The change in altitude and heat affected most of our still-not-fit players.

1827~~~
I think today's performance showed why I don't want Vidal to come in, or another midfielder of his type. We need someone to sit in front of the back three and take the defensive pressure off Herrera - allow him to flourish with the freedom to go forward. Fletcher provided that, Cleverley didn't, Vidal for £40m+ wouldn't be the wisest option either.

1829~~~
That player is Ander Iturasspe who plays for Bilbao

1830~~~
What's his buyout clause?

1831~~~
Wasn't quite finding his range tonight but got stuck in and tracked back well.

Does any of this matter when he is called Ruben loftus Cheeks? The name alone is reason enough to buy him!

1832~~~
Not sure what his buy-out is but reuniting Ander with Ander would be perfect for our midfield.

1833~~~
40M Euros.

1834~~~
€40m is the buyout clause for Ander Iturasspe. I'm guessing you've seen more of him than me, is he worth it?

1835~~~
Cheers.

1836~~~
He would be worth it, brilliant player.

1837~~~
Better than Martinez?

1838~~~
Martinez is a more established player right now but I believe Iturasspe has the potential to reach a similar level if given the stage to showcase his talent

1839~~~
Perfect opportunity for him if Bilbao can qualify for the group stages in the champions league.

1840~~~
Nah he's not worth that fee. He's a great player though, and in my view better than Ander (over the last two seasons at least), but Ander was closer to the type of player you need.

Reaching Javi Martínez's level is far too ambitious, they're the same age.

1841~~~
Vidal, defensive, is better than Fletcher. Vidal also offers a lot more going forward and in build up process. I strongly disagree with having anchor who's sitting in front of defense. That would limit attacking options with 4 idle players. Having player like that can be useful, thats why I wouldn't mind De Jong as backup/flexibility in formations.

1842~~~
I thought he was immense yesterday, a proper midfielder.  Must be great for the other guys to know they can give him the ball and not worry about him losing it under pressure.  We absolutely need a good partner for him though.

1843~~~
Think he averaged around 80% passing if im correct, which is pretty damn low for a spanish midfielder in his position where its very risky to make sloppy passes.

1844~~~
It's probably got something to do with the fact that he attempted the most through-balls last season.

1845~~~
Anyone can get 95%+ passing accuracy if all you do is pass sideways. Herrera tries a lot of risky passes to open up space.

1846~~~
His long passing needs work. He tends to fire them rather than float them like Scholes/Rooney. It hurts his accuracy.

1847~~~
Firing them is more likely to catch the opponents out of position while floating them allows the opposition to get into the right positions to deal with the danger.

1848~~~
Yep if we're going by stats Cleverley is one of the best passers in Europe.

1849~~~
In theory, yes. But Rooney's cross-field balls are almost always dangerous. 

It's impossible to be completely accurate over a long distance anyway. If it were, you'd see a lot more goals scored from 30+ yards out. 3 or 4 degrees out at the point of passing can turn into 5+ yards at the point of reception, even before allowing for wind. Long passes need to take into account a margin for error as well as giving the receiving the player a chance to control it. It's a technique Herrera can learn, though.

1850~~~
Herrera is best at short/medium range passing. 

We'll benefit hugely if whoever we sign to partner him has a good passing range. Strootman is the best and most realistic option his always playing those switch passes but can also split defences.

1851~~~
He played mainly as an attacking midfielder last season so his job was to do the risky passes constantly, hence his accuracy being low. Pass % anyways means next to nothing, as you can be like Cleverley and never risk anything, or like Herrera and do plenty of through balls and quick passes that have the risk of not working out, but also is what makes goalscoring chances.

For example, Koke had a slightly lower pass accuracy then him even, at 80.5 according to whoscored. He's a very good passer just different positions require more risks.

1852~~~
We are 2 signings away from this

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/q9guEqp4AE/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

1853~~~
While I agree that Vidal is better defensively than Fletcher, they're different type of players. I'm not sure having two box-to-box midfielders would get the best out of either of them as both will have defensive duties. Would rather someone come in and take care of most defensive duties and allow Herrera to concentrate on going forward.

1854~~~
3. Strootman as backup. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1855~~~
I didn't make it, but the first 11 is boss.

1856~~~
You shouldn't compare Rooney's long passing to Scholes - Scholes was miles better. Like Gerrard, Rooney's long passes are too lofty. Scholes did in fact often fire them, just with incredible accuracy, and at times making the ball stop once it hit the ground when called for. Not even Xavi is close to Scholes in terms of long passing.

1857~~~
How about that Scholes/Keane partnership? They were both 'box to box', even though you can say Scholes was playmaker and Keane was enforcer. Hererra's job shouldn't be 'going forward'. His job is linking defense with attack. The fact he's good going forward is just a bonus. Vidal's main job would be providing cover for Hererra and <i>then </i>joining attack if needed.

1858~~~
You don't have to tell me, mate! I'm the guy who argued that Scholes is the 3rd best player in the last 20 years. Love him to bits.

1859~~~
Scholes-Keane was in a 4-4-2. In a 3-4-1-2 when there are two centre-forwards and a number 10 that are central and attacking, do we really need two more midfielders centrally to add to the attack when we're going forward? I'm not sure.

1860~~~
You still compared them <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

He was an incredible player; his long range passing really was something else. Liverpool supporters who think Gerrard's is better are mentally disturbed.

Probably the one United player from the past that I would most want back at United as a youngster, then Giggs.

1861~~~
First off:

- SAF didn't coach, he managed. So if you want to give credit for the way United played then give it to Queiroz, Sven and Meulensteen.
- Fans, staff and SAF knew for years that our midfield was dramatic, and that for many years we needed a large amount of transfers to make a team able to compete for the upcoming years. SAF failed to fix this problem year after year due his stubbornness to pay the "modern" prices in the transfer market while still splashing insane amounts of money on extremely mediocre players.
- SAF has done fantastic in his time at United, but don't act like no other manager could do the same. When have you ever seen Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich etc fail to achieve the same when they actually rotated managers every 2-3 years?
- <b>SAF WAS THE PERSON TO SELECT MOYES. Without  a cause there is no action/result.
</b>
Second:

- How is Moyes to blame for the countless personal mistakes of our defenders?
- How is Moyes to blame for Wayne Rooney completely messing up countless chances in big matches?
- RvP/Nani/Kagawa being injured during internationals?

Its so easy to blame Moyes for everything now that hes gone, but it wasn't and we all know that even tough we tend to blame it all on him. Moyes was given an unbearable task to sign 5-6 players in a very short window of time and turn around a squad which was destined to fail. The only reason we ended first and not 5th the season before Moyes already was purely RvP carrying the entire teams ass like crazy during our shocking displays for 75% of the season.

1862~~~
Well, in 4-4-2, you usually have 2 defenders back whole time, so not sure why do you think playing with two 'b2b' midfielders would be too attacking.
Formation is irrelevant, it's all about shape. Eh, you could argue it's the same thing, but anyway, you already have 3 central defenders who are not going anywhere, they will sit deep all the time. Then you have another midfielder to protect them, like you said, to sit back and brake attacks. That leaves United with 4 idle players, doing nothing offensively, and that's very bad when you have to attack with 6 against 9 men behind the ball, which is doomed to fail pretty much every time. Also, defensively you lose nothing with number '10' on the pitch, because he'll help defense as well. Whole point of this, it doesn't matter what you're best at, it matters how you do when you get specific task. Everything else is a bonus. Vidal is excellent in defense, his part would be to protect defense and midfield, just like he's doing it at Juventus, shielding old man Pirlo, and I think we all know how influential Pirlo can be when allowed freedom.

1863~~~
Nah, honestly I believe the altitude or heat made a difference. Mata was missing pretty much all of his cross field balls too, and he is usually bob on. Against LA Galaxy Herrera hit a few switch passes which were perfect accuracy. 

For whatever reason against Roma players mishit a lot of passes. I think we will see in the next game it will be fine.

1864~~~
Ye i guess, but someone at his position shouldn't always risk that. Iniesta/Xavi/Modric all do the same and still have 90+ passing.

1865~~~
Bilbao doesn't play with a AM's.

1866~~~
They do with Valverde in charge.

1867~~~
They did last season, Herrera the season before played as a central midfielder but last season he was very much an attacking midfielder.

1868~~~
Its becoming difficult to believe your claim that you watched Herrera week in week out last year. Its very common knowledge that Valverde changed Bielsa's system. In fact, when the Herrera deal got made public, people on the caf were debating whether signing 'another number 10' was a good idea. The fact you claim Bilbao don't use attacking midfielders makes me wonder just how much you saw of them in 2013/14.

From what I have seen of Herrera I've every confidence he'll be a star for us once the Premier League begins. The claims you make about his sloppiness, as I said, I've never seen with my own eyes. Van Gaal has already declared that, along with Shinji and Mata, Herrera is the best passer at Man Utd. Given Van Gaal gave players like Xavi and Iniesta their debuts at Barcelona, I'd say the manager's a good judge of passing ability too.

Herrera takes risks with the ball but that's not a bad thing. Top class midfielders need to have courage, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes had a long discussion about this before and after we lost to City. Sometimes you need to have the guts to gamble if you're gonna win big. Herrera has <i>that</i> in him and it will be a help not hinder United as we try to get back to where we belong: at the top of English football.

What silly and clueless post coming from a Moyes apologist! Especially the two highlighted parts. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So we need to add 5-6 players to the 2013 title winning team, haha good joke. All we really needed last season was 2 CM's and a left back, Your homeboy Moyes couldn't even get Baines to hand in a transfer request and flopped on Coentrao as well. Moyes also bidded for Fabgregas weeks after Barcelona let Thiago go, why on earth didn't he bid earlier? Was he that stupid, that he thought a team like Barca would sell 2 top centre mids in 1 transfer window. Why did he buy Mata in 2014? It's because he was clueless and had no idea what he was doing. Let me give you a list on how many players your Deity dithered on last summer, De Rossi, Khedria, Fabregas, Thiago, Baines and Coentrao. Yep not his faut, ffs/ 

The second part is just as funny! RVP won us the league? If you take RVP's goals away , we still would have won the Premier League, assuming you take away every other teams top scorer as well (which is fair)

1870~~~
Lol, so when we didn't buy De Rossi, Khedria, Fabregas, Thiago, Baines and Coentrao it's Moyes fault but when we didn't buy Kroos, Vidal, Di Maria it's not LVG's fault? Unfair that.

1871~~~
Some people forget who exactly was the player with a best passing accuracy in top european leagues like 3 years ago. That was Leon Britton. Yep, in front of Xavi and everybody else. Pretty much speaks for itself, this fact.

1872~~~
Herrera has looked good from what I've seen so far. Nice skills, good vision, and not afraid to take players on. Think we might have a winner here.

1873~~~

1874~~~
Wow, what a load of rubbish!
Seeing that you're from the Netherlands, you probably started to support United when RvP joined United. Were you a goober before he joined us? lol
By the sound of it, you did not rate Sir Alex and regarded him as not knowing much about football. Can't take you seriously. My serious question to you is: did you cry when Moyes was sacked? Are you still crying? lol

1875~~~
If you're talking about the couple of diagonals out towards Valencia, there was a pretty clear altitude thing going on there. Over long distances the ball moves quite differently in such thin air, which is why it beat Valencia by exactly the same distance with both passes. Mata had the same problem a couple of times, as did a number of Roma players with those long balls looking for Destro. Wouldn't read anything into it, as it's not a problem I've ever seen him have at normal altitude.

1876~~~
Oke to be fair, i don't watch Bilbao's full match every week, who does. I mean i follow la liga every week very closely and if Madrid/Barca plays i always prioritize it above anyone. The thing is, most people see everyone who is creative and in midfield as a 10. Valverde always played with a 3 man midfield with Itu as CDM and 2 CMs in front of it. Herrera being the most attacking one in most cases specially when he brought in the other defensive guy in big matches (forgot his name). But that doesn't mean Herrera is a CAM lol. Its like saying Iniesta is a CM just because hes there on paper in a 433.Or saying Rooney was a CAM under moyes (like every website suggested).

And Herrera takes risk, i know its awesome that he tries. But he doesn't have the experience to know when not to risk. Im the type of guy who doesn't care where the ball is lost, as long as it is lost. because that means the opponent gets his chance to recover and build up again.

1877~~~
How old are you? Because either your a 5 yr old kid, or you are a 35 yr old who thinks hes cool for acting like internet youth nowadays.

I don't give a shit about Moyes, never did and always disliked him. But i got a fecking brain and i don't blame a sole person for an entire season of madness when there is obviously 11 players on the field failing, an entire staff not going against him, a board who signed him and a legendary managed who only wanted him as his successor. So stop acting like an idiot and use your brain for once.

By the sound of it i don't rate Sir Alex? Lawl, i think hes the best <b>manager</b> who has ever set foot on this earth. And considering we are starting the radials slurs, but you probably don't know what the feck a manager does and what a real coach is. Open your fecking eyes and look at Louis van Gaal and learn this year. Then you can start talking with the rest of the world and you can start judging if someones strategies are good or bad.

1878~~~
No.
It was all Moyes' fault. We won the league the season before, so we didn't need anything more than minimal, Champion-style ("if it ain't broke...") signings. The team was perfectly balanced and our passing game was superb under Sir Alex.

City and Chelsea were at the top of their respective games, and we still managed to win the league in the most balanced way possible. Had Van Persie joined City instead of us, we'd have replaced not only his goals but his match winning ability, no questions asked - so the whole 'Van Persie carried us' theory is easily debunked.
For example against Southampton, we'd have surely scored the three goals that Van Persie scored to win us the game. It's not like Van Persie's a player who can score goals that others can only dream about. If he wasn't there, somebody else would have been there to score his goals.
We wouldn't have played with ten men after all. We definitely weren't over reliant on him.

Moyes took a perfectly balanced team and completely destroyed it on his own. The warning signs were never there that this side lacks urgency, lacks the ability to control games, and generally lacks balance.
We all know how great and unique Sir Alex is as a manager, but there's no chance that he got way more out of that squad than anyone else could have done. Guardiola would have had Cleverley (for example) playing like Xavi within weeks.

1879~~~
A better example would be the Keane/Ince partership. Worked a treat although in later years Ince was apparently starting to get egoistical and started to disobey SAF's tactical instructions. I can't think of any other midfield duo with both of them being genuine box-to-box players. Fernandinho and Toure are most certainly not a box-to-box midfield duo as most claim. They are both capable of playing such a role but in City's team Fernandinho is the defensive midfielder and Toure is the more attacking one. With the trend of a midfield trio and specialisation of roles (holding mid/midfield metronome/attacking midfielder) genuine box-to-box midielders are rare to find nowdays. I remember Zico and Tostao saying that even Brazil Post 1982 stopped producing/favouring midfielder who could both attack and defend, and started to focus on more specialized midfielders with extra tactical responsibility.

1880~~~
Yet SAF couldn't manage to make him half decent. 

Tbh this whole SAF thing is looking creepy much like a cult nowadays. Everything against him is false, a big lie, crazy and not true (even tough our play has been shockingly bad for the past 3 years and pretty much every analyst has said so also). And everything pro SAF is exaggerated 100x more.

Not going to respond to this anymore, cba discussing with fanboys (extreme fanboys), because there is no point as you are to ignorant to actually understand an argument not in favor of your vision.

1881~~~
Turning nasty, eh! You sounded like you have a twisted brain and unnecessarily lectured other. Why not just answer some simple and straight forward questions instead of sprouting insult?? You still failed to answer my question: Before RvP joined United, were you a gooner? Yes, or no? If no, before RvP joined United, which team did you support? 

If you can't hold a conversation without being nasty, then don't bother to respond.

1882~~~
I'd say he got more out of that squad. A year before toe to toe with real Madrid, a year and 67m later...

No one can get Cleverly to play like Xavi, that's just crazy. However, Cleverly was decent before Moyes, now he's being ridiculed.

Moyes was a poor man manager, SAF was an excellent one, one of his best strengths was extracting the most from his squad.

1883~~~
Im a United fan since 1997 when i got taken to the match Feyenoord-Man United when i was 8 years old because my team won a tournament and this was our reward. Before that, i used to apparently have an Ajax spread on my bed. So no, never ever in my life have i been fan of Arsenal.

And excuse me if i got out of control, but to be fair, i don't see why you would make such statements purely based on my country. And your "did you cry, are you still crying stuff" is purely trying to taunt me to actually get this irritated. Im up for any discussion/debate which is actually a discussion. But when people refuse to even think about an argument and blatantly act like "LALALALA i can't hear you, SAF NEVER DID ANYTHING WRONG" like most around here then whats  the point of a discussion?

At the end of the day, Moyes fecked up, he fecked up hard. I never liked him, and absolutely hated his appointment. But we all know that you cannot blame 1 person for everything that has happened to us last season.

1884~~~
This discussion should be in another thread.

1885~~~
Whoah whoah! Folks' this is the Ander Herrera thread let's discuss him for the love of Pete!

1886~~~
Does anyone know if there were stats measuring passes between Cleverley and Herrera? From my observations, didn't really seemed like they linked up much in that first half passing wise. I'll watch it again but wasn't impressed by some of Cleverley's movements. There were times where he wanted the ball yet his marker was still close to him. Puzzling.

1887~~~
can you point me to the quote where scholes said that about ander? As far as I know, scholes quotes on herrera werent that bad and people just insinuated he was putting down Herrera's quality.

1888~~~
I'm on my phone at the moment so I can't get the link but it said something along the lines of them (Herrera and Shaw) are good players but not the level of Kroos.

1889~~~
Was that the headline or his actual quotes? And okay. just link me when you find it

1890~~~
It was on his paddypower blog if you want to try searching for it. It was just a quote rather than a headline, basically iirc it was just one line saying how shaw and Herrera were good signings but he wants to see united in for kroos as he's better (he spent a while on the same article waxing lyrical about kroos)

1891~~~
Okay thanks.

1892~~~
i think im in love with this guy. saw him on Saturday, granted he didn't have a great game (not saying it was bad, just it was not spectacular) and I think he has great future at this club.

1893~~~
id wank to this line up <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1894~~~
What's funny is his performance against Roma was better than all our midfielders could manage last season.

1895~~~
absolutely  . the gulf in quality was immense.

1896~~~
Just need another quality midfielder beside him and I can see him being one of our most important players.

1897~~~
Yes, it's much better example. Fernandinho was box to box in Shakhtar, and Yaya was defensive midfielder in Barcelona. However, that doesn't mean they'd play in exact roles in their new club, City, and they didn't. Vidal has quality to protect defense and but only that, he's very useful in attack. Keane was box to box as they come, and most of people see him as destroyer. I can't say they are 100% wrong, that was his main job, but he had many other qualities that separated him from generic destroyers such as Gattuso or Makelele.

1898~~~
I'm afraid you're mistaken, again, and its becoming extremely difficult to take seriously your claims to have any real knowledge about Bilbao or Herrera. Herrera was the right sided centre midfielder in Bielsa's system, however Valverde used him as a #10 in a 4-2-3-1. Anyone who watched Bilbao last season would have seen this. In fact Spanish football experts, such as Graham Hunter, say Herrera's early season struggles were down to him learning how to play as a #10 (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/1908047/hunter-herrera-the-right-man-for-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>). Other Spain watchers like Guillem Balague have argued that #10 is Herrera's best position (<a class="externalLink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2109392-ander-herrera-is-well-worth-the-year-long-transfer-wait-for-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>). That is an opinion I disagree with, as does Herrera himself (<a class="externalLink" href="http://imgur.com/a/Y3znq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>), I simply provide these sources as proof that you're wrong to deny Herrera played as a #10 under Valverde.

I'm not going to continue debating with you about Herrera' position. Based on the incorrect claims you've made about Ander, I simply can't believe that you know him as a player like you say you do. If I'm honest, you're coming across as a guy who saw some stats about passing completion on a webpage and decided to set yourself up as an Ander Herrera expert. For example, you talk about Herrera not knowing when to play the killer ball. The image below, courtesy of Sky Sports (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/15115/9369745/manchester-uniteds-signing-of-midfielder-ander-herrera-could-be-the-catalyst-for-louis-van-gaals-change-in-style" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>), shows in 2013/14 Herrera played as many successful through balls as Iniesta though. I take it you think Iniesta has a good understanding of when to play through balls? Therefore we should be able to agree someone who matches Iniesta's success in playing them is doing something right:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://e0.365dm.com/14/07/660x350/ander-herrera-la-liga-manchester-united-feature_3166178.jpg" src="http://e0.365dm.com/14/07/660x350/ander-herrera-la-liga-manchester-united-feature_3166178.jpg"/>

Plus, as we've already discussed, Van Gaal has said Herrera is one of the best passers at United and if anyone should know its him. I'm sure Van Gaal values possession as much as you say you do, if not more.

Ander Herrera is a top class midfielder. He is not sloppy in possession. He does not lack decision making or judgement when on the ball. Is he the finished article? No. However, the criticisms you're making of him are very wide of the mark. I'd be surprised if anyone who has watched Herrera on a regular basis would agree with any of the lines you're trotting out about him actually. The more you claim to know about Ander Herrera the more you come across not knowing much about him at all.

1899~~~
I think he is better than I realised. No doubt he looked classy for Bilbao, but I think until you see him play for your own team you can't fully appreciate somebody. 

It's so nice to see a midfielder confident in their own abilities, and not cared to take somebody on by themselves.

1900~~~
That's ok considering we have been playing without a midfield for a good few years!

1901~~~
I really, really want to see what he could do alongside a quality midfielder, or even a De Jong type holding player. He's been promising despite having to play alongside our midtable midfielders.

1902~~~
Thought he was a bit shit against Roma. Passing was way off. So maybe Van Gaal must be right about the pitch/altitude fecking with their radars? Although that didn't stop Roma/Rooney playing some sweet long passes, so feck knows really.
Funny the way he hasn't had any criticism at all for that performance but an almost identical display from Cleverley earned him dog's abuse.

Well, not funny. It's understandable. People really want him to be a great player for us and his last outing was so encouraging none of us want to consider the possibility that he can't consistently perform at that level. I would have the same mind-set myself. Definite double standards, though. One of my real bug-bears on here. You so rarely see players judged on their performance in a specific game in isolation.

1903~~~
Cleverley has given the ball away 3 times before the break. Herrera was not so good (compared to the LA game) but still miles ahead of Cleverley.

1904~~~
Where have i said im some kind of Herrera expert, i don't follow him at all specifically? All i said was i follow La Liga every week and seen a good amount of Bilbao matches and found Herrera to be a sloppy passer at times. Do you also want to show Herrera's passing attempts next to that beautiful number 13?

This forum is getting wildly out of control tbh with people just exploding the second you mention their "new FOTM player".

This is your first link:

"While Herrera's position during parts of the season -- the middle creative player in the line of three in a 4-2-3-1 formation -- was something he found a test, he nonetheless won Valverde's confidence there."

This is your second link:

"So where is Herrera going to play? He’s been used by Bilbao in a number of different positions around the midfield"

This is your conclusion based on these articles:

Herrera was the right sided centre midfielder in Bielsa's system, however Valverde used him as a #10 in a 4-2-3-1. Anyone who watched Bilbao last season would have seen this.

Do you see whats wrong with it? I don't specifically keep tabs on Herrera during the season, hell i couldn't even be bothered with him last season as La Liga got 100 more attracting players to watch. Its like you getting pissed at a guy who says "i watch the BPL every week and seen the top 10 play on a weekly base" then you going nuts because that person doesn't know what the exact position of Ross Barkley was at Everton. You don't care, until it matters to you (aka signed for United or hes a big player, which he wasnt/isnt). All i know is that it stood out to me that his passing was at times really sloppy/taking to much risk and failing. And if people can't say that on this forum anymore, without having to fight off 3 kids who love their new FOTM then really, im done with this website.

Starting to think of it, he actually did this pretty much entire match vs Roma also. With his highest risk pass being the back pass to the keeper which were incredibly stupid to make.

1905~~~
His passing was a bit sloppy against Roma, that's for sure.

1906~~~
Herrera's passing can be sloppy. I don't know how anyone can deny it.

He's naturally very forward thinking, he isn't afraid to try quick one-touch flicks with the outside of his foot or to scoop under the ball, and he also plays at a quick pace, so it's not surprising.
He's also just not as consistently accurate with his touch and pass as some like Koke or Thiago. He's good technically and can manipulate the ball well, but he's not a 'metronome'.

It's not really a slight on him, or anything to try to deny. He's still a very good passer, has great vision, and can assist superbly with lofted balls. He'll give beautiful assists that most others can only imagine (like the one against us at Old Trafford), so he's still a great player to have.

There are going to be games this season where he seems to give the ball away too much. But at least with him, you know he wont shy away from the ball because of it. And he's always capable of a good through ball delivered at any height.

1907~~~
Thiago, sure, butI don't know about your comparison with Koke. He's a very similar passer to Ander - constantly looking for quick and risky passes. I'm pretty sure his pass percentage accuracy was also in the low 80's, much like Herrera's.

1908~~~
Its not my conclusion based on those articles its the conclusion based on the evidence of my own eyes, which have clearly seen Herrera in action more than yours. Those articles were just evidence that Herrera has played as a #10, which you denied by saying Herrera played in a middle three in front of Iturraspe holding. I notice you're no longer peddling that line.

If you don't expect people to disagree with your opinion on a forum, especially when you make claims that do not appear to be factual, then that's your issue. I just don't see Herrera as sloppy. There's a difference between trying something that does not come off and having poor execution. An overhit or underhit pass is sloppy, admittedly there were a couple of those against Roma too, but its not a feature of Herrera's game. There are very few players who go through games without many any mistakes at all. Usually the weighting on his passes is very good. His passes might get intercepted, the intended target may misread the intent leaving the ball may run through to the keeper/defender but he is not a sloppy player. It is rare for Herrera to skew a ball totally in the wrong direction.

1909~~~
I haven't seen tons of Koke, to be honest. The few times I saw him play last year, he was very controlled and calculating, and barely broke out of a jog. Almost the perfect Xavi impersonation, with more physicality, but still in a measured way.

I never really saw him play with the extreme speed and directness of Herrera, but maybe I just caught the wrong games.
He didn't seem to have a real technical advantage over Herrera, but didn't play with the same fast, experimental style.

1910~~~
Herrera isn't your typical Spanish midfielder he likes to play fast and risky at times, his not one to play the simple pass when he thinks he has a chance to split a defense or create space hence why his pass accuracy is only around 80%

Like his pass for Young's 1st goal against Galaxy if that was any of our other midfielders they wouldn't of tried that and would have passed sideways. I personally feel we will benefit hugely to his ability to think and act quickly to spot movements but like others I will feel a bit more comfortable with a more defensive minded midfielder next to him.

1911~~~
The bolded bit is the key part though Pogue. If people saw his performance differently than that statement above then is it really double standards?

1912~~~
I've no doubt they would argue that they saw the performance differently. Not all bias is conscious. In fact, most isn't.

1913~~~
Sure but then where does your position fall within the whole spectrum? unbiased?

1914~~~
Anyone else think he's a pretty rubbish tackler? Dives in way too easily. I'd not really noticed that before at Bilbao so maybe it's just him lacking a bit of sharpness but if he's always like that then a midfield three with him and Mata absolutely has to have a dedicated DM in there.

1915~~~
Well I'm open to the possibility that Cleverley could still be a good player for us. So that puts me in a relatively unbiased minority, when it comes to judging his performances, certainly.

I'm probably as keen as everyone else for Herrara to succeed, so am just as likely to over-rate him. Maybe a little less giddy about him than some. Although that's probably just because I'm a bit older and jaded.

1916~~~
Didn't he have great stats for tackling in Spain? Don't think he could rack up those sort of numbers if he was rubbish at tackling. Been a bit reckless for United so far, I agree. Could be down to over-enthusiasm as much as a lack of sharpness. He'll be as keen as anyone to make a big impact in his first few games.

1917~~~
Not sure. If we play the 352 I don't think we'd need a true #6 to sit back, as I think with Mata, Herrera and an energetic CM (Vidal/Strootman) we have a lot of intensity and tenacity in pressing and winning the ball high up the field would be far more beneficial, as opposed to a sweeper to clean up, as one of our ball playing CB's (Evans/new signing) could perform that role.

1918~~~
Sort of. I know I've seen him get some of those diving sliding tackles right for Bilbao, but at the same time so far in pre-season he's done it the moment the ball is lost and never really got near winning it back. You can see why he's had a problem with picking up yellow cards.

I'm hoping that once he's properly match fit and settled he'll win the ball now and then with them

1919~~~
I would say from the type of tacklers we're used to seeing in PL, probably more unorthodox in his tackling but from the stats I checked, he makes a fair amount and wins most of them.

I think Cleverley could be a good player for us also but I didn't think he was that great either on Saturday. I would say decent as best. I thought Ander had better moments than Tom so if there was a scorecard, I'd score him slightly higher but not too much. More football to be played anyway.

1920~~~
Meh. Splitting hairs here to try and work out who had the better game. They were both bang average really. Certainly close enough to make the scorn aimed at Cleverley contrast sharply with the excuses rolled out to defend Hererra.

1921~~~
I'd say its more a question of the latter. From what I've seen of him in the past Herrera doesn't seem up to full speed yet. Herrera's tackling is usually a bit better than what we've seen, although he likes a sliding tackle <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> and he'll be lunging into challenges all season long. In many respects the tag 'the Spanish Steven Gerrard' that Herrera got stuck with a few years back is not that inaccurate. They've a similar throw yourself in, go for it kind of style, although I'd argue that Herrera's less likely to see the ball bounce off his foot from a horrible first touch (though by the same token he's also less likely than Gerrard to smash one in from 25 yards when you need to be dug out of a hole...) 

I think the key thing is that Herrera ended up with an assist. I don't think Cleverley played that badly, and we collapsed defensively after he was subbed off. However, what most people see is Herrera playing a first time through ball for Welbeck to win a penalty and they forget the rest. It happens a lot in football. An average performance, and lets face it besides three good through balls Herrera wasn't his usual self, gets forgotten because a player does something in an attacking sense. The unjust thing for Clev is that his role wasn't to get forward so he shouldn't be judged for not playing the kind of defence splitting through ball Herrera laid on for Mata etc. It would be like asking Makelele to be Zidane (and before anyone says it I know they served different purposes, that was my point).

1922~~~
This.

1923~~~
Yeah that's fine. I thought Herrera clearly had the better game but we probably dont see the game the same way

1924~~~
Part of the reason I graded down Cleverley's performance is because he was marked too easily at times throughout the time he was on the pitch. Although he did also appear in good positions, I think he could have done a much better job moving into spaces to give herrera a more lateral passing option.  Instead he was essentially marked out of play in those situations. Small things I feel which can make a bigger impact than some would think

1925~~~
To some extent this is true but Roma's game plan was to flood the midfield and then hit Blackett with the long ball from the back. There was relatively little space to play in and both Cleverley and Herrera were closed down quickly. Herrera managed to make a bit of space for himself one or two times but never really looked like going anywhere. Roma were tactically very impressive, even if the long diagonal to Destro became more and more predictable. They had an idea of how to play and until we scored it was working very well. It was only after Rooney put us ahead and Roma lost their composure that Herrera was able to do more in the game, although he did get one or two chances to spray passes beforehand (although two of those intended for Valencia went astray). Cleverley wasn't really to blame for our first half an hour performance, like Herrera he was being kept on a tight leash and kicked when he wriggled free.

1926~~~
Herrera was not as influential as against Galaxy, but to compare him to Cleverley is unfair. Cleverley had pretty poor game, he lost the ball on multiple occasions in dangerous areas and did nothing about it - he was just standing there and hoping someone else will bail him out. He was directly responsible for Young's yellow card in my opinion. Herrera on the other hand didn't give up on the few occasions when he lost possession - he was chasing and tackling and most of the times managed to recover from his mistake. He had a few misplaced passes, but this was already discussed to death - our whole team was suffering from the conditions and misplacing more passes than usual. Herrera's vision was also miles ahead of Cleverley's - his passing created three very dangerous situations and one of them resulted in the penalty. Overall I'm still very pleased with his game, which I can't say about Cleverley.

1927~~~
I don't really disagree with you, but just to be pedantic:
1. I think Graham Hunter is wrong if he said the reason Ander struggled at the start of last season was that he was getting used to playing as a 10. I'm not sure if you followed him when he was at Real Zaragoza but he was a number 10 back then and it's his natural position so there shouldn't have been much problem adjusting.

2. Not sure I'd read too much into where Ander says he plays best. After all, he was asked a similar question last season and he said he prefers to play close to the strikers. I think he's not particularly bothered about where he plays as long as he is involved in the team.

But yeah I generally agree, just had issues with those 2 points.

1928~~~
I'll watch the game again but I noticed this happen for cleverley even in the second half. And I wasn't blaming him for our first half performance either.

I agree that Roma were tactically good though. Probably the most organized side we'll play all tour

1929~~~
Playing well in your best position is also dependent on how the system operates around you. It's not easy to shine when your teammates' movements dont complement your own.  Unless you're a more dynamic number 10, it can be difficult to really excel.  So even if it's your natural position, if a system at a different club has different requirements for a number 10 then it's not implausible that said player may struggle

1930~~~
Yeah I was actually going to add that in afterwards, that the change in system might have taken time to adjust to even if Ander has a lot of experience in the number 10 role.

1931~~~
I would be a relief if Clev was good enough to partner Herrera, especially when we are short of quality in that department, but so far nothing has changed. Tom could be a good squad player but if he has ambitions and want to challenge for the national team he should ask for a transfer. It's always emotional when you have been at the club for so long but sometimes you have to make hard decisions in order to get the best out of your potential. Being a squad player for us gives him a nice life but will probably halter his future development

And comparing him to Ander Herrera is unfair to both of them, there is a golf of talent between them but Tom is an honest hardworking young man who have every chance to be successful in a smaller club.

1932~~~
ahh. wish you did!

1933~~~
Yup, all i said a few pages back that he never really stood out for me as a spectacular player in spain worth 37 mil. Not saying hes worth it or not, saying he never stood out for me like that because of his sloppy passing at times.
This is what i said "Valverde always played with a 3 man midfield with Itu as CDM and 2 CMs in front of it. Herrera being the most attacking one in most cases specially when he brought in the other defensive guy in big matches (forgot his name). But that doesn't mean Herrera is a CAM lol".

Basically, i said he played a 3 man midfield, with Herrera being the most attacking one. I even said that in matches where he played defensive he brought in a second CDM where they actually moved Herrera as the sole attack orientated midfielder. What i said is the following: "<b>But that doesn't mean Herrera is a CAM lol</b>". aka just because you are noted as a #10 on paper, doesn't mean you actually are. Or do you also agree that Modric is a defensive midfielder.

Also i got no problem when people argue with me of course, i got a problem when people don't argue and just say "BS!" "YOU ARE NOT A UNITED FAN" etc when you simply once state a little negative aspect of a United player or staff member without any further argument which actually makes it a discussion. What mostly happens is just simply considered trolling, and not debating.

1934~~~
So it seems LVG sees him as a no.10. Hope to god he isn't going to limit him to that role.

1935~~~
He mentioned Rooney as a striker and number 10 too. Maybe he sees Herrera as a 10 and an 8.

1936~~~
Exactly. He can play behind the striker but he'll be playing him central midfield.

1937~~~
So how was he against Inter? I missed the game.

1938~~~
Looked good of course. Composed and calm on the ball. Inter parked the bus though so there weren't many cutting passes.

1939~~~
He was solid. Fletcher was the best of the CMs.

1940~~~
I love the way he always receives the ball on the half turn, it's so refreshing to see that in our midfield. I hope his leg is ok though as he seemed in a bit of discomfort after he was clattered twice.

1941~~~
He set my expectation of him to highly since his debut. I am back to reality after his last two performances.

1942~~~
Hererra will be played as a central midfielder. It's clear Mata is LvG's first choice for the player in the hole.

1943~~~
Yeah. There's no way Mata is going to be displaced unless we somehow get a teenage Maradona in the squad.

1944~~~
To my eyes Herrera played within himself and was quite tentative with the ball. I'm not used to Herrera being so risk averse so I can't be enthused by what I saw from him last night. Maybe he felt he needed to get his passing percentage up after the mistakes he made against Roma? Still, I actually feel Ander played better against Roma than against Inter.

Herrera was less accurate but more adventurous at the weekend. I don't remember Herrera misplacing any passes last night, I also don't remember him trying anything that hard last night either. Herrera ducked out of a few chances to run with the ball too, which I found disappointing because he has the talent for it. When Cleverley came on in Herrera's place he was a lot more energetic as the #8 in the side, and his passing showed more conviction and zip. Wouldn't be surprised if Herrera drops to the bench against Madrid. Although Herrera usually plays well against Madrid, so I would also be unsurprised if he ups his level against them if he Van Gaal gives him a run out.

1945~~~
Where was he playing? Behind Mata or as a 10?

1946~~~
Behind Mata. Didn't get involved with our attacks that much either.

1947~~~
Was a fairly average performance. Didn't see a lot of the ball, didn't do much when he did get on the ball and some clumsy challenges trying to win it back. Fletcher looked like a much more accomplished midfielder out there.

Still, we've always got his debut to fall back on if we need reassurance about his talent. Anyone expecting him to play like that in every game was being wildly optimistic. As with every new signing, he will take a while to settle. Probably won't see the best of him until next season.

1948~~~
Don't think it'll take that long, Herrera thrives in space and most Premier League games are wide open. Very few teams in the Premier League will be as organised as Roma and Inter, especially in midfield. Herrera will enjoy the way Premier League teams commit men forward and play out end to end games, often leaving only 4-6 men back. However, that still doesn't make up for what was a pretty timid performance yesterday by Ander. I'm a huge fan of his and expect a lot more than what he showed last night, because he's capable of a lot more than what he showed last night.

1949~~~
Most players who are new to the PL comment on how little time they have on the ball. It's definitely not a league you'd typically say it's easy to find space in. I think you're being very optimistic there.

It might not take him until next season to be a useful player but it's highly likely he won't be at his best until the tail end of this season, at the earliest. That's just the way transfers like this usually pan out. Another factor in the long list of reasons why anyone expecting us to stroll to a place in the top four this season is in for a rude awakening.

1950~~~
Thought he did good. I like his style, never takes more than 2 seconds on the ball. Maybe that's something that LVG asked the players to do.

1951~~~
Thought he did well in possession. Creates space for himself very well and knows how to control a football.
Fletcher was brilliant yesterday though so I agree.

1952~~~
That's really just how he plays - with speed.

1953~~~
It depends on the player, Mata adjusted fairly quickly while i remember Silva took a few months to settle. A lot of Spanish/Bilbao fans say his game would have been more suited to the premier league as well personally I think he'll settle around Christmas.

1954~~~
Yeah, his first and second touches were usually great. Really knows how to wriggle away from someone who is tight to him. Just think he didn't do much useful once he'd created that space. Fletcher seemed to be doing all our best defensive <i>and</i> attacking work in central midfield.

1955~~~
I felt the same. But this might be a thing that comes with getting to know the other players and their movements better.

Clev did that very well when he came on. He and Fletch both were great yesterday and probably one of the reasons why I enjoyed the second half more.

1956~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> its the quickness of feet that you refer to that makes me feel Herrera will be an instant success in England. Yes, players get tight in the Premier League but its usually in a very naive way e.g. once players wriggle past someone they are often able to run unchallenged at a back line. Inter and Roma pressed intermittently, which involved alternating between a few seconds of getting tight and then retreating back into their shape. That meant every time Herrera did get some space he turned and faced up two solid lines in front of him. That tends to happen less in the Premier League.

However, as <a class="username" data-user="24815, @Godfather" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24815/">@Godfather</a> says there is a way, even against that tight organisation that you can succeed and Cleverley's performance was a good example of this. Cleverley brought a bit of energy, a bit of running and a willingness to get forward more to the #8 role last night. By taking the ball past Inter players he was able to get through their shape and get into spaces that opened the game for us. He totally outshone Herrera and Herrera should be questioning himself today as to why he didn't show similar levels of ambition. As I've said, I thought Herrera was far more adventurous against Roma than Inter and (depsite the misplaced passes) I preferred his performance at the weekend to what he showed last night.

Fletcher, as you both say, was better than both: Visions of a volley against Everton flash through my mind...

1958~~~
I've always wondered how well this phrase would Google translate into other languages.

1959~~~
Google translate thinks that by player, you mean toy for sexual pleasure, in that context.

1960~~~
Really like what I hear about Hererra in terms of his attitude.

1961~~~
He will have a very good season.

1962~~~
I hope so. If he doesn't, we're screwed!

1963~~~
There's certainly a lack of space in midfield. It's always been the case in the PL.

1964~~~
I think there's always been a lack of time, not sure if there's a lack of space.

Take this video of Fellaini vs WBA.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHpys_QvnAY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

There are numerous times at which the player receiving the ball is quickly closed down but when he looks up the play is actually quite stretched. The tendency for more Premier League teams to go 4-4-2 means there's often huge gaps to pass or move into, especially when someone steps out. If you have the close control, strength and speed to beat the man assigned to get tight to you you'll have a clear run. Players like Barclay and Ramsey, for example, are very good at exploiting this. Premier League sides are good defending deep but they aren't particularly organised when it comes to strangling midfield. There are also numerous times in this video where Fellaini gets the ball and is able to play without much pressure on him at all. Ok, against City it'll be different, but we don't have to play City 38 times.

1965~~~
You guys, there's still no "Ander Herrera - 2014/15 performances" thread...surely one of you wants to make it so I don't have to...

1966~~~
Still early days but Herrera's intense workrate and technical skill have been quite superb. His attitude is also drawing from from some senior squad members :

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Jul/darren-fletcher-ander-herrera-can-be-key-at-manchester-united.aspx?pageNo=1" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...can-be-key-at-manchester-united.aspx?pageNo=1</a>

Really looking forward to seeing him in competitive fixtures for United in the 2014/ 2015 season.

<a class="username" data-user="39261, @gooDevil" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/39261/">@gooDevil</a> <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1967~~~
He's brilliant! 

I predict he'll be our POTY.

1968~~~
I dunno, I feel like out of all our players Mata and Rooney are going to have the biggest seasons, but I have no doubt that Ander will be brilliant for us. Was just pleasantly surprised when he signed for us, now after seeing the friendlies I'm pumped that he's here.

1969~~~
Really can't wait for the season to start to see him in the Premier League.

Would be even better if United bought him a class midfield partner.

1970~~~
Same!

1971~~~
He can't work wonders on his own! 

But he is one of the many things to look forward to this season.

1972~~~
I think Mata is going to run the show this year!

1973~~~
I think there might be an element of sentimentality to the vote, having missed a midfield wizard since Scholes left. I'm thinking of the award voted on by the supporters, not the one the players pick.

1974~~~
He gives off the impression that he is captain material in the future, such a brilliant attitude for someone comming into the team.

1975~~~
He's had one great game versus Galaxy and two decent performances so far. He'll be a fine addition.

1976~~~
I'm with Pogue in terms of my perception of his performances thus far. Brilliant first game but in my opinion he's been pretty invisible ever since.

I have no doubts as to the lads ability, but he needs to tweak his game a little if he is to be more effective as a player in midfield - especially for ourselves. At the moment, I see a player who moves off the ball for moving off the balls sake far too much. Sometimes the best midfielders know when to just stay still and provide a better option for a pass whereas Herrera moves forward after laying it off every single time, which might draw attention but it means he is now in a difficult position to receive the pass again... which leads to the fluidity of the move being affected, with inevitable passes to the side or back to the centre-back. Basically he is making it hard for the likes of Fletcher etc to find him.

Another issue I have is his failure to make the ball 'stick'. Likes of Scholes and Xavi, hold on to that ball the right time before releasing, same goes for Pirlo... they don't ball hog, but they realise just by being on the ball... they're giving their team a lift and controlling the game. It also gives them more time to make a more meaningful pass.. but at the same time they have the ability to move it around quicker, just to mix it up and not get caught on it. Herrera in the first game - struck the right balance, but I've seen him a fair few times for Bilbao and his games v Roma/Inter.. where he just gets it and one touch passes it to someone else. It helps his passing %s look good, but in terms of him controlling the game, its useless if he is going to do that all the time... we need him to get on the ball and drive with it, making things happen.. not laying it off to the likes of Fletch and Clverely, forcing them to 'direct' the game. He needs to take responsibility and conduct the game.

Final issue, quality of passing.. he hits a brilliant through ball, but his mid range passing and long passing needs more work. I think it is linked with the problem of not holding onto the ball long enough, he rushes his passes. Slow the game down and he will make more accurate meaningful passes.

1977~~~
That's certainly true and I'm sure he would accept that. It's not just about his own play either, it's about understanding the players around him. You mention his movement after he plays a pass - I'd say he tries to move to where he thinks he'll be needed, a necessity in one/two touch play but he's making too many assumptions about his teammates. It did help make him look spectacular against Galaxy, he's played a more cautious game since then.

I've commented before that he's not the man for the Xavi/metronome role and of course he doesn't have the passing range of Scholes. But there are a lot of other ways of playing in midfield and he'll bring something of his own to the job. The important thing is not to throw drive and the quick thinking out with the impatience bathwater.

If you watch him pass, he'll always try to pass to someone. I'm sure he can learn to move to where our players need him.

1978~~~
Looked tired to me. He can definitely play better.

1979~~~
Not really. He's good, but lets not get ahead of ourselves.

1980~~~
I'm not talking about next year, but in 4 or 5 years' time you don't think he possesses the attitude to become one?

1981~~~
I was actually a lot more impressed with the defensive side of his game today. Really didn't mind getting stuck in at all. Going forward he was a bit off though.

1982~~~
Thought he did well today.

1983~~~
Not sure how he's getting so much praise for today. I think he's been anonymous since the Galaxy game.

1984~~~
Anonymous isn't quite the right word. He's been generally good after a fantastic debut; his presence has been felt much greater than any of our other CMs on tour, even Darren Fletcher for me.

1985~~~
I think he's been a big part of keeping the ball moving quickly and being comfortable enough on the ball to play possession football.

1986~~~
Excellent again, makes us tick, he's been helped immensely by his surrounding team mates knowing exactly where to be and what to do.
Van Gaal really is the real deal isn't he.

1987~~~
The commentator on MUTV (think it was Higgingbotham) got it bang on in saying we press a lot more and are a lot more lively in midfield (partly) due to the addition of Herrera. He may not be obviously brilliant - even though he chips in with some great passes and flicks - but he definitely brings a different edge and drive to our midfield. Imagine him next to Vidal...

Edit: that's the phrase I was looking for <a class="username" data-user="56539, @gasmanc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56539/">@gasmanc</a> - he makes us tick! Everything seems to work with Herrera in midfield.

1988~~~
Been very impressed with his defensive work.

1989~~~
He has a wonderful habit of moving into space that has just been occupied. Another runner makes a run taking his marker with him and Herrera finds himself into that space. Helps us move the ball quicker and press with more intelligence.

1990~~~
He and Fletcher make a solid midfield.  I'd like to see them together again against Soton in the final, but maybe Fletcher will need a rest.

1991~~~
Only partly. In general our players are pressing a lot better. Rooney, Mata, Welbeck as well as the high line from the defenders is the reason.

1992~~~
A real creative number 8.

He really is the real deal.

1993~~~
I like what you did there.

1994~~~
He's not settled in yet. I'd like to see him get on the ball more, and be more influential.

In fact, right now, although were winning, I don't think the central players are seeing enough of the ball higher up the pitch. Need to get the likes of Herrera and mata on the ball more. Although it could be argued that Herrera being a cm has to get on it more often himself.

1995~~~
Fletcher has been more expressive in that regard with Herrera being a tad bit more reserved. It might have something to do with him adapting to his surroundings and teammates though. He will be more expressive and take more responsibility after he has settled in.

1996~~~
I didnt think he had the best of games yesterday but you saw him take up some good positions, was open to the pass and played the ball forward which was refreshing to see. Fletcher stole the show though.

1997~~~
Again thought he did well. ALways making space for himself or looking for a first time forward ball. Not as impressive as Fletch yesterday but albeit a few misplaced passes he still looked good imo.

1998~~~
He is playing more further forward than fletcher though, who is picking the ball up deep and in isolated. Maybe he just needs to get more used to his team mates so that they find him in better positions, or simply has to drop deep more.

1999~~~
Herrera did the hard work with fletcher yesterday. They kept the ball moving and never let eachother get out numbered. 

It actually is a great partnership forming. If fletcher can keep this up through the season we've got a good chance.

2000~~~
Great movement and awareness yesterday, he closed down the opponent and was key to winning the ball back quickly. Other than a few stray passes here and there he's been solid, I feel hes helping Fletcher shine as well.

2001~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhoTjPWR_RE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2002~~~
Few bad passes and he has 2-3 times stupid the ball....BUT he was still very good again yesterday

I'm so happy he's here.....i think all fans will love him soon

2003~~~
He's been brill. Not really hit top gear yet but he's looked the part straight away. He'll be a very good midfielder for us.

2004~~~
He's the perfect player for the system we are playing. Mobile, aggressive and with a high level of technical ability. Early days and all but I think he'll prove a fantastic signing.

2005~~~
He will become a fan favourite in no time. Not only is he our best midfielder, he is also a very likeable lad. Great signing.

2006~~~
Thought he did well last night.

2007~~~
Really shows how much we've missed a midfielder like him, if he gets so much praise for that performance. By his own standards he was average yesterday. Still better than the rest, but Fletcher was clearly better than him for example. In my eyes it's very obvious that he is still getting used to the system and the team around him. It will come with time.

2008~~~
It is hard to say for certain, considering all the substitutions, but the midfield has missed him every time he was subbed off during pre-season.

2009~~~
What Herrera does at 2.30 is what he was bought for, turning away from a marker and releasing a quick forward pass (also at 1.25 but that one was intercepted). 

Pleased to see Herrera look more like himself last night after a middling performance against Inter. Still not quite <i>there</i> yet but getting there.

2010~~~
Agreed.

Athletic Bilbao destroyed us not because of how good they were individually but because they were brilliant as a unit. I have high hopes that Van Gaal can do the same to us.

I'm just hoping that we can pair Herrera with someone like Martinez/Iturraspe here to really get the best out of him.

2011~~~
I like him. He makes some sloppy errors but I think that can be ironed out. Whats more important is his positivity and his workrate for me. He's confident on the ball, looks to carry it forward or pass it forward when he can even in tough areas and if he does lose the ball or we as a team lose it he's quick to get back and help close down. I think I'll do well next to either Carrick/Fletch.

2012~~~

2013~~~
One thing that I really like about Herrera is that he's not afraid to get stuck in.

2014~~~
Yeah you seen it with his completed tackles stats from La Liga but its already noticeable in these friendlies, he's a proper ball-winner when he wants to be.

2015~~~
Is there a transcript/video of this interview? Love Herrera

2016~~~
So Herrera looks certain to stick with No21? Henriquez will be loaned out then.

2017~~~
Decent performance today. Just concerned with his constant napping at opposition players. He needs to be more decisive and less committal. Could end up racking up fouls and getting sent off more often than not. Tbf most of his fouls today weren't deserving of a yellow card but still he has to alter his game since refs can give a yellow card for constantly fouling. Nice to have a player with a bit of a bite and ability to disrupt the opposition instead of passively stargazing like a few of our midfielders.

2018~~~
Fantastic through ball for the first goal. Love his ability to close down players ( even if it ends up with some small foul ) in an aggressive manner and his pressing work. Great player he is.

2019~~~
Fletcher wasn't doing him any favours in midfield, but he did quite well regardless.

2020~~~
Was alright. I like that he's a scrappy nuisance of a player but it might see him pick up a fair few cards throughout the season.

2021~~~
He reminds me a bit of Fernandinho and to a lesser extent Ramires for their respective clubs.

2022~~~
He's a dirty bastard, isn't he? Wasn't great, we still need a midfield partner for him.

2023~~~
Good to see him roughing them up. Will get better.

2024~~~
Interesting performance. Real quality in the build up to Rooney's goal. Rather too many careless passes. Wanted to get stuck in; which I'd say is a good thing but he'll need to get the balance right as don't want to see him sent off for 2 yellows.

2025~~~
Like the fact that he loves to get stuck in. Even if it means a fair few fouls, better than just letting the opposition walk right through you. Spanish midfielder with some proper bite, he's going to be good for us. He showed today that even when his passing radar is way off he can still put in a passable performance overall.

2026~~~
His gone off the boil since his galaxy game. He'll need some time to settle but in the meantime we need another midfielder to share the load.

2027~~~
He's feisty and when LvG moved the team up in the 2nd half he did a good job getting into the pockets of space and breaking from midfield, overall I'm pleased with his start for us.

2028~~~
In the build up to our first goal Herrera showed why we spent nearly £30 million on him. With Liverpool getting tight in midfield we needed someone to lose his man, carry the ball to commit a Liverpool player and open up the space between their lines. Herrera provided that and then played a perfectly weighted pass to Hernandez, which allowed Chico to swing the ball in for Rooney's goal.

I want to see more of that from Herrera. Driving forward from midfield has been hallmark of his game for years, but since we played LA Galaxy he hasn't really done it all that much. I won't criticise him too much because until he pulled that out of the bag we never looked like building a dangerous attack, never mind scoring. But I want to see him use the full range of his abilities more instead of playing it so safe. He has the ability, he just has to show a little more ambition and adventure.

2029~~~
Thought he was lucky to escape a card (he didn't get carded did he?) and would have got a yellow in the prem. love him having that edge though - the polar opposite of Cleverley in these last few games. Bodes well.

2030~~~
I'd like to him to advance more, the Galaxy game is the only game where he had a good shot on target and a header in the box. Is it the quality of competition making him not advance? Is it the crazy pre-season schedule? Does he trust his partner's less to cover for him?

2031~~~
A graduate of the Paul Scholes school of tackling

2032~~~
As others have said, even though he was sloppy and not at his best, he was still able to come up with moments of magic. That's the sign of a very good player and I'm sure LVG will iron the creases out.

2033~~~
It's great how snappy he is. Haven't had a player like that for a while.

2034~~~
Its strange to see Herrera play so conservatively because he has always tried to get forward from midfield. Also, when he stretches his legs he's a real proposition as we saw last night. He's not easy to knock of the ball and when he works it into space he's capable of playing a key pass or striking the ball from range.

In every game since we played LA Galaxy every player who has replaced Herrera has made more effort than him to get forward. For example, Cleverley against Inter played the #8 role far more pro-actively. Even Lingard last night was keener to get forward. Maybe its just Herrera's interpretation of the tactics? Young was saying after the Madrid game that we've been working on playing it a bit on one side and then switching it quickly to the other side when space appears. Maybe Herrera feels, based on that, that his role is to hang back and be available to switch the play instead of go on driving runs from midfield? Perhaps he feels, or he's been told, if he goes galloping forward with the ball and loses it the team will lose its shape too much? The last time he played in a midfield three he had Iturraspe cleaning up after him, maybe he feels without that holding player it would be irresponsible to drive forward?

I'd love someone to interview Herrera and actually ask him why he has felt the need to change his game so much?

2035~~~
I only saw the highlights but that was absolutely the thing that caught my eye. It's the sort of thing we wanted Anderson to do and at time he did. Hopefully Herrera will give us that aspect.

2036~~~

Dunno the lad/lady who makes these Herrera match compilations but I like how quickly he/she gets them out.

2037~~~
I love the way he muscles himself away from players, he really is a little bulldog. Exactly what we needed really.

2038~~~
Much better second half from him. Drive, determination and took on a bit more responsibility in making things happen.

2039~~~
I thought he was quite average last night, his passing seemed off at times, as did most of the team first half in all honesty, he commited countless fouls to boot, it's too early to judge him really, but the Galaxy game aside, I would say its fair to say he hasn't looked exceptional but again.. it's far too early to be overly critical or positive

2040~~~
Aye, but you have to remember he has a league 2 player in the shape of Cleverley next to him.

2041~~~
Bit off from the start like the rest of the team,but his pedigree shone through.

Love the fact hes got more than a bit off bite in a tackle,he just wants the ball,and as things stand Fletcher has complimented him well.

Carricks return and hopefully another midfield acquisition,really should free him up to dictate,,,,hes a cracking wee midfielder that will only get better.

2042~~~
Poor old Clevs, but I'd inject his midfield partner for many of the first half games so far has often been Fletcher, the thing with Fletch as well is he gives a MotM performance Vs Real, makes you pause and think.. perhaps it's someone who could offer us something sustained this coming season.. and yet the next game he looks distinctly average once again, thats the thing with our midfield none can really so far be counted on to give consistent 7-8 /10 performances week on week, Herrera included so far, but  again.. its too early to judge the guy too harshly when he's just settling in.

2043~~~
You can see his quality in the little things he does, turning quickly and firing the ball wide or using his body to turn away from a player. He'll improve things immeasurably in our midfield once he settles.

2044~~~
Heh. Cleverley, of course, had the benefit of playing with the Spanish Paul Scholes alongside him, so can have no excuse for not putting on a midfield masterclass. Amirite?

Didn't watch the game so can't comment on the performance of either player but the double standards about Herrera's pre-season have been interesting. 

People were belittling Fletcher's performances against Italian opposition by saying he had an unusual amount of time on the ball while absolutely nobody criticised Herrera (who didn't really impress) for failing to make the most of all that time and space. Now we've decided it's Cleverley's fault Hererra wasn't much cop against Madrid but woe betide anyone who might argue that perhaps Cleverley might have benefited from playing alongside a more effective midfield partner?

I obviously hope Hererra will be a huge success at United and there's been enough good things writtedn about him - as well his one great performance against admittedly woeful opposition - to make me confident that he's got what it takes. I think it will take him a good while to settle into the team though, particularly against PL opposition, perhaps most of next season. Meanwhile, I look forward to seeing how creative and varied the excuses get after each less than impressive perfornance*.



<span style="font-size: 9px">
*Obviously, I look forward to impressive performances waaaaaaaay more than creative excuses about poor ones. That should go without saying but you can never be sure on here...</span>

<a class="username" data-user="76075, @Blue always red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/76075/">@Blue always red</a> <a class="username" data-user="61245, @BennyBlanco" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61245/">@BennyBlanco</a> Why the backhanders for Cleverley and Fletcher? Nobody played more full games on tour than Fletcher is it any wonder he looked knackered? Most players have been playing a half here, an hour there. Fletch played 90 minutes against Madrid on Saturday and then had to play again on Monday, of course he was tired. As for Cleverley, he was involved in both our second and third goals and looked quite good to my eyes. Getting Fletch off, so he could rest, and introducing the fresh legs of Cleverley helped give our midfield more balance in the second half. I don't see how anyone can view his contribution as league two standard.

<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> Actually thought Herrera played his best game since La Galaxy last night. We were awful as an attacking unit until he popped up with the strength to hold off Henderson and arrow that pass to Chico, which led to Rooney's goal. You spend £30 million on a player because you expect that when nothing is going you're way that guy will make something happen. For the first time, Herrera did that last night. Against La Galaxy the gulf in class was so big Herrera barely needed to get into gear, against Roma he only woke up when we started to dominate at the end of the first half, and against Inter he was treading water. Yesterday Herrera stood up to be counted, and he did it when we actually needed him to. That's what he was bought for. That bodes very well for the future especially as most Premier League midfield's aren't as good as Liverpool's. I could watch the clip of him turn away from the Liverpool midfield and find Hernandez with the pass on loop.

2046~~~
I don't have anything against Fletch, wouldn't knock him or any of our players, I'm just stating the opinion since his return last year, more or less, he's looked good in one game and quite average the next.. you don't know what you can expect game to game from him, it's been similar this tour where I thought hes put in some great performances yet looked quite average the next, last night similar, but I take your point on total minutes played over the tour and tiredness, though most of our side looked a bit jaded to be fair, I would disagree also on saying Herrera had his best game last night, some of his basic touch and easy passes he misplaced and the amount of fouls he commited was particuarly high, it was eyebrow raising that he was only booked after several fouls, in a league game he'd have been in the book far more quickly, also he could easily have given a second penalty away with his challenge on Sterling.

You can see the quality he holds but so far he's struggling to produce it, my opinion so far.

2047~~~
That doesn't have to be a bad thing, as long as he makes them high on the pitch and not around our box. If anything, we conceeded lot of stupid goals in last few seasons that could have been stopped relatively easy if we had player who was willing to foul opposition players at times.

2048~~~
His best game since he played against LA Galaxy, not his best game. Clearly the man of the match performance in his debut was better. However, what he did last night was more important. He's been decent in the previous three games without doing too much, and its relatively easy to play well when everyone else in the side is on their game. Last night was the first time in a red shirt, against good quality opposition, where Herrera was the reason we started playing well instead of just a beneficiary of us playing well. That, to me, was the big difference. Until Herrera's bit of strength and vision opened Liverpool up, so Hernandez to whip that cross to Rooney, we were totally flat. What I like most is that, at a time when he wasn't pulling up any trees, Ander found something within himself to do that and lift the whole side. It's a sign he can be more than a sunshine player for us.

2049~~~
In his less impressive games (even including last night, which we'd be justified in simply writing off because almost everyone was shite in the first half) there have still been lots of good moments, things that only a really quality player could pull off. There haven't been mediocre performances so much as inconsistent ones. Even last night he was doing these little turns and bursts of pace which took him past and away from the likes of Henderson and Gerrard, and little deft through-balls.

I'm not worried. He'll take a while to settle into full form but he's already playing more than well enough for me.

As I say, I'm not counting last night for much because so many players who've been superb so far on tour (Fletcher and Evans, for example) were utterly, anomalously incompetent. And I don't buy that it was Liverpool's so-called 'high press', because Madrid were pressing us just as energetically at times and we dealt with it effortlessly against them. I'd be more inclined to say it was the difficulty of getting the ball to move on that waterlogged pitch. And then, once they realised how badly they were playing, a sort of cumulative team underwear-soiling, which LVG effectively put a stop to at half time.

2050~~~
I like this guy. He will go a long way in improving our football as a team. He's simple yet effective, circulates the ball well yet will always look for the creative pass. He's no world beater, but I don't think he needs to be. With the right partner, he, and Mata, can make for an excellent midfield three. I like what I've seen so far, certainly.

2051~~~
Such an excellent addition the fans are gonna love him.

2052~~~
Seemed like he had about 15 fouls yesterday.

2053~~~
As one of the ones who was pleased we went back for him, I'll chime in. His tackling is like that, he used to pick up a lot of cards (including reds) in La Liga. He won't change overnight, but I think he will moderate it, if he knows we're relying on him to stay on the pitch, and let someone else make those "second-yellow" provoking tackles instead.

As for him seemingly playing within himself since the Galaxy match. He looks restrained and that's not normally his problem. I assume he's learning his role. He's watching his wingback, he's watching his central partner. I'm guessing LvG is telling him to look at his positioning and nothing is instinctive yet. Same with his passing, he doesn't know his teammates or their movements - he gets caught out by it.

He's not a solution to our problems in midfield, he's just part of the solution.

2054~~~
I agree. Once he settles in, he's going to be one of those players you'll be glad is on the team, particularly if the team is having to work for a result.

2055~~~
Very happy we finally have him. He's going to be brilliant and as others said before, only a matter of time before he breaks into the Spanish NT

2056~~~
Didn't catch the game but that moment where he shrugged off Henderson (?) and played a perfect pass to Hernandez made me so happy. We've lacked that in midfield for years. I love Carrick but he'd have shat himself and played a five yard pass backwards to Evans.

2057~~~
Think he was greatly underrated in the ratings section, he's a huge part of the reason we've able to keep possession. He's at the heart of it all.

2058~~~
To be expected in a player in his position playing for a new team. Good central midfielders play like they have eyes in the back of their head. Partly because they have great vision and feel for what's going on around them, partly because they anticipate the runs made by their team mates without needing to see them. That last bit takes a long time to learn. It's why they are likely to take longer to bed in than any other position.

2059~~~

Don't know which one I'd rather have <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2060~~~
Finally watched the game last night. Was better than I'd feared, reading some of the post-match comments online. A big improvement on his last game IMO, especially playing on pitch which really wasn't conducive to passing.

He really needs to clean up his act a little bit though. I actually love seeing someone getting stuck in and kicking a few players. We've been too "nice" in midfield for years. About time the opposition started worrying about their shins again. However, some of his challenges were clumsy to the point of stupidity. To be fair, he was playing the game on it's merits and might have calmed down if he'd been booked earlier. I just have a nagging concern that he can only play one way. Didn't he pick up more than his fair share of reds when he last played this deeper role for his club? Hopefully he'll prove me wrong when the season starts.

2061~~~
He's picked up five red cards over the duration of his career, but not one last season. At the age of 24, I suppose that's quite a lot, although I don't know what is statistically the average for someone that age. Anyway, it could be part and parcel of a player who is aggressive and completes a lot of tackles anyway. As you say, we've lacked physicality and aggression in midfield for years, so I would rather we have a player like that who is prone to poor challenges than someone who is tentative and passive in midfield like Cleverley for example.

2062~~~
Yeah i love to see that quality in a CM, and lets face it, if he plays alongside Carrick he is going to have to get stuck in for him too.

2063~~~
I am sick of having a midfield full of complete pussies.

I'd take the odd red card if he performs in the other games.

2064~~~
Could someone please do an 'Ander's Game' out of this?

Gonna need his smiling face inside/on top of the helmet!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6MM36h68A0E/Utji_PjM_oI/AAAAAAAAEpQ/RsgLNa4SbAc/s1600/1+Enders_Game_2013.jpg" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6MM36h68A0E/Utji_PjM_oI/AAAAAAAAEpQ/RsgLNa4SbAc/s1600/1+Enders_Game_2013.jpg"/>

2065~~~
Agreed, was a bit worried with him being Spanish.

But on his pre-season performances he puts himself about in midfield more than Fellaini and when he cops a hit he gets straight back up and chases his man down, he's a little fighter, I like it!

2066~~~
Playing for Bilbao would do that to you, I'd imagine.

2067~~~
That is a child, I'm almost certain

2068~~~
Would guess 5 red cards by that age is above average. It's not Sergio Ramos bad but it's pretty high, nearly 60 yellow cards too!

2069~~~
He looks like Woody from Toy Story, I've decided.

2070~~~
Reading through this thread, surprised by some of the over-critical comments. We should be more prudent when the season actually starts. Even good/great performances can be overblown.  It's not easy for any player to shine against teams who reduce the space and after the Galaxy performance I think it was to be expected. Especially against Inter who matched up against us with a default 3-5-2 formation. Like Shaw, think it's clear they've shown enough that they will be good signings for us. I dont understand how anyone could get worried.

Making predictions that he will only thrive when there's open spaces based off these games (sometimes only 45 min cameo) is a bit silly imo because he's shown before he can handle when the game is tighter. However, in these situations having a good understanding with your teammates is helpful in reducing the errant passes in tight spaces.

2071~~~
Nah, he's just naturally youthful.

2072~~~
Will become a hybrid of robson and scholes.





<span style="color: #ffffff">Ma slight tendency to get over excited.</span>

2073~~~
Nah its defiantly Herrera.

2074~~~
I think his first game might have built expectations up a bit too much (especially amongst those of us who haven't really seen too much of him before now). That game gave us a glimpse of his talent and potential but I get the feeling the performances we'll see from him this season will be a lot closer to what we've seen in the games since. He is currently far from the finished article so we shouldn't expect too much from him just yet.

He'll have to be careful not to pick up too many cards though. Aggression is definitely a good thing (and it should ensure he has an easier time adapting to the PL too) but some of his tackles against Liverpool were a bit stupid. Being a dirty, niggly fouling bastard is only a plus if you can actually get away with it. Otherwise you become a bit of a liability.

2075~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i911.photobucket.com/albums/ac318/Vato_1979/AndersGame.jpg" src="http://i911.photobucket.com/albums/ac318/Vato_1979/AndersGame.jpg"/> 

Dunno if this is good enough, Olly could probably do a much better job.

2076~~~
It's brilliant! You've made my day sir

2077~~~
That's just the way Spaniards are taught to play, if anything our players need to work towards such fluidity. Passing the ball and moving forward actually helps the likes of Fletcher, as it drags a player away and makes space for him to move into, and then he's ready to contribute higher up the field should we work the ball around the opposition. With regards to giving one touch balls straight back to players; again, making space only this time higher up the field as it's drawn someone out of position to press him. 

All such small factors of the Spanish game that make them so successful, not just for keeping the ball but for knackering the opposition out. Imagine running 5-10 yards out of position for 70 minutes, you'd start getting fed up and either you'd fail to get back quickly enough or you'd just stay in formation, in which he can then turn and look to be more direct.

2078~~~
Argh no! This has been one of my favourite things about him so far! It would be one thing if all his passes were just passive lay-offs, but he's noticeably aggressive in his passing, looking to push the ball forward and make things happen. And the speed with which he does that, trying to never linger on the ball for longer than necessary, just makes our attacks that much harder to respond to. Gives the midfield that he passes through less time to react and try and get back whilst Mata, Rooney or whoever is receiving that pass and using it.

As for the passes that <i>are</i> more passive, the lay-offs and sideways balls... high tempo is the way that you make passes like that valuable. The criticism people often have of Cleverley, or of Carrick last season, is that they make those sorts of passes but they take two touches thinking about it before doing so. As a result the pass does nothing for our fluidity or tempo, and can never lead to a nice pass-and-move manoeuvre. You can't make pass and move work unless it's bang bang bang, pass move pass move, no sitting on the ball for three seconds between those quick short passes. You're trying to pull the opposition out of shape while they chase the ball, and that doesn't work if you give them a breather between each little movement to recover their positioning.

Herrera hasn't been individually brilliant in every game on tour. He was exceptional against Galaxy, impressive against Madrid, average against Inter and Roma and fairly awful (like everyone else) against Liverpool. But make no mistake, his introduction has a great deal to do with the fast, aggressive pass-and-move that people have been so pleased with so far under Van Gaal. And it's all about that quality of looking to release every pass as early as possible, to always keep the ball moving.

2079~~~
the girl...

2080~~~
Whoosh...

2081~~~
She's probably 15 at most...

2082~~~
Yeah the girl looks to be definitely under 18 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2083~~~
I see some criticism against Herrera. Absurd regarding our results and his contribution. Yes, his misplace some passes, sometimes he fouls to easy but one of his biggest strength is his off the ball contribution, more or less always available and on the run. Can't praise him enough. Thanks God we bought him.

2084~~~
I would say 18-19

2085~~~
Someone looking young next to baby face Herrera, isn't a good sign.

2086~~~
Yeah, that's what I meant about him picking up more cards when played deeper. He was used as a 10 last season but had a poor disciplinary record the last time he played in a deeper role. At least, that's an observation <a class="username" data-user="21825, @Ekeke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21825/">@Ekeke</a> made which stuck in my head. You could see why in that Liverpool game. Like I said, though, he might have just been waiting for that first booking. With the ref so reluctant to get his yellow card out I'm not too fussed about Hererra kicking as many lumps out of the scousers as possible!

2087~~~
I think he is just very eager. He is perhaps a little naive in the sense that he makes niggly fouls that build up into bookings, rather than bad rash challenges. 

He will learn though to get a bit cleverer in that sense. It's just learning when to actually win the ball, or just do enough to prevent their forward momentum.

2088~~~
Long term investment, just like how LVG likes youth!

2089~~~
He's just so comfortable playing with the ball under pressure at a such a high tempo, especially with the quick passes, he almost always makes the right pass. Haven't seen him dribble forward or play as many through balls as he did the first match, but I'm sure he'll begin to assert himself more. The more capable our team grows on the ball under van Gaal, the better he will look, as currently he has the ability to adorn some of those around him with the way he instigates fluidity in our play.

2090~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck

2091~~~
He's the perfect partner for Michael Carrick.

2092~~~
I'd bold the first sentence if it wasn't too much effort to do on my phone, but yeah I think that's one of the biggest benefits of buying a player from Athletic Club rather than most other Spanish clubs. They play a faster, more aggressive style than most other Spanish teams which makes their players more comfortable moving to an English side. 

I do think he could benefit from adding a bit more 'pause' in his play though. The cut-throat style is great to watch but sometimes it makes more sense to slow the play down and that's something he needs to learn.

2093~~~
No, I got it. Just not really funny since she's legitimately under 15 years old.

2094~~~
Totally agree. The objective is to move the ball quickly - whether backwards, forwards or in triangles with the wide players doesn't really matter. What we don't need is someone who spends time contemplating making THE pass.

2095~~~
In my opinion, in that Liverpool game.. he struck the right balance once more. I was mightily impressed. Most of his lay offs in those in between games were passive, which was my issue... and if you over do the quick lay offs (sideways and back), you're not really progressing the play so the tempo might be quick but in terms of moving the game from back to front, it is slow and allows opposition to stay in their shape without having to worry out the spaces in between defence and midfield.

Anyway I'm certain it is just a consistency thing rather than a talent/way of playing issue... he just needs to get into habit of being ever-present and running games week in week out. The Liverpool performance was very positive. His first touch is brilliant, and when he's positive.. he's a joy to watch.

Needs to cut out the fouling though, easily could have been sent off.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTPaoNBk5mQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2096~~~
I still can't quite believe that we signed a CM.

2097~~~
This is what concerns me a little and specially for his first season. I mean too much responsibility from the get go without someone to help him (Carrick would have if he weren't injured) or another CM signing.

2098~~~
Remember that he also spent last season in a different role so might take some time to adjust back to a normal CM role. You can dive with a low percentage tackle high up the pitch with lots of teammates behind you, not when you're 20 yards out. Same with passes - after his first game his passing consistancy wasnt quite there. Gave the ball away trying things which werent on. Again, high up the pitch with lots of players before you its not a worry but in your own half or on the halfway line and it can be a problem.

2099~~~
He played in all games which was exhausting and you could see that. I cant wait to see him play when his fitness levels are top and with a top partner in midfield

2100~~~
Remember when we had doubts over his defensive qualities?

lulz.

2101~~~
Need the Carrick from 06-09 next to him.

2102~~~
He is the kind of modern CM that a lot of people seem to deny the existence of. 

Herrera, Modric, Kroos and Fabregas (off the top of my head) are creative CMs, not AMs.

He is the kind of player we lacked, and has looked good. My only criticism tonight is he seems to do a lot of backwards/sideways passes - but this may be due to simply not having enough movement ahead of him, as he has shown his passing quality a few times tonight.

2103~~~
Our best player in that first half.

2104~~~
Cough *the scholes* cough

2105~~~
He's skillful, crafty. Not exactly creative due to his passing. He's the perfect link up midfielder. There aren't many of that type and having him at United is fecking amazing.

2106~~~
He's no Fellaini

2107~~~
Tbh looking at Carrick's age, we need to find a perfect partner for Herrera.

2108~~~
Yeah I suppose creative is the wrong term. I think that is more due to the fact that he plays deep though.

2109~~~
Tbh, crafty and skillful can also be called creative, it all depends what do you mean when say creative. But yes, he is very good at it.

2110~~~
He alone can't make a difference

2111~~~
Mixed performance today, very good in the first half, less so in the second. Reminds me alot of Scholes.

2112~~~
Most of the moments of genuine quality involved Herrera. I was impressed.

2113~~~
He is good, but if you look at Kroos at the RM game, the difference in class is so evident. Still think he is a great player but I doubt he'll become a world class player.

2114~~~
I thought he had a good Old Trafford debut, he's confident on the ball, has good technique and gets stuck in, I think he'll have a good season for us.

2115~~~
Completely different type of players though. Nobody said Herrera's passing was at Kroos' level. He brings a lot more energy and pace to the game though.

2116~~~
TBF it's more of a difference in playing style. Ander is a high energy box-to-box player while Kroos is more of a conductor. There are things that Ander does which Kroos can't, especially in a purely 2 man midfield. Real played more of a 3 with Modric and James where Kroos' comparitive lack of work-rate gets masked just like with Schweinsteiger + Khedira for Germany or Schweinstiger + Lahm/ Martinez/ Thiago for Bayern.

2117~~~
He was excellent today. Love his attitude and work rate.

2118~~~
I think he'll have a good season but we shouldn't have unrealistic expectations for him either. He isn't a top class player and people will be let down if they're pinning their hopes on him making a massive difference on his own. He needs better players alongside him in midfield.

2119~~~
Yeah Herrera is more mobile and I love his energy so far, but honestly I've been a bit disappointed that, for a creative CM, he so far just didn't show the deep lying playmaking ability, I hoped he'd have. His short passing is excellent, but there are times when he gets the ball in his own half and I'd hope he'd just take the ball forward, or makes a long diagonal pass and then instead does the Clevery thing with a short side way pass. Once we got some tempo in the final 3rd he is great so far, not to mention his through balls. I just expected a bit more from him as a deep lying play maker. Like for example Luka Modric, who shares all those great attributes, but is also a fantastic deep lying playmaker.

2120~~~
That's not his game though, he's Spanish so plays like most other spanish players, but with the bite and energy\ to his game and not quite as good on the ball as the best spanish midfielders. His playing style on the ball though, he doesn't do the long balls like scholes so much, and he's not a deep lying playmaker really to dictate the tempo. He likes moving about, opening space for himself to receive the ball and the quickly give it to somebody to speed up the tempo of the game. His through passes are very good of course, but you can't really expect him to play like a player that is a completely different style to him.

2121~~~
I wonder if Kroos had started his career at Bilbao you'd have the same opinion? 
I'm pretty sure it's a lot easier to play with Ribery, Schweinsteiger, Muller, Lahm, Robben, Ronaldo, Bale, Modric & Benzema than it is to play with Aduriz, Muniain, Susaeta, Llorente, Iturraspe, Rooney, Hernandez & Fletcher.

2122~~~
He's a good player. It's nice to finally have a midfielder worthy of Manchester United.

2123~~~
Kroos played with all them and was still the central hub for all Bayern's attacking play. Literally everything went through him and because one guy said he was an AM everyone jumped on the bandwagon. I would have given my left nut to see him next to Herrera. The closest young player to Scholes I've ever seen.

2124~~~
But as the creative CM, you should be atleast be able to do it on some level. Especially against deep sitting opponents like Valencia today, your creative CM should be able to make the game fast, or open up space with a good long ball. All his other great abilites aside, a very good creative CM simply needs that variety in his game to be effective against different kind of opponents. 

<a class="username" data-user="66250, @Dr Baltar" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66250/">@Dr Baltar</a>: I've watched him since his Bayern Leverkusen days, were his class was already evident. That he'd improve this much in the last year was suprising, but even with inferior team mates you could see his class at a very young age. 

I really like him and I think with a great partner along side him our midfield would be finally sorted, just that I think he needs to add a certain variety to his game to become a really great creative CM.

2125~~~
Need two more of him at least.

2126~~~
We need a world class player to partner him, this much is obvious.

2127~~~
I know his goal scoring record for Athletic is not great but I get the feeling he may help himself to a few here.

2128~~~
I'd say two. I've spent all pre season worrying about him picking up an injury I think we need 2 more CM's of similar or better class.

2129~~~
He can't be any worse than our current midfielder's contribution to goals.

2130~~~
very true.   kroos is very good passing wise.  but lacks the work rate and tackling.   will be interesting to see how madrid fare this year.

2131~~~
I'd be elated with Blind and Vidal joining Herrera and Carrick.

2132~~~
Kroos didn't lack work rate nor tackling tonight that's for sure. He'll work harder at Real Madrid without a doubt as he's outside he's comfort but he's a fantastic footballer and a much much better midfielder than any one we have.

2133~~~
I think expectations were raised a bit too high after that first game where he took the piss out of LA Galaxy. He was extremely highly rated by many in Spain, coming up against better opposition has shown that he's not going to just seamlessly be amazing for us but with time I'm sure he will be very highly rated here as well. And even having said that you can tell he has some great qualities already, some things we've been crying out for, but there's still more to come

2134~~~
Don't get me wrong, he's a fantastic player & I would have loved to have had him here.

Stick him in Bilbao's team from a young age, where they don't play the best football in the league & don't have all the best players & let me know if everyone bums him this much.

I can guarantee you a lot of people commenting here are basing their views on Herrera on what they've seen this pre-season & they haven't really watched him before. He still hasn't got going properly yet but if you stuck him in Madrid's team tonight everyone would be calling him top class. I think the midfielder that's playing with Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema, Rodriguez & Modric is going to look better than the one playing with Mata, Rooney, Hernandez & Fletcher.

2135~~~
I don't really see the comparison with Scholes, but it is definitely nice to see someone with energy and grit in midfield, a refreshing change.

2136~~~
Did ok but I think people are willing him to do well so much that they see performances that aren't there.

You could definitely make a case for him being the least impressive of all our CMs tonight. That's including last season's scapegoats Marouane Fellaini and Tom Cleverley.

Put in a couple of decent tackles and ran round a lot but didn't anything remotely memorable in an attacking sense and seemed to get the weight and direction slightly wrong on a lot of his passes.

2137~~~
Ah, he was better than Fletcher and Cleverley. Remember his ball to Young before the Rooney penalty? And some of his touches were sublime. Nothing incredible but it's not as if Fletcher or Cleverley were excellent. Fellaini was okay but scored a goal. He's currently our best midfielder, but that's not saying much.

2138~~~
The ball over the top to Young was his best moment so far for me, throughout the entire pre-season. The ball to Hernandez that people were fawning over was crap. It was a nothing ball that required Chicharito to play an inch perfect cross as there was only Rooney in the immediate vicinity. His pass today, on the other hand, was inch perfect and he played it whilst shrugging off an opposition midfielder. It allowed our forwards time to get into the box and was angled away from the fullback so he couldn't even close Young down without selling himself.

I agree though, some of the crap people are coming out with is a bit laughable. Fellaini gets hammered for hitting people whilst Herrera is applauded for having bite and ferocity, lol...

Also, I think LVG has been experimenting with him and Fletcher. It's like they're both occupying a holding role with neither venturing forward too often.

2139~~~
I do. It was slightly over-hit. Young did really well to wrap his foot round it. The Fletcher through ball which Rooney couldn't quite control was better.

Neither Fletcher nor Cleverley were excellent but they passed the ball much more consistently and accurately than Hererra and had as much of an impact going forward as he did. That one pass to Young aside, what else did he actually do with the ball that caused Valencia any problems?

2140~~~
He certainly attempted to link midfield and attack more than most, our front three remained anonymous for the most part in the game unfortunately. Thought he did well and was certainly on par, at least, with any of our other midfielders tonight. It was a pre-season game though so I'm not going to read too much into it. But Herrera, for me, is by far our best midfielder currently... Which still worries me regarding our midfield.

2141~~~

2142~~~

2143~~~
Don't think he's been great in preseason, at all. His passing has been wayward at times and he's given away a lot of fouls. This guy is definitely a work in progress.

2144~~~
I think a lot on here got a little carried away because he was our first midfield signing in like seven years. His been a little up and down so far, passing has been a little suspect as well.

2145~~~
I think that's an accurate observation, we will be better with him in the team but there is still room for improvement on his part. If it comes together for him he will be immense.

2146~~~
People are overrating his performances. He's been ok at best

2147~~~
He's a dynamic midfielder with great technique, fantastic at moving the ball forward with quick one touch passing, can spray the ball about and likes to put a foot in, that's why we're getting carried away, so what he miss places a few passes, he's a proper midfielder at last.

2148~~~
Pfft.. No we're not. He's been quite good even in the absence of a top class midfield counterpart.. Herrera will improve as he gets used to the team sure. But he's been much better tha "ok at best"..

2149~~~
I was buzzing when we signed him and might have overrated him myself because well we finally signed a midfielder. I'll obviously let him settle before finally judging him but we really need to get a top quality player next to him I mean he had better midfielders in Martinez, Itturaspe, Rico and Benat the he does at United.

2150~~~
He's had his moments here and there but overall, the praise on this thread has been over the top.

2151~~~
Those with a complex against supposed popular players have a tendency of appearing in the same kind of threads with peculiarly similar observations. As if they take it upon themselves, quite gladly, to be the one considered reasonable and just. Really, it's just a bit picky and boring.

2152~~~
And also because his first performance, against LA Galaxy, was genuinely great, with a lot of fast forward incisive passing and a lot of grit.

I agree that he's not been amazing in pre-season, but he looks solid and he's a huge improvement on everything we have in midfield. I'd still really like it if we could sign one other top notch midfielder, I think we need it.

2153~~~
The backspin he put on the pass for Young made it the killer ball it was.

2154~~~
Yeah the Galaxy performance was something we haven't seen from one of our midfielders in a long time so expectations would have gone up.

Agree, place in a top quality midfielder alongside him and he'll shine.

2155~~~
He was amazing against Galaxy and has done 'ok' since then but i think its pretty clear he's the best midfielder we have atm.

2156~~~
It's pre-season, he's not going to push himself to the level he was at on his debut consistently. I'll judge him properly when we need to start winning games for three points or otherwise.

2157~~~
Looks a great addition but I fear he will get sent off a few times this season if he doesn't tone his tackling down a bit.

2158~~~
He's good, the whole squad needs time to settle and gel. He's spent most of his United time so far jetting around America so let's just see how he (and the team as a whole) plays when LVG has found his best 11 and they're playing together every week.

2159~~~
I've been impressed with how vocal he is on the pitch, especially for a new foreign player. He's very un-Spanish with the way he challenges opponents. He seems to love a bit of a scrap for the ball.

2160~~~
Yep, I think he might pick up a couple of reds and a few yellows, he likes to get stuck in. I'd rather that than players ghosting away from challenges though.

2161~~~
since about 09/10 we havent had a person who gets about the place and hassles the opposition like Fletcher used to. We finally get one and people are pleading for him to calm down. No winning with some of you lot.

2162~~~
Just to clarify, I said he'd pick up a couple of reds cos I just think he will, but I'm actually delighted we have someone who's willing to go into challenges and who doesn't shy away from the physical aspect of the game. It's crucial for us.

It's just fairly sensible to believe that given that aspect of his game, I won't be surprised to see him sent off once or twice this season. There was already one game in pre season, not sure which one, where he probably should have been sent off tbf.

2163~~~
He made about 3 or 4 bookable challenges in that game, so I see your point. However, none of them were worthy of a straight red and when he did eventually get booked he didn't give the ref any chance to book him from that point onwards.

Of course, I don't think he picked up a yellow card until the 80th minute or so...

2164~~~
I think we still have to give him some time. He was playing a different role and system last season right?

2165~~~
The posters telling everyone else that they're overrating him are the ones who don't seem to understand what sort of player he is. He's not a stereotypical Spanish keep-ball player, and never has been. He's not about percentage passing, he's about dynamism and aggressive passing. We bought him for his movement, his energy and his through-balls (more than anyone except Fabregas in last season's La Liga, wasn't it?), not for his pass completion rate.

And you can't complement the quick one-two football we've been playing but then criticise Herrera, either. He is the reason we've been able to do it.

2166~~~
His problem is his passing is inconsistent. One minute he pimps a perfect 60 yarder, the next he fecks up a simple pass. If he can improve this aspect of his game, he will be amazing.

2167~~~
Are you sure? I'll have to trust you on this one as I watched a lot of these games being completely shattered and I can't even remember which one it was right now, but in my mind, there was one game where he was booked, not especially early in the game but not 80th (I'd say around the hour mark) and made a couple of clearly bookable offences after that but was lucky it was pre-season basically and the ref didn't want to send him off. 

In any case, he knows how to get stuck in.
Yeah agree with this, I didn't really know much about him before we got him apart from when he'd played us so I was pleasantly surprised. Though, not really related to over or under rating him, that incisiveness to his passing hasn't always been on display throughout the tour, which is just what some of us are a tad disappointed about. But to even say 'disappointed' is making too big of a deal about it I think, I'm delighted we have him and he's definitely the best CM we have at the moment. 

And, in line with what we're discussing above, that physical aspect to his game is very good to see as well as we've missed that immensely.

2168~~~
They've been noticeably absent since the LA Galaxy game.

2169~~~
It's strange. He's looked a completely different type of player since that game. More combative than creative.

2170~~~
He produced three very good ones just last night. It's not his fault if the strikers don't turn them into goals.

2171~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> who said it was a bad thing?

2172~~~
To be fair those through balls came from when he was moved into the no.10 role.

2173~~~
I think people are going overboard with some of his performances. His best game was undoubtedly against LA Galaxy, who were by far the worst opposition we have faced, but none of his performances following that match have come remotely close to that sublime performance. He's clearly a quality player and someone who adds to our midfield and will improve, but he's not without his faults. Definitely our best midfielder, but I suspect there is certainly a lot more to come.

Just to elaborate on a few of his weaker sides to his game, I wouldn't include tackling or his combative nature in that side of things. He is what he is and our midfield has been so passive and tentative for years, it's vital we possess a player like Herrera and he is always going to be prone to a few poor challenges. What slightly concerns me, is not so much his passing itself, but his use of the ball in certain areas of the pitch. His passing is generally impressive. However, I've noticed how frequently he gives away possession in our own half - not just last night, but throughout the tour - and this is when 5v4's in favour of the opposition can occur, when he's often the deepest midfielder. 

The signs aren't ominous that he will continue to make those mistakes, but it could prove decisive against very good pressing sides. Another thing is his tendency to overcook passes. He has excellent vision and can execute very impressive through-balls, but his consistency in doing so fluctuates a bit too much and the direction and weight is often off when attempting what should be considered a relatively simple - compared to others - pass. If he can find a better balance between his passes in our third and the oppositions, he will be far more lethal and potentially less liable.

That's just a few criticisms, but I'm very excited to see how he develops here. On a more positive note, some of his touches are exquisite and his awareness of teammates around him is incredible. A very well-rounded player.

2174~~~
You sure? I don't remember any. The best (and only?) through balls of the night came from Young and Fletcher (both to Rooney)

They even did a little montage of his best bits on MUTV and the only remotely penetrative pass they could come up was that (admittedly very nice) pass he pinged out to Young in the corner. Apart from that, the only highlights they could come up with was a couple of neat little flicks and touches. No through balls.

2175~~~
Yeah. Which is slightly concerning. He's looked way more impressive as a 10 (where we're already over-stocked) than he has in deeper positions (where we're woefully short of real class)

2176~~~
It is indeed slightly concerning. Last season Hererra was pushed higher up and excelled in that role as a playmaker. He had Ituraspe and Rico behind him to protect the defense and do the dirty work. Hopefully he will adapt to the deeper role here but there will be less room for mistakes in your own half.

2177~~~
Indeed. Ander had one good season in a deeper role under Bielsa but other than that his best performances have always been playing further up the pitch - at Zaragoza and at Athletic Club.

He's never been that consistent though so I don't think anyone should be surprised at his performances being at different levels (assuming they have been, I've only seen him play against Liverpool where I thought he played well for about 20 minutes in the 2nd half and sloppy/rash for the rest).

2178~~~

2179~~~
I wish Mata was my friend.

2180~~~
Same, haha!

2181~~~
Me too, I finally get to share a birthday with a United player.  Hopefully we will celebrate many birthdays together <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I love him, face of an angel and a nasty little bugger. Just what we needed. Nobody will boss him about. Not frightened of shouting at colleagues either. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2192~~~
Aren't there a lot of rumours that Mata is exactly that?

Which might explain why he's attracting so much man love on here.

2193~~~
There was an article in the Mail around the time he joined that looked to me like they were suggesting. The Mail keeping it classy as usual, if so.

2194~~~
No idea, he's far too handsome to be straight though. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2195~~~
I have an idea, if we're so rich, why not just buy all of Spain? We have the money, they need it. No brainer.

2196~~~
Because then City would buy the Netherlands and you'd be screwed.

2197~~~
Yeah but Holland = Rich, Spain = F*cked

All that's missing is confirmation he's got the Grindr app on his phone...

Great read that.

2222~~~
Great lad, he won't be a moment's problem for any manager. Top player and professional.

2223~~~
Smart kid. Really refreshing to read some of that stuff. 

“I still enjoy football. I love football. I love my profession. What I don’t like is cases where owners prioritise their interests over the club’s. Football can’t be solely about profit. Look, no one’s stupid: no one wants to lose money but nor should it be about people getting rich off people’s dreams.”

2224~~~
Thanks for posting that <a class="username" data-user="72055, @MancunianAngels" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/72055/">@MancunianAngels</a>. Great read. At this rate he'll be vying for Mata's likeable crown. Interesting guy, real football nut. Can't wait to see him in action particularly in matches against rival teams, his baby face certainly deceives!

2225~~~
Loved that, thanks.

Comes across as a really interesting guy with his head firmly on his shoulders. He's going to be fine here.

2226~~~
I came here to post that paragraph too. This kids love for the game is great to read. You don't see many footballers talking with that sort of passion these days.

2227~~~
They go and trademark themselves instead.

TC23...

2228~~~
Came across really well in that interview. It's so refreshing having someone here who was desperate to play for us. I think he'll have a cracking season.

2229~~~
Haha, awesome interview. Love his enthusiasm. So happy for him that he wanted to play for the club. You can see he will eventually become a manager when he stops playing.

2230~~~
great interview - he is obviously far more articulate than your average footballer

was suprised that he compares himself to Nigel De Jong and lists Cleverley as one of the leaders in the squad!

2231~~~
Might explain why he´s played in a more restrained way for us (and also why he´s been happy to put the boot in! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>)

Seriously speaking, I think Herrera understands that he can´t get too far ahead of the play in Van Gaal´s system as Mata is a dedicated #10. If he goes wandering off to join our attacks and we lose the ball we risk getting overrun on the counter. He's shaping his game to suit the Van Gaal philosophy.

Very nice interview. Great piece of work by Sid Lowe.

2232~~~
Loving our Spanish contingent. Mata, Herrera and Dave are probably my three favourite players at the moment.

2233~~~
Bit of the Guardiola in him, a smart midfielder who meticulously studies the game off the pitch.


Also, props to Sid Lowe. Best sports journalist out there in my books.

2234~~~
I'm starting to think we've signed the nicest three men in spain, or are they all that nice out there ?

2235~~~
Sergio Ramos provides an entire nation's worth of cuntishness all on his own.

2236~~~
If only more players were like him I'm sure we'd sign more <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

<3 <3<3

2238~~~
That really is a ridiculously good interview. 3/4s of the Caf can't chat as good a game as that.

2239~~~
Does anyone else think he has the makings of a great trainer coach one day ? Really impressed by his articulation and general football knowledge. Seems an analytical student of the game :



Comes across as genuinely humble and complementary to the senior squad figures too. The likes of him will be an asset in the dressing room and a credit to our club.

2240~~~
Proper student of the game. Love players like that. Also he seems a proper down to earth lad who understands the club which is rare in football these days.

Mata and Herrera must be the nicest footballers out there.

I can see Herrera becoming the new Evra in terms of the eloquence with which he speaks and being influential in the dressing room.

2241~~~
We need a chant for him

2242~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Ander Herrera: I would never have left Bilbao but for Manchester United</b></span>
The Spaniard has many footballing heroes - from Sir Bobby Charlton to Luciano Galletti – and the great enthusiast of the game wants to become a winner at Old Trafford

On the first day Ander Herrera walked into Carrington he was met by Sir Bobby Charlton. Just when he thought it could not get any better. The photograph is one of his prized possessions, his profile picture on Twitter, and Herrera looks almost offended when he is asked if he really knew anything about the man who <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/27/manchester-united-european-cup-wembley-1968" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">won the European Cup</a> and played 758 times for Manchester United, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/26/ander-herrera-signs-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the club Herrera had just joined</a>. “Of course,” he shoots back. “Those of us who like football know about him and I love football.”

It does not take long to realise that it is no exaggeration; as he talks, the enthusiasm is clear.

It is a wet Wednesday afternoon 15 miles south of Manchester and Herrera has just arrived with Juan Mata from Carrington, where he is drawn to the photographs on the walls; historic moments at “perhaps the world’s biggest club”. Bigger, Herrera says, than even he imagined.

“You go to the US and there are a thousand people outside the hotel. You play Real Madrid and there are 109,000 people, almost all in United shirts, 80,000 against LA Galaxy, 60,000 against Roma. Every day at Carrington there’s someone else I haven’t met yet. You get a sense of the magnitude of the club. You go into the dressing room and see Fletcher, Carrick, Rooney, Van Persie, guys who have won it all and been at the highest level for 10 years, not two or three.”

“I would never have left Athletic if it hadn’t been for a club like United. I left a different, unique club, with a special philosophy and incredible people. It’s a club that few of us have had the privilege of playing for and, who knows, but for United I might have been there 10 years. But this is the biggest club in England, a new project, new players and a new coach. Desire too: it’s been 25 years and the players are conscious of that. They’re determined to put United back where it belongs.”

Herrera continues: “I’m 25 tomorrow [Thursday] and I thought it was the right time. I wasn’t thinking: ‘The train’s leaving, the train’s leaving … ’ but United is an opportunity you can’t turn down.”

It is also an opportunity Herrera might have thought had passed him by: the train had already left once, last summer.

“Much more was said than really happened,” he insists. “From my point of view, it’s simple: United made an offer to Athletic, I told the clubs to talk, I would listen and Athletic turned it down. United offered a lot of money but not the buyout clause. Athletic said no and that’s it.”

This time, United did pay the €36m clause. “In Spain, players have an official price tag, just like shirts hanging in a shop do,” Herrera explains. “It wasn’t a difficult decision.” A year on, the move happened.

“I hadn’t been wondering what might have been or worrying over whether they’d return. It was going from ‘very, very good’ to ‘excellent’; it wasn’t escaping a bad situation. I was happy in Bilbao, so my thoughts were on enjoying playing for Athletic … we made it to the Champions League, so it’s safe to say I enjoyed it and gave everything. I understand that there are people who didn’t like me leaving but most understand that this is United.

“I didn’t talk to Louis van Gaal, I spoke to the club but I knew he was demanding, very sincere and direct, and he has shown that. He says things to your face. He protects you and supports you when you’re doing your bit. He’s very disciplined, the team always comes first and he doesn’t let you relax. Every training session has to count and I like that.

“One of the things I’ve liked about Van Gaal is that he gives <i>mucha, mucha, mucha</i> importance to the ball, to possession. He believes that if we have the ball it’s easier to attack. It’s not ‘ball or run’, they’re not separate things. Run, yes but with the ball. I prefer that; you don’t get as tired.”

Herrera sees some parallels with Marcelo Bielsa, his coach at Athletic before Ernesto Valverde. “He’s vigorous, intense, he gesticulates a lot.” However, was Bielsa as <i>loco</i> as they said? “Yes,” Herrera replies, “but a <i>loco bueno</i>. That’s a good thing: he thinks about football 24 hours a day, I’d never seen anyone work so much, analyse opponents so well.

“Van Gaal’s sessions have some similarities: he’s hands on. Bielsa made me a better player and I’m sure Van Gaal will, too.”

Herrera may look slight, young, too, but there is something in his initial response: “winner”.Colleagues say he is <i>pesado</i>: relentless, tough, hard-working, always talking. A pain. He knows referees’ names, linesmen’s, too; he reads the game superbly, both tactically and emotionally. He knows football inside out and has, they say, an innate ability to empathise. He’s a players’ player. A leader.

“It’s very, very, very early to say that,” he counters. “I see myself as a worker, shoulder to shoulder with my team-mates. Responsibility? Yes, always but I don’t see myself as the saviour of anything or more than anyone else. A leader? ‘Leader’ is a big word at United. We have leaders like Rooney, Van Persie, Fletcher, Cleverly … I’m here to contribute. Maybe one day I can be considered a leader. Not now.”

That idea of a players’ player is compelling and Herrera is a fans’ player, too. The son of a footballer who played for Zaragoza between 1982 and 1988 and later became sporting director, he sees the game differently – from the pitch, the dressing room, the boardroom and the stands.

During the tour, Herrera met David Beckham. “A legend,” he says. What he did not tell Beckham was how much he enjoyed one of his worst moments. In 2004, the Englishman scored a superb free-kick to give Real Madrid the lead in the Copa del Rey final only to lose 3-2 to Zaragoza in extra time. That began a slide that culminated in a historic three-year trophy drought. Herrera, a Zaragoza fan who began going at the age of “four or five”, was there. “In the corner where Galletti’s goal went in,” he says, beaming. Luciano Galletti’s goal was the second, right? “No,” he grins, “it was the orgasm! The winner.”

Galletti is one of Herrera’s idols. He runs through others. Soon he’s on a roll that is eloquent in itself. “Gustavo Poyet. Juan Esnáider. Galletti. Aimar. Cani, who is still playing. Fernando Cáceres. Nayim. Milito … <i>both</i> Militos. Santi Aragón: he’s maybe the one I’m most like in style. David Villa. Andoni Cedrún, the goalkeeper.” There’s enthusiasm in every word and admiration in every name – and there are lots of names.

As the list grows and conversation heads to other teams, it is tempting to conclude that every player is his idol – and, in a way, every player is.

One of the most striking things about talking to him is the number of footballers he mentions, as if determined not to forget anyone, and the respectful, almost reverential tone with which he does so. <i>Ilusión</i> is a word he uses often, too. Enthusiasm, hopes, dreams.

Football is Herrera’s vocation, one he defends and is proud of; one he is protective of. He says he is a <i>futbolero</i>, a lover of the game, and a <i>forófo</i>: a fanatic, “transformed” by it, even when watching his friend Fernando Amorebieta play for Fulham. As Spanish football confronts a crisis, he has not remained silent. He likes the game too much.

He has supported protests at Real Zaragoza, backed Real Murcia players as their club went through the courts, suffering an administrative relegation then promotion again, and spoke out about empty seats at the Europa League final. “You read that Sevilla fans and Benfica fans haven’t got tickets, and then see an empty space and, well, something’s wrong … ” he says.

“I’m not trying to be anyone. I just see it as doing for others what you’d like them to do for you,” he adds. “There are clubs in Spain that aren’t solvent and players with the same <i>ilusión</i> as me, the same desire and professionalism, who find themselves in bad situations.

“I still enjoy football. I love football. I love my profession. What I don’t like is cases where owners prioritise their interests over the club’s. Football can’t be solely about profit. Look, no one’s stupid: no one wants to lose money b ut nor should it be about people getting rich off people’s dreams.”

<i>Futbolero, forófo</i> … There’s another Spanish word for people like him too: <i>friki</i>. A bit of an anorak, an enthusiast. The passion goes back a long way. It is not only Zaragoza players he mentions. He talks about Andrés Iniesta, Juan Román Riquelme and Memphis Depay. The PSV player’s first name momentarily escapes him, so Herrera looks it up. It matters.

It is a familiar routine. Herrera’s dad was technical secretary at Zaragoza, Ander his unofficial assistant. “He’d travel to games and phone me up: ‘Put the telly on and watch him, him and him.’ I’d have been 12 or 13 and I’d be there, writing it down. Then I’d report back: ‘I liked the No7, I didn’t like him, I did like him … ’

“I watched a lot of football. A lot. I still do. Last season I watched some pretty <i>friki</i> games. Second division, Copa Libertadores, the Brazilian league, the Argentinian league. I like to watch Boca, for Riquelme. I’ve seen … ” there’s a pause. “Yeah, some <i>friki</i> matches. I watch a lot. I love it.

“I don’t know if my perspective is different because my dad played but I’ve always admired footballers: second division players, second division B players. When I was a kid anyone who played professionally I admired intensely – and now here I am at Manchester United. Imagine.”



I love him already. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2243~~~
Wonder what Scholes see's in him to doubt he's a centre mid? Scholes reckons he's another #10 but don't see that myself.

2244~~~
Wow. Rare you read young footballer THAT passionate about football. Proper captain material. 

Now, compare it to Rooney's interview.

2245~~~
That is a fantastic interview. The kid has a great mindset towards the game and his overall enthusiasm is really admirable. It won't be long until he's a fan favorite.

2246~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> My guy

2247~~~
Might not be a pure #10 like Mata or Kagawa but he'd likely do best as the furthest midfielder in a 4-3-3. His partner in a 3-4-1-2 needs to really be a very defensive aware midfielder like Carrick.

2248~~~
Best of luck to him today. Hoping he has a big one.

2249~~~
Yeah, I don't agree with that either. Very odd statement considering how when he played as a number 10 for Bilbao he looked like a central midfielder played out of position rather than the opposite.

2250~~~
That is one focused intelligent, thoughtful young man. I also believe him when he cares about the club and plight of fans. A manager in the making maybe.

2251~~~
That interview shows he's had a really good and grounded upbringing. So yeah, he could have a managerial career.

2252~~~
Great interview! I love him, we need more players like him, genuine professionals who clearly love the game and are loyal to the club. Swoon! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2253~~~
A lot of players are well trained in PR and just say the right thing's they are told, but you can tell Herrera is just a genuine football fan and all round top bloke. 
Players like him and Mata are definitely the right type for this club.

2254~~~
It sounds like his dad was using him as a scout when he was a teenager.

Good education for a young player to have.

2255~~~
He said this is a new <b>project</b>. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I always wanted a player to say that about us.

2256~~~
Such a nice interview,enjoyed reading that. Always felt the English journalists did the players a disservice by not making interviews a bit intellectual like this one. He is so grounded, he ll be a fan favorite in no time. Instead of becoming a manager maybe he should get into organizations running the game like UEFA or FIFA..

2257~~~
Played well today and was a massive part in us taking control if midfield, which we lost after he was subbed. 

Clear that Swansea had marked him out for a kicking before the game. Stood up to it well though. Shelvey was probably wondering what he'd have to do to get rid of him. Then his number was held to by the fourth official...

2258~~~
Agree and if he had stayed on Shelvey would have been off eventually.

2259~~~
No idea why he got subbed, was comfortably one of our best players. Good energy, had good touches, and some good passes. Wasn't amazing or anything, but was much better then most of the others.

2260~~~
He played well in comparison to Fletcher. I'm not sure that qualifies it as a good performance. A lot of backwards passing and some free kick winning. He'll need to be a lot better than that.

2261~~~
His sub was puzzling. He wasn't outstanding but he was the only one really forcing it.

Could've linked with Mata more often but we fell apart completely when he went off and showed few signs of coming back.

2262~~~
The drop in performance after he got subbed off was ridiculous. If only we could get a good defensive midfielder to partner him.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2263~~~
Clearly does when he goes off and we lose the midfield, the momentum and the match.

What we saw from Herrera was not Redondo reborn, but a competent enough performance to free up the guys in front of him. After his substitution we parted like the Red Sea before Moses.

2264~~~
Really enjoyed watching him today, gonna be real good for us. Fair few misplaced passes, but you don't mind that as they were fecking forward passes(are you watching, everyone else in Man Utd's midfield...", trying to make something happen. Massive mistake taking him off.

We finally have a "project" praise Moyes! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Took a bit of a kicking, took it well though, and kept battling. This is where we missed some of the old guard, like Giggs, (last season for Januzaj, notably), who'd stick someone right back and take his card to make them cop on. The sort of bite I was hoping last year that Fellaini would add.

2265~~~
Effectively kicked out of the game.

2266~~~
He is pulling a Büttner from what I gather...i.e., exceptional debut, but his other performances has been mostly average to good to unnoticable. He needs competition and I am sure a player like Kovacic will provide that. If not, I would not oppose playing kagawa or Powell as the number 8.

2267~~~
Well yeah, he was better than Fellaini and Fletcher who were both awful. It doesn't mean he was particularly good. I think people have been so desperate for a midfielder they're convincing themselves they've seen something that wasn't there. Most of our possession was in defence and we were slowly pushing for a goal so didn't dick about with the ball quite so much at the back meaning we weren't keeping the ball as well. More than the substitution cost us.

2268~~~
Wasn't impressive. It was almost like he was a new signing thrown into a desperately ordinary side or something.

The black hole in our midfield will swallow Herrera whole. Promising player but he is some distance from being top class atm, it's actually unfair on him how much we need him to perform.

2269~~~
I'm glad you are not the manager then. Kagawa isn't suited to the number eight role and Powell is nowhere near ready for this level.

2270~~~
Critics are out in full force. Baseless judgments.

2271~~~
He will improve us a lot but he still looks like he will need 6 months to get used to the tempo of the league. In the first half Swansea were dominating possession in central midfield which is frightening considering we were the home team that supposedly had the in form central midfield trio of Fletcher, Mata and Herrera

2272~~~
I said I would not oppose the idea, not that they should come in at the moment. If Herrera does not start pulling strings in midfield such a move would be made by a footballing managerial god.

2273~~~
Left wing back won't pass to him, right wing back won't pass to him. The center backs most certainly aren't interested in passing it to him. Obviously it all goes to shit from that point.

2274~~~
They weren't at all. Although Swansea used the ball better,they did not dominating possession at all.

2275~~~
I said on the tour games, you can see he has talent but is struggling a little to really make a difference in our side and was resoundly deafened out but I'll say it again, hes finding it difficult to impose his game here so far.

2276~~~
This x1000.

2277~~~
You could see him asking for the ball all the time, he'd get himself open, and the other players just played the safe pass sideways/backwards. Depressing.

2278~~~
I thought he was good. Didn't shy away from Shelvey taking chunks out of him and we missed him hugely when he went off. Desperately need a better player alongside him though.

2279~~~
Indeed. The tempo collapsed. The nonsense in here about this young lad is mind boggling.

2280~~~
Was surprised at him being subbed, even more so when it was Fellaini coming on.

2281~~~
The team need to start using his and Mata's passing more and stop lumping it out wide at every chance.

2282~~~
He had a better player next to him. Fletcher.

Herrera was poor. 27 million! Jees!

2283~~~
He was decent today I thought. Not amazing but decent. Needs more quality around him and needed much more help from Mata too. I thought his sub was a really baffling one as Fletcher was having a bit of a mare and should have been the one to make way.

2284~~~
Worst player on the pitch. Don't get his fanboys. Should've been subbed at halftime.

2285~~~
Any judgements would be baseless at this stage be they good or bad. As it is I don't see anyone saying he's a bad player. Unless I've missed something you can point out for me.

2286~~~
I think we'll see him grow into the team as the weeks crack on... played very much within himself today and was keeping it extremely safe.

2287~~~
Who for?

2288~~~
Not sure if you're winding me up or you honestly think Fletcher is better?

2289~~~
I love this lad and he was one of our better players. Odd that he was subbed rather than Fletcher.

He is a little Spanish maestro but who gets stuck in and harries opponents.

2290~~~
He was decent at most, nothing special, looks like he can do nothing wrong in the eyes of some.

2291~~~
This is a lad playing his first PL game for United, I will let him off for maybe being a bit nervous, the others out there had no excuse. Pre-season games are a lot different to league games and he didn't hide even though he was getting a kicking.

2292~~~
He did about as well as he could under the circumstances. It's not easy for a new signing to play in an unknown league at the best of times, it's even worse when he's playing for an underperforming side.

He has all the tools to succeed here. I really don't understand the criticism of him today, he did alright.

2293~~~
He had some bad passes but he made some good ones as well and did well in closing down the opponent (a bit excessively imo). Was shocked when he was subbed off only way to justify that is if he was injured but I hope that was not the case. We all knew that Herrera on his own will not solve our midfield woes. We need to buy, simple.

2294~~~
No he wasn't, Hernandez was worse as was Fletcher.

2295~~~
Fletcher was certainly better than Herrera - regardless of Fletcher's few bad passes.

2296~~~
When Herrera came in, we were not expecting the Carrick injury. We were funnily enough expecting more midfield signings as well.

2297~~~
We need a top class partner for him, otherwise teams will take him out of the game and we lose control of the midfield, they are always targeting him. After the Galaxy game, Roma, Inter and Liverpool were on him too. There is no movement in front of him to play some passes, but he plays a bit reserved at the moment too. Maybe thats his role under LvG, but he has a lot more to offer than he shows at the moment. Thought he was one of our better players today. Fletcher was terrible by the way.

2298~~~
Was he hell as like. Give over. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2299~~~
ermmm no

2300~~~
What did Fletcher bring that Herrera didn't? Herrera pressed really well, passed it reliably apart from like 1 or 2 passes, and provided a lot of energy. There's a reason why we collapsed once he came off.

2301~~~
Yeah he was ok ish but certainly not what has been missing from our midfield all this time

2302~~~
He's a missing piece but we need more pieces.

2303~~~
Carrick isnt getting any younger. Fletcher/Fellaini/Cleverley are not the kind of players we need to compete at the highest level. Herrera is by no means the sec ond coming of Scholes or Xavi but I do believe that he is a quality player. Needs someone beside him to help the team.

2304~~~
I think it is safe to say that Fletcher has been a better midfielder than Herrera? I am not sure what consensus has been, but Fletcher looks to be the one that has been pulling the string in our midfield.

Beside Galaxy and few other matches as a hypothetical, Herrera is not doing the number 8 role justice. He has made some great diagonals, but I have not seen the throughball passes which he was so good at with at Bilbao since the Galaxy game. His performance has dropped for reason unbeknownst to me,

2305~~~
Hernandez is a striker. He and Rooney weren't getting any service from the wingers or midfield in the first half. Fletcher was way better than Herrera - that's why the latter got subbed.

2306~~~
Exactly, he's not the type of player who is going to win games on his own. He'd be brilliant in the right system though.

2307~~~
In fairness Fletcher was terrible, even on the ball when he actually found someone, it took him ages to get it out of his feet and release it, slowed us down possibly the most of the entire side, it's no surprise Herrera was better of the pair based on just that fact, but I guess LvG thought Fletcher had the experience in the side or something? who knows.

2308~~~
His performances so far have been solid but not spectacular.

It will go unnoticed by a lot, but he was asking for the ball constantly and he played some decent passes forward that were very close to coming off.

But 2 sloppy goals were conceded today so the attacking players will be critised for not scoring enough, but once the back line is full strength his qualities will be easier to appreciate.

2309~~~
I'am just gone go out and say it, not worth his transfer price at all.

2310~~~
Definitely not an overreaction. And did you see the other players on the field today? Hardly our worst player.

2311~~~
I think it's because he wanted to have 1 defensive minded on the pitch while putting on Fellain to have the long ball option. Should have taken off Mata if that was the case though IMO.

2312~~~
Couldn't understand him bring Nani on as he is another one who is supposedly off, like Hernandez. I would have tried Kagawa. Herrera was better than Fletcher.

2313~~~
Herrera was poor. Out of his depth. Understandable for a player new to the Premiership. We collapsed - we lost 2-1! We played better in the second half when Adnan and (I hate to say this), Nani came on.

2314~~~
If we wanted him we had no choice on the price, we will have to get over it.

2315~~~
Fletcher seems to be playing as a deep-lying playmaker type, holding the fort for Herrera. I don't think he's very good at it though. His best attributes were always his drive and energy, not his passing.

He had Iturraspe alongsdie him playing that role at Bilbao and I doubt you'll find many that would rate the Darren Fletcher of 2014 above him. Certainly not in that role anyway.

I think it's far too early to be saying he isn't doing the role justice. The whole team underperformed today; even experienced players like Mata and Rooney created very little. He did relatively well.

2316~~~
Spot on TBF. Let's judge a player acclimatizing to a new country, new culture, new league, new teammates, new system in his very first competitive match. Seems rational enough.

2317~~~
We played better in the second half until Herrera came off. How was he out of his depth? He did nothing wrong, barely gave the ball away and got fouled loads, along with him providing a lot of energy and quick passing as I said before. If he was poor, the rest of the team were awful, he looked like one of the few decent players.

2318~~~
He is our best midfielder of that I'am convinced, but that is no great achievement if you look at what he is up against. He hasn't convinced me off his quality yet, but I'am willing to give him more time to do that, atleast a season or two. Yet his price tag was as high as what Chelsea paid for Fabregas or Real for Kroos, now I know the situations ain't comparable, but I'am just not sure if he was worth the investment, time will tell.

2319~~~
Unless Herrera got an injury I'm not aware off, he got subbed because he was poor. Certainly poorer than Fletcher.

2320~~~
Way to not sound knee jerk...
Anyways, 30m doesn't get you world class players nowadays. 40-50m does. Herrera is a very good player but isn't a deep lying playmaker, so I'm not sure why so many are expecting him to fill that role for us. He's not going to, it's not his game. He's a box to box.

2321~~~
Yea as good a shout as any to be fair.

2322~~~
This.

2323~~~
More likely is that van gaal wanted to go more direct, so given that fletcher is the only defensive mid, he didn't have much of a choice. It was mata or Herrera but mata still can offer the set piece threat so he kept him on.

2324~~~
Better quality round him and he will get even better.

2325~~~
I think we certainly overpaid for him but that doesn't particularly bother me given our weakness in that area and the lack of signings since. 

He'll justify his fee in the same way Carrick did: by being an important part of the team for years to come. He isn't going to suddenly become a midfielder on the same level as Cesc/Kroos though.

2326~~~
Kroos and Fabregas went for 30m, Sanchez altough he aint a midfielder did aswell.

2327~~~
No he wasn't.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2328~~~
Like you said before, different situations. Kroos had a year left on his contract, fabregas was being pushed out so obviously leaves for cheaper them normal. Apart from those two, what world class midfielder was available?

2329~~~
He did well. Happy with his display.

2330~~~
He was marginally better than Fletcher and improving 2nd half.

Shouldn't have been subbed.

2331~~~
Rakitic went for €20m this summer

Last winter Matic for €25m, last summer Strootman for €20m

I'am not mad we bought Herrera but he is worth €25m at most, not €36m, but I understand the contract situation and if he was the only one available then I get why we took the bullet, yet doesn't change the fact he ain't worth his transfer price.

2332~~~
He reverted to 442 to give defence more protection after Mata failed to back track his man who scored a goal. If he wanted to go direct then it didn't work. Gaal is still learning about his new players.

2333~~~
It's one of those where he's not worth it now but could be worth it long term given our situation in midfield and him still being young. And yes, we missed out on all of those for whatever reason. Now there isn't really anybody left. Vidal is the dream signing, then there's potentially khedira if we go for him (which we should). Herrera had a release clause and that was the only way to buy somebody from Atletico.

2334~~~
I thought he was average overall with 2 or 3 moments of pure class in a move with a nice touch, skill or pass. Pretty much the same as Kagawa's performances as a cm on tour. A couple of nice bits and pieces but ultimately not convincing enough.

Still the main problem in CM was definitely Fletcher

2335~~~
Don't think its that. We clearly started hoofing it at the end, mata went to centre mid and fellaini up top. It didn't work of course, but its what he tried.

2336~~~
No one played well today. Are you guys going to go to ever player thread and systematically criticize them all? Some of you are a bunch of babies. Grow up move on.

2337~~~
Well yea don't need to call me knee jerk because i'am stating the obvious fact he ain't worth his transfer price. Knee jerk would be to say he makes Fellaini look like a good bit of business. Sure he might be worth it in the future, we'll see. Anyway I just hope we aren't going to stop with just Herrera, we need atleast one other good midfielder, Vidal would be the bomb, but as you said Khedira wouldn't be a bad alternative.

Ow and it is Athletic, not Atletico...

2338~~~
Might as well close the football forum if we can't have discussions.

2339~~~
Ah yeah I know got them mixed up. But even if he is a little overpriced, it isn't a ridiculous amount. He cost us 29m pounds, where in reality his price is probably worth 25m. Not a huge difference. Obviously we need another player though, that much was obvious a year ago. Even only Vidal wouldn't have fixed our problems, we always needed 2 midfield signings.

2340~~~
People need to realise he's part of the solution, not the sole solution. 

We've needed two very good midfielders for about 4 years. We've got one who will enhance the attacking side from the deeper midfielders but we need one who can enhance the defensive side now.

2341~~~
We don't know how much having to look at Shelvey affected his performance. He has had a rough introduction to the PL but I think he will come on leaps and bounds if we buy a good midfield partner for him.

2342~~~
If we had bought Vidal and shoved him next to the Fletcher that played today, he would have struggled. Fletch has played most of the pre-season games. Maybe the pace of the PL was too much for him today and he will have to be used off the bench if we are ahead.

2343~~~
Thought this was his best performance since LA Galaxy.

2344~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's almost worth the infraction I'd get for insulting you.

2345~~~
I said €25m, that is like £20m, he cost us £29m, so it is a big difference.

2346~~~
After was subbed, things looked different and we lost everything. He was clearly better than other players today.

2347~~~
I thought he played well,surprised reading some comments on here slating him. He wasn't the worst player out on the field today.. One thing today did reemphasize was we need another midfielder to partner him. 

When is Carrick supposed to be back?

2348~~~
Strange substitution, Fletcher should have gone off instead

2349~~~
It made a difference when he went off obviously but he wasn't exactly brilliant either was he?

2350~~~
You have to look at the substitution that came on for him. If it had been like for like and Cleverley had come on the game wouldn't have changed as much. Ander was offering very little going forward but kept it pretty well in the back.

2351~~~
He did alright today. Bit harsh to criticise him already, he needs time to get used to English football. I am sure giving time he will be a very good player for us.

2352~~~
He was average today. Needs to play a little further up the field when we have possession of the ball. With Fletcher sitting deep, we don't need another midfielder playing as deep as Herrera played today. At times it looked like we were playing with 5 central defenders.

2353~~~
Rakitic had a release clause.
Matic said he joined Chelsea because of Mourinho, if he was elsewhere he would have joined him there
Strootman - read threads on here before he signed for Roma, no one was up in arms about us not signing him and not many rated him.

The only way we get Herrera is if we meet his release, regardless of what you think we should have paid.

2354~~~
I know, I'am just stating that he isn't any better than those players and that they have all moved for less.

2355~~~
Get the lad to the gym, he's not a kid anymore, he's mid 20's and was getting bullied by Shelvey ffs.

2356~~~
Bullied? He was getting fouled constantly, not bullied. Big difference.

2357~~~
You need to be able to stand up for yourself in this league, can you imagine Shelvey dominating Keane or Scholes like that?

2358~~~
He was the only player looking for an alternative to the standard play it out to the wing/punt it over the top, although admittedly that alternative was through balls to the wing-backs, but at least he was attempting to mix it up a little. He and Mata need to get a little closer to each other and link up more though as they're the most creative outlets you have in that sense, compared to Januzaj who is a bit more direct with the ball.

2359~~~
Shelvey wasn't dominating Herrera.

2360~~~
He was getting tripped, how the feck was he getting dominated? There is a huge difference between "dominated" and fouled constantly. Oh and considering we dominated possession and the game, despite Swansea normally being that type of team, wouldn't it be the other way around, that our midfield out performed theirs? The only difference was our defence was shite and made amateur mistakes gifting them goals.

2361~~~
Stop it, mate, you are talking way too much sense here! You are ruining the party! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Obviously, you are right. You win as a team, and United has clearly decided to play shite as a team.

2362~~~
I'd actually say Herrera was dominating Shelvey in that battle. He kept drawing Shelvey into making stupid fouls.

2363~~~
I'm giving him a free pass for a few games as he's not used to English football but I don't think he did a whole lot today, I was getting abuse from Arsenal fans asking me why Herrera wasn't playing after the 1st half. I do think he needs a proper CM alongside him.

2364~~~
It was his first premier league game, no amount of preseason games can prepare you for it. I'm sure he will have a good season. He will learn from this game.

2365~~~
Lets be honest, his first game aside against Galaxy, he's been a bit 'meh'.

2366~~~
Shelvey dominated so much that he was leaving something extra on Herrera in every challenge he made. Wow such dominance. Such ability.

We lost control of the game completely the moment he came off. It was a bizzare decision to take him off. He didn't set anything alight but there were 6 or 7 comfortably worse performances today.

2367~~~
It is why he hasn't looked great since the second half against LA Galaxy where he played a far more attacking role imo.
I think he has been asked to play that deep, but it creates a gulf in between the midfield and the attack that isn't too dissimilar from last season because Mata is playing fairly high as well.

I partly hope we get an out and out DM to allow him more freedom to get forward and link play, but at the same time even if it was just someone more dynamic he might feel more confident getting forward from time to time.

His stats from today are pretty poor. From what I remember 0 tackles, 1 interception and hardly any attacking stats, but they rarely paint the whole picture when used on their own. I was there and from what I saw with my own eyes he had a decent (if unspectacular) game and we were definitely a lot poorer after he was subbed off. He will get better as he settles in and hopefully we get him a better partner.

2368~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIoywpwqqMA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
He could get more involved but he didn't really play poorly, whenever he got the ball he looked pretty good. They were just constantly fouling him.

2369~~~
Probably, but it will take time. The potential is there. He'll start to regularly reproduce form like what he showed in that game regularly in the Premier League. Needs to get used to the physicality.

2370~~~
I can't believe some of this in here, he's bought to help the situation, and he didn't have a mare.  He needs time to adjust to the PL, and a supporting cast to match our ambitions, sadly his fellow cast members aren't up to speed at the moment.

2371~~~
Give the lad a chance. This was his first professional game at the club. Patience!

2372~~~
If it's any consolation most (non-Utd supporting) La Liga followers agree with you. He's a good player but that's about it, not worth the price but not a terrible player either - just a decent addition to your squad without being spectacular. People keep getting ahead of themselves by saying he's Spain's future and all that nonsense when even with this move he'll still only be on the fringes of the squad, nevermind the starting line-up. His career has been blighted by inconsistency so that's something he needs to fix.

That said, whoever in the last page said he is part of the solution, not THE solution has it bang on. He gets an easy ride from some of your fans who are just glad to get a new midfielder in, but he also gets a rough ride from those who expect him to change everything on his own.

2373~~~
I am very surprised at this comment to be honest. Especially in the first few minutes he fouled Herrera hard and looked to go in and chin him. Shelvey could have been booked at least twice if not 3 times. He got away with excessive fouling then was booked for comically kicking the ball away.

Was impressed with Herrera - we need to lighten his defensive duties until he acclimatizes to this league. It's faster, and more physically powerful than I think he is at the moment.

2374~~~
Crazy how the same people praising him all preseason have thrown it all away and questioning him because he didn't have a great game. Was Evra's debut a good one? Vidic?

It was his first match, he needs time. He shouldn't have the pressure from fans to save our midfield.

2375~~~
Give him a full season before you judge him not just one game.

2376~~~
I don't understand the point of criticising a player who had just played is first league game for his new club.
He look sensible and would adopt quicker.

2377~~~
He got the 'welcome to the league' treatment but I thought he handled it pretty well. The positive I take is that he can link midfield and attack better than we have done for awhile, I think his relationship with Mata will only get stronger.

2378~~~
I thought he did well. Excited to see how he does once settles in properly and we start playing like a real team.

2379~~~
He was too quiet in the first half, didn't want to get on the ball and control things. Just when he started doing that in the second half, LVG substitutes him.

2380~~~
I think he is struggling with the aggression and speed of the English league. Hopefully I am wrong.

2381~~~
It's the usual caf way. Completely schizophrenic in terms of judging player performance. They'll be branded "shite" because they're not dribbling past 3 players or scoring wonder goals every other game.

I thought he did reasonably well for his first game in a new league. The posts about Shelvey "dominating" him are ridiculous; he was clearly being fouled repeatedly. Will continue to get better, and obviously having a more mobile player than Fletcher alongside him would help.

2382~~~
Remember how Athletic Bilbao schooled us? I think he will be okay. But most of the players around him are the problem.

2383~~~
Don't think so. Not sure why so many people are saying this, he coped quite well and just got up and kept playing. Just because Swansea decided to try to kick him all game doesn't mean is struggling with the physicality, I can't remember him being outmuscled off the ball once actually. They just kept fouling him. 

The only thing you could criticize him for today would probably be that he could have got more involved in the first half.

2384~~~
Many can't understand the sorry state our squad is in at the moment. If we look at things from a big club perspective, Herrera is just a common signing. He shouldn't stand up above anyone else. Take Juventus for example Vidal, Marchisio, Pirlo, Pogba are equally if not better then him. 

The problem is that at United we have so many shit players that for us Herrera is some kind of an extraordinary talent. Bottom line of the story, Herrera is a step into the right direction. He's not the solution to our problem. No wonder why so many experts had predicted a quite big number of signings

2385~~~
I'm not suggesting that he is bullied off the park. I am saying that he is not used to it. He probably outmuscled every aggressors but he is not used to be doing that while playing his normal game. Having to mix them up, plus playing at a relatively faster speed, might be a new thing for him. Anyway, just as many in here are saying, it's only one game. Hopefully I am proven wrong yet again.

2386~~~
I thought he played quite well yesterday, specially in the second half. Was surprised to see him getting substituted and we definitely lost our momentum once he was gone.

2387~~~
Did well considering he had feck all in terms of space and time to exploit on offense.

2388~~~
I'd say they're all clearly better than him.

2389~~~
Vidal is, Pogba will probably be shortly, He's around Marchisio level.

2390~~~
Pogba is already better than Herrera IMHO, Vidal and Pirlo are clearly better and you're right Marchisio is probably at the same level.

2391~~~
Watched Alexis Sanchez yesterday and thought he was pretty underwhelming. The foreign players coming into this league get a shock at the pace and physicality of it. They will adapt. They have to. I thought Herrera did better than some of our players who have always played here. So not too worried about him.

2392~~~
I don't think he was bought to be the main midfielder, or at least he shouldn't have been. He was a Moyes target and he wanted Kroos as well and of course we didn't get him. Typical of our club to do things half arsed.

2393~~~
Exactly Herrera isn't the problem, unfortunately some of his team mates are. Woodward is going to live up to his bragging.

2394~~~
Well its hard to make a direct judgement like that, given the midfielders around each of the names you mention and the midfielders around Herrera. Not saying you're wrong, but its a harsh call to make right now.

2395~~~
Why are people criticising him? He wasn't bad at all yesterday. I thought he looked quite good. Good touch, played a few inventive passes here and there. Given how badly we played he did well.

2396~~~
The lad showed he wouldn't be intimidated by all the fouling and won't be scared to give some back. If that had been some of our other players, they would have been hiding in the dugout.

2397~~~
Individually then they're better than him, not trying to be too harsh, just giving my honest opinion having seen play mostly for Bilbao. Herrera will be a great buy for us and will improve to become a better player.


I agree with you, he's a new player, he's Spanish and he's young and he has poor or aging teammates in midfield. One player was never going to change anything in our midfield performances let alone a promising one who still has everything to prove at the highest level. It's beyond stupid to leave this late with one CM signing, fecking stupid situation to be in again <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2398~~~
But typical of us, you must admit.

2399~~~
What has it got to take for us to finally get it ?

2400~~~
Unfortunately for us, another year out of the CL and the club being hit in the pocket. It's only one game though, so hopefully that won't happen.

2401~~~
Decent performance, the criticism I would have is that he just wasn't involved in the game enough, because when he did have the ball.. he produced good moments and looked upto the task.

This is either down to poor movement, knowing how to offer an effective option or his team mates are just by-passing him far too much. Mixture of both for me, but he is not the problem... being surrounded by Fletch and the non-existent Mata isn't going to help anyone's cause.

2402~~~
The easy pass is always out wide. Teams have no fear for the wide players at United so the midfield is always packed.

But United had lots of possession yesterday and Swansea didn't dominate United's midfield, so that is a positive.

Early signs are good for me, an inexperienced back line was the problem yesterday and not Herrera.

2403~~~
I'd love to know LVG's reasons for subbing him. He hadn't shone up to that point but he'd still been the main link between the defence and the attack. I can see the idea that Fellaini can offer "something else" but why take off Herrera to get it? I guess Mata's setpieces are a factor, but we were a worse team when Herrera went off and Fletcher didn't look like he was ready for 90 minutes out there.

Unless it was the formation change to something that players who were with United last year would be familiar that meant it had to be Herrera who came off. Anyway, I'd love to know.

2404~~~
He wasn't the problem yesterday

2405~~~
Not worried about Herrera at all, he is a good acquisition for us and we will see the best of him in no time.
I was more agitated by the performances of both Rooney and Fletcher, with Rooney giving the ball away cheaply a few
times when we were in a good attacking situation.

Was surprised Fletcher stayed on instead of Herrera, and all our creativity 
went out the window after Herrera was subbed.

2406~~~
Of course he wasn't but everyone on here is so quick to criticise every single little thing atm it's tedious. Everything has to be perfect straight away and no one will be given time or patience to settle in and make a difference. Some of the reactions are so over the top.

I watched pretty much every game Herrera played in last season and in one of my early posts after we signed him I warned against expecting too much too soon. He won't pull off the spectacular every game but he is a very good little player who will make us play much better. He needs to be given a chance to settle in and adapt to this league and I'm sure once our other first choice players start returning the team as a collective will start playing better and individuals like Herrera will shine more in the process.

2407~~~
Getting constantly hacked down/fouled = getting dominated apparently. Wonder how Iniesta has carved a career for himself when he gets dominated every game. Herrera didn't look the slightest bit intimidated by Shelvey yesterday, in fact at the start when he jumped back up I was worried he was going to nut him and get sent off. Would like to see him bulk up a bit further so he can get the real physical presence to match his mentality.

2408~~~
Not sure why LvG subbed Herrera, will not be surprised if Ander had some minor injury by HT. Swansea players were trying their best to kick the daylights out of him, and their fouls looked pretty deliberate. One of those games when you start missing Keano. Get a decent partner for him, and Ander will shine. Unfortunately, neither Fletch nor Carrick are suitable for that role.

2409~~~
I remember David May saying once that we don't stick up for each other anymore, as you say if Keane was in that side he would send Shelvey into row Z for kicking Herrera about like that.
In fact play Fellaini with him against Sunderland so when Catermole kicks Ander he can stick one on him. He wouldn't be a loss if he was sent off. A nice long ban, say a season would be good.

2410~~~
Joey Barton <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2411~~~
How dare he not come in and boss the game in his first match in a new league playing for a dysfunctional team. Get a grip, he'll come good.

2412~~~
He's played 1 EPL match for God's sake...

2413~~~
He didn't even play badly. Did you not see how much worse we were when he came off?

2414~~~
Saw this being discussed in the Mata thread. Is he really better as a no 10 as opposed to a CM? He played in the no 10 role vs LA Galaxy and I think he was playing there last year for Bilbao too. If so we have another problem on our hands, Mata, Rooney, Kagawa, Herrera all being no 10's cannot be good for us

2415~~~
Yes. Doesn't mean he can't play deeper too though, just means he might take longer to adjust. It was 2012/13 when he last played there regularly and 2011/12 when he last played well there regularly, but naturally he's a number 10 and that's where he played when he was breaking through at Zaragoza.

2416~~~
Just rewatched the whole game after watching it "live" on shit stream, and I think he had a really good game, it was surprising to see van Gaal subbing him off because I thought he was easily our best player while he played, it was Moyesesque decision. 
Plus pretty much every player who was supposed to help him had shit game(Fletcher, Mata, Rooney) so fair play to him. Really exciting to see how he'll do this season, can't wait for Carrick to return, I think those two might be excellent together. Carrick is defensively better than our any other midfielder, and our best passer, pretty much ideal partner to Herrera IMO.

2417~~~
Wasn't LVG on about this?  Hardly a revelation.

2418~~~
He did well. The team performance and result will mean that a lot of people will be critical.

2419~~~
It's debatable. Herrera certainly thinks of himself as a #8 rather than #10, so I suspect that's where we'll nearly always see him played.

2420~~~
I never said its a revelation, just that the club might have completely fecked up again because he hasn't really been impressive as a #8

2421~~~
He's played one competitive game for us, and was one of our better players.

2422~~~
Yeah and Fellaini thought of himself as a "defensive midfielder" in some interview when he signed for us: when in reality he is a #10 behind the striker who is fit for a hoofball system at West Ham

2423~~~
Shaw and Herrera are obviously not Van Gaal signings.

2424~~~
He doesn't struggle with the pace of the premier league, he struggles with the pace of our own team.

2425~~~
Yep, but Herrera actually played far more regularly as a #8 as far as I'm aware. I think it was just last season where he was used as a #10, so there's no real reason to think he can't perform in that role.

Or to put it another way: when we were trying to buy him last season it was as a #8, so I'm not sure why we'd suddenly have a new role in mind for him now.

2426~~~
All his attributes point to being a #8 which is where he has played for the majority of his career, hell play there for us too.

2427~~~
It wasn't just last season he played as a number 10. He's only played 2 seasons of his career as a number 8, and when he was starting his career it was a 10.

Like I said a few weeks ago, I wouldn't read too much into his interview saying he's a number 8, given he's also said in the past he prefers playing further up the pitch closer to the strikers. It's more likely he just says whatever he knows the manager wants from him.


Played more as a 10 actually.

2428~~~
I liked Herrera and thought he did well. He took quite a few challenges from Swansea, took it and still did well.

2429~~~
Funny thing is, while Herrera might stuggle to settle in his first few months, he'll still be by far our most competent midfielder.

2430~~~
Lynk that's true but not funny

2431~~~
I can't help but laugh Lawman. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2432~~~
Did you really expect Herrera to play at his best on his premier league debut? It took Silva close to a full season to reach the level he played at in the Spanish league.

2433~~~
It's laugh, or cry, I suppose...

2434~~~
His first match in which he was ok and he is already criticized ??? Wtf is wrong with some people.

2435~~~
People forget far to easily how long it takes some players to adapt to everything, not just the football. Look at two players who just left, Vidic and Evra, really struggled to begin with but went on to have great careers. Really embarrassed by many fans this week.

2436~~~
He was easily one of our better players, and anyone watching the game would surely notice the issues were more how he fit into the team during such a slow and lethargic performance more than any issue of ability or know how.

One of our biggest issues was getting the ball to Rooneys feet, yet the only player who did it was Herrera and he was let down 3 times by a shit return ball from Rooney. Then people moaned he was out of position, despite his job being to carry the ball and link with the attackers.

2437~~~
Is he really a central midfielder or one that plays better at 10 but can also do a job a bit deeper? Leave it to us to sign another semi-cm-ish player who really plays better further up the pitch.

2438~~~
He isn't a #10 in the slightest. His skill set is so obviously suited to central midfield and I'm pleased with his progress so far.

2439~~~
He played well. Taking him off for Fellaini was the single biggest contributing factor in us not getting at least a point, imo.

2440~~~
At least he won't be able to do that for a while.

2441~~~
Not sure I agree it was the biggest factor, but I think Herrera should have stayed on too. Should have been Fletcher off for Fellaini. I do hold a few concerns over the whole #10 discussion though. Maybe he is a #10 trying to play as a deeper CM.

2442~~~
How so? Fella beautifully headed a ball back to Januzaj for an almost sitter in the dying moments. A far better chance than Herrera created during his time on the pitch. It ws exactly what he was brought into to do and what was expected of him.

2443~~~
It should've been neither. Fellaini played so high up the pitch, trying to get knock downs, that Swansea had it easy when they got the second ball. They were streaming forward at will towards the end. With only Fletcher in front of the defence it was easy for them.

We lost all our balance when Herrera went off. If Van Gaal wanted to bring Fellaini on to win knock downs he should've subbed Mata. We lost our balance in midfield after Herrera went off and that is really why Swansea came back into it. At the hour, after we scored, it seemed inevitable that we'd go on and win. We were all over them. After the tactical change we collapsed. It had less to do with the personnel and more to do with the shape. Although I think Herrera was coming into it when he was subbed.

2444~~~
That was the problem, Fletcher wasn't giving him any protection for Herrera to go forward. Fellaini is just a lump who will just get sent off for fouling and elbowing people. Thank god the option has gone as he is injured. They need another CM to get the best out of Herrera.

2445~~~
Actually I agree with this.

2446~~~
If Januzaj had capitalized on that fantastic chance everyone would have Fellaini's yarbles in their mouth.

2447~~~
I agree with this. The sub didn't make much sense to me either.

2448~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It was a standard knock-down at the back post for Januzaj! It was hardly an amazing piece of skill.

2449~~~
Van Gaal has just said in his MUTV interview that Ander is injured??

2450~~~
LvG just confirmed that he is injured <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Time to panic

2451~~~
Herrera is fecking injured

2452~~~
Absolute nightmare. We're going to have Fletcher and Cleverly in midfield.

2453~~~
What type of injury did he say? if Herrera is out for long we are in big trouble.

2454~~~
Maybe that's why he was subbed off against Swansea

2455~~~
So injury was why he was taken off in the last game? Because VG was taking a lot of shit on here for that.

2456~~~
What a fecking joke. It's actually a fecking disgrace we are at this stage with just over a week left of the window. Fletcher and cleverley midfield. The stuff of nightmares.

2457~~~
There's Andow as well!

2458~~~
We're fecked. Easy start my arse, we'll be beat on Sunday again.

2459~~~
Herrera injured? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2460~~~
Didn't Herrera never get injured at Bilbao? Ridiculous.

2461~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you just have to laugh really.

2462~~~
Indeed. If he's out for long, we are fecked.

2463~~~
you are fecking kidding...

2464~~~
Yup.

2465~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> someone is taking the piss!

2466~~~
Unbelievable the amount of luck we have with injuries.

2467~~~
Our midfield situation is an absolute joke.

2468~~~
Giggsy might need to get his boots out of storage.

2469~~~
Luckly Anderson has just started training with others.

<span style="color: #ffffff">feck my life</span>

2470~~~
We've got Shaw out for a month, Smalling out for 3 (?), Carrick out for half the bloody season, Herrera out for god knows how long, no work permit for Rojo and no decent back up for any of the positions the players that I just mentioned play in.

Not to mention it looks like Welbeck's leaving and we're no closer to signing anyone decent.
Absolute shambles at the moment. What's going on?

2471~~~
Smalling is out for 3 months???

2472~~~
Smailling is out aswell? Wow... We must practice mma session during our training.

2473~~~
I don't think that's a coincidence. We've obviously realised we are in the sh*t and have no other choice.

2474~~~
It really is a shambles. When can we start the thread to discuss how fecked we are? We're going down the fecking toilet, fast.

2475~~~
We're fecked. Down to the bare bones. Our easy start mught be where we lose out on top 4.

2476~~~
MMA? Must be bloody fight club at Carrington. There's probably less people getting taken out in the Expendables 3!

This is unreal.

2477~~~
Yep.

Indeed, 9 days left to pretty much stop a steep decline I think. Other teams are simply not going to wait for us to catch them.

2478~~~
Explains a lot.

2479~~~
I'm not 100% sure if it's been confirmed. I just saw it somewhere, and when I searched 'Smalling 3 months' on twitter everyone was whinging about it!

2480~~~
Feckinell.

Are Evans and Valencia fit at least?

2481~~~
So what LvG is saying is we basically have no players left that aren't forwards except our goalie.  It's been heading this way for a while if we're honest.  I think i'm going to try not to see Sunday's game results, its not going to be pretty.

2482~~~
It seems he picked up the injury in training yesterday. 2 midfielders in one week.

2483~~~
Those other clubs have already left us behind, IMO. We're so far behind Chelsea and City on paper, it is beyond belief.

2484~~~
One great signing in the shape of Di Maria, Benatia or Vidal would change everything. Can't see any of those three coming, though.

2485~~~
This is my fear as well. Let's just hope RvP is back and we can settle in and grind these out.

2486~~~
Van gaal didn't say anything about it, think someone was on a WUM.

2487~~~
Unreal, absolutely unreal.

The midfield options were bottom half of the league quality anyway, probably worse if Ander is out.

2488~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view1/1449061/police-squad-alan-north-o.gif" src="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view1/1449061/police-squad-alan-north-o.gif"/>

2489~~~
There isn't a one man on earth who can cover both and entire defense line and midfield line, because that's what we're lacking right now.  If Smalling is injured too Sunday could probably be mistaken for a reserves match.

2490~~~
Are you trying to say Herrera was shot, or set on fire? Either way that's a lengthy spell out.

2491~~~
feck sake.

2492~~~
Had we sorted Our midfield out by now we would have been able to deal with two injuries pretty well.

2493~~~
Potential twitter bollocks, but 6 weeks is the rumour. 

fecking hell, we have no luck do we?

2494~~~
It's Carrington when the season comes around.

2495~~~
By sorted our midfield out, you mean signed one more midfielder?

2496~~~
Not him... how depressing

2497~~~
You have to be fecking kidding me. Are our players incapable of getting 'knocks'?

2498~~~
We will have to panic buy now to compensate for the injuries.

2499~~~
I bet the workouts at Carrington look something like this.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.stupidgymshit.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Squat_Death1.jpg" src="http://www.stupidgymshit.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Squat_Death1.jpg"/> 
That can be the only explanation.

2500~~~
Blessing in disguise like losing to Swansea? We need to buy.

2501~~~
6 bleeding weeks

2502~~~
How many 'blessings in disguise' are we going to get in the coming weeks? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2503~~~
feck sake!!!

2504~~~
Cleverley and Fletcher it is then.



muppetsuicide.gif

2505~~~
Betfair, a reliable source for injuries...

2506~~~
People always saying ''what if Herrera get's injured'' 

So typical that it happens straight away...

2507~~~
Too many 'rumoured' and 'could' in these tweets. Nobody knows.

2508~~~
You know to make things 10 times worse it's going to be Fellaini or Cleverley who injured him.

Like when Rio got injured before the World Cup and it turned out to be Heskey.

2509~~~
Get Pearson and Rothwell involved. Not joking.

2510~~~
That midfield partnership is as grim as a scottish housing estate in winter. We need signings badly, we really do.

2511~~~
6 weeks. Bloody hell. The midfield is depressingly bad now. Sunderland are going to be all over that. What luck.

2512~~~
Time to get Scholesy out of retirement again.

2513~~~
Be hard to understand if neither of them even make the bench.

Fletcher and Cleverley nailed on to start, mind you. Possible he might drop Mata for Kagawa, though. God knows our CMs will be needing a bit of help fetching and carrying from whoever plays at 10.

2514~~~
Can we actually wait for confirmation that it's as long as six weeks before dousing ourselves in petrol?

2515~~~
Carrington was cursed during the witch-burnings of the 1560's. The surveyor United employed should be sued.
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yup. Made it all up.</span>

2516~~~
Even if he was desperately unfit he'd still be a better option than Cleverley.

2517~~~
Panic stations anyone?

2518~~~
we are fecked. So injured yesterday? That is not the reason LvG took him off then. Even if i dont like them that much, get Khedira and De Jong in.

2519~~~
Six weeks means he'll take ages to get into his stride. I now won't be surprised if his whole season suffers, and he now has a seriously patchy, inconsistent, underwhelming first term.
The absolute worst time to pick up an injury - for him and us.

2520~~~
If it does indeed turn out to be 6+weeks out, then you just have to laugh. I hope Van Gaal had fun assessing his squad.

2521~~~
He got kicked a lot last weekend. 

We need a hard case in our team who doesn't let this sort of thing happen.

2522~~~
The sensible thing to do would be to play 4 2 3 1 and have Rooney dropping back from 10.

I doubt we will do anything sensible though.

2523~~~
Get Ando out of the fridge.

2524~~~
Our luck. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2525~~~
Raymond Verheijen and friends right now:

2526~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2527~~~
What's in the feck is going on with all these injuries. Every bloody year it seems to be the same. There has to be something severely wrong with either our medical team or training facilities/practices. Has anyone checked that Carrington isn't in fact a minefield? Or do we have that fella from Dodgeball as a first team coach?

2528~~~
I thought the majority had already doused themselves during the Vidal saga.

2529~~~
352 was such a massive disaster it's just about possible that common sense will prevail.

Of course, Van Gaal is a stubborn, arrogant cnut so will probably assume the team just needed one more week in training to execute his formation of choice to perfection...

2530~~~
hence why it says rumoured .... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2531~~~
I'm starting to question our fitness team or something. Every year we have a craze of injuries, and with a lack of investment in midfield we end up going into a league game against Sunderland with the inferior midfield.

2532~~~
And an inferior defense.

2533~~~
Wonder if we might play Rooney in midfield a few games. I'm usually the last person to advocate that but the combination of Fletcher and Cleverley sounds so mediocre. If Sunderland decide to press us I can see just constantly giving the ball straight back. I'm no fan of Rooney in midfield but maybe for a few games surrounded by the right players. Ah, feck, maybe I'm overreacting.

2534~~~
All those years <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> terrorised opponents with his injury jinx threads.

This is payback.

2535~~~
Not sure how anybody can stop themselves getting kicked. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

He certainly gives it aswell as he takes anyway, a muscle strain is just overworking.

2536~~~
But having a player of Vidal's quality replacing Fellaini, Cleverley or Fletcher or having Di Maria replace Nani, Young or even in a centre mid position would be an extreme improvement ey?

2537~~~
Went for few beers hoping for some good news and then I see this. Fe.king hell..

2538~~~
This is DISAPPOINTING. We need to sign a truckload of pillows and spread them all over Carrington.

2539~~~
So Herrera is injurred, well that lasted long <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Seriously the feck just sign a midfielder, maybay even two and please add another defender because no way are we going to keep this squad fit, not even with no CL games, we are just the worst team on planet if it comes to fitness. God we are down already to Cleverley and Fletcher on a must win game...brilliant !<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Shaw almost never injurred, Herrera almost never injurred, we sign them, boom both out injurred, Carrick, Fellaini, Lingard, Rafael....What the hell do we do to these players ?

2540~~~
At least it explains the sub last week.

2541~~~
Ankle?

2542~~~
Was it definitely last week when he got injured? I don't recall him getting kicked.

2543~~~
Seems I'm wrong. Apparently injured yesterday in training so the mystery of the sub still remains unsolved.

Knowing us, he probably went for a nap in one of those new sleep pods we've got and came out with all his limbs amputated.

2544~~~
I don't know where <a class="username" data-user="77044, @LennonNL" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77044/">@LennonNL</a> is getting his info. Was that in the presser? I doubt it

2545~~~
Just fecking cancel training, these injuries are ridiculous.

2546~~~
Is there any official word on the injury duration?

2547~~~
What exactly does Tony Strudwick do, I just find it strange that we are getting these injuries despite changes of manager and training regimes, yet he is a constant through it all. Is what he is doing with the players weaking their muscles and leading to pulls and strains? It can't be all bad luck.

2548~~~
Twitter, my friend. The best place on the internet for reliable information.

To be fair, I did say that it wasn't 100% confirmed. Just saw someone tweet about it on twitter and the uproar I saw when I searched it made me think it was genuine. Probably not!

2549~~~
fecks sake. If only we could sign some more midfielders...

2550~~~
You are having a laugh, they were hacking him down all the time and Shelvey put a sneaky knee in on him as well.

2551~~~
Jesus wept , just heard about the injury.We are fecking cursed.

2552~~~
Nothing right before he went off though from what I recall. And someone just posted that it happened yesterday anyway.

2553~~~
Wouldn't be surprised if LVG has invented this one to get Woody to get his chequebook out pronto

2554~~~
I know it can happen in training but it's getting ridiculous. Maybe some of the players need to calm down a bit in there. Problem we don't know how it happened.

2555~~~
I wonder if Phil Jones ran into him. He seems to be always running into people.

2556~~~
Yeah mate wouldn't be surprised.

2557~~~
Lots of moaning around here and some really idiotic comments as always. 

Here is ESPN reporting it to be ankle injury and period of 2 weeks. 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/335809.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/335809.html</a>

Ankle injuries are not down to strict fitness regimes or anything so I don't understand what this moaning is going to achieve. We sometimes had 3-4 CBs injured under SAF. If we are to buy a CM, it will be if LvG thinks he needs another there and has the right player available, not because at a given stage we will have 3 CMs injured.

2558~~~
Great news if it's 2 weeks instead of 6.

2559~~~
We're left with Moyes' team.

2560~~~
No you're wrong. We should have 8-12 top class midfielders just in case something like this happens.

2561~~~
If he thinks this squad is fine then he might be deluding himself. This isn't Bayern/Barca where you can sign players no matter where you finish in the league as Bayern just get whoever they want, whenever they want. Barca and Real just hoover up players as well. United have a lot more competition here for signings and league position is vital.

2562~~~
Since an hour moaning is going around and I am surprised nobody did a simple google search. Do people nowadays only trust twitter accounts who put words like 'rumored' etc in their tweet? An official word will be still needed but without it, there is no point going overboard.

2563~~~
We haven't got 8-12 top class midfielders when they are all fit, nevermind when they are injured.

2564~~~
So what is the solution? Fire him? Or send an e-petition to him to sign someone whom fans want?

2565~~~
Getting 4th with this squad made of sicknotes will be like winning the title itself

2566~~~
Of course not. This is a long standing problem. It is up to him to find it out for himself. I am more bothered about why we are getting constant injuries season after season, that isn't right.

2567~~~

2568~~~
Someone like him who pays so much attention to details, I don't think he will miss if there is larger problem and some peculiar root cause to the injuries and will set it right.

2569~~~
The injuries are doing more harm to us than any lack of quality. It's absurd. How much money does the club spend on medical, dietary and physio staff, resources and equipment?

2570~~~
Thank goodness if true. The six weeks figure did seem like it was just plucked from the air.

2571~~~
All this money paid out in wages for these people and we can't keep our players fit.

2572~~~
9 months and 2 players = all the shit that's going on now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>?? Someone needs to check the CCTV at Carrington.

2573~~~
Technically speaking for the Sunderland game, none of the new players will take part. It'll be 100% Moyes' team, it's a fact.

2574~~~
And every one of our big signings this summer can't play for 1 reason or other. Massive feck up after feck up after feck up.

2575~~~
All the players will have been signed by Moyes? Because I'm only seeing one.

2576~~~
Never thought I would say this but I'm delighted that there's an international break in two weeks!

2577~~~
Yeah, he'll probably only miss this weekends game, the MK Dons game which he would probably miss anyways, and next weekends match vs Burnley. Hopefully we have almost everyone fit and ready to go against QPR on September 14th. Shaw should be back then too I'd think. Only Carrick would still be out if nobody else gets injured.

2578~~~
No surprise his is now injured, everyone seems to turn to glass the moment they sign for us.

2579~~~
Come on, you know what I meant right ?

2580~~~
well, kind of, but it's truer to say that LVG has to work with players assembled by mostly SAF and slightly Moyes. But given the injuries I don't think it'll be a starting XI that any of those managers would prefer to play.

2581~~~
Both our big money signings out already inside a week of the season. Great.

2582~~~
2 weeks is certainly better than 6. But our luck is truly terrible.

2583~~~
Jesus it actually happened <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2584~~~
How long till Ro..

I wont even say it!

2585~~~
How long until Ronaldo comes back?

2586~~~
You need a big squad. People think we need just two one good player per position.  I admit that would be a good start considering we are miles off that but we need quality backups too as there will always be injuries

2587~~~
No.

2588~~~
How did he get inured/by who?

2589~~~
Heskey.

Or Fellaini.

2590~~~
Hope it's just the two weeks. Can't believe the luck we have with injuries. Although placing it on luck probably isn't right, surely all these injuries aren't a coincidence. What is happening there?

2591~~~
Heaven only knows. Every club always feels they in particular are bad with injuries but we hit new heights. Usually though we get everyone back at the same time and start hitting form, hopefully that happens this time. We just need to ride it until players come back/in.

2592~~~
I need an update on his injury, for my sanity.

2593~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I miss him so much

2594~~~
When will he be back? There wasn't any news after he supposedly got a scan. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> We really miss him and Carrick.

2595~~~
Agreed. I'm itching to find out. If it's long term we really need another central midfielder, at the very least. I'd be fairly unhappy if we didn't get two.

2596~~~
According to Mark Ogden, Herrera has started training.

2597~~~
Thank christ

2598~~~
Glad it's not a long injury by the sounds of it and he is back training. Now please Ander don't go scaring us like that again!

2599~~~
Brilliant news. Hopefully he can be back for Burnley. Him, Rojo, di Maria. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2600~~~
Vidal hasn't signed yet so keep hobbling Herrera! you will have a worthy midfield partner soon enough!

Good news he is back training but please don't rush him.

2601~~~
Great news! Our midfield is so dependent on him it's ridiculous

2602~~~
It'll be like watching Zidane in his pomp on Saturday after sitting through 90 minutes of Cleverley and Fletcher.

2603~~~
Seriously, thank God.

2604~~~
Our midfield wasn't any better against Swansea. Herrera has potential, but he's hardly pulled up any trees yet. We're not really dependent on him at all right now. Glad he's back, though.

2605~~~
Agreed with what you said but He's had what, 60 mins? He'll come good, especially with a better partner in midfield and AdM out wide <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I think after witnessing the midfield against Sunderland, we definitely are dependent on him tbh.

I also think we're way too slow and static and the 3-5-2 isn't getting the best out of him. Once these issues are ironed out, he'll be excellent. I have no doubt.

2606~~~
I agree in part with this. It still wasn't very good but compared to what Fletcher and Cleverley dished up I can't have Herrera back fast enough. Glad it isn't a long injury.

2607~~~
Almost forgot we have him amidst all the Di Maria excitement! I will still buy Herrera's shirt once the R returns to the megastore <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Now pls pls stay fit!!

2608~~~
I think it's a case of better the devil you DON'T know. Herrera might turn out to be absolutely amazing in the next game, whereas everyone expects Fletcher and Cleverley to be shit because we've all been watching them for so long.

2609~~~
He was probably our best player vs Swansea, which is why everybody had a fit when he was taken off. I reckon it would have been Fletcher if not for the injury.

2610~~~
It's a double boost when Herrera plays as it means we have some real potential in our line up and it also means that Cleverley does not play

2611~~~
Good news, though don't rush him back if he isn't 100%. At least with him in there we will have some mobility

2612~~~
Excellent news

2613~~~
Exactly the news we needed

2614~~~
Great to hear that he won't be too long in returning. Such bad luck the timing of his injury. Midfield will be infinitely better with him in it.

2615~~~
Will he be OK to start against Burnley?

2616~~~
Hope so. Can't witness the Fletcher-Cleverley horror show again.

2617~~~
Some of the stuff in the last few pages is a bit harsh IMO, he's playing in a team devoid of confidence in a system none of them are used to alongside Flethcer in midfield, it's not exactly a set up that many would succeed in. I am certain once LvG has the side streamlined and into a rhythm he will shine.

2618~~~
He was one of our best players against Swansea. Certainly out of the midfielders and attackers. Not bad for his debut.

2619~~~
I thought he was fine in the game as well, especially since he was doing the work of two in midfield. It just seems that people are using the LA Galaxy rout as the benchmark when really per-season in general doesn't amount to a hill of beans once competitive football starts, it's a glorified fitness tour.

2620~~~

2621~~~
poor reporting - it was Kagawa that LvG mentioned not Herrera!

2622~~~

2623~~~
With Cleverley seemingly on the way out, I've got a feeling in my waters that Herrera is actually fit and LvG was just pulling a Fergie.

2624~~~
Rafael to partner Fletcher in midfield then?

2625~~~
Anyone else interested in seeing Herrara play as the deepest midfielder? A duo of Herrara and Di Maria...

2626~~~
Herrara might work as a deep midfielder but I fear Di Meria is more of a winger/am

2627~~~
Didn't Herrera say something about LvG encouraging him to sit back and keep possession? There was a thread in here a while ago about who van Gaal was going to <i>Schweinsteiger</i>. I think there's every chance it could be Ander. There's no other way I can see him fitting in alongside a player of Vidal's ilk otherwise.

2628~~~
if we go for Carvalho, this theory would be dead. Didnt Schweinsteiger play as an 8 like Strootman under LvG? Van Bommel was the one sitting back?

2629~~~
I still have flashbacks seeing Fletcher totally miscontrol the ball and fall flat. I wish I requested a gif but in all honesty I have respect for Fletcher. Cleverley on the other hand...smh. I don't want to ever see that combination again. I'd rather we play Rooney in midfield

2630~~~
By pulling a Fergie he meant, trying to keep a player's recovery from injury under wraps. Fergie always tended to overestimate the time players would be out and would even claim that a player would certainly not be making an appearance which obviously would prove to be false on matchday. There was always an air of excitement and unpredictability around the team that Fergie was going to unleash, there used to be some pleasant shockers in there at times. Now it seems more predictable. Not seeing Valencia or Young in the teamsheet would be the only modicum of excitement you would be able to generate after Fergie left. Really excited to see Di Maria this weekend though and extremely curious as to how Rojo will fare when he is available.

2631~~~
I knew what you meant mate, was only pulling your leg.

2632~~~
Had a suspicion it was a tongue-in-cheek comment. My mistake then and it was Dante's post not mine though.

2633~~~
Found this rather interesting from that article:

2634~~~
One of Rooney or Di Maria has to simply play in midfield this weekend. I can't take another Fletcher - Cleverley performance.

2635~~~
This whole "Mata might leave" thing seems nonsense to me. Even in a slump he's been responsible/involved for half of our goals since he signed and LVG has specifically stated he's playing formations to get the best out of him.

2636~~~
Any hope of him startingn on saturday?

2637~~~
Physioroom says Sept. 14th for his return date.

2638~~~
he is injured, but nonetheless good to hear that he features in his plans

2639~~~
For all our signings, this is the signing we really need to be a success. If Di Maria is utilized on the wings etc... really going to need Ander to be running games from deeper. Our ability to control games rests heavily on his shoulders.

2640~~~
And Blind to be fair.

2641~~~
i think that he is our most important signing too. We really need him and Blind to control the midfield and play some passes to our offensive players. It is time to step up in midfield and boss games again.

2642~~~
Is he back in training this week or the week after this?

2643~~~
Yep, I echo the sentiment. He may have flown a bit under the radar in the press, but we really need a big season from him. He is the equlibrium in this team, the glue that will make it all work.

I am quite confident he will do it though.

2644~~~
He still remains the player whose name I'll get on my shirt and the player I am most excited to have signed. 

He will be very integral, especially in regards to defending and workrate which is needed behind some of our attacking fairies!

2645~~~

2646~~~
Oh God... Don't remind us of that substitution <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2647~~~

2648~~~
Get in. We've missed his grit in the middle. Looking forward to him getting back into competitive games for us.

2649~~~
I swear until we made that sub we were definitely going to win against Swansea. Thank God Herrera's back. We need some good news what with Jones going down injured tonight.

2650~~~
Thank feck Herrera's back, he's going to be crucial this year for us.

EDIT: Saying that our whole XI will be crucial at all times but Herrera's special because he's Spanish.

2651~~~
Brilliant. His dynamism in the middle is badly needed. Also, he can pass the ball which helps.

2652~~~
I only hope for him and his style of play that he has as few injuries as possible. These ankle injuries suck...

2653~~~
I have huge hopes for him. Finally going to give us that combination of bite and creativity in midfield that we've been lacking for so long.

Probably our most important signing in the long-term. He's a likeable guy too, I can see him quickly becoming a fan favourite.

2654~~~
It's really weird being a United fan at the moment. We have nearly a whole team of players who have hardly turned out for us yet - the new signings, Shaw, Rojo, Blind, Herrera, Di Maria, Falcao, the new young players like Blackett and James, and Mata, Januzaj and even Fellaini still feel like new players as well.

Looking forward to seeing Herrera for us.

2655~~~
The biggest problem is they just target him as we saw against Swansea. Thats why we need another top quality CM alongside him, otherwise you just have to take him out and we are struggling. After his show against Galaxy, it wasnt just thst his level dropped, but you could see the opposition teams closing him down immeditely and fouling him constantly. He is our best midfielder and they know it.

2656~~~
Having Blind and Di Maria in midfield next to him, as opposed to Fletcher or Cleverley, should help him.

2657~~~
Still probably one of the more important signings this summer. His quality will show this season.

2658~~~
Not to under-appreciate our current new buys but if we get Strootman I think he'll be ideal next to Ander in the same way he works with Pjanic.

2659~~~
Felliani that much taller than Ander? Looks like Felliani is like 6ft 6in (excluding the fro) or Ander is 5ft 5in

2660~~~
TBF I hold the converse opinion. Herrera is more akin to Strootman in a high octane box-to-box #8 position. His tenacity and superb work ethic combined with good mobility is ideally suited to that role. What he can't do with relative consistency is be the main rhythm-setter of a midfield and control the tempo from deeper areas. Which is more Pjanic territory. Strootman combined with Herrera would give us two very similar midfielders and I'm not sure that's the best idea.

2661~~~
I was thinking along the lines of Strootman and Herrera playing as box to box CM's in front of Blind, who I guess would play the tempo setting role, with Di Maria possibly moving up as part of a front 3. Strootman's physicality in midfield next to Herrera might offer him some protection.

2662~~~
This. Short, simple post, but a great post.

A midfield 3 of Herrera, Di Maria and Blind supporting a front 3 of Rooney, Falcao and RvP is gonna win trophies.

2663~~~
That's an idea but IMO our team will become totally unbalanced. Ideally in a 3 man midfield :
1. is the defensive screen whose main job is to guard the central defenders.
2. is the primary playmaker than can control the tempo of a game while in possession of the ball.
3. is a box-to box midfielder or has good dribbling ability/ mobility to extent plays.

If we look at some of the better traditional 4-3-3/ 4-3-1-2 teams of the past decade :

Gattuso 1, Pirlo 2, Seedorf 3
Busquets 1, Xavi 2, Iniesta 3.
Alonso 1/2 hybrid, Modric 2/3 hybrid, Di Maria 3.
Edmilson 1, Xavi 2, Deco 3.

If we replace the 2 with two #3s there's every chance to lose control of the game, especially vs possession oriented teams because even though Herrera and Strootman are technically gifted - neither those 2 or Blind have the vision or passing range to really impose themselves on the game. The sole example of a successful team using 2 box-to-box player in the central areas Juventus but they have Pirlo as the playmaker.

What we need more than anything else IMO is someone who is like a younger Xabi or Scholes in his older days when he just sat back and picked teams apart. A player like him surrounded by the energy, workrate and mobility of Herrera + Di Maria would be a deadly combination and instantly catapult the current lot into one of the best midfields in Europe. I think someone like Koke or Ruben Neves (very inexperienced) would be better suited to that role than Strootman because both have great vision and the requisite passing range/ defensive work-rate.

2664~~~
Pjanic was a beast for Bosnia at the World Cup but there wasn't even a word that he's linked to us. I suspect maybe our scouts think that he wouldn't suit us.

2665~~~
You're putting far too much emphasis on the limitations those roles would present. Blind, Strootman and Herrera are all ball winners who have tactical nous, there's not many midfield 3 in world football that it would be more difficult to control a game against. I think you're also underplaying their passing ability, let's not forget Herrera was playing as a #10 last season, you don't play there unless you have a bit of creativity about you.

2666~~~
1. Ideally United should be playing a more proactive brand of football. The first emboldened part disturbs me greatly. This reeks of reactionary playing style, where in a midfield of 3 stifling/ high work rate players in used to negate opposition creativity. The kind employed by Jose in Mendes, Costinha, Maniche. While it can be effective, this is certainly not how I envision United to be playing in the future. We should be trying to dictate the pace of the game and let the opposition worry about containing us rather than the other way round. Not that there's much wrong with being extra-forceful but this parking the bus scheme doesn't appeal very much to me.

2. Creativity is not a concern though. Loads of players have superlative amounts of skill and creative ability but only a few can influence the passage of play. At Bilbao Ander was an Oscar kind of high energy #10, who was equally renowned for his defensive work-rate and played quick passes in the final third. What I mean is someone who can slow down the game when necessary, ping the ball from sideline to sideline and keep proceeding in order. And he certainly isn't that kind of a player - someone who's a director in the mould of Scholes, Xavi, Pirlo, Alonso, Schweinsteiger or some of the more esteemed withdrawn play makers of the modern era.

A great example of illustrate the point I'm trying to make is Spain's victorious 2011 Euro U21 squad where Martinez was their #6, Herrera the box to box and Thiago was the primary play maker. Take Thiago out of that line-up and their control of the game will suffer massively because you're replacing someone who can consistently make 100+ passes per game with someone who averages around 60. Consequently that means 40+ extra passes for the opposition which lends them a greater amount of control over the game.

2667~~~
Yep. It annoys me when people say we don't address our shortcomings in defense and midfield. Well, we got 2 defenders and 3 midfielders, and all 5 either looks promising, or absolute world class. I swear if our midfield buy is not named Vidal, or defender named Benatia, people are gonna fecking complains

2668~~~
I can see where you're coming from but again I feel you're undervaluing their passing abilities, as you've already mentioned Juve are an example where you have similar players in a 3 and it still works. You could take it further and look at City, they have a midfield 2 if Toure and Fernandinho, at times they've even put Fernando in there to make a 3, there's no deep lying play maker but they can still control a game by imposing themselves with a bit of tenacity. You may feel it leads to 40+ passes for the opposition but conversely an extra ball winner (with ability) will counter that. Add Di Maria and Rooney to the mix and we have an incredibly hard working team that's going to turn the ball over a lot.

2669~~~
But see here's the thing though :

Juventus have arguably the 2nd greatest regista in modern football in Pirlo who can control matches almost single-handedly. Any permutation of Strootman, Ander, Blind can't replicate that. Omit Pirlo from their lineup and Juventus suffers evinced by them scraping past Chievo last week.

Roma in comparison have the perfect trio : De Rossi is the defensive holder, Naingollan/ Strootman is the box to box and Pjanic is the creative lynch pin - stemming from his average of 5 key passes per game this season. Even Chelsea's best starting midfield 3 adheres to this philosophy. Matic is the defensive holder, Ramires is the box to box and Cesc is the main creative force. Now before one argues it, yes Cesc is superior to Ander in play making/ passing ability. I believe we went for Herrera because he offers greater amounts of energy, team-work, drive and commitment. All admirable qualities but they won't overcompensate for his inherent deficiencies as a manipulator of the game.

City is again not the greatest comparison because Yaya Toure's passing ability and vision are world-class - something Ander or Strootman haven't displayed so far. People often under-rate that facet of his game, this is someone who's really expansive in his passing, having played in Guardiola's Barcelona. Matter of fact he regularly notches 100 passes per game while boasting 90 %+ pass completion. eg vs Liverpool he had 98 passes and 93 % pass accuracy.

Again, like you alluded to - I'm not arguing that it won't work in the right circumstances. But it's certainly not the best use of each players' ability, isn't as effective as a  prototypical 3 man midfield is supposed to be and isn't aesthetically pleasing either. Why settle for Strootman when we have a player of similar ilk and could instead go for Koke who would cost maybe £10-15 million more than Strootman and is unarguably the better prospect.

2670~~~
But is Yaya someone who can control games like you were originally stating? In fact its the biggest criticism.

Still, valid points, I feel we just view the game a little differently.

2671~~~
Agree that Koke would be a better signing than Strootman and with the general thrust of your post but I would like to see how Herrera and Blind settle in the side first. If Blind could perform the Carrick role to a decent standard then it could work because Carrick was our conductor and isn't that the role Bind's agent said he was promised ? Yeah his no Pirlo but they are different ways to skin a cat.

2672~~~
I do believe he can and does in fairness. May not be Xavi level at that but IMO he operates at a higher wavelength than what we have/ Strootman. Equally I could be under-rating them a bit and they could make me eat humble pie down the line.

But as you said, maybe we view the game in a different way. Apples and oranges. Having said that, I just desperately want United to have someone as aesthetically pleasing as Scholes while simultaneously taking charge of the game. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

All true. Maybe our current lot can develop into something extraordinary thus eliminating the need for procuring a player of the caliber of Koke. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2673~~~
I think Herrera is our key signing. Being successful or not will depend a lot on how he will do for us this season.
No worry about di Maria - he is absolute world class and will improve our attacking play a lot. Blind will give us a lot of stability as long as we will play him on a constand basis as DM.
Herrera is the connecting piece - our lung or our engine if you want to put it like that. He has the tools and the physics so I hope he will deliver.

2674~~~
<a class="username" data-user="86753, @Invictus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86753/">@Invictus</a> 
You do make a valid point about us lacking a metronomic expansive presence in our potential midfield. In the short term we do have Carrick though, who LVG seems to rate very highly. Perhaps Blind has been brought in to eventually replace him from the first team and take over the metronomic duties. 

I know you think Blind doesn't have the expansive aspect to his game that a Busquets/Alonso/Carrick posses. However, he is a metronomic passer who given the time, has the ability and the tools to grow into this role. I personally haven't seen much of him but I believe that he has what it takes (the basics and foundation) to take his game into the next level.

2675~~~
I've never heard midfield traits be referred to as <i>metronomic</i>. I'm severely lagging behind in this new era of football buzzwords.

I'm excited by him though. His grit in midfield is nothing short of algebraic.

2676~~~
Here's hoping he can come back and have a solid base to work from.

He hasn't been particularly impressive but it's been hard with effectively no midfield partner alongside him.

2677~~~
IMO he was one of our best, if not our best player vs Swansea on the first day. We went to shit shortly after he was subbed off.

2678~~~
Not really saying much is it? We were fairly shocking all round against Swansea.

He was solid but didn't stand out for me. Didn't really offer too much but had a good touch, gave the ball away a few times but mostly kept possession well.

2679~~~
Not saying much at all, but it was his first competitive game for us in a team not playing well at all. Let's judge him beside somebody like Di Maria. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2680~~~
I'm really excited to see him in the same midfield as Blind/Di Maria.

2681~~~
I think it has more to do with the quality of teams increasing than any special treatment. LA Galaxy played like a pub team.

2682~~~
Give him chance, It was his first game in the Premier League, he's a top midfielder. Also, I seem to remember him doing pretty well against us a few years back.

2683~~~
I'm looking forward to seeing Herrera play with Carrick. I wish both would recover and play soon.

2684~~~
He's just a poor man's Joe Allen ya know.

2685~~~
I, too, am hopeful that Blind will be able to play that role whilst offering better protection to the back four. I read an article on his last season at Ajax where De Boer had him playing that Busquerts role, obviously to an inferior standard, but it does show that he can at least run a match. I think if we play the trio of Blind-Herrera-Di Maria, the unit will be stronger than the sum of individual parts in that trio. You can have that trio with a point upwards or at the base, such is the versatility of Herrera in that he can play as part of the double pivot or he can be pushed up, these things can be implemented in a single match.
Another thing is that Herrera is still readjusting to a deeper role, after spending the last couple of seasons playing as the furthest midfielder. It will obviously take a bit of time for him to settle since he is doing this ina new country, amongst new teammates some of whom are absolute gabbage and in a team that is still finding it's feet. That said I think there is a few midfields that can match the Herrera,Di Maria and Blind/Carrick axis because who is brave enough to push up against such a quick midfield ?

2686~~~
I really wouldn't play that front 3 together. They'll end up getting in each other's way IMO. Drop 1, or even 2 and add in Mata &/or Januzaj.

2687~~~
Agree, Falcao, RvP and Rooney playing together seems like a terrible idea. Falcao is a pure predator, RvP is a #9 and Rooney is far, far, far better at #9 than #10. Playing all three would just be a case of fitting in the players we think are least droppable, not the ones who'd actually work together the best.

Mata should be our first choice #10. If he still doesn't perform then dropping him is fine but actually <i>intending</i> to play an inferior #10 ahead of him is stupid.

2688~~~
I didn't get around to replying last night and I can see you have made several excellent posts since expanding your viewpoint. I can certainly see what you are getting at and we could need 2 CM's to make it work in your method IMO, but there are more ways than one to play a midfield 3 and it does seem that LvG is very keen to bring Strootman in.

Maybe two very rounded CM's in front of Blind rising up as the conductor can work very well as well, we shall know more by Christmas.

2689~~~
The last 8 top attacking/def midfielders I think who havebeen available/sold have been Mata, Fabregas, Kroos, Matic, Di Maria, Fernando, Blind & Herrera. We have bought 4 of them.

2690~~~
Well yes. It might and probably will work with Van Gaal at the helm, especially if like you said he's more than eager to sign Strootman. My main concern was with the aesthetic appeal of things, but as long as we're successful and playing good football using his methods I'll be more than happy. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2691~~~
There isn't a fixed way to play the game, likewise, there isn't a fixed set of players to play a midfield three. A regista is an important player but he is not be all and end all. You do realise that Xavi, Modric and Pirlo are all very different players? At the end of it, it really depends on how the team is set up and what kind of players there are in the team. Most of the time, teams who wins the midfield battle have 1) More bodies in midfield and 2) Flexibility.

Juventus have Pirlo as their main playmaker but they don't play a genuine #10 whereas we have Rooney and Mata, a hybrid attacking midfielder/CM (Di Maria) and Herrara a mix between a #8 and a #10. If LVG manages to get his philosophy through, our 3-5-2 would have far more tactical flexibility compared to Juventus who sometimes find themselves in major trouble when a team sacrifices someone to man-mark Pirlo.

Barca's midfield trio fits your description of the "ideal" 3 man midfield, but it is incredibly fluid and have other players playing in such close proximity thus enabling them to have complete control over the ball. Xavi also played with two players who would easily make the top 10 all time list.

Pirlo at AC Milan played with sometimes not one but three playmakers. He strangely turned shit for awhile when they all left and he became the sole playmaker.

Alonso was great for Real, but got found out a few times in the big games, especially in the CL when Ozil and Ronaldo wasn't giving the midfield enough support. That's the reason why Mourinho went to buy Modric.

2692~~~
Agreed, a regista is a luxury, there Are very few top ones.

Worth noting that Scholes and Pirlo started off playing behind the striker.

Chelsea didn't have one when Mourinho first went to Chelsea and was so successful, like many many other very successful teams.

2693~~~
Yep, it would be like forcing the biggest names into the team because they're undroppable. I really can't see that 3 working together unless we go 4-4-2 (diamond) with Rooney at the tip, but as you mentioned, I'd rather either Mata or even AdM there ahead of Rooney.

2694~~~
Looking forward to seeing this guy play week in, week out more so than any of our signings I think.

2695~~~
I'd rather Adnan and Herrera there too. Rooney is awful as a #10 IMO.

2696~~~
Let's just hope we start moulding the best team and not just a cast of the best individuals.

2697~~~
So, Marcos Rojo, who hasn't even put on a shirt yet, gets a 'Performances in 2014/2015', as does everyone else except Ander?

Let's give this a thread change.

Anyway, really looking forward to watching him. Been a fan for a few years, and I think he'll be a surprise as to just how good he is. Crucial for us, we have no substitute for him.

2698~~~
Has he recovered from his injury yet?

2699~~~
Even before Kroos' emergence as a pure #8, Bayern didn't play a Regista when they won the treble. The one closest to a Regista they have is probably Schweinsteiger but I'd liken him closer to a box-to-box midfielder.

Scholes, Pirlo, Kroos, Modric all started off playing further up the pitch. Another example would be Hernanes at Inter who started out as an attacking midfielder but now plays as a deep-lying playmaker. No reason to think why Herrara can't do the same for us. It is not the hardest role to play in football. I can easily think of 3 or 4 more which require much more ability.

2700~~~
Yup. Can't wait to see him get started, it's hard to say this but my favourite signing thus far.

2701~~~
Easy to say when Falcao hasn't turned out for us yet, and Di Maria only once <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>  Still quite incredible typing out those names, in addition to Rojo, Shaw, Blind and Herrera

Hope the combination of Herrera, Di Maria and Mata altogether mean a consistent resurgence of fluid play with the ball on the ground (something which never eventuated with just Kagawa for an extended period).

2702~~~
Does anyone think he might be converted to a more defensive midfielder in order to play alongside Di Maria? Not purely a central defensive mid like Carvalho. He wouldnt have the luxury to bomb forward every time, instead he might be asked to stay back, tidy up and play as a more deeper lying playmaker?

2703~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a>

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/ander-herrera-2014-2015-performance.394201/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/ander-herrera-2014-2015-performance.394201/</a>

2704~~~
I don't mind where he players in midfield really, he's such a well rounded player he gibes us such options, there aren't many midfielders left that have such a vast skill set as our Herrera. I hope he does get paired with Blind to ensure he isn't too restricted in his game, we've missed players making late runs into the box these past few years.

2705~~~
I don't have faith in his tackling ability, he reminds me of an improved Scholes in this respect. He constantly fouls, his standing tackle is poor.. but he can put in a decent slide tackle.

2706~~~
In a two? No way. In a three he needs someone else helping him defend like Blind, Carrick or Fletcher would.

Ander likes to try and make a tackle, what he cannot do is sense danger and snuff it out with good positioning and he's also prone to being very rash in the challenge getting booked and giving away freekicks. He is not the man you want in front of you as a CB

In fact he has all the same issues that Fellaini had when he was used in front of the defence

2707~~~
To be honest I'm surprised so many people want to see him in midfield two with Blind. He probably CAN play there, but this role puts limits on him.

2708~~~
Next to Blind he'd be fine. He just needs someone next to him with more of a mind for defending just like Scholes needed. That allows him to get on with what he's good at on the ball.

Blind is a tidy passer with a great long pass, but he's also a defender and will try to pinch the ball and cover dangerous positions. He'll do a better job defensively than someone like Fletcher

2709~~~
Why can't he play in a 2 with Blind in the same way that Ramsey plays in a 2 with Arteta / Flamini?  It doesn't seem to limit Ramsey that much, who managed to score a shed load of goals from that position last year.

2710~~~
I just don't want him to sit deep all the time, in midfield 3 he would've much more freedom. 

Ramsey has terrific goal record, but I don't think Herrera is on the same level.

2711~~~
Ander is definitely not on Ramsey's level. And next to Blind you can rest assured Ander wont be sitting, thats what Blind is good at. He's similar to Carrick in that he's prepared to pass the ball around from deep and try to fill the spaces that the opposition will try to exploit. He's probably not as good as Carrick was defensively at his best, but we'll have to see.

2712~~~
Doesn't Van Gaal always play 3 in the middle anyway? I thought that was the one thing he never compromised on. As in the rest of the formation is variable but 3 in the middle doesn't change. I think I saw him say it on some video.

Herrera next to Di Maria with Blind in behind them sounds dandy to me.

2713~~~
He played 442 at AZ so I dont think he is completely inflexible on it.

2714~~~
Hopefully this is the plan, starting this weekend.

2715~~~
The thing is if we start Di Maria, Herrera and Blind, then only two of Rooney/Falcao/RVP/Mata will start. Di Maria or Herrera will be acting as a #10.

2716~~~
Di Maria, Herrera and Blind is fine for a midfield 3.

Rooney/Falcao/RVP/Mata would have to fit into a 3 up front, most likely 2 going wide (Rooney/Mata) and 1 through the middle (Falcao/RVP). The other option is to use Mata behind 2 strikers, but that leaves us very narrow

2717~~~
Its a 5-3-2. You play your five defenders, then the midfield three of ADM, H and B, which means you have only two spots left up front for 4 people.

2718~~~
We dont have to play 1 single system. In fact LVG tends to like to swap between them during games.

4-3-3 is where we could use all of them.

2719~~~
Hoping he starts today. Still such an exciting signing, been overshadowed by the arrival of the others but he will be such an important player for us.

2720~~~
I don't see any problem with that, do you ?

2721~~~
If we go 4-3-3 then it could either mean Januzaj comes in for Mata to play on the wing or Mata and Rooney sort of flank Falcao/Van Persie to create a Christmas tree formation. The problem is that we don't have enough pace in the side to effectively play a 4-3-3 I think our best bet is to play the diamond and flood the central areas to dominate the ball then look to have Di Maria breaking on either wing, occasionally. Having Mata, Van Persie and Rooney in the same side was such a bright idea from Moyes.

2722~~~
With all the crazyness and buzz over the two massive signings of DiMaria and Falcao, almost forgottten we have actually signed Herrera and Shaw where they have both been injured.

2723~~~
Is he fit to play today?

2724~~~
Seems to be. I'm sure he will be involved as he has been training all week, I don't know if he will start though, I'm hoping so.

2725~~~
Doesn't appear to be with the rest of the match day squad at the lowry.

2726~~~
Mata sitting infrot of Herrera and Blind, with Di Maria out wide.

2727~~~
Don't say that. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2728~~~
Please don't say things like that <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

2729~~~
It doesn't make sense to play him there when we have 2 players perfectly moulded to a deeper position in Blind and Carrick. He has the versatility to play there in injury situations but certainly shouldn't be he starting position. 4-3-3 is the way to go IMO, with Di Maria and Herrera on either side of a defensive minded player in Carrick or Blind.

2730~~~
Confirmed starter.

2731~~~
He's a hard worker isn't he? Some engine.

2732~~~
He's fecking brilliant. Pressing, passing, composure and goals. He's got it all!

2733~~~
Really good strike that. Concentrated on striking a difficult ball across the body.

2734~~~
The balance between him and Blind has been great so far. Blind has been the more defensive obviously, but Herrera has dropped in whenever Blind has drifted forward. 

Nice finish from Herrera, previous to it the timing of his runs into the box have been excellent.

2735~~~
I think I want to marry him.

2736~~~
Seems like a very likeable player. Looks like he's pleased to be with us and enjoying his football, our new Chicharito.

2737~~~
Gets box to box, good in possession, can tackle, is always available for the pass and looks to pose a goal threat. 

But seriously this is what we've been missing for 3-4 seasons... A proper midfielder!

2738~~~
He's had some sloppy moments. Still a bit  rusty.

2739~~~
Been excellent so far imo.

2740~~~
A goal and assist already - good to see hes already equalled Nani/Valancia/Young/Carrick/Cleverleys stats from last season

2741~~~
He is going to be terrific player for us.

2742~~~
Best player on the pitch today, closely followed by Di Maria. Great player!

2743~~~
1 goal and 2 assists in the first half. Decent. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2744~~~
Had we signed Herrera last summer last season would've been better. Had we not subbed Herrera against Swansea we'd have won our last home game. Had Herrera not been injured for the Sunderland and Burnley we probably would've got something more from those games too. That's how much I believe in him.

2745~~~
He's been special. I absolutely love his tenacity too. He is always after the guy with the ball. We've missed that.

2746~~~
For all the talk about Di Maria and Falcao, i think this guy may turn out to best our "best" signing. Hes got pace, energy, technique, drive and seems to be an attacking threat as well. Simply his energy and industry makes our midfield seem ten times better than it was last year.

2747~~~
Outrageously good. fecking hell, this what a good alround CM looks like.

2748~~~
No.

2749~~~
A central midfielder that scores <i>and </i>assists? What is this sorcery?!

2750~~~
Been brilliant in the middle today. Fantastic hit and the one two before setting up Rooneys goal was pure quality.

2751~~~
A very un-Spanish Spanish midfielder. He looks a fiery character. His long range passing isn't the best, but he gives our midfield so much more mobility, and a lot of fight too.

2752~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2753~~~
What a miss he's been. Please don't get injured.

2754~~~
Goal will give him confidence, be great after a run of games with consistent team selection I think.

This isn't the acid test though, even Cleverley would look pretty decent against this shower of shite.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Nah Cleverley would still be abysmal.</span>

2755~~~
He's a bit of a scruffy player like Suarez - ball manages to ricochet of everybody in sight but he somehow manages to get through.

2756~~~
Looks the real deal Herrera hopefully he can stay injury free and carry this form all season.

2757~~~
Wait a minute... yea you did just smiley your own post. Perfectly acceptable in the circumstances <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2758~~~
Been brilliant!

2759~~~
Our central midfielder just scored a goal, lads. Let that sink in.

2760~~~
He is looking some player, can't wait to see him up against the top teams in the PL will really see his worth even more then.

2761~~~
Looking like our best central midfielder since Carrick in his pomp. Truly a box to box type and has taken to the EPL like a duck to water so far.

2762~~~
He's definitely benefited from Blind just sitting in. Gives him license to go forward.

2763~~~
You might be right but that could also mean Moyes would still be our manager... Worked out for the best then!

2764~~~
Such a busy player, love the way he gets stuck in.

2765~~~
Best player on the pitch by a mile for me.

2766~~~
Keep changing my mind on this every 2 minutes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So busy, generating movement and rarely misplacing a pass... tenacious and terrier like in defense. The different the players around you can make!

2767~~~
Constant energy, brains, enthusiasm, goals in him, priceless. This is what we've missed for over half a decade at least.

2768~~~
same here.

2769~~~
It is quite ridiculous that how much time it took us to buy a midfielder like him. We have been waiting for someone like him since 2008

2770~~~
Love this lad. He's everything our midfield has been screaming out for.

2771~~~
His movement off the ball makes it so much easier for others. Brings out the best of Mata who IMO will be vital for us this season.

2772~~~
Him and Blind are amazing. Such an improvement on what we've had in the past.

2773~~~
Was class today, all action performance. 8 tackles apparently as well

2774~~~
He has practically every quality that we have been looking for. Brilliant today as well.

2775~~~
Quickly becoming a huge favourite of mine

2776~~~
Box to box stuff from him. Massive upgrade from Cleverley.

2777~~~
The type of player we have lacked for years in midfield, energy and aggression mixed with technique and desire.

2778~~~

2779~~~
He's not getting much of a mention but I thought he was absolutely quality today. Him and Blind looked great together and the two of them read the game so well. Unlucky not to get another goal aswel, but I was delighted to see him get his first goal for the club.

2780~~~
Showed today why he's going to be such a crucial player for us.

2781~~~
Flying a bit under the radar with our other new signings, but looking forward he could become our most important player. He's everywhere in midfield - tackles, puts on pressure, passes, scores goals etc. The midfielder we've all wanted for so long!

2782~~~
How long has it been since we have  a proper box to box midfielder?  Absolute class today.  Love Blind today too.  So much composure.  I haven't seen that since Carrick at his best

2783~~~
Another fantastic performance among our new signings. Little terrier, great passing and a goal on top too.

2784~~~
Arguably MOTM today, was great and the type of player we've been crying out for in midfield for ages.

2785~~~
Does exactly what we bought him for. Great signing.

2786~~~
Watching the Rooney goal again, 2 give and go's.... so good!

2787~~~
He's brilliant. Love the way he gets stuck in, takes no shit from anyone.

2788~~~
Absolutely the perfect player for us. His energy, passing, tackling and workrate is what we've been crying out for for years and years.

2789~~~
Excellent performance, so happy for him.

2790~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.gyazo.com/e16a3f33390b1c0203e18860124f2b48.png" src="http://i.gyazo.com/e16a3f33390b1c0203e18860124f2b48.png"/>

2791~~~
Was brilliant. Exactly the opposite of Cleverley - has the confidence to take a shot, will drive past people, will tackle and will assist. 

We just need some luck with injuries.

2792~~~
He's a real actual midfielder. Wow.

2793~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> haven't had one of those in a while!

2794~~~
just shows that the people worried about his 81 percent pass accuracy last season panicked for nothing.

2795~~~
As much as we've needed di Maria, he has also drastically improved us too.

His energy, passing and general combativeness is night and day to what we've been used too. 

He was fantastic today and in my eyes a very close runner up to do maria as MOTM

2796~~~
His one touch football for the Rooney goal was understatedly brilliant.

2797~~~
Brilliant performance. I can't decide what was more exciting, the goal, the chances created or the tackles. We've been missing all three of them in CM for too long. A massive upgrade on his compatriot, El Clev.

2798~~~
Best player on the pitch today. Only one thing I don't like about him: the long name on his shirt.

2799~~~
Love his tenacity and urgency. Wants to be involved all the time and keeps things ticking over and genuinely looks happy to be here. Really pleased for him.

2800~~~
Really pleased for him (and us). A great way to restart his season. Always willing, never hiding. That's my Ander <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2801~~~
Excellent performance. Going to be such a key player for us if he can keep this up. Love his tenacity.

2802~~~
Best presser of the ball today, his passing, his defense, his drive, his intelligence, his ability to be comfortable in all areas of the pitch. 2nd name on the sheet.

2803~~~
Brilliant today. A real all round midfielder, created a lot and also tackled.

2804~~~
My Man of the Match. Excellent.

2805~~~
I rated him a perfect 10. Amazing

2806~~~
The sort of midfielder we've been crying out for over the past few years. Really like the look of him as a player.

2807~~~
It puts things into perspective. This is the performance we should be seeing from a top midfielder. He was all over the place, attacking and defending with such energy. I liked the way he keeps passing and moving into space to create options for others. It makes such a difference when we get around the box. He suits our team really well and is gonna be a fans favourite here. He's still a bit rusty so that excuses some sloppiness in possession though.

2808~~~
So that's how a quality CM plays, almost forgot it

2809~~~
Worked really well with Blind too. When Blind was going forward Herrera got back and equipped his place on the field. May be the start of a good midfield partner ship there!!

2810~~~
Nah, Cleverley's just more of a Spanish-type midfielder.

2811~~~
In response to people saying "it was only QPR"

2812~~~
Yep, noticed that a few times. He's a very clever player is Herrera, infact all three of the midfield covered each other today. Looks very promising.

2813~~~
Just having a player like him has helped the balance of the team so much. I just love his energy so much and think he'll be so important for us this season. Looks like he loves playing for us too which makes him even more adorable.

2814~~~
He's just delightful.

2815~~~
A midfielder that will make runs past the strikers and look to get in the box, yes please.

2816~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Exactly. Also funny how people don't point out that Chelsea have mostly stuffed 'only' newly promoted teams, or teams that struggled to stay up last season.

2817~~~
He was great today and suits that wide midfield position in the diamond perfectly.

2818~~~
He'll quickly become one of my favourite players, such a great player and likeable person. Easily MOTM for me.

2819~~~
Did very well today. Both he and Di Maria have a tendancy to mishit or get their pass wrong every now and then, giving the ball back to the opposition but other than that he was really really good today. And tbh I was expecting that with Blind coming into the team, who also covers for the weakness I mentioned because he's fine with keeping the ball at a 90%+ accuracy and covering the positions they leave behind.

Some nice passes, won the freekick that opened the scoring, took his goal and because Blind was there covering him he was able to press forward aggressively and actually make 8 tackles and 1 interception, being the most effective ball winner on the pitch. It was a performance similar to Ramsey today

2820~~~
Jayzus.

106 touches.
91 % passer rating.
100 % headers won.
8 tackles.
9.9 rating out of perfect 10.

323 total touches between him, Blind, Di Maria.

<span style="font-size: 9px">Manchester United midfielders.</span>

Is this real life ? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2821~~~
He created two or three chances alone with passes inside to Rafael and the Januzaj one at the end.

2822~~~
He's a midfielder. A real life one. He can run and do shit with the ball. It's a yes from me.

2823~~~
He's class, I can't believe people were using his lack of caps for Spain as some sort of indicator that he's not cut out for the top level, which is ridiculous. He'll be a great midfielder for us, and he'll be playing for Spain in Euro 2016 too, I'd wager.

2824~~~
323 total touches between him, Blind, Di Maria.

Holy hell <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2825~~~
They also scored six at Goodison Park. I mean, I'm all for praising Herrera, there's no need to bring Chelsea into it and trying to downplay their start to the season.

2826~~~
I was gutted when Moyes decided against signing him last season, then signed his mate from Everton. Herrera is a boss and we haven't seen anything yet.

2827~~~
Classy little player.

2828~~~
But at least he managed to avoid the confidence-shattering freakshow that was last season. It might have ruined him.

2829~~~
Nah, I am quite sure del Bosque will still be playing the same team, Casillas in goal, Xavi-Xabi in midfield, and his hero Torres up front.

2830~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Waited a long long time to see another dynamic, mobile and fluent United midfield.

2831~~~
Acording to BBC's match report:

2832~~~
Beautiful game. He did everything, passing, tackling, goal.. 
We waited for you Ander for so long.

2833~~~
Love him. Great game today, my motm despite Di Maria.

2834~~~
That's absolute class. Calling it now, future United captain.

2835~~~
It's called a midfield.

2836~~~
Blind had 110+ passes with a 95% accuracy. As they play together, Blind could consistently pass with very high accuracy. Finally.

2837~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Spot on!

2838~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/14/1410709537619_wps_15_Sept_14th_2014_Manchester.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/14/1410709537619_wps_15_Sept_14th_2014_Manchester.jpg"/>

Nice to see him make a tribute to Jones

2839~~~
MOTM for me. Been too long since I've watched such a well-rounded performance from a United CM. 91% passing. 8 tackles. A goal and an assist. Sensational.

2840~~~
He was excellent today, got box to box, passed it well most of the time, linked up with the attack, made tackles and scored, probably would have a 2nd as well if not for RvP getting in his way.

2841~~~
We've gone from Cleverley, Fletcher, Fellaini to Blind, Herrera and Di Maria. I can't quite believe it. What a joy it was watching one touch passing, movement and interplay in our midfield. First time for years.

2842~~~
That Ander Herrera on his back looks ridiculous. He should just put Ander. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2843~~~
It was a joy to see 2 midfielders with a clue about how to play football to be honest, it's quite a simple game really. Both just do the basics very, very well, that's all we want to see and what we haven't been seeing from the clowns that we've had in there for ages. 

Herrera just wants the ball all the time, the only worry I have is thinking he'll be burnt out if he plays at that intensity every game! He was still charging round at 4-0 up as though his life depended on it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2844~~~
he played as an AM that season.

2845~~~
I really like this lad I think he's going to become a top notch player for us.

2846~~~
I thought he was excellent, a proper midfield performance.

2847~~~
Like I said in the other thread: this guy will make 'Team Of The Year' next to Fabgregas.

2848~~~
By the way, Ray Wilkins called him an average player after the match. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He also called Blind "not United quality at all".

2849~~~
It's incredible the amount of media outlets are still calling him "former Atletico Madrid player". No wonder all the pundits were questioning whether or not he was a good enough player for United. They've never seen him play before this season, or even heard of him.

2850~~~
You guys wouldn't believe it but Ray Wilkins just called him average for a 30 million player, on the back of that performance. Absolute bollocks. 

He has it all in his locker but just needs a bit more consistency to his game. I don't exactly mean this on a game to game basis but rather within a game. He seems a bit hit and miss at times but if he adds consistency to his game he would be in the elite band of midfielders. I am by no means criticising him. He was absolutely sensational today. Just think he has the ability to become a top notch midfielder, if he stabilises his game to his peak levels or thereabouts.

I was always an advocate of the diamond from the start and it looked brilliant today. We had Blind, a great deep midfielder who is a great outlet with his quick one touch passes and intelligent play all around.. Di Maria can play in the left midfield role brilliantly whilst providing width as well. I was just slightly worried if Herrera wouldn't have been effective in the wider areas providing good support for Rafael. Theoretically it should have worked as he is extremely mobile and a good link up player and it ultimately did work. He provided excellent support for Rafael whilst being ever present in the centre as well. Our midfield finally has the quality and balance that we always craved for.

2851~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2852~~~
Yup, saw that. Ridiculous claim. I mean, ok if he said that prior to game but after it?

2853~~~
He's our replacement for Roy Keane. 9 years late, but better now than never.

2854~~~
I was listening to his interview on MUTV after the game. He was happy he scored but was more happy because the team won. The suggestion about him being a captain is not a bad one. Bit too soon yet.

2855~~~
Where on earth did he say that. Oh by the way, were you United quality Ray?

2856~~~
He's very intelligent, humble, calm and a box to box midfielder which I think is an ideal position for a captain (probably due to Keano) and he also seems to be vocal on the pitch, which was a pleasant surprise for me. Not afraid to get stuck in when he needs to. Obviously early days yet but looking forward to seeing him hopefully develop further in the coming years.

2857~~~
Di Maria was superb today, but Herrera was my MOTM. Apart from giving the ball away cheaply a couple of times, I thought he was superb. Done everything you would ask from a box to box midfielder, in my opinion. Superb!

2858~~~
I thought the understated but brilliant positional awareness and redistribution from Blind was worth a shout to. Isn't it a good feeling to have 3 potential MOM candidates from a midfield 3! Thought it would never happen again at one point!

2859~~~
He likes a tackle too. And he's much better at it than Scholes.

2860~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2861~~~
Incredibly stupid shirt <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Just seen it for the first time really.

2862~~~
I think Herrera, Di Maria and Rafael are the most spirited players at the club right now. Always great to have characters like these at the club. Immensely likeable as well.

2863~~~
Wilkins is a Chelsea lapdog. He's like a puppy that get kicked and kicked then will still lick your hand and wag it's tail. You would never guess he ever played for us. He just makes me angry.

2864~~~
Thoroughly impressive, that was exactly the kind of performance he is known to be producing.

2865~~~
He gets it wrong sometimes, with misplaced passes and fouls.  The upside is how much he does during a game, and that is HUGE. Playing only one game a week he should be able to keep up this intensity.

2866~~~
91% pass accuracy, 2 fouls. He barely got anything wrong today.

2867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> There was a point after the game where the presenter said something along the lines of "Utd fans would probably be wondering if they're back" and Wilkins lets out a sly sarcastic laugh in the background.

2868~~~
TBF most people are.

2869~~~
I know, right. Who would have thought it? Their first game together as well. They can only get better from here once they start to gel. Exciting times ahead.

2870~~~
He was probably also one of the guys who said we didnt need Di Maria. Absolutely clueless and Chelsea biased this guy.

2871~~~
Thought he did a very important job keeping things ticking. Always looking to get on the ball, at one point in the second half he made 3 passes moving from one side of the pitch to the other and keeping things going nicely. Gets stuck in as well. He might not be a c£30m player but he's a clear step up from clev

2872~~~
Great performance from him today.

Wish they would sort out the name of the back of his shirt though! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2873~~~
I know right? It doesn't even fit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2874~~~
He's pathetic. The way Chelsea got rid of him and he still loves them to bits.

2875~~~
Said during the game that he looks like a leader out there. He's going to be a fans favourite for sure, I just hope everyone else pays him his dues. Somehow goes under the radar of many even though he's having a massive influence.

2876~~~
So glad he is getting the recognition from more and more ppl now. I wanted to sign him so much last season, my favourite signing.
Oh and Scholes will hopefully give him a rest now too as he has scored and assisted, that's all most British pundits want to see.

Some still won't believe it for a while, but we needed him much more than we needed a Fabregas or Kroos. Would either of them had made as many tackles as him today or had the energy to run, press, defend and attack all game long? Nope, they are different players and better attacking-wise, but we have enough attacking players ourselves. What we need is someone with good technique, brain AND defensive abilities, stamina, agression, God he has everything we need. Of course he will misplace some passes, but who cares? Even Di Maria did that. 

Lovely player and from the first second he had been signed he seems to be extremely happy to be here.

2877~~~
His shirt name reminds me of this:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.psv.nl/upload/79c798cd-3528-4b19-9066-f674ebe62bcf_1160477955716-VennegoorCeltic3751.jpg" src="http://www.psv.nl/upload/79c798cd-3528-4b19-9066-f674ebe62bcf_1160477955716-VennegoorCeltic3751.jpg"/> 

Why have him and Marcos Rojo got their full names on their shirts?

2878~~~
What should they say to him? 'Sorry, some people arent happy with the name on your shirt, choose between Ander or Herrera please. Thank you'.

2879~~~
Very good performance from him. He's a brilliant all rounder and does everything you hope a CM would do. 

What I really like is his pass and move style. Always available, gives other players and option and once he gets the ball he already knows what to do. 

Wonderful signing, 36m will look like a bargain. But yeah, sort out the name on the shirt <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2880~~~
Probably the best midfield performance I've seen at OT in a good couple of years (though the standards aren't that high).

No less than I expect from him (well he won't score and create every week). He's just all over teams, the pressure he puts on is worth £30m all day long. He forces errors and then once he gets the ball, he's got the balls to think attack. He's never going to pass it like Scholes or enforce like Keane but he's got the fine balance of a little bit of everything and I love that.

2881~~~
In terms of a partnership, without a doubt. Him and Blind provided so much awareness and energy in midfield, it was so refreshing to see. The polar opposite of what we've had recently.

Very promising start.

2882~~~
What I liked most about his peformance other than his technical quality which is superb, was that he never stopped moving. After years of midfielders that barely budge, it's great to see someone who is always busy, always looking to do something positive.

2883~~~
Oozes class. Really does seem to have everything in his locker and never afraid to ask for the ball (Scholesy style).

2884~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ray Wilkins called him average after today's game.

2885~~~
Im not so sure it's that. He was very positive about everything else related to us today. Strange assessment to say the least.

2886~~~
I heard that <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Also before kick off, he said we essentially wasted the money on AdM as our team needed investment elsewhere, not in attack....mind boggling.

I take it he didn't watch the creativity of our wingers & lack of CM's set all the last couple years???? AdM essentially covers 2 of our most troublesome areas - both at a world class level.

2887~~~
Be great if we could get a video of his highlights today. Any around yet?

2888~~~
OK this isant a ray Wilkins thread but I must disagree with your disagreement . Didn't see him today but he's on talksport a couple of morning a week and he's most often very negative about United.

2889~~~
Hands off! Ander is mine! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2890~~~
Ah I didn't watch the prematch coverage. Seems like another Paul Parker.

2891~~~
Was very sceptical about him, he was just amazing today.

2892~~~
Alright. Haven't seen much of him. You're probably right.

2893~~~
That's absolutely ridiculous.

2894~~~
Was a decent performance, but quality of opposition, especially in 2nd half was way too poor to make a real judgement. 

I cant wait to see how he fares against top quality midfields like City or Chelsea.  

I think a Herrera - Blind - Carrick threesome could be a very good battle with the best in the PL.

2895~~~
Carrick will struggle to get into this side now IMO. Especially if he doesn't improve on last seasons horrendous form.

2896~~~
Yeah people are getting a bit ahead of themselves but I already have a man crush on Ander. Such a combative bastard, an all-rounder and a leader. Everything we ever wanted in a CM.

2897~~~
He wasn't actually ABU or anything. Just some weird assessments, that's all.

"He's not seen much of Herrera, but in his mind, he's average"....like wtf? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2898~~~
I hope not.  He is a massive link between past and present and once fit, will become one of the most senior and influential members of the dressing room.  

Im a huge fan of his.  I think LVG is too.  He has another season or 2 in his locker.

2899~~~
Carrick will certainly thrive in this team configuration. Midfielders are only as good as the options that present themselves. I can't see Carrick having problems if players are constantly showing for balls.

2900~~~
Impossible to call how much Carrick still has to offer until we see him after his recovery.

2901~~~
Good stuff.

2902~~~
So am I right in thinking Herrera (and Di Maria in fact) already have more assists this season than the entire United midfield had during the entirety of last season?

2903~~~
he misplaced some passes but had 91% passing accuracy at the same time. He tried some riskier at times which is good because we looked very tidy as we wanted to dominate possesion rather than make risky passes, so I'm glad that there are players who try those passes. I think dimaria misplaced twice the passes and was MOTM, best plyer on the pitch..
.
And as for his tackling I think he was very tidy and cautious as well today, he didn't give away silly fouls and some of Phil Dowd's fouls were not fouls at all, he pressed very very well without giving away fouls like he did that in preseason. He was everywhere on the pitch and I am very happy for him as he will definitely love it here and will be fans favourite. Future star of the league, he could end up with two goals today and 3 assists while being amazing defensively. I love him and only pray for him to stay fit as his style of play is very demanding on his body. he might struggle with his ankles with his tyle of play. I wish he could stay fit

2904~~~
When we was signed someone said "He's the Spanish Tom Cleverly".

2905~~~
Today was the complete midfield package. Goal, clever assist, all action performance and some amazing through balls to go with those crunchy tackles.

He was liberated with Blind playing such a diciplined and intelligent game anchoring our midfield.

2906~~~
He was excellent. In all fairness I think he was wasted on the right today. I'd like to see him more central alongside Blind anchoring the midfield. I think they can work very well with Mata just ahead of them.

2907~~~
Wasted? He's the perfect player as a shuttler.

He didn't play wide, he played on the right of a midfield diamond with liberty to move where it pleased him. 

You couldn't really ask for more in terms of an allround CM performance than today, so how excactly was he wasted?

2908~~~
Without jumping the turtle too early now, he does kinda remind me a little of a young Roy Keane. Good work rate, agressive as feck, good passer, and can score goals.

2909~~~
He's like a hybrid of Keane and Scholes, but I don't mean that in a way where he is better than either, just shares a bit of both in terms of style. i hope he can be our spanish Robson.

2910~~~
He's my new favourite player. Just pure class.

2911~~~
He is "harder" on the tackle than I ever thought. His baby face certainly helps hide the nasty side to his game. A bit like Alonso in the tackle but different players obviously.

2912~~~
Fantastic performance. What we have missed for years. Over the moon to see him grab a goal too.

2913~~~
He's got the balance of being generally very good at a bit of everything. He's got legs, he can pass and move, he can slot a ball through,  great ability to carry it and he gets stuck in. We've lacked a properly well rounded midfielder for too long. In an older system under Fergie, that would've been ideal alongside a Carrick at his best.

2914~~~
Not only does he contribute all over the pitch he plays with passion to. Something we have been missing for a while.

2915~~~
Funnily enough I was thinking earlier that he's pretty much the player I'd hoped Cleverley could have become. It never quite happened for him obviously but still, we have Herrera...

2916~~~
Whoscored rated his performance today at 9.9......di Maria was 8.9.

2917~~~
He's the sort of player I most enjoy watching.

2918~~~
overall his performance was better, i mean 8 tackles and 4 chances created. Herrera, Di Maria and Blind were outstanding. Hard to pick a MOTM.

2919~~~
Finally we got a midfielder that covers every blades of the grass on the pitch.  Lovely goal from him.

2920~~~
Rafael too.

2921~~~
True. I thought Cleverly would be exactly like this. Making us tick with the occasional run in the box and all.

2922~~~
Last season is a write off. 

Carrick has played the Blind role to perfection many times for us. The only difference is he's never had someone as good and mobile as Herrera next to him. Personally, given that we still looked vulnerable on the counter I'd drop one of the strikers or Mata to play both Carrick and Blind in the tougher games.

2923~~~
I'm very optimistic because this was his second match in the PL, he will settle and his performances will reflect that and it's the same with Di Maria, Blind and Rojo. If we had him last season instead of ''you know who''.....

2924~~~
I like the fact he can pass the ball but he can tackle too, and it seems he likes to tackle as well. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2925~~~
Apparently he is a real big match player and was often one of the best players whenever Bilbao played Barca and Real

2927~~~
To be honest, I keep hearing how it's QPR and stuff. But, Ander is 25 and he's regularly come up against the best in Spain and bossed it at times. It's not like he's an unknown, inexperienced player. If there's anybody we can say this about, that would be Blind [who's coming from the Eredivise], not Ander.

2928~~~
Yep, there's a bit of a concensus that outside of the big 2 in La Liga (possibly big 3 atm <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>) - he was probably in the top 3 midfielders in the league. Though he played a bit more attacking (with Rico and Iturraspe holding).

Hence the diamond might suit him as much as it suits AdM.

2929~~~
Love the way he is always on the move. Passes and moves straight away. That has been our major problem. We would pass the ball and then just stand there giving no option for a pass.

2930~~~
My MOTM. Just awesome and linked up with Rooney for some reason. They were telepathic!

2931~~~
When Cleverley first broke into the scene and shamelessly compared his "pass and move" game with Iniesta and Xavi, we were told that he could reach such promise one day at similar level as Herrera is now.

Turns out all he managed is passing sideways and moving like headless chicken.

2932~~~
He and blind will be vital this season. Di Maria and Falcao will get the attention but is the other 2 who will make us tick.

2933~~~
Absolutely. It is a delight to see so many players in our team want the ball. It is a complete transformation.

2934~~~
MOTM for me, just watched the match. Goal, assist, he was everywhere, pressing, a lot of tackling and fantastic flicks, he's a joy to watch.

2935~~~
I voted him MOTM and then immediately realised I had forgotten Di Maria. Both were good though. Was nice to see midfielders passing and moving. We didn't look static for the first time in a long time.

2936~~~
Aye. These guys will be responsible for creating the foundations that allow Di Maria and co. to express themselves. Really impressed with Blind's reading of the game and Herrera's tenacity to win the ball back, not to mention both appear to have a solid passing range.

It will be interesting to see how they both perform when pressed (let's face it, Blind had a really easy ride of things yesterday). But I have faith in what I've seen.

2937~~~
MOTM for me. Covered loads of ground, always looking to receive the ball, was on the move constantly, took his goal well and set up Rooney's. Di Maria and Blind both had great games but it just seemed so long since I've seen a midfielder put in an all-round performance like that for us.

2938~~~
Yep. What's nice is that no one can agree who was MOTM – because there were so many good performances. The exact opposite of last season.

2939~~~
Blind is used to coming up against the press. It's pretty standard fare in Holland. While Herrera has more than held his own against the likes of Barca and Real. Hopefully, they continue that in a red shirt. The diamond is definitely the best formation for the players we have. Suits Di Maria down to the ground. Allows Herrera to bomb on, while Mata is allowed to mop up in the 10, rather than dictate the play. Once RVP gets his form back, I think it will be himself and Falcao who will be first choice. But as of now, Rooney looks to be the second striker after Falcao...

2940~~~
The anticipation of blind is what I expected to be honest. What I didn't expect was how quickly he could turn over the ball - his head was up the whole time enabling him to move the ball quickly and efficiently. Really impressed. 

Herrera is a player. That simple. Just looks quality.

2941~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlmSA_OC8_8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2942~~~
I don't think it's a given to be great at reading the game. Can't really write it off as expected. But I do agree his passing and awareness on the ball was something I didn't expect at all.

2943~~~
A great performance, but in each game he has played one or two woeful passes that go straight to the opposition. At least he has his head up, but hopefully he can get those errors out of his play entirely.

2944~~~
His long passing isn't perfect, but nothing that he can't sort out.

2945~~~
Yep. I'll take the first time finish, the one-two with Di Maria and Mata to set up Rooney, and his sincere desire to work hard as evidence of his quality. But against the best, those kinds of passes can be brutally pounced upon. Something to work on in training.

2946~~~
I think you're being harsh. As far as I remember he made one long ball and that was awry because he slipped. He's showed plenty in pre-season that he's quite adept at passing long.

2947~~~
I absolutely love this guy, always wanted him and Martinez from that Bilbao side ahead of Munian.

2948~~~
Same. Thought he was outstanding against us that time when Muniain got the plaudits. As I said in my original post from his last thread, I saw him for the first time in the Spain u21 team and thought 'this guy is class but surely he belongs to Barca or Real'. Kept an eye on him ever since when I realised he wasn't.

2949~~~
Yes, the pass around 12 minutes was due to a slip (I recall a misplaced pass in the transition to attack, but I can't remember where). And di Maria was guilty of a give-away too. When the performance was great nit-picking tends to happen-my apologies. Believe me, I'm happy for him and the result.

2950~~~
When he's on the ball he's expected to create. He'll make a few iffy passes each game. Same as Giggs used to.

2951~~~
ICYMI

2952~~~
Lack of midweek games might actually be quite advantageous for us with a completely new midfield. There's not much need for rotation so we can stick with this Blind, Herrera and Di Maria trio which will only get better as they get more familiar with each other. Plus they'll have plenty of training time to build chemistry and learn each others movements.

They'll only get better as a unit, exciting times for us.

2953~~~
found on Reddit



Look how he drags away Kranjcar and tells Rafael to pass to RvP, who stands alone there with a lot of space. The guy is a real team player on top of his other qualities. Didnt want the ball, but going the extra meters to free up RvP. Fantastic stuff

2954~~~
Its the little things...

2955~~~
Nice. Took out 2 opposition players completely from that bit of play.

2956~~~
Yup, Rojo was doing same kind of commanding in the back-line, it's nice to have somebody on the pitch at last who's not scared of trying to dictate both on and off-ball play.

2957~~~
He needs a song to this tune. Fact.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMHp9a5FwrI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2958~~~
Good piece of vision. Intelligent player.

2959~~~
I said it in the match day yesterday, his passing and work rate reminds me of a young Roy Keane and feck me, how we've missed a player like that, must be going on 10 years. Seems an absolute character too.

2960~~~
The movement, look at all the players moving <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2961~~~
That 1 touch back heel pass to RVP around the 12th minute when Rooney rifled the ball to him is just ridiculous.

2962~~~
much more legs and covered space/defensive work from him.. yes we liked giggs in later stages that he could make final pass but that was it this guy has much more to our game:-) he is no doubt key player much more than anyone else..

2963~~~
1:28, 2:31, 3:22, 6:14 highlights for me..

2964~~~
A player with this type of awareness is invaluable.  Making runs for the sole purpose of displacing defenders to open avenues for your teammates.  Kinda of funny, it brings basketball to mind because you'll see this type of movement a lot in the NBA.  

I really hope he can stay fit.

2965~~~
I don't think it's any odd in football either. Perhaps it's how it should be done

2966~~~
future captain

2967~~~
It's refreshing to see what an actual midfielder does. That is all.

2968~~~
Munian is a month older than Tom Thorpe. I still think he'll be a top player. Lovely vision and so low to the ground. When Bilbao get a bit desperate they tend to shift him into the middle and he's just so tough to deal with for opposition DM's. 

As for Herrera, I think he's a brilliant fit as the right-sided of a middle 3/diamond and Di Maria will obviously be on the left. Blind and Carrick give us 2 good, but not great, options at DM, but we'll probably sell Fellaini and Cleverley this summer and buy a CM with the mobility to play the wide CM roles Herrera and Di Maria will be tasked with, I would think.

I also think Herrera as the 10 in the diamond in tougher games might be worth looking at, though we don't really have the CM to play in his stead on the right with Fletcher's reversion, Cleverley's regression, Fellaini being Fellaini and nobody else stepping up.

2969~~~
I think Rooney would do well as the LCM or RCM in that system.

2970~~~
I disagree. Think he lacks the defensive understanding and agility. Herrera will always be deeper than him.

2971~~~
Not sure if this has already been posted, but:

2972~~~
He's playing midfield now rather then as a number 10. I must say, I'm impressed at how natural he looks there, considering all the scare-mongering about him being too attacking for the position.

2973~~~
He's my favourite player already. Going head to head with Mata (and Dave...I must have a thing for Spanish men <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>) for the most likeable guy ever.

edit/I do not have a thing for Spanish men.

2974~~~
He does give the ball away with some over ambitious forward passes at times, but I think I can cop that considering he'll be creating just as much with them.

2975~~~
This is a very good point actually, there was a lot negativity about his signing saying he could no longer operate further back than #10, despite spending the majority of his career as a #6/#8. We can see #8 is clearly his favoured position and I think he settled any doubts in the QPR game.

2976~~~
Even when he played further forward last season he was an unorthodox number ten. He made a load of tackles/interceptions and didn't stay high up the pitch.

2977~~~
Wasn't it given as a foul at 6:14?

2978~~~
looks like it was, anyway its good aspect of his game his sliding tackles are great..

2979~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfBdkTr8WxA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Its funny, when Fellaini said he wanted to be like Keane I couldn't take it seriously. Yet I hear Herrera say she wants to be like Scholes and have no doubt he will go a decent way towards becoming that for us.

2980~~~
Surely we have the most friendliest squad in the world? Falcao, Herrera, Rojo, Blind, Rafael, De Gea, Mata & Chich are all come across as the nicest bunch of players!

2981~~~
He seems like such a great humble character and I just love the way he plays. Seems like a very intelligent young man as well, much like Mata. Fan favorite in the making right there.

2982~~~
So happy with our summer signings, they all seem to have very good heads on their shoulders and no one epitomises that more than Herrera.

2983~~~
He has a fantastic personality. He's a real student of the game too.

2984~~~
Ander comes over so well, smart and humble. He's been unfairly underrated by our clueless media but I am sure the team and LvG appreciate how good he is and just turned 25.

2985~~~
Depends whether you mean on or off-the-pitch. Ander, Rojo and Rafael are hardly angels on it...

2986~~~
Anyone else think he sounds a bit like Ole when he says 'club'?

2987~~~
That's ideal. Lets keep the friendly mushy stuff off the pitch.

2988~~~
Yeah, wouldn't disagree. No one wants a team that's too nice on the pitch.

2989~~~
Didn't Rojo bottle/beat up his neighbour? He's a nutter and I love him.

2990~~~
Even Herrera, he loves a tackle.

2991~~~
Ander is Herrera <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

But yeah, he definitely does. Likes a moan at the referee too, he's the type of player that's going to piss off other fans but one who'll be a fan favourite at his own club.

2992~~~
He will also do well at number 10 spot. I like him a lot, his intelligence and movement are very good. I think buying players from spanish/german teams who focus on technique will really help us. This will move us away from the slow zombie(but effective) football we played under fergie in his last season.

I hope we can see him in the 10 position in one of the games, His through balls look really good and i think he will link really well behined a front two.It might be difficult to see him in that position due to competition, but may be in the future at time of F.A. cup.

2993~~~
Despite him already having 1 goal and 2 assists thus far, the biggest issue he'd have with playing as the #10 is his lack of numbers. He really isn't much of a goal threat (despite taking a fantastic chance last game) and is far more of a pre-assist/build up passer than a final ball kind of player. Despite being a good #10, he's better as an #8 and we already have a great #10 in Mata.

2994~~~
I think for the big games, when Carrick is back, we will see him being played there to shore things up, with Carrick - Blind at the base and Di Maria floating. Defensively we will be solid and he could be used to shut out the opposing deep-lying  playmaker.

2995~~~
He's a crack, what a gentleman.

2996~~~
Yeah, he seems like a great lad.

Hopefully he'll become the worldclass CM you so badly need.

2997~~~
We already have one thanks to your team.  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2998~~~
It would be one of these games that would usualy worry me about a new signing, going away to Leicester, I just see it as one of those game that could potentially prove to catch a new arrival out but with Herrera, you just get the sense that whoever he is playing, wherever he is playing, you are going to get the same attitude and same output out which is a great attribute to have that not many do.

2999~~~
Herrera is already like a young Paul Scholes in one way, off the ball the both run around like little terriers snapping at the heels of anything that moves. Both small(ish) in stature but don't get bullied.

He won't be just as comfortable as Scholes on the ball and he won't quite have the passing range, but few in our lifetime ever will. I'll be delighted if he keeps going the way he's going, improving all the time.

3000~~~
I think it also helps that Athetic don't play the traditional Spanish slow build up, they run around like maniacs closing down at a frantic pace. I think that him being used to that kind of setup will make him slot in without much trouble.

3001~~~
similar story to Blind, wait for bigger games and judge after let's say 10 games or so. Promising signs so far and better than what we had last season, tha's for sure! If they go on to form a midfield partnership that dominates the Premier League is to be seen. Happy we have them both and to add Strootman will give us further depth and strength in January. 

I really have believe that with Herrera and Blind (as well as the rest of the squad) we have passed the lowpoint of the post Fergie era. The only way is up now and if it brings us a CL spot this season I'am happy for the beginning.

3002~~~
Herrera is notorious for performing in the big games, so that actually shows he doesn't suffer from lack of courage.

3003~~~
I think Herrera is six foot, he's deceptively tall.

3004~~~
If he can just add goals to his game he'll be a complete midfielder which is pretty rare these days. I think of he continues to play that box to box role and makes a few late runs we could well see him finding the net a little more often.

3005~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he's 5'9.

3006~~~
Where are you getting that from? I've seen a few articles mention him as 6"0, and wiki has him as 1.82m tall.

3007~~~
I thought he was 5ft 11

3008~~~
Nope, he's six foot.

3009~~~
There's no way he can be 6 foot, he looks about Rafael's height!

Edit: Google has everything from 5'9 - 6ft.

3010~~~
No, every single site has him down as 182m, just some sites are using the wrong maths and equating 182cm (which is 5.97 foot) as being 5"9 when it's actually a stroke off 6"0, ESNP and the Beeb both made this error.

He's 6"0

3011~~~
But he looks so deceivingly small! <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3012~~~
If only he'd had a medical at Bridgewater.

3013~~~
Then he's 5"10.

3014~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

Mate he's 5 foot, and 97.1% of a foot. He's about a centipedes arse off 6"0, and for all practical purposes he's 6"0, he's not 5"10.

3015~~~
Size doesn't matter. Or so I've been told. Many times.

3016~~~
Fair. Some website, first one on Google, reckons 5 feet and 11.6535 inches, to be exact.

3017~~~
He's 6'1" in football boots when standing on concrete.

3018~~~
Yeah. People are getting mixed up by equating .9 feet with the same amount of inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. So .9 feet is more or less 11 inches. At 182 cm Ander is a shade off 6 feet tall.

3019~~~
Talks like a leader. Wouldn't be surprised if he were captain in a few years.

3020~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://totalfootballmadness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ander-Herrera-81.png" src="http://totalfootballmadness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ander-Herrera-81.png"/> 

He would stand as tall as Fletcher if not for his pose in here.

3021~~~
Fletcher is sitting down.. really though, had no idea Herrera was that height!

3022~~~
fecking hell, this discussion is as stupid as Di Maria's cross/shot debate. Which was a cross by the way.

3023~~~
I love this guy so much, since last season when we failed to sign him, i felt very bad for him, it really felt like he wanted to move here, so i have followed his career ever since and i even signed him up for everytime i have played with in career mode i have played since, so i am delighted we have him. I really believe he and Blind will be our most important players along with Di Maria ofcourse.

3024~~~
Shot.

3025~~~
He has kind of suprised me by how good he has been so far (mostly based on pre season and QPR of course). I think he kind of fell under the radar to some extent due to not playing for Real or Barca. He seems just the type of CM we have been waiting for. Fantastic box to box and a real workhorse. Has impressed me so far

3026~~~
Touché

3027~~~
This. I said the same thing. All action, passionate, loves the club. And importantly, learns and appreciates the history of the club.

3028~~~
Agree. Like Mata, very classy on and off the pitch....

3029~~~
Nice goal, overall I think he's been pretty messy though. Not poor but quite a lot of misplaced passes.

3030~~~
Only RVP has a higher passing accuracy than him today of our midfielders/forwards, and even RVP just has 1% better.

3031~~~
That is Ander's playing style TBF. Not content with recycling possession, he always seeks to create chances. It's part of his appeal and the reason he lined up as a #10 last season.

But really this midfield is jizzworthy. We have the creative touch, pace, tenacity, distribution. Each one of them complements the other perfectly. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3032~~~
You're right that it's his style, but he's definitely not at his best today. That's all I'm saying.

3033~~~
I think he's put in another all action performance for us today. Highest amount of passes in the team, among the highest in accuracy of our midfielders and forwards, just one less successful dribble than Di Maria - tied with Falcao, good amount of tackles/interceptions and he has only lost the ball to the opponents once. 

He does it all a bit in the shadow of the flashy Di Maria, but if he can keep these levels up that is brilliant for us.

3034~~~
I thought he's been quite good and what we needed in the all-action kind of role but fair enough mate. That said doesn't every player have a cycle of ebbs and flows ? We must bear in mind that he's still acclimatizing to the league and one first team game removed from injury. Similar to Moreno and Manquillo for you lot. It takes time to find consistency.

3035~~~
Yeah. He still has to adjust to a position that he hasn't played regularly in for a while too.

Don't think there's any need to go overboard with any criticism, all I said was I don't think he's been at his best.

3036~~~
Ok. No harm done. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3037~~~
I thought he was excellent today. Let down by those behind him.

3038~~~
I thought he was absolutely fantastic today. By far our best player.

3039~~~
Agree on both counts.

3040~~~
Another good performance from Ander. Looks a class player.

3041~~~
Him and Rafa could do with some movement around them on the right side. They both seem to get isolated some times and trapped in the right corner with nobody else really there for support. Not so much of a problem on the left side because Di Maria is much more natural when he gets wide.

3042~~~
Love watching this guy play. I think he'll have a great career here...especially with Blind next to him, he can really do a lot. Shame about the result today, but thought he's everything we've lacked in recent years.

3043~~~
Totally agree, followed by Di Maria. I said it before but them two and Shaw will be top signings - the others I am yet to pass judgement but they all possess quality in abundance and character.. Shaw just needs to get fit but once he does, he is a player.

3044~~~
He's a wonderfully balanced player. His first touch is sublime. His technical ability is first class. He's got lovely close control and movement off the ball. 

His goal was pure class.

3045~~~
I thougt he was doing a really good job up until mid way through the second half when they started putting the pressure on. He always offers himself for the ball and plays good positive passes. Bit disappointed that when we did come under big pressure he kept booting it rather than try and pass it out. Still think it was an encouraging display.

I think though he needs to play more tucked in. With the a/m in Rooney/Mata playing it very much pushed up and Di Maria given a lot of license to roam forward, we need Herrera more tucked in. For some reason though we've not quite had the fullbacks bombing on and stretching the game meaning that Herrera has to pull out pretty wide at times. Leaves us far too open.

3046~~~
Him and rafa seem to have got a good understanding of each other quite quickly. He is very clam on the ball and when we get our quicker game going, Herrera is always involved. Great flick for the goal as well.

3047~~~
Thought he was class today. The ratings in the match day thread <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Asa team we were great for an hour but even then, Di maria and herrera were a class above. I have no idea why the general perception in the media is that he's a bit average. He's class and would walk into most starting 11's in the premier league, apart from city and Chelsea, but even then it's touch and go imo.

3048~~~
With him and Di Maria, we can finally get the goals from midfield as well. We just to be more stable defensively so we can make a solid run for the 4th spot.

3049~~~
I'm also so impressed with his positioning, can read the game so well and always seems free for the pass. I guess this is what it looks like to have a proper midfielder!

3050~~~
Its funny.. we finally have a good midfield and the rest of the team goes to shit. (Ok, Striker-wise Falcao was pretty good- but Rooney and RvP have been poor so far this season)

Di Maria- Blind- Herrera is looking very balanced, and top quality so far. Di Maria was more of a threat and his pace is incredibly important to this team, but Herrera was MotM for me.

3051~~~
Maybe that part of the problem, some of our players have forgotten what it is like to actually have a midfield.

3052~~~
Thought he played well today, next to Di Maria by far our best player. Chips in the goals now and always avaialble for a pass. Got lost after the penalty incident, like the whole team though. Panicked 2 or 3 times in the box where he kicked the ball blind forward, still better than losing the ball in defence i guess. He seems to be always one of our best performers this season. He can still improve massively once the team and our defence improve and settle.

3053~~~
Fantastic addition

3054~~~
How refreshing to see a midfielder score a goal, move the ball forward, press and tackle like mad. Another match where you can hardly say a bad thing about him.

3055~~~
In fairness he panicked like hell on 2-3 and 3-3 - cleared the ball left, right and centre with no composure at all.

3056~~~
I thought he played well. Lost his composure at the end but he was surrounded by teammates losing their shit and he's only new/young. Will be a great signing IMO.

3057~~~
I'd actually watch those goals again to check if you're right, but since I can't be forced to watch this shambles again, I'll have to take your word for it.

Atleast he scores goals.

3058~~~
I think that penalty incident, when it all went pear shaped, was LVG's window of opportunity to stem the tide. A well timed substitution to bring in midfield reinforcement would have steadied the ship, then. Even Fletcher (don't know if he was on the bench) would have done, bring him on and push Ander forward then knock it about.
Thought Herrera, like the whole team, played well until that moment.

3059~~~
I think Fletch might have calmed things down. I like Ander playing forward, he is real threat. That would have give Leicester something to think about.

3060~~~
For everything he adds, I'll take his shaky moments all day long. But it can't be easy playing in front of defenders who don't seem to communicate and have the positional sense of Fred.

3061~~~
He is great, only thing that he is missing now is that he should know when to slow things down at times, but I am sure that will come. Great goal btw.

3062~~~
I think that's our major problem, our established players rather than leading expect to be carried by the likes of Ander, Di Maria and Blind just as they have been carried by Rooney, Van Persie and Carrick over the years. How do Smalling, Rafael and De Gea not only allow but, get to become active participants in, the meltdown. These players have seen it all, they should not behave like novices, there are veterans of two successful league campaigns ffs and lost the league in the most horrendous of fashions in 2012, that's experience, that's PL proven.
Seriously it was obvious that new players would need to settle in but is it too much to ask for those we've always had to calm the feck down?

3063~~~
I quite like his ambition to get ahead of Rooney but there's a time and a place for that. Maybe he can get away with it more at home but in away games he needs to have some discipline. Blind is not solid enough to be left to hold on his own.

3064~~~
He did lose composure at the end, but so did everyone else. Thought he was pretty good.

3065~~~
he was great until we capitulated and he went missing big time in the last portion of the game.

3066~~~
I thought he was pretty poor to be honest.

3067~~~
Badly worded - he didn't panic when conceding the goals themselves, but when the score was 2-3 and 3-3, we needed someone to take the sting out of the game, calm down, get the ball down on the ground and our passing game going. Instead he hoofed and panicked for about 10 minutes. That's what I meant.

3068~~~
I was disappointed to be honest. Didn't take control of the midfield and started panicking when they equalised.

3069~~~
He's quality. 2 goals in 2 games. Whens a midfielder last done that for us. People have to remember nothing prepares you for the PL. Its not the hardest league in the world for nothing and games like that just demonstrate the intensity of its football. He'll learn from that. The only thing that worries me about him and Blind is I think they are a little lightweight and physically can get overrun at the moment.

3070~~~
He rushed clearances, not passes in midfield. Someone should have been giving him a shout that he has time.

There was a pass/flick he played to Rooney before Rooney passed to Falcao, beautiful stuff.

3071~~~

3072~~~
Probably a nothing story. 

I really like Herrera so far. Room to improve but he has a positive attitude and always plays with his head up and makes himself available.

He is what Cleverley should of been.

3073~~~
I agree...

3074~~~
He was one of the players who visibly shat his pants and lost it after their third goal on Sunday.

3075~~~
Yep, which was disappointing, because he was very good prior to that.

3076~~~
I think it was him that booted the ball as hard as he could from our penalty box on Sunday when there was 3 or 4 players he could have passed it to. However, I think he's been very good so far.

3077~~~
A couple of punts shouldnt distract us from his overall performance. I thought he was our best player besides DM. Glad to see him get a couple of goals as its always been a weakness in his game, we havent had someone like him making these late runs from midfield since Keane.

3078~~~
I think people may be acting a bit harsh towards Herrera, I thought he had a good game, To the people who are wanting him to slow down the play, I think he will do this once he adjusts to the league, Coming to England will be a big culture shock playing wise to him and it will take a while for him to find his feet, He will get there though. In fact i'd be surprised if he isn't eventually called up to the Spain NT

3079~~~
I think the analysis of his performance has been fair. Others get over the top criticism I think, while a few probably get off a bit easily. Herrera was good until they got momentum, then he lost his head for a little bit. Hopefully he learns from it though, then it won't be an issue next time.

3080~~~
During the last international break Del Bosque mentioned Herrera was very close to making the squad before he got injured. He will eventually be a full Spain international however I would not expect him to become the kind of player that slows down the game. Its not his style.

Herrera's game is about getting forward and looking for through balls. He's direct, provides running, plays touch football nicely, can be a goal threat and likes a tackle. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2130019/Manchester-City-United-want-Ander-Herrera-Athletic-Bilbao.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">There's a reason he was compared to Steven Gerrard in the past</a>. Herrera will be a good, perhaps great, player for us. However, I wouldn't expect him to turn into Xavi or Pirlo.

3081~~~
I.dont know why new players come in for such criticism.  It takes a whole to  adapt to the EPL.  Look at Evra, Vidic  and Stam. Stam

3082~~~
He's been very impressive so far. Like Di Maria, he's a real natural in a midfield diamond.

3083~~~
Yeah, I have no issues with Ander and think he has been good thus far. It takes time to gel. Whilst the #8 is indeed his preferred position, we do have to remember he was playing #10 all of last season, it's difficult to reaccustom yourself to new positions, even if it's one you've held before.

3084~~~
Absolutely. One of the reasons that he was sometimes criticised in Spain was that he's not got that same metronome running in his head that Xavi/Busquets etc possess. He's not really the player you look to, to slow a game down - he's the one you might look to, to keep the pressure up. It's no coincidence that some of his best performances have come in backs-to-the-wall scraps for Athletic against teams like Barcelona.

Valverde played him a #10 (not a Ozil 10, the other kind) using those instincts. He's also played in a more defensive way under Bielsa curtailing them! I think he's actually ideally suited to the PL and us, he just needs time to understand his role and his teammates.

3085~~~
Yeah, I've been fairly pleased with him so far. He played well against QPR and given some more time to settle into the team and his position, he'll hopefully keep improving for us and keep getting better. Hopefully...

3086~~~
He's not gonna get noticed with all the superstardom up front but he's bloody brilliant.

3087~~~
I worry he will burn himself out, he never stops running.

3088~~~
Our best player in this start of teh season.

3089~~~
He's superb. We've got a gem on our hands.

3090~~~
Simply immense. That second goal is thanks to him. Amount of work by him is fantastic, all the movement he makes on the pitch off bal is calculated to create space and positions for his team mates.

3091~~~
Class player. So easy on the eye.

3092~~~
Best player on the pitch in the first half, true box to box CM, has linked well with Rafael and covered him, plus I think he's just been a bit calmer in possession than he was last week, looking to control the game more.

3093~~~
Love his tackles

3094~~~
again best player on the pitch. Always available, defensively tackling, linking up with the forwards and Rafael.

3095~~~
I love him. Spanish Cleverley my arse.

3096~~~
I love being right about a player, and Herrera's performances are justifying my anger at our failure to sign him last summer. Thank God we managed to get Herrera in this summer. He's adding so much to our midfield right now. A large part of why our diamond can work is because of the ground Herrera covers and the tackles he makes, his ball use aint bad either!

3097~~~
Excellent.

Been working so so hard.

3098~~~
Brilliant on the ball and puts in excellent tackles. All rounder!

3099~~~
No nonsense display so far, he and Rafael linking has been a huge plus for the right hand side. MOTH ?

3100~~~
Brilliant player. He truly is box to box.

What a tackle to make the second goal too. It was basically him winning the ball back that got us into that goalscoring position.

3101~~~
Exactly what we need(ed). He has btw always averaged around 2.5 to 4.0 tackles per game, no matter if he played deeper in midfield or as a 10. I wouldn't actually be surprised if NONE of our players in the last few years has acchieved to match his tackling stats. Brilliant allround player.

3102~~~
Oh ffs

3103~~~
No!!!!

3104~~~
What a surprise

3105~~~
Didn't see what happened to him?

3106~~~
Please be okay for the love of god PLEASE

3107~~~
Please don't be out for long!! He's brilliant.

3108~~~
Out of all our new players, I love this guy the most! Really hope it is not a bad injury. I said in matchday thread, him and rafael link up together so well already. They compliment each other well and both play such quick football. Great game today.

3109~~~
I really hope he is ok. He was fantastic today. Dare I say it, he looked like a captain out there.

3110~~~
Fingers crossed because I think we will struggle big time without him.

3111~~~
what happened? didnt see how he got injured....

3112~~~
He was MOTM for me, I just hope it's a knock as opposed to anything serious, we can't afford to lose him.

3113~~~
Passes, heads, tackles, scores, fecking great to have a proper midfielder. Also last two game he has tried to slow the game down after events go against us, really like the cut of his jib and I hope he's not too injured.

3114~~~
Seems that I've posted in a wrong Herrera thread previously, wasn't aware we've got two of those.  Simply immense today. That second goal is thanks to him. Amount of work by him is fantastic, all the movement he makes on the pitch off bal is calculated to create space and positions for his team mates.

3115~~~
I hope he's alright and fit for next weekend. He's been excellent whenever he's played.

3116~~~
He was bloody good today. Looks right at home in the system. Hope the injury is nothing serious. If it is, hopefully Fellaini's back to replace him rather than Fletcher.

3117~~~
Looking a class player at the moment. So many of our best moves seem to originate with Herrera winning possession high up the pitch.

3118~~~
Enjoy seeing him play, hope he shakes off that knock.

3119~~~
Please stay fit, we really need him, hope it's nothing serious.

3120~~~
What happened to him today? Does it look a serious injury? Hope to God not as he's been looking class!

3121~~~
He's great. Think it looked like a back injury, hopefully he's okay, we'll need him next weekend.

3122~~~
Dearly hope that injury is nothing serious. I hate to see players holding their backs, because back injuries can be real feckers.

3123~~~
Any news on his injury?

3124~~~
Everything you could possibly want in a Man Utd midfielder - fearless, attacking and quality passing and movement. Love watching him play!

3125~~~
Could we have this thread merged with the 7x pages one please? <a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> <a class="username" data-user="28685, @Cina" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28685/">@Cina</a>

3126~~~
Tough role he plays but does it to great effect. Love the little flicks that always seem to come off.

3127~~~
That's for Damien, us lowly mods can't merge threads.

3128~~~
Very tempting.

But I don't want to lower the tone. The 's' will live to be dropped another day.

3129~~~
As we saw against Swansea in our first game, neither Fletch or Fellaini are adequate replacements for Herrera.

We cannot go into the run of fixture we have with the clubs that finished above us last year without Ander.

3130~~~
He's exactly the kind of midfielder we've been missing for years.

Proper box to box player.

Ofcourse he's gone and got himself injured which is par for the course with us.

3131~~~
It didnt look that serious - any word post match?

3132~~~
Obviously whoever comes in if he is injured will make us a weaker outfit, but we have to find the best compromise. Possibly Carrick anchoring and Blind on the side.

3133~~~
Yes you can you lazy shit

3134~~~
Best Herrera game so far. He's only new signing who keeps playing better. Second best player today (behind Rafael) by very small margin.

3135~~~
Any news on his injury?

3136~~~
Great performance. Hope he isn't injured. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3137~~~
That first half was his best for us, even better than QPR for me. Really tidy player but also knows how to tackle

3138~~~
He really is a cracking player. We have no decent alternative in the squad, so hopefully it's just a knock.

3139~~~
Man of the match for me.

3140~~~
Smashing little player. Worth every penny.

3141~~~
I didnt see him come off..did it look bad?

3142~~~
Took a bit of time walking off with a hand clutching his lower back. Hopefully it was just a bit of time-wasting but a probable back injury is never good.

3143~~~
Hopefully just a strain. Dunno what our midfield would look like without Rooney and Herrera v Everton. Mata, Fletcher, ADM and Blind most likely

3144~~~
Good performance from him. Hopefully not a serious injury.

3145~~~

3146~~~
Not comforting that he doesn't seem to know what the problem is with his back. Was hoping for 'just a precaution, I'll be ready week'.

3147~~~
Please Ander don't be injured. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3148~~~
God how I hope he is ok

3149~~~
I love this guy! We were really missing a player like him. With him and Di Maria we've basically gone from a crap midfield to one of the best in the league.

3150~~~
I hope the injury is not serious and that he can be back for the game against Everton.

3151~~~
Please don't let the back injury be time out of the team unless Carrick is able to step up. Fletcher is not capable of performing in his absence on recent displays.

Thought he was good today. Positive play, great movement and energy were key components of our midfield play, certainly in the first half and a lot of these came directly from him.

3152~~~
I hope he can reach Joe Allen's level.

3153~~~
I get the feeling that one of these days he's going to get himself sent off. Love his tackles but it's all on the edge

3154~~~
Eh, he's a central midfielder, so that's pretty much nailed on.

3155~~~
He will most probably be undergoing some scan or tests to know the extent of the injury. I don't see any point in him declaring on his own something about it without confirmation from medical team.

3156~~~
Hope he will wake up tommorow with no pain in the back <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> He is class.

3157~~~
Wasn't he completely injury free at Bilbao? Bit worrying that he's already picked up 2 injuries for us.

3158~~~
Delighted at how he's started the season. Sounds a top guy from the interviews too.

3159~~~
Very good today if i haven't said it already.

Need him fit next week thoough as we don't really have a backup to him right now.

3160~~~
Things like that don't matter at United, we could buy Superman and he would get injured in the first week. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3161~~~
I'm a big fan of him and actually he might be a candidate for captain in the future. Early days but not many other options I guess.

3162~~~
If he is injured and out for next week I hope LVG stays true to form and throws in Pearson......who am I kidding ? Fletcher it will be and I don't hold much hope for a Fletcher- Blind midfield combo, Everton will press them mercilessly and we will be overrun as a result. We should maybe play one less forward for this.

3163~~~
i think he missed 13 games in his time at Bilbao, but 0 last year because of injury.

3164~~~
He's an absolute monster. Absolutly love the little fella.

3165~~~
our most consistent and best player over the season so far including pre season. Never had a really bad game in a United shirt thus far, actually most of his performances were excellent. Hope he keeps it up and isnt injured for the next game.

3166~~~
He's been absolute quality for us so far. The type of player we've needed for years. 

Hope he's OK and is ready to go against Everton.

3167~~~
For me our best signing we made this summer. Di Maria has a higher top level, but Herrera is just so consistent and keeps everything moving and works hard. Great player.

3168~~~
Already become a vital cog in our team. I followed him religiously, watching pretty much all of his games for Athletic Club last season and he's adapted really well here. Maybe better than I imagined. Hope his back injury is nothing serious.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3169~~~
Is there any stats on how much ground he covered today? Was all over the pitch and his passing really is top notch, especially his quick feet. Great game today!

3170~~~
He needs a chant.

3171~~~
His short passing is erratic at times, almost as if he's trying too hard to make things happen but he is the first name on the team sheet for me. He's like the 08-11 Fletcher already.

3172~~~
He's shown what an absolute beast he is. Its always a struggle for players outside the very top teams in spain to truely shine, understandably so with the quality midfielders barca have had in recently memory. However hes clearly displayed he is good enough to have represented  Spain at the WC this year and that he should be recognised as one of the top CMs around right now, £30mil is starting to look a bit of a bargain.

3173~~~
He got one moments after he came off injured. Just 'Ander Herrera, clap clap clap clap clap, Ander Herrera' repeated over and over. Same as the David de Gea one.

3174~~~
Love this lad!

3175~~~
When he's given the more defensive role in CM, you dont tend to notice him, and thats not a bad thing, he does all the nitty gritty work and progresses the play excellently. given the choice, i would have taken fabregas, but Herrera is going to be a mainstay for us for years.

3176~~~
if he is out of evertons game I don't think why we shouldn't give chance to Pereira. He could play deeper and could help Blind to shield the defense not that he could be any defensive capacity but he is a good playmaker so we could keep possession but yeah it will be sad to say that "sadly" it will be Fletcher and we will be outran. But who know maybe Ander recovers quickly:-) Key player no1, with Rafael

3177~~~
He's only 5 foot 9 but he has the heart of a relevated. He's gonna be great.

3178~~~
Any news on the injury?

We're absolutely screwed if any of Blind/Herrera/Di Maria get injured, as its back to Fletcher and Anderson.

3179~~~
I see what you did there.

3180~~~
Maybe we can go back to 3-5-2 vs Everton or just play Pereira if he's out ?

Anderson is not even making the bench tbf and Fletcher and Blind might become too safe in this and we lose energy a bit too. Though it might be possible in a 4-3-3 more.

3181~~~
We dont need to switch to 3-5-2. This new formation is working just fine. Mata is going to replace Rooney and either Fletcher or Perreira will replace Herrera if he is injured.

3182~~~
Tackling machine at times. Great hunger to win the ball back. Hopefully is fit for next week.

3183~~~
I thought he was terrific. A midfielder who can pass, tackle and run? I'd forgotten such a thing existed.

3184~~~
The de Boer's were making these statements in July. Seems the world is just catching up...

3185~~~
Been very impressed so far. Has it all. Ultra consistent. Cant wait to see how he fairs against the big guns. Cant see a weakness in his game.

3186~~~
Dunno if at home vs Everton qualifies but won't be surprised if we go 3-5-2 in big games this season to play more on the counter like the dutch. (Though first need 3 defenders fit as well in their 3 suited roles.)

Don't think Fletch has the legs for that role which is crucial vs Everton while Pereira is completely untested at this level or in that role in such a game as the Everton midfield will work hard and press a lot.

If Fletcher plays we'll have to go 4-3-3 probably with 2 sitters and front 4 having more freedom. 

For the role Herrera is playing actually Valencia might be a serviceable backup too in a Everton sort of game. Plays that sort of role for Ecuador as well and did so last season few times like Sociedad away.

3187~~~
Shouldn't be long before he get a Spain call-up.

Hard to understand how he's not been called before now, Spain's strength in depth is just <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3188~~~
he was close last month, but he injured himself.

3189~~~
He has been great so far, a real all rounder.

3190~~~
Big compliments from the de Boer's. I am still praying it was just an impact injury and he'll be fine by next Sunday.

3191~~~
Any real news on his injury?

3192~~~
How long is he out for? He's vital to our team already.

Also, the De Boer's actually share a twitter account? How cute.

3193~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> what? This would be a huge blow.

3194~~~
Remember he got subbed off holding his back? He tweeted hopefully his back is feeling better soon. He'd be a huge miss, second to di maria for our most important outfield players IMO because of the lack of replacements of his quality. 

If he is out, it'd likely only be for the Everton game as its the international break so it wouldn't be a disaster, I'm just worried that we'll struggle for results without either Herrera or di maria in the team.

3195~~~
Really, really impressive player. Love the fact that our midfield has finally got a goalscoring threat with him lurking around. Love his work rate and movement. Cracking signing.

3196~~~
Fantastic energy and so clever. Sloppy on the ball at times, but that's the sort of thing players tend to improve on as they get older. 

Gives us a lot of flexibility, too. He can play as the more attacking of the 2 CM's in a traditional 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1, as the 10 in the diamond (and if we had a decent midfielder to play the RCM role he's been playing, I suspect against a really strong team, he'd be first choice as a 10 for us right now, or in big games if we sign Strootman to play RCM).

3197~~~
Anyone reminded of Deco when seeing him play? What a wonderful player.

3198~~~
Herrera is unstoppable once he gets going and people that watch the spanish league know this. He runs more than anyone, he chases every ball, he tackles more than anyone and that's his game, stamina and well-rounded ability. He's just everywhere.

3199~~~
At Bilbao he could be described as a big game player. I watched him a lot last season and his best games were Madrid and Barcelona away. That sort of intensity really brought out the best in him and he's one who wants to stand up and be counted, not shy away and avoid responsibility. I love him. 

Their strength in depth is really good but they are also in a period of needing to phase out some of the older players and I think Herrera is ideal to come in.

3200~~~
Any word on his injury?

3201~~~
Quickly becoming one of my favourite players. Has it all. He has ability and he adds a great work rate to that. Never stops, always covering, always running, he is quite relentless. And how refreshing to have a CM who can pick a pass and actually score a goal my god.

3202~~~
How is Herrera doing? Hope he is ok for next week.

3203~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIr6UjUTPxg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3204~~~
What a great performance. If he needs someone to rub his back, I'm available.

3205~~~
I like the sound of that.

3206~~~
Stunning performance. I really think he's the best midfielder we could have brought.. really does tick all the boxes we needed.

3207~~~
Has someone seen what happened? Is it just me or did the ref catch him unintentionally with the elbow/arm?

3208~~~
His movement is just a joy to watch. He gives the team good options going forward, often times finding himself close to the six-yard box. It's not flashy by any means but it's very effective.

Look at sequence where he won the ball resulting in RVP's goal - he pushed forward and put the WH player under pressure as fast as he could. None of our midfielders the past (eight?) years would, or could, have done that. They would have fallen back and relied on the fullback to get the ball back. I agree it's a bit risky but when you are that confident in yourself then damn it, go for it!

Love it.

3209~~~
His performances are tireless. He's constantly on the move. As soon as he releases the ball you can see he's already thinking of where he needs to be to receive the ball back / provide a passing option. Sounds basic but it's f*cking fantastic when you've been watching a static midfield for years. He's a real team player as well. In a age where everyone seems to want to be a number ten with little to no defensive responsibility, Ander wants to get stuck in and get his shorts dirty. He's a gem, and I genuinely think Spain will be better off with him in their midfield as well next to Busquets.

3210~~~
I was reading the report in the Sunday Mirror and Simon Mullock gave him a 6 rating. Some got lower than that. How could he give him 6, that's bang average, he was everywhere, the heartbeat of the team. The ratings were though the first half of the game never happened. They so wanted to put the boot into Rooney, LvG and United it completely clouded their judgement.

3211~~~
Best player on the pitch after Rafa.

3212~~~
Herrera's terrific, he's a very tidy player and I love how tenacious and dynamic he is. He seems like the type who could become a real leader as well, something this side is currently really lacking. I wouldn't take any note of the ratings, journalists have admitted that they're just a last minute thought and the numbers are just plucked out of their arses.

3213~~~
What exactly happened to him? There was a break in play and suddenly shots of him holding his back and walking off gingerly to be sub

3214~~~
Wasn't there a bad tackle went in on him and he was left in a heap on the ground?

3215~~~
The co-commentator on the NBC stream I had (before it disconnected in the 2nd half and I had to go to a foreign one) was very complimentary of Herrera. And Rafael too. I find the latter more surprising actually, as Rafael always seems to be unfairly criticised. Plenty still seem to think he can't defend.

Still, reading a few reports and mixed forums this morning, and plenty reckon Herrera is a dud. I don't really know what they're expecting of a box to box midfielder. I also don't know how people aren't noticing how awful we look when he doesn't play.

3216~~~
Early shout for our player of the season.

3217~~~
I reckon that he'll be fine for the next game. The injury looked like more than a twinge than anything else. He wasn't in any kind of serious pain.

3218~~~
He is the sort of player who teammates appreciate.

3219~~~
Might also have been buying time for us.  Me being hopeful, mind.

Very reliant on this guy to remain fit and in good form for the season (and Blind for that matter). I thought he was the second best player on the pitch yesterday after Rafael.

3221~~~
Lots of those opinions seem to be based on the stupid logic of "well he can't be any good since he isn't playing for Spain"
Player's player maybe. I love players like Ander and Rafa but I reckon one of our attackers will get the fans vote this season.

3222~~~
Definitely. Or possibly "I'd not heard of him before United bought him".

3223~~~
They will all know about him soon.

3224~~~
Once Carrick, Fellaini come back we'll have few more options to rotate. A second choice midfield trio of Fellaini-Fletcher-Carrick is not too bad.

3225~~~
It's terrible <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Di Maria - Blind - Herrera = Pace, mobility, penetration, energy, technical and creative. Plenty of goals and assists.

Fellaini - Fletcher - Carrick = Sluggish, no penetration, only Carrick has any technical skill or passing range and very little creativity. Few goals or assists.

3226~~~
We'll hardly play the second set together! 

A combination of our tow new midfielders and one old one is miles better than our midfield from last year(and the year before).

3227~~~
Getting worried now that we haven't heard anything <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3228~~~
It might be Monday before it is scanned. Ander won't say anything else in case he gives us false hope. I have had back pains, that next day have disappeared, but at the time I could hardly walk.

3229~~~
Back injuries can be a complete nightmare. I didn't play football for about 2 years in my teens because of back problems.

Really hoping there's nothing in this.

3230~~~
Maybe there is nothing to announce.

3231~~~
I shudder to think of him being out; he's become quite integral to the way we are playing (or, at times, <i>trying </i>to play).  Fletch can do some of the dirty work he does, but everything going forward would be going down the left in Di Maria which would be much easier to defend against.

3232~~~
He's a great little player, could be vital this season. Hopefully he isn't injured.

3233~~~
He's just brilliant. The way he plays the ball into space, is capable of the surprising pass and plays at such a quick pace is brilliant to see. Compare that to Rooney who needs to have 3-4 touches every time and sometimes slows us down

3234~~~
I wasn't sure if it was the Valencia tackle that did it. Watched the game again and Ander is running after the tackle, but you can see him holding the bottom of his back now and again. When the tackle came in he twisted when he went down.

Still none the wiser if he got another kick after that. Saw him go down again. He might have just wrenched his back. Which is bloody painful. I hope it isn't something longterm. At least we have the facilities to treat it properly. I hope we have.

3235~~~
He's everything we've been missing of late, and although he might not get all the plaudits, he's so important to how Van Gaal wants to play.

3236~~~
I didn't notice any restrictions in his movement during the game, so I'm hoping he just got a knock or knee in the back when he was brought down just before he went off, and it's something that is sore for a day or two and then fine after that.

I can only echo what everyone else has said about him, cracking little player. Makes a massive difference to us already.

3237~~~
Was watching Cleverley for Villa today. He is the same age as Herrera, to within 2 days. There is no comparison really. Herrera does so much more during a game.

3238~~~
I didn't realise they were that close in age. Tom really hasn't made any progress when you compare the two.

3239~~~
This post just starts a bit pessimistic and then ends leaving me sad. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3240~~~
Sorry. The fact he was walking reasonably freely is something. It might just be a twinge. Maybe he is a typical man and making more of it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3241~~~
On his facebook:

3242~~~
Damn it. He already feels essential to the team. Hope it's nothing serious.

3243~~~
He was my man of the match. He was the engine room and was involved in everything positive we did. If he can stay fit and keep this going then he's going to become an excellent CM.

3244~~~
Hopefully will be back after the international break.

3245~~~
Bloody hope he is available this weekend.

3246~~~
How long does he have to be in the UK before he spells "massage" properly?

3247~~~
Having him and di Maria makes playing the diamond possible. Don't see anyone else in the team who is capable of filling in for him in that right sided midfield position. I can't see us employing this system if he is out of the Everton game.

3248~~~
Well obviously, but it doesn't sound like it.

3249~~~
I hope he does, we really do need him playing at this moment in time.

3250~~~
And for the first time this season, we have now moved into second place for injuries.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php</a>

Arsenal have taken the lead.

Bad news is Herrera seems likely to be out this weekend. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3251~~~
Does anyone know what is actually wrong with his back? They can be pretty troublesome injuries and out for a while.

3252~~~
He's gonna be a huge loss if he's out against Everton. Probably the player that it's the hardest to replace in our squad.

3253~~~
If LVG continues in this vein of replacing first team members with like for like replacements from the junior ranks, Andreas Pereira is as close as you can get to Herrera. I'd say putting in Mcnair at centre-back was a greater risk against such a physical side as the hammers.. this lad would be able to handle himself in my opinion.

3254~~~
I don't think Pereira is anything like Ander.

3255~~~
Missing a player like him for so long has lead me to appreciate certain things about his game that I'm sure many other fans would see as rudimentary. Several occasions against West Ham, he received the ball, had a knowledge before hand of where his teammates were, turned and passed the ball progressively forwards. 

In each of those occasions the ball that Carrick, Cleverley, Fletcher, Fellaini etc would play would have been straight back to our central defenders inviting pressure onto them, probably resulting in them lumping it forward to the opposition defence. It's just such a hugely positive difference that you wouldn't notice without being subjected to mediocrity for so long.

3256~~~
He is highly technical, lots of energy.. can put his foot in, playmake with short passes and longer ones.. runs with the ball. I disagree.

3257~~~
Also the system, will be a big loss.

Think he might put Blind and Fletcher as a midfield 2.

3258~~~
This is a bit depressing no? We finally look good in cm and then have to revert back to Fletcher.

3259~~~
Doesn't it just say no return date because there has been no update either way? He could still play this weekend

3260~~~
If he misses out it'll be to di Maria and only then he'll shade it but I really think Herrera will be our player of the season. To think this guy is only going to get better is fantastic for us. He's the player we desperately needed last season.

3261~~~
Usually when they do that it means at least a few weeks. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3262~~~
I think it'll be a week. Small niggle which rest and proper treatment can solve.

3263~~~
watching the highlight replay from saturday, the 2:0 really is made by herrera. His tackle initiated the situation. I like players who press opponents in their half and win the ball as early as possible. A goal we never ever would have scored under sit back Moyes!

3264~~~
Out of all of our current midfielders, Pereira is the most similar in play style. Ander is superior defensively though.

3265~~~
Pearson into DM, blind to fill in for Ander? Or 2 dm's with ADM in a free role ahead of them?

3266~~~
That'd be horrendous. We need him back for the next game.

3267~~~
"Herrera felt better than expected on Saturday evening re injury in West Ham game, may find out today prognosis"
Jackson tweeted this, hopefully he's fit for this weekend.

3268~~~
Oh please God be fit.

3269~~~
Think Van Gaal would just slot in Januzaz right into that role. I hope not because we're already slightly weaker defensively in the middle with Rooney's absence and Mata playing.

3270~~~
If he's got a slight problem with his back, I'd rather rest him for a bit and make sure we have him back for Chelsea. 

In the meantime, I'd give the opportunity to Fellaini to slot into the box to box role, with Blind or Carrick (if he's back) holding, and Di Maria playing left centre midfield (LCM). 

Herrera be a massive miss, though. He's the engine in midfield we've been missing for so long.

3271~~~
Jamie Jackson tweeted that Herrera's back was better the night of the West Ham game, so I don't think it's a big problem. He probably just jarred it slightly, i've done similar and then been fine later the same day.

3272~~~
Without Herrera we're absolutely screwed. Our back up options (Fellaini, Anderson, Fletcher) are just woeful.

3273~~~
The everton challenge will be a lot harder without him. The standard drop is huge if he's out. If he is, lets hope Fletcher can raise his game.

3274~~~
It's an area that still needs a fair bit of improvement, isn't it? If we're to stick with the diamond we need another two very specific midfielders. They have to be dynamic, otherwise the formation falls to pieces without either one of Herrera or Di Maria. Pereira, I like. I think he is a good fit going forward. I don't mind Fletcher as a squad man, but another two midfielders to cover these spots should be a priority over the next twelve months.

3275~~~
We really need another box-to-box midfielder in January. We're in big trouble when either him or Di Maria are out. We've got plenty of players who can fill in at DM like Blind, Carrick and Fletcher all to a fairly acceptable level. But there's nobody there for those two box-to-box roles without a massive drop in quality.

3276~~~
Strootman would be a good signing, I think. I think a specialist defensive midfielder would be a good signing, too.

3277~~~
Carrick may be back.

3278~~~
Absolutely. I was saying in another thread a few weeks ago that our first choice midfield is finally good, but the lack of depth is worrying. Personally I think Strootman is nailed on, probably in the Summer though, and then one other.

He can't play the Herrera role though, he just doesn't have the legs anymore.

3279~~~
Even when he had the legs, he could only dream of Herrera's box to box skills. It's really refreshing to see a competent midfielder playing for us, it really is.

Some painkiller will do for Everton hopefully.

3280~~~
Obviously we would have to tweak the midfield, but with quality players we can cope. For example play with a double pivot, Blind-Carrick in a 4-2-3-1 or play Blind higher and Carrick infront of the back 4.

3281~~~
We really need this guy to be fit. He has become my favourite United player and my pick for our future captain<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>
Him being out worries me more than anyone else in the team...

3282~~~
Why would some website have any idea regarding injuries at all clubs? All they know is what's being reported and what the club says. And there's nothing about Herrera.

3283~~~
The problem is that none of the other options in the first team squad has the legs to properly slot into the role Herrera (and Di Maria for that matter) is currently playing in. It requires a dynamic player who has the capability of moving around a lot, not just up and down the pitch, but also out wide to create space in the middle as well as support the full back.

Especially the last part is absolutely pivotal for the current system. Swapping Herrera for another, less mobile midfielder, will mean that the middle becomes more congested and the full back is more isolated. Of course, it might also make us more compact, so I could possibly see us going for an option like that against the top teams, but our attacking play will suffer.

3284~~~
Officially worried now.

3285~~~
I'm not. He has until Sunday to recover, if he had really done something terrible to his back he wouldn't have walked off so comfortably.

3286~~~
Plus after the Everton game there is a small break. Let's hope he's back as he's absolutely crucial to our midfield

3287~~~
Wonder if he'll get called up into the Spain squad? He's started the season well.

3288~~~
Meh it's Jaime Jackson... Any other more reliable journo reporting this?

3289~~~
the luck we have for a while I wouldn't be surprised if he is out for 2 years like Gündogan. Would just be what you expect after Moyes and being pranked by cnut Cakir and Clattenburg recently. 

Manchester United and a proper midfield is just not ment to be

<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3290~~~
Even if it's not a serious problem LVG is unlikely to start him v Everton as he is so cautious about injuries/fitness

3291~~~

3295~~~
What does the tweet say?

3296~~~
FFS! We never seem to catch a break with injuries

3297~~~

3298~~~
feck off. How long is that our for then, a month? We play Chelsea 1 month from now, we really need him back for that.

3299~~~
terrific

3300~~~
feck.

How long do you miss with a fractured rib?

3301~~~
Just fantastic. There goes our midfield.

3302~~~
For feck's sake!

3303~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> WEEKS?

3304~~~
What was his injury record at Bilbao? That's his second injury in 6 games.

3305~~~
We've got no luck.
It just gets worse and worse.

3306~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
feck sake.

3307~~~
Spotless record there I think. Genuinely don't remember him being injured at all for Athletic Club.

3308~~~
So he'll miss Everton and Chelsea, and maybe even City. Smashing stuff.

3309~~~
Pretty sure he hardly ever got injured. A rib injury is just one of those things you can't account for or predict though. 
Hopefully he's not out for too long.

3310~~~
I will take a fractured rib over an injured back any day of the week. These heal quick and with no long lasting results.

3311~~~
Id prefer option C. No injury at all

3312~~~
Huh? Ribs are like 2 weeks max as long as he is getting the proper resting.

3313~~~
well, i guess that's the one good thing about only having 3 ######## matches between now and november.

3314~~~
feck off

3315~~~
He will play vs chelsea.

I fractured rib is annoying but you can play through it and i am speaking from experience.

3316~~~
I think we all would, but people were worried about it being his back when he fell. My point is you have only TWO options, which do you prefer?

3317~~~
Oh brilliant.

Well thats us f*cked for the Everton game.

3318~~~
If we are just monitoring it there's a chance he could play vs Everton??

3319~~~
Thank goodness for another seemingly pointless international break.

3320~~~
what???

3321~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Feck sake.

3322~~~
Fletcher it is against Everton. For feck sake.

3323~~~
Give our injury luck I had a feeling we'd not get good news, hopefully missing the Everton game and then the International break will be enough for him to recover.

3324~~~
Broken ribs are 6 weeks normally, isn't it?

3325~~~
F-k off. Another victory for Big Sam's brand of Barbarian football. Literally breaking bones...

3326~~~
Three to six depending on severity.

3327~~~
fecking hope not. Top 4 hopes would take a pounding. We have absolutely no depth in midfield and if Herrera is out for that long I can see us struggling hugely.

3328~~~
fecking unbelievable the luck we have with injuries. 

There goes our midfield <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3329~~~
fecks sake. I don't want to see Fletcher at all. He can't even keep up with Burnley let alone Everton, or donkey Anderson. 

Play Di Maria there even if it is a complete waste of his quality, at least it allows Januzaj to play hopefully.

I get the feeling it's going to be one of those seasons where things just don't go right.

3330~~~
We are in a lot better position than we where this time last year.

3331~~~
Anyone know when Carrick will be available?

3332~~~
Luckily Carrick is nearly back..

3333~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> who is next ? RVP ? Rafael ?

3334~~~
Wouldn't be that bad if it were one of our strikers instead. The drop on quality after herrera is huge. Let's hope Fletcher has a blinder or 4.

3335~~~
I thought Carrick was supposed to be back this week.

3336~~~
fecking hell

3337~~~
Carrick and Blind in a midfield, not sure I'd like that...

3338~~~
We are never that lucky, it was always going to be an injury to our best midfielder.

3339~~~
Just stick Phil Jones in midfield, will make us harder to break down. But knowing LVG he will play Fletcher.

3340~~~
Huge blow. Looked real quality so far. 

Maybe LvG will put Andreas in? Please not Fletcher, look so shite against Sunderland and Burnley.

3341~~~
Isn't Jones injured too?

3342~~~
Then we have to hope the rest has done Fletch good. Otherwise we are screwed.

3343~~~
Could be back for Sunday, I'd play him centre-back though if he was fit. van Gaal likes round pegs in round holes, so I'd imagine he would too.

3344~~~
Well that's fecked this diamond over. 4-4-2 with Carrick in Blind in midfield?

3345~~~
Ya! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3346~~~
Our best midfielder injured, feck this shit. As Rooney is also injured, Fletcher will play. Hopefully he performs a little bit like pre season.

3347~~~
Play the perrera kid. Fletcher is all kinds of shite

3348~~~
This is Perreira's chance to step up. Hopefully we give him a chance and he takes it.

3349~~~
fecking hell. I hope he is fit again after the internationals break.

3350~~~
Fletcher had a decent cameo on Saturday I thought, so that's encouraging at least.

3351~~~
Isn't Pereira more of a no. 10 than a box-to-box?

3352~~~
I think you find Rooney is banned for being a silly boy.

3353~~~
Actually doesn't Valencia play the same role for Ecuador?

3354~~~
Please no!

3355~~~
My bad. I wanted to say that Fletcher as a vice captain would surely play now that both Rooney and Ander are out.

3356~~~
I'm so pissed off with this news. Just knew it wasn't going to be something minor. 

Our lack of depth is going to cost us big time this season.

3357~~~
No chance of that mate with that kind of injury. 

Anyway, it's a squad game these days. You have to expect injuries and have good replacements ready to come in. You can't over rely on one or two individuals in any position.

3358~~~
Time for Marouane to unleash his elbows on poor Everton

3359~~~
This has pissed me off. Only back from injury against QPR, things starting to click and he's out for possibly a month? 

We're fecked. Nobody can step into his role.

3360~~~
Big blow but thankfully there's an international break coming up, hopefully we can get him back for the Chelsea game at the end of October.

3361~~~
Yeah about that. Should be back to match fitness by December.

3362~~~
Unfortunately, our squad is full of shite.

3363~~~
3 would be the absolute minimum.

3364~~~
How far away is Carrick? You would guess he will probably be rushed back as he is the closest like for like player we have to Herrera

3365~~~
Ya he's shite for them too.

3366~~~
Apparently he'll only miss Everton and maybe (probably) west brom. Should be back for Chelsea. Thank feck for the international break. Thankfully Carrick will be back soon, maybe even against Everton on the bench. Same with Jones.

Hopefully Pereira gets a chance now that Herrera is out though it will probably just be as a sub as he's still quite small physically.

3367~~~
Carrick is nothing like Herrera.

3368~~~
He is alot closer to Herrera then Fellaini or Fletcher though

3369~~~
This is a big blow.

Even if Carrick is back he will be a major downgrade. Herrera is a proper box to box player who is fine defensively, good passer and can actually create and score from central areas.

None of our other midfielders can actually do all of those things with the possible exception of Di Maria.

Herrera is already a key player and losing him has fecked us big time IMO.

3370~~~
When will ever get a break with all these injuries to our players

3371~~~
Definitely Rafael - he's played three games in row now, he could breakdown any minute.

Given how Carrick is usually a slow starter even when he has a full pre-season, I'm not finding much in the way of consolation here. Unbelievable that this is his second injury after two months with us when his Bilbao injury record was so good.

3372~~~
big blow

the bad new keep coming and comin and coming. The last months are damn hard to bare for a United Fan. All started with that cnut Cakir to rob SAF his last CKL season. From then on its one hit in the face after another.

I'm so fecked up of this bullshit. We are making enough mistakes on our own recently, we don't need that feck luck in addition!

3373~~~
I thought the same earlier today, only a matter of minutes till he is out as well. Falcao knee injuy next on the agenda.

3374~~~
We have some really bad luck with injuries don't we?

Sorry to break it to you guys but if he has a genuine broken rib expect him out for a minimum of 6 weeks. The main issue with them is you are unable to do anything fitness wise so even if the pain clears up after a month or so he will need that little bit of extra time to get sharp and fit again. They really are a nasty injury you can't do anything for other than rest. I have suffered with bruised ribs from boxing and even they can take 3-4 weeks to fully clear up.

3375~~~
He was probably player of the month too. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3376~~~
That a real shitty blow for us. I would switch to a 4-2-3-1, drop Falcao or RVP, bring in Fletch or Carrick to sit beside Blind, and Mata, Di Maria and Januzaj to make the three behind the central striker. LVG wont do this though I'm sure, as he seems to want to play with 2 strikers at all times.

3377~~~
It usually is when it's between 3-6 weeks <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3378~~~
Christ on a bike, this lad was never injured at Athletic and he's already been injured twice here.

I'm convinced our training consists of our coaches using the players as real-life wrecking balls in order to battle out with each other.

3379~~~
Wasn't he injured in a tackle?

3380~~~
Untrue.


And I'd like to know what training methods avoid getting cracked ribs during tackles in matches.

3381~~~
Indeed, soon the question will be changed from how many players are injured to how many players are fit.

3382~~~
Very rarely.

EDIT: In fact his last one was 2012.

3383~~~
Yep since 09/10 his league apps read 30, 33, 32, 29 and 33. Very good injury record.

3384~~~
Valencia can do the role Herrera has played i guess ?

Sort of role he played few times last season like Sociedad away and also plays for his Country.

Well has more legs than Fletcher for it anyway for Everton type game.


If Fletcher plays we have to go 4-3-3 with 2 sitters.

3385~~~
Our attacking talent should be more than enough, anyway. If anything, having two sitters will be just what we need to fix our defensive problems in recent games.

Silver lining and all that.

3386~~~
We could always play blind in his position, and having fellaini, protect the back 4

3387~~~
Would be more solid and Better than Fletcher in that role tbh especially against Everton.

3388~~~
I'm mostly disappointed because with Rooney out I would have really liked to see Herrera play a game or two behind the striker, though that may not have happened anyway.

Really though he's comfortably the best midfielder we have and considering our alternative is Fletcher, I fail to see a silver lining.

3389~~~
This is what i was dreading . More than Rooney's ban. Just when he was establishing himself.

3390~~~
Oh ffs, it just never ends does it?

3391~~~
He's easily replaced.

3392~~~
2 goals in his last 2 games despite clearly not being at his best yet. I'd rather not replace him, personally.

3393~~~
That's what I thought.

3394~~~
Not saying we should replace him but he's easily replaced if he sustained an injury.

3395~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Do you guys realise how dreadful Fellaini and Valencia are?

3396~~~
FFS. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
I give up, it's absolutely just raining shite luck on us.

3397~~~
Oh for god's sake. It's like we just can't catch a break at the moment. I'm really worried that having Fletcher or someone in for Herrera is going to seriously hinder our play.

3398~~~
Why not Lingaard to replace him? LVG obviously rates him after starting him in the first game, isn't he training again now?

3399~~~
feck West Ham and whichever cnut injured him.

3400~~~
OK then

3401~~~
So what ?

3402~~~
Ahhhhh Fu-uck!!

3403~~~
*cries*

3404~~~
Yes, it was Enner Valencia, I think. He then played on for a little while, which is good old hindsight, might not have been the wisest thing.

3405~~~
Painkillers work for this kind of injuries ?

Really hope we have him for Chelsea at least <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3406~~~
We need him for the next few games, this is really bad news.

3407~~~
No one to blame, it's just bad luck. I have faith in the squad we've got now though.

3408~~~
I've just found out that this injury was caused by the referee Lee Mason. No fecking joke.

Edit: Okay I was joking a little bit.

3409~~~
There's nothing you can do but rest, the severity of the fracture will determine how long he's out for. Unfortunately you can't put a time scale on it.

3410~~~
?

3411~~~
The fact that I read that as Lindegard, and considered it, tells you how bad our back-ups are.
Get Pearson in. Time for him to start tearing shit up in the first team.

3412~~~
I don't remember that. What did he do?

3413~~~
Falcao and Rooney couldn't replace RVP if he got injured? "OK then".

3414~~~
Rooney is out for 3 weeks (and plays alongside him) and Falcao is already playing <i>alongside </i>RvP so neither can be considered as replacements.

3415~~~
No, because Rooney is suspended.

3416~~~
I don't think it was actually due to this but imagine if it was <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3417~~~
The OP I replied to didn't specify the next 3 games in which Rooney is suspended.

3418~~~
And Wilson is injured too.

3419~~~
Are you serious? The injury wasn't shown on cameras, if that's true then something has to be done about it.

3420~~~
Get real, what could be done about it ?

3421~~~
Get more cameras

3422~~~
Fine him? I don't know, I doubt anything would be done but it's still pretty mad.

Depends on how the injury happened really.

3423~~~
Ah ok, I didn't realise we where looking at it from an idealistic point of view <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>
I thought he was taken off in the under 21 game to ease him back to full fitness?

3424~~~
Sources are telling me that Mason repeatedly kicked him in the ribs.

3425~~~
I've looked at the gif a few times now, and it actually looks like he hit him for getting too close.. 
Am I going mad or did I see that?

3426~~~
The cnut, I hear he's very good friends with Clattenburg, Coincidence? I think not.

3427~~~
Not watched the game yet. It was in the match report I read.
I prefer your version of events. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3428~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I think we should probably change formation, whether it be a traditional holding 433, 4231 or 442. I'm not convinced that another of our other midfield options can do a good enough job as a CM of a diamond.

3429~~~
Tape the crap out of the ribs and have a lot of painkillers.

That worked for me from experience in an Aussie Rules match when i was younger. Hurts like a bitch though.

3430~~~
I'm nearly convinced that's what they said in commentary. In fairness though they do tend to get a lot of things wrong <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3434~~~
We are cursed if that did it. Unbelievable.

3435~~~
A real shame he's going to be out. Arguably been our best player in the last few games.

Maybe this is Fellaini's time to step up and fill the box to box role until Herrera's back. Hope he's fit for the Chelsea game, though.

3436~~~
FFS.

3437~~~
Indeed.<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3438~~~
Fletcher is vice captain, you'd think he'd replace him.

3439~~~
Na mate, I did the same thing last year. You can hardly move, let alone play a game of football. You can't even breathe properly. All he can do is rest.

3440~~~
Bring Di Maria into the centre?

3441~~~
Pretty much what I thought. A fractured rib is not a recurring issue.

3442~~~
This kid has no mazel.

3443~~~
With his playing style he'll get injured a lot if he's not made of strong stuff physically. Even more so in the PL.

3444~~~

3445~~~
Worth every penny this lad, hopes he kicks on after this injury. World class midfielder in the making, no doubt about that.

3446~~~
Agree completely.

3447~~~
How long will he be out for then?

3448~~~
I love the attitude of this guy, getting so tempted to get a Herrera United shirt now!

3449~~~
Minimum 3 weeks.

3450~~~
What a shame! Get well soon, Ander <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3451~~~
So, not protect them at all?

3452~~~
His whole name looks ridiculous on the back of it though. Should just say Herrera.

3453~~~
Where is white text?
Carrick should be match-fit soon though.

3454~~~
We can still dig deep in the rubbish bin left by the SAF/Moyes administration. Fletcher, Fellaini, a 33 year old Carrick....we're spoiled with choice.

Id say we should give a kid a chance. Periera or Pearson would do fine

3455~~~
With Herrera out I don't really see the diamond working particularly well.

Should move to a 4231 now IMO and get Carrick alongside Blind.

3456~~~
The injury business is getting to be a bit much. How many 1st team crocks have we got now?

3457~~~
Basically, we're screwed.

Genuinely can't see us beating Everton now. Thats how dire our midfield options are past Herrera/Blind/Di Maria.

3458~~~
Their defence has been leaking as goals. With the attacking threat of Falcao, RvP, di Maria and Mata, we should be able to outscore them if we lose the midfield battle.

3459~~~
Big blow, we're getting no luck atm. Tbh can't see how we can stick with the diamond now, don't have the personnel for it, if Carrick was fit maybe we could push Blind wider and if Lingaard had more experience (if he's available anyway) we could maybe have brought him in. Then Valencia can't fill in his role and his lack of interchangeability makes it pointless to try in the current set up. Got to be a 5 for me, Blind/Fletch sitting, mata ahead with Di Maria and Januzaj either side. Enough there to see us through but obviously not ideal. 

Reckon we'll move back to a 352 though which is a shame as would be cool to see Di Maria, Januzaj and Mata together.

3460~~~
I don't like the look of the diamond but think a 4231 could work:

 
Obviously a few of those can be swapped about depending on fitness etc (Carrick/Fletcher, Mata/van Persie/Facao).

3461~~~
FFS! SMH how fecked up is our luck? I hope he's back within 4 weeks - it's like we're now paying for someone's deal with the Devil ffs.

3462~~~
Gutted about this. He's a pivotal part of the side now. I expect to see one of Fletcher or Pereira. I'd give the latter a pop but would expect and also understand the former. Hope Ander is back soon.

3463~~~
I'd flood the CM instead. Carrick-Pearson-Blind with Januzaj and Di Maria on the flanks and Falcao upfront.

3464~~~
I'd be up for something more like that in a bigger game but I don't think that's really necessary at home to Everton. Wishful thinking re Pearson I suspect to.

3465~~~
Bleedin' hell. Barely an injury to speak of in his professional career to date, and how he's had two whilst at United. He's been such an important player too. We look loads better when he plays. I was hoping it was just a bruise from impact.

3466~~~
1 month

3467~~~
Our morale is rock bottom, our defense is wiped out by injury and is struggling even in the basics, the captain is suspended and with Herrera gone things will get messier. Every game is for us a CL final.

3468~~~
United are gonna lose this weekend without him.

3469~~~
In my opinion, he's our only actual CM.

Mata, Di Maria and Fellaini are all best in pretty advanced positions with minimal defensive responsiblities. Carrick, Fletcher and Blind are best at protecting the defense and controlling the pace of the game. So that's 3 AMs, 3 DMs and 1 CM. By default, Herrera becomes our most important midfielder, imo. Di Maria might be more important overall, but an injury on Herrera leaves us ridiculously unbalanced.

3470~~~
Overly dramatic, I think. We did just win our last game afterall. Morale certainly didn't look rock bottom after that.

Everton haven't started well and have EL midweek. We'll win.

3471~~~
We lost against MK Dons, Leicester and Swansea and drew against Burnley and Sunderland. How can that possibly be translated in me being overly dramatic. 

All the teams mentioned above are much worse then Everton.

3472~~~
I'm not sure why people keep mentioning Carrick, he's not fit either.

It'll be Fletcher (unfortunately).

3473~~~
Shame about the injury, just when he has really started to shine. Time to bring in Anderson for the Everton game. Would rather see Anderson ahead of Fletcher.

3474~~~
Bad news for us. He's already key to our midfield, such a wonderful player

3475~~~
we are fecked, time for Pereira. Fletcher and the other arent good enough.

3476~~~
Bad news given how much dynamism he adds to our midfield and how substandard the potential replacements are. Luckily, it's the international break after the Everton game, so if we can get through that, hopefully the injuries will subside in time for West Brom away.

3477~~~
Luckily, two weeks of that is for internationals. Should be back for Chelsea.

3478~~~
How? How can we have all these injuries? 
Herrera been brilliant so far, so hopes he is back soon.

3479~~~
When is Carrick Back?

3480~~~
Heard he should be back around the 5th of October. But not sure if he would start or what he'd be like since he hasn't played for around 3 months or so <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Really upset about Herrera - the one injury we really don't need....

3481~~~
There's only one Darren Fletcher! Anyway I would give a chance to Pereira to take it, we need that tenacity and energy in midfield against everton, him and Blind could be a good pair to shield the defense tih tehir crisp passing and controlling the game Mata in front of them and Januzaj with diMaria on the wings, or we could playdiamond with Pereira as box to box with diMaria also helping in the midfield..

3482~~~
I was referring to the "our morale is at rock bottom" and "every game is a CL Final" as being overly dramatic. I'm well aware of our form.

Ah I thought Carrick was fit and nearing availability? Has been training for around 2 weeks I think.

3483~~~
Very disappointing to see he's out for a few weeks. He's been very impressive so far IMO, and clearly a definite starter when fit. He'll be a loss. Hopefully the international break absorbs most of his injury time.

3484~~~
Big, big loss for us.

Van Gaal will really need to show his worth tactically in the Everton game if we're to get anything out of it.

3485~~~
Moyes put a curse on the team after he got sacked.

3486~~~
Will be missed no doubt. Still hope we can beat a Thursday-tired Everton without him.

3487~~~
Get well soon Herrera! you will be missed

3488~~~
We'll miss him against Everton. I'm being serious when I say we really need to be beating the teams around us. It's not a disaster if we lose, because I believe we have the quality to get results against the best, however it's good to start with picking up points with potential 4th place rivals.

3489~~~
Bad bad news but as some said better that than back injury. 
He was great for us so far. 

Who will replace him though. Is Carrick fit. 
Maybe it's Anderson's big chance to shine. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3490~~~
He's going to be one of these made of glass types isn't he. That's about the third different injury already, 2months in.

Please don't let him join Club Smalling/Jones/Evans

3491~~~
This is a fecking joke.

3492~~~
The last we heard was LVG saying that he was back running on grass, but not doing any ball work. I think that was about two weeks ago.

So I doubt he'll be ready for a good few weeks yet.

3493~~~
We really do have the shittiest luck with injuries!

3494~~~
Every other top four team gets to field a full strength midfield every week. We're lucky to field one every month. It's ridiculous.

3495~~~
Yes, us and Arsenal. 

Liverpool and Chelsea don't seem to have nearly as many.

3496~~~
Carrick's going to do his usual "slow start" routine whenever he does come back and with him completely missing pre-season I'm expecting him to be even more off the pace than usual. 

LvG has brought on Valencia to play on the right side of the diamond before so I guess that could be an option.

3497~~~
Erm...

Arsenal have Ramsey, Arteta and Walcott injured from theirs!

3498~~~
He's never been especially injury prone before as far as I know. Would be ridiculous if he suddenly started picking them up all the time after joining us

3499~~~
Yeah but at least they have the personnel to cope. Our backup options are absolute dirt aside from a 33 year old Carrick and a Fletcher that's way off the pace. Neither of them offer anything close to what Herrera has offered us so far this season.

3500~~~
That's our fault though!  You said every other top team can play their best midfield every week. That's not true, just that they've made sure they have the squad to cope.

3501~~~
Well that's half what I meant. They can all field functioning midfields week in week out then. Ours constantly has a bunch of players that can't play together for shit, which is what's going to happen this weekend. Herrera getting injured is a major blow.

3502~~~
Yeah Valencia on the right side of the diamond is the most solid option we could use for this weekend, simply because you know that he will definitely put a shift and he is economical with the ball though he is fecking useless going forward but with ADM and Mata in, that shouldn't be a problem. The worst we can do is to put an out of sorts Fletcher or an unfit Carrick, given the demands of the role. With Tony you know that no one is going to be steamrolling past our midfield!
Huge blow losing Herrera, let's just it's for a relatively short period.

3503~~~
At least two week will be eaten up by the international break. First time I have been grateful for one of those.

3504~~~
How the times change, ha!

3505~~~
They really don't. Flamini is a negative hatchet-man, and Arteta has declined in the same manner Carrick has. Their midfield turns as dire as ours once Ramsey is out, even with Wilshere's bright start to the season.

3506~~~
Two of them are way above Everton,   they are woeful this season, you will smash them, they probably wont even have landed from Russia by the same you play.

3507~~~
Just a shame that Herrera is out injured.

In my eyes, LvG is going to pick Fletcher as his replacement and rightly so. We overused him in the first weeks due to the injuries we had and his performance level dropped massively. I don't think he can play week in week out but he certainly has something to offer, if he is used in the right way. The game against Everton is under the right circumstances for him. He had some time to regenerate, trained consistently and had that short cameo against West Ham.

3508~~~
Had to skip about 5 pages of people crying (rightly so, mind) about Herreras injury so didn't get to see the Carrick situation if it was mentioned, isn't he due back?  I'd happily take a unfit carrick and give him 60 minutes in the hope we can sub him off while leading. 

As for Herrera why can't he play on pain killers? A fractured rib isn't exactly ability or career threatening.

3509~~~
He needs rest for the healing to occur

3510~~~
Those games without Herrera will be difficult, the guy makes us tick now.

3511~~~
Don't know how practical this is, but you'd have thought it could be done fairly easily, seems LvG just doesn't take any chances with injured players, is highly frustrating that we are suffering so badly with injuries, just hope our lack of games benefits us injury wise as we get into the latter part of the season, because it only seems to be hindering us atm.

3512~~~
Adjusting to a new league - it happens. No one close-lined him every 10 minutes in Spain.

3513~~~
Jesus christ we can't catch a fecking break at the moment..

3514~~~
Presumably because if gets hit hard in the ribs again that fracture can become much much worse. Wouldn't even necessarily have to be a player doing, a bad fall could exacerbate the injury. It's a shame he can't play but it's better to have him out for a few games than risk it

3515~~~
Probably the last player we wanted to lose to an injury. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3516~~~
Injuries have to heal, it's as simple as that. Professionals need to listen to their body and to play on pain killers is a stupid thing to do. It's something different in a final or a decisive game in a championship, but it shouldn't be a common thing. We already have injury prone players and to play them not fully fit won't help the situation we are in, especially long term.

A fractured rib is a restricting thing to have. Had one myself and it's hard to breath under physical pressure, limits your agility and is of course really touch sensitive. Of course it depends on how many ribs are fractured and how bad, but for a contact sport on a professional level, it won't matter too much I believe.

3517~~~
Funny how Herrera now is a bigger loss than Rooney.

3518~~~
Agree, Valencia is the best option against Everton. He will put in a good defensive shift and allow ADM and Mata to be more attacking. Also he will keep Baines quiet, which is half of the battle against Everton.

3519~~~
Well we still have RVP, Falcao and Mata to play behind them. Our options after Herrera are pretty bad, a much bigger drop in quality.

3520~~~
What a blow. Herrera and Di Maria are irreplaceable as the 'shuttlers' on the side of a 4-4-2 diamond. Even putting aside the huge drop in quality, none of Fletcher, Carrick, Anderson or Fellaini have the energy or mobility to perform those roles adequately.

3521~~~
After going through years of midfield torture, it's surely not much to ask for our new and now best CM stays fit. Or are we all just overreacting? I honestly can't believe how frustrating this season is already becoming.

3522~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/ByyZoPaIAAEwTCE.mp4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/ByyZoPaIAAEwTCE.mp4</a>

Probably not what actually fractured his rib, but it's possible if he elbowed him in the right place I guess. More likely it aggravated it and did the last bit to fracture it after a previous tackle. Still, our lack of luck with refs has been ridiculous this season.

3523~~~
Andreas Pereira almost sounds like Ander Herrera. Does he almost play like him as well?

3524~~~
Agreed. MF is so thin on talent.

3525~~~
Don't think so. If I'm not wrong Pearson is more like it.

3526~~~
Thanks for that. Glad you have faith.

3527~~~
I don't think we're that bad off

-----------Blind-------------


----Anderson--------Di Maria--


--------------Mata--------------


----------Falcao----RVP-----------


Though a bit unbalanced with 5 left footers. Feel we can still get a win, Ando could produce one of his 2 matches a year performances that is good

3528~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

No worries kid. I'll be impressed if they beat Everton though.

3529~~~
Still way considerably better than the days of seeing Alan Smith, Kleberson, John O Shea, Phil Neville, Park JS and Rafael in centre midfield.

3530~~~
Anderson still exist?

3531~~~
It will most likely be Fletch but I'd love if Pereira was given a chance

3532~~~
Naah I would rather Valencia, Pearson, Perreira or Fletcher, in that order, for the right-sided CM in his absence. I think, have said it before, Valencia is best suited to ''do a job'' on the right side of midfield. We need to be solid in midfield and fielding any of Fletcher, Carrick (first game back, slow starter), Fellaini (is he back yet?) and Anderson, won't aid that objective.

3533~~~
Single fractured rib treatment is simple analgesia (pain killers) and rest.  Not too worried, might be back sooner rather than later.

3534~~~
I reckon he'll miss Everton and West Brom and should be fit for Chelsea. All hail international break!

3535~~~
Don't forget we have the best medical staff in the world. Might take double the time required.

3536~~~
Valencia is dog shite but now that I think about it he makes more sense than Fletcher given that Rafael and him are quite good together.

3537~~~
No Ander.. no cry.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3538~~~
Rafa and Valencia were indeed ace together at one time. Mostly down to the fact that Rafa opened up spaces for Valencia to dart into. Can't remember the last time they played together though.

3539~~~
I had a dream we started Fletcher and Anderson in midfield with Falcao and Frazier Campbell up front.

3540~~~
But even with our medical staff, its hard to bollocks a SINGLE rib fracture.

You literally give him a tablet and say "good luck".

3541~~~
I cracked a rib and it took me 2 weeks to recover before I could fully breathe without pain. Hopefully after the international break he will be back to normal.

3542~~~
That's a real blow to our chances against Everton, he has been giving 7/10 performances since he got here. Who are we thinking will play in his stead? Probably Fletcher I suppose.

3543~~~
bad news this, i've been very impressed with him on the most part the past few games. I'd prob say easily second best performers after di maria

3544~~~
I'm not even sure if you're joking here or not...

3545~~~
Carrick returning would go a long way in keeping things ticking till he recovers. It's frightening the drop in quality when we look at our back ups

3546~~~
It's a shame (for Ander) that he's injured just before the international break again, because I think Del Bosque said he was going to call him up last time, but he got injured, and I can only imagine he would have received a call up this time, as he has been excellent for us. 
Good for us in a way, as its two weeks recovery time, but a shame for Ander who will have to wait for his first cap when he's so close. 

I think it'll be Valencia to come in and replace him against Everton.

3547~~~
It's half and half... Obviously not what caused the injury but it could have aggravated it running into him. Probably just a coincidence that he went down right after. Again not blaming the ref because that would be crazy but I'm saying how terrible our luck is!

3548~~~
Don't worry Carrick has always specialised in 7/10 performances so hopefully he will be back fit

3549~~~
--------De Gea
Rafael---Jones--Rojo---Shaw
--------Blind---
Adnan--Mata---Di Maria
---RVP----Falcao

3550~~~
10-12 to Everton.

3551~~~
So what is the real change in formation that makes you think Everton will win 10-12?

Herrera hasn't exactly been playing CM for us, he's been playing on the right hand side of midfield where Adnan can play, his injury is a blow but shouldn't change us that much in the way of formations or approach.

3552~~~
We obviously won't play a diamond if Herrera isn't there.

3553~~~
No way can Adnan play Ander's role IMO. Ander offered a lot more defensive cover with his pressing and control in tight spaces, plus he always gave Blind an option. I don't think we'll go diamond formation again against Everton though.

3554~~~
I've got a feeling LVG doesn't fancy Mata, as been pointed out previously we don't have another player who can do what Herrera does on the right side of a diamond, my prediction he will go for a 4-4-1-1 with RVP playing a bit deeper behind Falcao:

--------De Gea

Rafael---Jones--Rojo---Shaw

Adnan/--Fletcher--Blind--Di Maria
Valencia
---------RVP

---------Falcao

3555~~~
LVG will continue to field at least 1 academy player in the starting line up <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> 
(Well its either Pereira or Anderson)

3556~~~
I quite like the look of that team as it happens but I cant see RVP being left out.

3557~~~
Yet it is slightly refreshing that there's actual improvement as the weeks go by unlike last year. LVG at least has that going right.

3558~~~
With the 2 week international break, I reckon he'll be fine to play against WBA but it's whether LVG wants to risk him.

3559~~~
WHY?


Also change my user title because it's completely wrong.

3560~~~
These days it's the only reason for thanks for the 2 week gaps!

Sods law dictates we'll struggle to field someone next to Rojo for Everton, then suddenly everyone will be back for the next game. That's our luck all over.
Then they'll all be out again. etc

3561~~~
Agree on Valencia. It does give us quite an odd look midfield though, of Mata and 2 wingers. Blind will have to work hard!

3562~~~
Why do you hate Herrera?

3563~~~
I know it's ridiculous and laughable but we do...he ahs all the tools, he just has a body like a car wreck and has given up playing football, but Anderson at his best is exactly what we need in a Herrera understudy for the diamond formation. He can run with the ball, can defend (not through excellent slide tackling, but otherwise he;s OK) and can pass well over short distances - only problem is all these attributes are inconsistent and he's never fully fit or able to give more than 65 minutes!!

*pulls hair out*

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/01/marouane-fellaini-manchester-united-fitness-everton?CMP=twt_gu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...-manchester-united-fitness-everton?CMP=twt_gu</a>

Louis van Gaal’s injury crisis is easing as the Manchester United manager begins to reduce the list of 10 unavailable players before Sunday’s visit of Everton.

Marouane Fellaini has been back in full training since the start of the week after the ankle injury he suffered in late August and Van Gaal will leave it until the last possible moment to decide whether he can call him into squad for Sunday.

The Belgian had appeared set to leave the club on a loan or permanent deal but the ankle issue prevented any possibility of this occurring and Fellaini recently signalled his determination to fight for a place.

Ander Herrera, whose place in the matchday 18 Fellaini would take, has told friends that his fractured rib is not overly painful and he is aiming to return in less than three weeks, immediately after the international break, for the trip to West Bromwich Albion on 20 October.

The Spaniard’s ability to do so depends on his pain threshold when starting to run again in training rather than any risk of aggravating the problem.

Phil Jones, who injured a hamstring playing for England this month, has started training once more on grass but only in light sessions, away from the main first-team squad. Jones has joined Michael Carrick, who is recovering from ankle ligament damage, but the match with Everton is expected to come to soon.

3565~~~
Jamie "di Maria hasn't agreed terms and is still in Spain" Jackson.

3566~~~
Fellaini being back is not a positive. The longer he's injured, the better.

3567~~~
Eventually we're going to sell him, having him keep his value by playing the odd game isn't that bad.

3568~~~
Van Gaal won't be using him anyway unless he really wants to, or believes he has something to add.

3569~~~
Him wasting away on the bench won't sit well with potential suitors, though. It would've been better for us if he stayed injured until we could sell, or a few weeks beforehand, that way we have the excuse of "he wasn't match fit" when we try to fob him off to somebody.

3570~~~
Really disappointed with his injury obviously. We'll miss him against Everton. Barry looked really suss against Liverpool and Herrera pressing him and hounding him would have been good. Hopefully we don't lose too much in the midfield though.

3571~~~

3572~~~
It's funny, but he isn't going to close a United player over a Liverpool player. Henderson has been good to be fair, however, I would take Herrera.

3573~~~
Even if Carragher had said they're about the same level it would be a lie. Herrera is significantly better than Henderson, and that's not my Man Utd myopia affecting my brain. I can admit that Henderson is among the best options England have in centre-midfield, but if Herrera was English he'd be a nailed on starter for our national team.

3574~~~
Herrera is definitely technically better. Worrying that Henderson is one of Englands better options.

3575~~~
Agree. He gives a lot of perspiration and effort and with space he can hit a good long pass too but, in effect, he's just an upgrade on Delph. If Wilshere ever managed to hit his top form again, and keep it, he'd be head and shoulders above the rest of England's other midfielders. We've just called up Shelvey, again a less good version of Henderson. 

Going back to Ander I hope he does not get mixed up in the match fixing trial in Spain. I saw Gabi got done today. Atleti will miss him massively. Bad enough Ander has a broken rib (Jamie Jackson says he broke it first half and played on until he couldn't anymore), the idea of losing him for an extended period is horrible.

3576~~~
He's sitting on the fence there.

3577~~~
That is a worry. I just hope he is not involved and that if he was he was just fooled into doing something. He loves Zaragoza, it's his club I think not Bilbao. Until the names of the players who were given money comes out we will be non the wiser.

3578~~~
Just to clarify, Gabi testified today but denied any knowledge of the match being fixed. At present there's nothing to suggest he'll be suspended by the LFP or Atletic, or put on trial.  His comment that, "I just did what the club asked," referred to him being given €85k by the club and handing it back to the club president. He says he didn't ask why, but assumed it was to keep it hidden from the club's creditors.

It's believed over €1m was laundered in this way with a dozen players involved. If Ander was involved then hopefully it was unwittingly of the real intentions.

The saga so far is in:

3579~~~
Henderson is a very good player and seems to be very underrated on here. I'd say Herrera edges for me slightly now due to being technically simply better and I think he will become a much better player than him but Henderson in the last 12 months has been brilliant. He was one of the big reasons that Liverpool looked so good in the title hunt.

3580~~~
I seriously am worried about the match against Everton, i really believe along with Di Maria, he is already our 2nd most important player, all of our good moves starts with him, and he is so intelligent, you will see him at the start of the moves combining with Rafael to create chances and when he sees Di Maria moves out to the Wing, he goes back along with Blind just to give him a cover and make us solid, while he covers the most ground in our matches, and against a team like Everton who presses, he has the technical ability to keep the ball and keep things ticking, while defensively his blocks, his pressing, tackles, this guy is a complete package we will miss him immensely, i really hope he is back after the international break.

3581~~~
I love watching Ander play. He just gets involved everywhere, and he's surprisingly efficient on the ball. Plus, he's shown intelligence and discipline that has made him a perfect foil to di Maria playing as a pseudo-central midfielder.

His injury's going to really hurt us. His dynamic presence in the middle of the park brings the best out of everyone.

3582~~~
A lot of under rating of Henderson in this thread. He'd be a great option for us, although I think Herrera is a better player.

Henderson reminds me of Fletcher back before he was ill.

3583~~~
Manchester United central midfielder in European team of the month. Get in !

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2014%2f10%2fSep-TotM.jpg" src="http://164.177.157.12/img/blog/2014%2f10%2fSep-TotM.jpg"/>

3584~~~
Or, get out!

Edit: And a Barca centerback? (And isn't Mathieu a fullback?)

3585~~~
Payet listed as a CM and no Fabregas tells you that it's a stupid joke.

3586~~~
Center back. I think he played at the left quite a lot for Valencia.

3587~~~
Barca had 6 clean sheets in a row.

3588~~~
Mathieu has been a center half for over a year and Barcelona's defence has been fine this season.

3589~~~

3590~~~
As Kroos supposedly pulled out of the transfer because LvG got the job, isn't it a bit of a pointless argument they are making. I am very happy that we got LvG and Ander. Someone who wanted to play for us, not someone who is scared shitless of the manager.

3591~~~
I think we did.

3592~~~
Weird comparison given that we've just only started the season. I suppose journos have to write something to get their website clicks.

3593~~~
Agree. If we had a more solid defensive midfield maybe Kroos would have been the better option, but not onlyis Herrera accomplished going forward, he adds a lot more steel to our midfield. It does, however, show why Di Maria was a necessary buy rather than the luxury he was initially made out to be. I think we've done good business with the midfielders we brought in. We didn't just buy for the sake of buying, but bought with a system in mind. 

Blind (mainly defensive, but can get forward if needed)
Di Maria (mainly attacking but can defend when needed)
Herrera (an ideal go-between to link the the two)

Our concern in midfield now is quantity rather than quality. When one of these players in unavailable (tomorrow) it really does show up the scarcity of our midfield options.

3594~~~
Always thought myself we were better suited to Herrera than Kroos. Moyes with Kroos would have continued our slow zombie passing style. We needed someone with the dynamism and athleticism of Herrera even at the slight expense of lesser technical ability.

3595~~~
Kroos could have succeeded Scholes here, he's a world class midfielder. Right now though, Herrera has proven a great partner to di Maria in a system that is working, offensively at least.

3596~~~
We could have done with both but not sure how they'd have fitted in together.

3597~~~
We probably would've asked the same question regarding Herrera, di Maria, Rooney, Falcao and van Persie.

3598~~~
Yes, because Herrera is dynamic - something we've been missing for ages. Kroos, as good as he is, wouldn't give us that. That said, I wouldn't have minded both. A midfield three of say:

We'll miss Herrera a lot, in my opinion.

3599~~~
I think so too, when Herreras not on the pitch we just dont seem to have the same control we do when hes on it. His ability to break things up and get forward will be missed. 

Heres to hoping Carrick is back so we have him cover for Blind and Blind can move further up the pitch to cover Herrera as our midfield engine

3600~~~
He's obviously a gutsy little beggar as well, he played on with that broken rib, when some go off with the slightest twinge.

3601~~~
We wont win tomorrow because of Anders absence imho. Thats how important he is.

3602~~~
If everton are missing McCarthy and Coleman we really have no excuse.

3603~~~
We'll play more like we did against Burnley I'd bet. Won't be pretty.

3604~~~
I've already said it but if di Maria shows up then we'll win, it's that simple I reckon. He's that good.

3605~~~
Are they confirmed out? I didn't know that.

3606~~~
Not quite, he showed up against Leicester...

3607~~~
Well McCarthy isn't in the Ireland squad so I assume he's out.

3608~~~
Thankfully Clattenburg won't be turning up on Sunday.

3609~~~
Ah thats pleased me. If Coleman is out too then we really wont have any excuses.

3610~~~
Looks like Mirallas is out too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3611~~~
If we don't win, the media will be all over Rooney, when we know it will be because Ander is missing. We have options to replace Rooney, but not Herrera.

3612~~~
I think it's impossible to say who we'll miss more, only the match and the performance will tell.

3613~~~
Really uneasy without this boy starting. How long is he out for?

3614~~~
Pretty confident he'll be back after the international break

3615~~~
Well that's a relief.

3616~~~
Yea, LvG said he's fit to play but has some pain in the rib. Probably precautionary decision not to play him today

3617~~~
ander is the type of a midfielder that we have been missing over the years. he is always all over the pitch, pressing people, not afraid to get stuck in, links up well with his teammate, always moving, good passer and by the look of it, not bad from the edge of the box as well which is a bonus.

hope he is back as soon as possible.

3618~~~

3619~~~
Buy more Spaniards! They have the right mentality.

3620~~~
Watching Athletic club tonight on SS5. They've really missed him you know. I think he will become one of the most valuable midfielders in the prem!

3621~~~
Pointless, it wasn't a choice because Kroos was not going to join once Madrid approached him. Herrera has still done very well for United and will prove to be an excellent buy.

3622~~~
Athletic Club are missing him badly, was a important player for them.

3623~~~

3624~~~
Love players who are happy to be playing for the club because of the club, the ones we have top of my head:

De Gea
Rafael
Rojo
Herrera
Blind
Di Maria
Falcao
Van persie 

Interestingly enough 5/6 of out new signings.

3625~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzbcRJnCIAA-q1P.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzbcRJnCIAA-q1P.jpg"/>

3626~~~
It obviously wears off...

3627~~~
I know some people see Falcao as a bit of a mercenary, so I think it might be a bit earlier to list him there since he's in that initial stage of playing for us. Even though he doesn't play a lot anymore, Fletcher would be another. Carrick too, arguably.

3628~~~
I'd take away falcao, RvP and di Maria. I like to think of it like who would still be here and not even think of a transfer had moyes not been sacked. No chance we would have signed di Maria, maybe with falcao the same. These are players that could walk into any team in the world. RvP would probably look to leave if moyes was still here as well. Apart from the home grown players though, I agree, Jones, rafael, smalling, Herrera, rojo and blind all seek to be delighted they made the step up to a club like United and aren't worried that we had a shit year last year.

3629~~~
any news on his availability for the west brom game?
Physioroom has him returning for the game on 26th. I always thought he should be ready for the west brom game as he got injured on the 27th.
Really hope he is fit for the next game.
Apart from his importance in the team, I really can't get enough of Shaw, Falcao, Di Mariaa and Herrera. Hence, want each of these four for every game.

3630~~~
There still really isn't a definitive date for his return. I would wait until the press conference in 3 days time to see what Van Gaal says about the injury front. The only positive I saw of this international break was that it gives time for some of our injured players to get fit. As for Herrera, I feel as if the West Brom game might be too soon, but hopefully I'm wrong.

3631~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i911.photobucket.com/albums/ac318/Vato_1979/AndersGame.jpg" src="http://i911.photobucket.com/albums/ac318/Vato_1979/AndersGame.jpg"/>

Thanks again <a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a>!

3632~~~
Is Falcao covering an ice-pack on his knee in that photo?

3633~~~
Any news on how his recovery is going? Any chance he'll make West Brom?

3634~~~
I read somewhere that he's a chance to play West Brom but they were considering saving him for Chelsea. Think I saw it on Twitter - they said Jones and Smalling were back fit too. If Herrera isn't 100% then I wouldn't mind him just getting 20 minutes off the bench to get sharpness back before Chelsea. We should be able to beat West Brom without him.

3635~~~
saw it too.

3636~~~
great news if true. We should start him on the bench. Valencia can do a decent job against WBA

3637~~~
Valencia is injured.

3638~~~
Kinell...

3639~~~
If he's fit then we should play him. feck resting him for Chelsea, there's a whole week for that.

3640~~~
Would be good to see him feature. No rush with him though.

3641~~~
Probably. I'd imagine you really do what's required to help recovery after every game and training session once you've had an injury like he has.

3642~~~
wtf?? what happened to him?

3643~~~
We stand little chance at Chelsea in all honesty so id rather he played this weekend and Carrick/Blind combo next

3644~~~
Yep, lots of professionals take ice baths straight after matches to help stop swelling in joints. Probably on Physio's orders to help keep his knee strong to ice it straight after games.

3645~~~
The Chelsea game is at Old Trafford.

3646~~~
What kind of attitude is that? Play only our 2nd tier players because we will lose anyways?

3647~~~
Would expect Fletcher to provide cover for Herrera if the latter isn't 100% for WBA; although might LVG use that game as an opportunity to pair Carrick and Blind with a view to some of the tougher games coming up where we might need extra bodies in midfield? (Leaving out RVP or Falcao I guess...)

3648~~~
Get out

3649~~~
don't worry, we wreck Chelsea, just watch. (unless another Clattenburg ofc)

3650~~~
That's the spirit.

3651~~~
Are you Moyes in disguise? 

I want to see Ander back in the side asap because I think his presence raises our game. If he is fit why rest him? There will be a week to rest between West Brom and Chelsea. Lets play him and get the points on the board, in both matches.

3652~~~
I know one thing, we stand a much a better chance if Herrera is playing at Chelsea. You wana give Carrick his first match back after a long term injure, against Chelsea? Are you mad fs.

3653~~~
tweaked hamstring, out of the WBA game.

3654~~~
Is Carrick fit yet?

3655~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2792220/how-radamel-falcao-wayne-rooney-robin-van-persie-compare-real-madrid-barcelona-trios.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...rsie-compare-real-madrid-barcelona-trios.html</a> Don't know if this is true, but this statement is just so wrong.

Archive.today for Mail-like garbage.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://archive.today/ojKGC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://archive.today/ojKGC</a>

I liked how the author used midfielders and wingers as strikers.

3657~~~
Horrid tripe.

3658~~~
I just wouldn't rest Herrera for a very winnable game to play him in a game which we're likely to lose.

Hopefully he can play both, id still include Carrick if fit as his discipline would be useful. I reckon we'll need to counter against Chelsea via Di Maria pushed high

3659~~~
Surprised at you, Smores. What sort of a bullshit attitude is that?

3660~~~
We should play him when he is fully fit, no point in risking him for 3 points at West Bromwich if he could break down again

3661~~~
Ya because we stand no chance against Chelsea at home... <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3662~~~
When i was younger and played Football manager, whenever there was a big game and one of my best players were injured i used to "un-injure" them using some hack and injure a non important substitute as i felt bad as i cheated. Right now if i could, i would use that hack on our ander <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3663~~~
Everyone is so afraid of Chelsea. We're going unbeaten against them this season.

3664~~~
We stand a chance against any team in the league if we can maintain our high performance levels throughout the entire game. Chelsea included.

3665~~~
But he's fit to play?

3666~~~
Great news that he's back, he should be played for 50-60 minutes which should see the game out, then bring on Carrick.

3667~~~
If he's fit then he should play, no question about it.

3668~~~
I think Chelsea will finish above us this year, but I actually have a feeling we will hand them their first loss of the season. I'd rest Herrera for WBA if it will mean he will be fit for Chelsea.

3669~~~
You're welcome! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3670~~~
Not with our shaky defense though.

3671~~~
Don't stand a chance against Chelsea at home? Chelsea are brilliant but they aren't the juggernaught they're being made out to be, we have one of the best big game players in the world in Di Maria, and Falcao bagged four last time he played them, we're going to beat them.

3672~~~
I like your optimism strange, mental person.

3673~~~
Well Chelsea's defence isn't the greatest either. We've definitely got a chance at beating them. They're a great team, probably the best in England at the moment, but they have flaws especially defensively. We have players that can exploit that, same with Chelsea in regards to us.

3674~~~
If he's still requiring a pain injection to play against West Brom then I wouldn't risk re-injuring himself, more chance of that if he can't feel the pain, I'd rather give him another weeks rest and then give him a pain killing injection (if he needs it at that point) and release him fresh against Chelsea.

3675~~~
He needs to play against WBA in order to be in contention for Chelsea. If he is fit, then get him match fit!

3676~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.bestfreechristian.com/stock_04/images/ccn009.jpg" src="http://www.bestfreechristian.com/stock_04/images/ccn009.jpg"/>

3677~~~
Chelsea's defence isn't the greatest, but it sure is better than ours at the moment.

3678~~~
I love Ander and he'll be a great boost if he is back fit, but I don't see the point in taking a risk if he's not 100%. I'd hate to see him face a longer spell on the sidelines for aggravating the existing injury.

3679~~~
Agree with this, and even though anything can happen in Football I'm fully expecting us to lose to Chelsea (even though it feels wrong), maybe even be a big margin

3680~~~
Someone has to be optimistic or the Caf will go into meltdown, I drew the short straw today.

3681~~~
Youve ruined it now, hysterical negativity was the one thing we all had in common.

3682~~~
Well apparently Herrera might be able to play on Monday albeit with injections, but his ribs are healing well and barring any setbacks against West Brom he should be fit enough for Chelsea. To early for Carrick to start against Chelsea imo, plus i don't think LVG would even consider him anyway. We could see the return of 352 against Chelsea, weather thats a good thing or not i dunno. Although the squad still might be working on aspects of it and the fact we'd have a whole week to really get a game plan drilled in with this formation it could be a lot better since we last saw it. Wouldn't hold my breath though.

3683~~~
Just bend over will ya.

Are we playing West Ham again?

Also he injured himself against West Ham, he didn't play against Everton

3689~~~
With that attitude, you'd have to consider why Chelsea don't win every game, and we don't beat every single team below us?

3690~~~
Why don't we just forfeit the match? We're <i>obviously</i> going to lose.

3691~~~
He's declared himself fit to go back in time and play West Ham again too, top bloke

3692~~~
Attitude of some of the fans here is horrible.

3693~~~
Amen, where the phuck are the balls!

3694~~~
Wearing a specially designed corset for his rib injury? I thought he was a Basque man.........<ahem>. I'll get my coat. WE need him back regardless.

3695~~~
Don't seen an issue at all. If it means he can play without worrying about his rib then go for it. 

He can probably move OK, but knocks can still be quite sore weeks after, so a bit of protection won't be a bad thing.

3696~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3697~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Very clever!

3698~~~
I like him and think he's a cracking player but he has this ability to be neither far enough back when required defensively nor far enough forward offensively. Having an off game tonight, too.

3699~~~
Having a bit of a mare but he's probably not fit

3700~~~
You can tell he's injured by the lack of slide tackles he's tried tonight. Clearly conscious of the rib being broken. Its arguable that, if the coaching staff knew he wasn't capable of his rull range of motion, they shouldn't have started him.

3701~~~
A bit sloppy today in possession and just looks off the pace along with our other forward players (not named Di Maria). A shame that the injury is probably hampering his performances. Story of our season.

3702~~~
Far from his best as you could expect with lacking game time and probably playing unfit. What bothers me the most is that I expect Fellaini immidiately when the game resumes.

3703~~~
Played like he had a broken rib or something.

3704~~~
Hopefully his injury didn't get worse by playing today. Was clearly not fit, shouldn't have risked him.

3705~~~
Shouldn't have started today probably, clearly backed out of a few challenges and wasn't as energetic as usual because of the rib injury, which to be fair isn't something you can ignore when you tend to get stuck in. Hopefully he'll be 100% for Chelsea as he makes a huge difference, though I hope he plays behind the main striker (falcao alone please, no RvP). His pressing and energy will be vital for that game, especially if we have more defensive solidity in Carrick and Blind behind them.

3706~~~
He better be fit for Chelsea, we're going to need him.

It was almost shocking how average he was today.

3707~~~
It was a bad idea to start him with the niggling rib injury.

3708~~~
Agree, bad idea to have started him.

3709~~~
Really just hope he's fine for the Chelsea match. His grittiness to deal with Fabregas will be mandatory to take anything from the game.

3710~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Man Utd midfielder Herrera to miss Chelsea clash</b></span>

Ander Herrera may be forced out of Manchester United’s clash with <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/english-premier-league/chelsea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chelsea</a> on the weekend.

The 25-year-old was substituted at half-time of the 2-2 draw with West Bromwich at The Hawthorns on Monday night, after feeling pain in his rib.

The midfielder broke his rib against West Ham on 27 September and was initially ruled out for six weeks, but made a speedy recovery aided by the use of a specially designed corset.


Well that backfired.

3711~~~
I was dreading hearing that when he was substituted at half time.

If Carrick was match fit we could have afforded to give the lad the full six weeks to recover, now it may have backfired.

3712~~~
Fergie starting his minds games <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3713~~~
Hopefully Di Maria starts then. We're missing Rooney and Herrera. Carrick has got to start. Carrick and Blind hopefully.

3714~~~
We are going to get fecked on that match.

3715~~~
The diagnosis was six weeks, we should have let him have the rest. We may well lose him for longer now. At least he's the best in training, apparently:

3716~~~
Tribal football isn't it? Let's not get ahead of ourselves, maybe he will play.

3717~~~
He may have had a niggling injury, but I think he was taken off because he clearly wasn't up to speed and Van Gaal thought Fellaini could bring something else to the mix. He kept chatting with him beginning at the 30 minute mark so I think he'd decided on the substitution early on. 

He wasn't THAT bad (I think Van Gaal said it quite well in his post match interview, it was neither good nor bad), but it might have been one of his worst performances for us. I think he'll start against Chelsea though.

3718~~~
Seems that we didn't manage to get him properly healed for the game, bloody shame. Maybe he should've been rested against WBA instead of playing with that stupid corset?

He's been our best player untill that game imo, feels a bit like somebody cut one of our legs off.

3719~~~
So he's deemed fit enough to start last week, then a week later he's not.

Someone's fecked up here.

3720~~~
Big loss for us today. Would have played him instead of Mata if he was fit.

3721~~~
Sounds a bit like that, unless he was injured in training.

3722~~~
Said this last week and think it was noticeable how much more solid we looked with Fellaini playing that role today. He's definitely a better player than Fellaini in either position either advanced or defensively, but his ability to perform a B2B role is hampered by poor game awareness. Would like to see how a Blind-Herrera-Carrick(Fellaini) midfield would look.

3723~~~
I was a bit pissed off that he didn't come in for Fellaini when Mata was subbed off for Wilson, I thought that we lacked creativity through the middle because neither ADM nor Januzaj provided it and we kept crossing but in the end Fellaini helped us get the point and Herrera is rested for City so he can heal properly. Can't complain.

3724~~~
We look so much better with Fellaini in the team . Herrera is not imposing enough yet for big games. Herrera will be a great option when we are at home to Burnley etc ....but there's not a chance that Herrera is getting back into the team ahead of Fellaini in big games for the forseeable future

3725~~~
I doubt that. Fellaini has been good in the last couple of games but Herrera was one of our best players before he got injured. Also Herrera played well against Barcelona a number of times so he certainly doesn't struggle in the big games...

3726~~~
I think it will depend as you say on the type of team. He is now getting chance for his rib to heal properly. He will get plenty of chances.

3727~~~
No way would I judge Herrera on the WBA game, he shouldn't have played that match whatsoever.

3728~~~
How do you come to that stupid conclusion when he hasn't played a big game yet?

3729~~~
Ahead of Mata maybe? And yes he is better then Fellaini, maybe you forget how good he can be defensively. In this game LVG chosed Fellaini because of multiple reasons (they have strength, i think Herrera is not 100% fit,...) but i think he will be in the starting lineup for almost every game when he will be fit.

3730~~~
One off big games? I could definitely see Fellaini being picked for a few depending on whatever way we plan on setting up. I'd be surprised if it's Herrera that gets displaced though.

There's no way Fellaini should be in the team over Herrera generally though, he simply doesn't offer as much.

3731~~~
I want to see him in the number 10 role he's not as silky as Mata but he makes up for it with a superior work ethic.

3732~~~
Would be a good idea vs City actually.

But then can't see it happening if both Rooney and Falcao are back though.

3733~~~
I dont think it will happen for the City game but in the long haul he could be our best option in that role.

3734~~~
Doesn't give enough in terms of Assists/Goals output probably. I'd say he would be a good option there for bigger games though to give more control and defensive protection.

3735~~~
I actually think he has a good eye for the pass and could chip in a few goals hes on equal footing with Mata this season (2 goals, 1 assist) and id like to see him get a chance since Mata completely blew it.

3736~~~
Considering Herrera has yet to play in a traditional big game then how on earth do you come to that conclusion? Herrera has been and is considerably better than Fellaini. Personally, I'd play him ahead of Mata next week, to beef up the midfield.

3737~~~
Kind of like Oscar, would have been ideal today in the role Mata had which was deeper than we have been playing our AM.

3738~~~
Whilst I love the fact that we have three top strikers we must always look to play the most solid side, both on and off the ball. Against City a trio of Fellaini, Blind and Herrera is primed to stand toe to toe with City's midfield. We should be looking to get the best out of the team not pleasing the big names. If they have to compete for two places or one then so be it and whoever loses out should be wary of the door hitting them on the way out. We have a weak defence and we should be looking to play a midfield that shields that defence better and gives us a chance.
Personally I would go with 
--------Blind---Fellaini-----
------------Herrera----------
--Rooney----RVP----ADM--
under no circumstances should we be surrendering the midfield to them nor isolating Blind against Toure and Silva. I know Rooney is not that effective outwide but I think we need Herrera's tenacity in the middle more.

3739~~~
Can't believe I'm saying this but I think Fellaini should keep his spot (at least until Valencia returns), and I think Herrera should now replace Mata.

3740~~~
This, but then I also want Rooney and Falcao in, and then Januzaj I thought did well today and should maybe keep his spot. So really I'm not sure who will miss out. One of the 3 strikers, Mata and Januzaj is my guess.

3741~~~
So is he fit again? I want to see him play against City, i dont care if he displaces Mata or Fellaini, i just love watching him play.

3742~~~
I agree with this. His pressure at number 10 would definitely be useful, and his play going forward has been more ambitious than Mata's this year. With Rooney back though there's no hope I'd have thought.

3743~~~
If Rooney isn’t fit then Herrera should replace Mata, he would work much better in the formation as he is more adept at moving between the number 10 and a more orthodox midfield position and in theory him and Fellaini could then both switch between those roles. I think he could start anyway even if Rooney replaces Mata, wouldn’t be surprised to see him replace Januzaj and play fairly narrow on the right hand side of midfield.

3744~~~
Herrera, Fellaini and blind in the middle with Rooney ahead and Di Maria operating in a free-ish Robben type role from the WC would be interesting to see.

3745~~~
Personally, I'd like to see Hererra and Rooney both start, with Mata and RvP on the bench.

Won't happen though. More's the pity.

3746~~~
No way he can drop RvP now. The real question is whether he'll play Rooney and Falcao alongside him, which I believe would be a mistake, because although they've looked good together, it really fecks us over defensively.

I expect we'll see pretty much the same team as Monday only Rooney in for Mata.

3747~~~
Yeah, we let in two silly goals against West Brom but generally the defending in our last two games has been dramatically improved compared to the previous games. You can't ignore the fact that this coincides with Falcao and Rooney both being unavailable for selection. Playing a lone striker against Chelsea and matching them up in midfield must have been a big factor in us dominating posession and conceding relatively few chances.

It concerns me slightly that Van Gaal has stumbled into a solution to our defensive woes, rather than proactively addressing it by having the cojones to leave one or two of his three big name strikers on the bench. He has a reputation for not caring about egos and making tough decisions, so I'd like to see some evidence of this. If he reverts to playing all three of them against City and they steamroll us in midfield it really will be a crushing disappointment. Almost enough for me to bump that "false dawn" thread again...

3748~~~
Ye that is what I am expecting - although plenty of time for half of our team to get injured between now and then <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

I was suprised that Herrera didnt come in from the bench when we were chasing the game last Sunday though.

3749~~~
It’s a good point, for all the talk about how great our attack is I actually think we can only play 2 of them and trying to shoe horn anymore than that in only weakens our midfield and defence, I was initially under the impression LVG was trying out 3 of them in the team to see if he could make it work and he would eventually revert back to playing with just one up front but we won’t really know until everyone is fit. Mata has played his way out of the team I assume, RVP and Rooney both seem certain starters so will he leave Falcao out, drop RVP or play them all if they are fit, will be interesting to see.

For me Herrera, Di Maria, Blind and based on his most recent showings Fellaini have arguably turned the midfield into the strongest area of the team (still work to do there of course), when you factor in Carrick and Januzaj we now have great options and can compete with any team in the division. When you factor in our short comings in defence I don’t think the big names up front have so far justified their inclusion and in all honesty I don’t think they will, because despite all being very talented they are a bit too similar and one paced. At this moment in time I see more benefit to starting the extra man in midfield rather than an extra striker and I think it would make us a better team going forward as well as defensively.

3750~~~
No chance in hell LVG will start with Rooney, Falcao and RVP. I reckon it will be the same team as vs Chelsea with maybe (just maybe) Falcao instead of RVP, although I doubt that and Rooney instead of Mata.
I certainly hope we wont start with all 3 strikers. 
Fellaini and Blind starting with Herrera coming of the bench I think.

3751~~~
Is he fit to play this weekend? Nobody asked Van Gaal this question today.. I missed LVG's press conference last weekend,so don't know if he has recovered after West Brom..

3752~~~
Fellaini is good when he has a job to do like mark someone out of the game, Fabregas and Toure this weekend or needs to be a target man. Herrera will come when no one needs marking and we're playing fluid football. IMO Herrera would suit the 4231 version of 433 as an interchangeable holding CM. Where both CM can dictate play, dropping deep to collect the ball between the CB's (as he played in the 352 formation) ala Carrick and Scholes. I'd like to see him paired in a CM duo with Carrick or Blind (and if we get him Strootman) with Rooney ahead of them, 2 Winger and a Striker. This is the formation we will settle into, it may not start against Man City but will in the coming games.

3753~~~
--------Blind--------
---Fellaini-Herrera-
----Rooney---------
-------------Di Maria
------Van Persie---

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3754~~~
We need him back asap. Without him, we dont create enough chances. We play different with him in the team, especially now against Palace, we need players to open them up. Hope LvG finds a place for him in the next game.

3755~~~
This.

3756~~~
Would much rather him on the right of the 4-1-4-1 than Januzaj at the moment.

3757~~~
I concur. I think a midfield 3 of Blind, Herrera and Fellaini would dominate most games.

3758~~~
Was expecting him to start today. Is he still injured?

3759~~~
I miss him very much. Our attacking tempo is far too slow without him, only Di Maria seeks to play with the ball at a pace as quick as Ander.

3760~~~
Should be fit to start against Palace, hope he wipes the floor with them. I reckon we'll go back to the diamond then

3761~~~
I'd rather:

3762~~~
Yeah, that's my ideal formation also. Januzaj replacing Fellaini against the minnows/lesser physical teams, and Rooney doing all the dirty work for Falcao to leave him in all the vacated forward positions. Di Maria playing more central, moving from in to out. I really hope we see it at some point.

3763~~~
So has he just lost his place or is LvG trying to give him until after the International break to fully recover?

3764~~~
I think he's just lost his place.

3765~~~
yes he lost his place. Van Gaal said in the pre match interview that he had decisions to make, not just Rooney in for Mata, but also Herrera or Fellaini and he chose Fellaini. He wouldnt be on the bench if he wasnt fit, thats his 2nd game in a row now. I am a bit disappointed and annoyed by the lack of his playing time.

3766~~~
Please get him back in the team ASAP. He was brilliant up until the injury, and is a vastly superior to Fellaini.

3767~~~
Bit of both. No way was he fully fit against West Brom and just played really poorly and his injury clearly affected him. Doubt he was fully fit the week after, but with Fellaini's sub appearance being so good, and then doing well vs Chelsea I think he just won the spot for this game. Reckon Herrera will come back in next week as we're home against a smaller team, so I think we might go back to the diamond.

3768~~~
I hope you're right, he started really well for us and I'd hate to see him marginalized as being too lightweight.

3769~~~
He really should start vs Palace.

3770~~~
I hope he comes in for Fellaini and we play ADM also in midfield again.

--------Blind-----------
Herrera-------ADM

3771~~~
Yeah I agree with this, We cannot waste Di Maria out wide any longer, And while I believe Fellaini has been very good the last 3 games, Now we are against teams in which we can take the game to them and not vice versa, Therefore Fellaini won't be needed as much

3772~~~
Let's hope LVG sees it like that as well. Now we need Herrera's creativity and drive and not Fellaini hussling other key players. ADM coming from deep and be a bit more central hopefully brings out the best of him again

3773~~~
He was absolute dog shit against Wes Brom but most of us put this down to his ribs bothering him. I did anyway.

However, it's possible that Van Gaal was assured (by the player and our medical staff) that he was absolutely 100% going into that game. If so, you can see why the manager might be reluctant to start him again. Was a really woeful 45 minutes of football.

3774~~~
I think his rib was nearly ready, but they put that corset on him which actually irritated the injury. He was great against QPR, Leicester ( except for the fact he and the rest of them lost focus) and West Ham until he had to go off. He won't be the first player to say he is ready to play when maybe he wasn't entirely. Those three games we were great as an attacking force. However we do need a Strootman type player in there as well.

3775~~~
People have been saying that his best games for Bilbao were against the big teams, Barca etc. What position did he play in those games? Surely you would have to be capable of looking after yourself in those games?

3776~~~
None of us have any idea what state his rib was going into that game, apart from Louis Van Gaal and Ander Hererra.

3777~~~
He was really poor against WBA because of his injury. But he's a dynamic midfielder, someone who follow the attack, and he links well the defense with the attack. Hoppefully he will be back against Palace at home in a more attacking game.

3778~~~
We don't, but tbh I thought bringing him back against WBA was a bit soon. Maybe if he has said he was fit and actually aggravated it has put his recovery back. I know he has been on the bench, but we aren't overloaded with options for the bench, apart from kids. I wouldn't want too many kids against Chelsea or City. We will have to wait to see if we are going to go more attacking against Palace and I actually think Herrera's game will suit the Arsenal game rather than Fellaini.

3779~~~
I think <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> is right that Van Gaal was probably told by the player/staff that Herrera was capable of playing, only to be rewarded with a very bad showing at West Brom. Lets face it, the original diagnosis was six weeks out. To play two weeks later was a bit crazy. Herrera didn't put in a single slide tackle at West Brom, and he loves a tackle. Clearly, he didn't want to stretch his midsection and was playing within himself. I respect him for breaking his rib in the first half at West Brom and playing on. However, we should only bring him back if he can give 100 per cent. Another half arsed performance won't help us.

3780~~~
its amazing to think how many fans feel he's should be playing 2 weeks after a cracked rib

3781~~~
I think 2 weeks was a risk that backfired. Hopefully his rib is fully repaired and he can get back to playing.

3782~~~
If he's not fit then why's he on the bench?

3783~~~
he's probably partially fit and would get chucked on in a disaster. we've had players on the bench before who clearly aren't/weren't fit

surely common sense would say that a cracked rib wont fully be ok in less than 4 weeks.

3784~~~
We've even had players starting when they're not fit.

3785~~~
I really hope thats the case tbh, and he hasn't just been dropped for Fellaini. That would be a horrible thought.

3786~~~
Herrera being one of them!

it just goes to show how desperate we are for a properly balanced squad

3787~~~
That would be close to my perfect team. Just one change..rather than Rooney behind Falcao, I would play Mata behind Rooney. All you need to watch is Mata playing behind Drogba to see what he is capable off. Playing him deeper or wider is not effective as we've seen it.

We know what Rooney is capable of if asked to be disciplined upfront. For all his work rate he is not a pure playmaker and by letting him assume that role, we are only wasting a goal machine Rooney.

3788~~~
The midfield has looked more solid with Fellaini in there but it is not 100% due to Herrera's absence. Di Maria moving out wide has made the midfield more compact too.

I miss Herrera and would have him in the side again once he is fully fit.

3789~~~

3790~~~
Does the tweet say anything about his availability?  Can't read at work.

3791~~~
Fellaini hasn't been bad when called upon at all. Cracked ribs certainly hinder movement, something that is rather integral in midfield, if not everywhere on the football pitch. I don't think he should have even been on the bench..let him recover totally. He's a great player and great signing certainly one with a very positive pro-team attitude.

3792~~~
I'd be interested to see him in a midfield <i>with </i>Fellaini personally. But with Rooney in there or Di Maria moving back in it seems it is one or the other.

3793~~~
Missing him so much.

3794~~~
Him and Rooney would be a very interesting pair. Either they would be absolute garbage for being too similar or they'd be absolutely brilliant. Both has the energy and aggressiveness to make life difficult for the opponents in those areas.

3795~~~
I still don't think Rooney can do well in midfield. He's just too rigid when playing that role and doesn't have the mentality of a midfield at all. He clearly shows his limitations in midfield given how often he goes for a diagonal pass to the right and doesn't have the vision in midfield to spot other passes. He also doesn't have the close control to maintain possession whilst under pressure, something that even Mata has even if he isn't that good of a midfielder.

I believe Herrera and Fellaini will be a good partnership because Fellaini can play his game whilst Herrera's discipline and intelligence means that we won't be too open in midfield and still maintain aggression in it. We've badly missed someone who can dictate play from midfield, and Herrera is the missing piece of the puzzle. Against West Brom, Mata played as the dictator whilst Herrera played higher up the pitch. Since then, we haven't had a midfield dictator in our team. For this reason, regardless of how we set up, I really wish that Herrera returns.

3796~~~
Just give him a call mate, or send some flowers. I'm sure he'll come round and take you back.

<span style="color: #ffffff">we do miss him much</span>

3797~~~
Well it could be awkward because I have already cooked Spanish for Juan.

3798~~~
Since he seems to run out of steam more often, I'd like to see Di Maria runs havoc in attack, (almost) completely free of defensive duty.

I think that formation will also give more freedom to Herrera to join attack, and Carrick does less leg work but more playmaking. On paper, that team look much better than Arsenal. Feck me, with better CBs, that team could compete with the bests out there.

3799~~~
Its amazing to think players expect to get paid regardless of not actually doing any work for it cough cough Ando..so it works both ways <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3800~~~
Are you insinuating that Herrera is not working for his pay?

3801~~~
How is that even related to Herrera?

I always find people moaning about players pay hilarious. The club decides that, yet people cry like it's their money.

3802~~~
Well, obviously it is their money. Higher transfer fees, higher wages means higher merchandise and ticket prices.

3803~~~
Only if they are local Smashed. Also tickets and merchandise is probably (I'm assuming) a pittance compared to sponsorship etc. The TV deals and the like are what cause the wage hikes. Not merchandise and ticket prices.

Also nobody forced the club to give Anderson that contract. Criticizing him for something every one of us would do is hypocritical.

3804~~~
Also it's human nature to resent people being overpaid, it doesn't matter whether it affects them directly or not. It offends people's sense of fairness and propriety.

3805~~~
I don't even get his point. Many people get paid when they're off work sick or injured.

3806~~~
I actually miss him in our side. He just brings something different to Blind, Fellaini and Mata. Lovely little fella.

3807~~~
Non-local fans can't buy club merchandise ?

3808~~~
Read the overall post please.

3809~~~
Reread it. Once was enough to be fair though. In 2015 match-day, merchandise and apparel related revenue accounts will account for :

Gate and receipts : £110 million.
Adidas : £80 million.
Chevrolet : £45 million.
Aon : est £5-10 million (distribution between training gear and the Carrington sponsorship is a bit fuzzy).

Lower conservative est. : £240 million. Other sponsorship deals not included.

Dunno how more than half of United's total revenue (United's broadcast revenue in comparison is projected to be about £120 million in 2015 provided we qualify European football) doesn't concern the average supporter through the trickle down effect.. These companies are paying ridiculous amounts in terms of sponsoring United related gear and products with the primary purpose of enhancing their brand and attracting more consumers on a global level.

3810~~~
I would like to see Blind - Herrera - Fellaini as a midfield trio. Good balance, physicality, technique etc

3811~~~
If he's fit then I'm disappointed he isn't playing. Against City I'd hoped we'd see Blind, Herrera, Di Maria + Carrick/Fellaini.

LvG went what looked on paper like a bolder route, adding Januzaj instead, perhaps because Rooney/RvP as a forward partnership has never looked quite as good as it should. But personally, I'd sooner have seen a midfield diamond and Herrera on the field, if he was fully fit, and I would have hoped to get the drive and creative energy that way.

Anyway, get well soon, Ander. And see you soon, I hope.

3812~~~
I like the Ander, Blind, Di Maria midfield 3. Think weve missed it in recent games it was starting to look good until Herrera's injury

3813~~~
is he fit again? any news?

3814~~~
Well he trained today. Don't know anything after that.

3815~~~
Call me blind but i cant see what herrera brings to the team yet.  I dont think he has properly settled and feel like his role in the team will be different to the role he plays when 3 years down the line when he settles.

3816~~~
Nice try, but with a post like that you're no Blind. A Cleverley or Gibson tops.

3817~~~
... What?

3818~~~
Blind is not the description I am thinking of.

3819~~~
We're much better going forward with him in the side. He is very good on the ball and is great in those tight areas.

Di Maria seemed to play a lot better with him in the side too.

If we're playing the diamond, he has to play. It's not the same without him. Some will think that's an exaggeration, but I think Di Maria's existence has distorted the reality more than anything.

3820~~~
I'd prefer to see him in tbh. Think he brings others in very well. I'm not a big fan of the way in recent games we've been looking to push on an extra midfielder early in moves I think it's hurting our build up. In that capacity Fellaini does have an edge over him due to his physique but playing a primarily more supportive role I think Herrera offers us a lot.

3821~~~
I am a big fan and I want to see him play every game, but we have to be honest and admit that the big hairy guy played him way in the team fair and square and deserves to start at this time.

3822~~~
We finally sign a box to box midfielder who can create and score from central areas as well as defend and we put him on the bench.

Ridiculous.

3823~~~
Baffling logic to bench our best central midfielder.

3824~~~
He better be recovering from his injury otherwise it's ridiculous that he's not playing. One of our best players before he got injured and unlike Fellaini, he actually offers some creativity.

3825~~~
Can he control it on the chest ?

3826~~~
But Herrera still played better than him whenever he played.

3827~~~
Oh no, a few 7/10 performances and Fellaini is the man. The man.

3828~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's not quite at Fellaini's level in that aspect, I have to admit.

3829~~~
As far as I'm concerned, the debate is closed then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3830~~~
He better still be recovering.

3831~~~
Fellaini played against Chelsea and City, and scored off the bench against West Brom where Herrera was mediocre.
In contrast - Herrera was in the Leicester capitulation, though he scored, and played well against QPR, as did everyone - QPR are woeful.
The rest was good. Nothing more or less really, and given the quality of opposition they've faced, Fellaini's done no worse.

3832~~~
Can't understand why he isn't playing. He was brilliant in every game ba the last game he played, when he was clearly injured.

3833~~~
Maybe herrera isn't quite ready but LVG still wanted him on the bench? Hardly matters. Most important things the win

3834~~~
If we're desperate to play 4-3-3, I'd take Januzaj off, play Rooney up front/out wide, and bring Herrera in centre midfield.

3835~~~
So ?? How is that his fault ?? By that logic, we drew 2 and lost 1 with Fellaini starting, so he has been worse by that reasoning. The opposition should not matter, you beat what is in front of you.

I don't have a problem with Fellaini starting, but this reasoning of yours is ridiculous.

3836~~~
Fair enough. Take that Leicester part out if you want, and there's nothing else ridiculous within my post.
The opposition <i>does </i>matter when comparing a selection of about three or four games. Quite clearly it does.

Fellaini's been as good, in my opinion. And I like Herrera.

3837~~~
He needs to come on for one of the CM's. Quicken us up.

3838~~~
needs to come in.

3839~~~
Fellaini played against Chelsea and City and we got one point in those two games where he put in 7/10 performances afaic. Herrera was there in the Leicester game but so was everyone else (which you obviously pointed out for the QPR game while conveniently forgot to mention here). Herrera has been brilliant for us so far except for the West Brom game where he was quite clearly struggling from his injury.

So far, Fellaini has been pretty useless in the Crystal Palace game. Not creating anything and his passing has ranged between poor and mediocre. So all this talk of how Herrera faced poor opposition and thus his performances were good will be put to test today during the second half where Fellaini will have to improve a lot to put in a performance comparable to Herrera's.

3840~~~
I don't think the midfield is the problem. Front line has done nothing.

3841~~~
Well, it's easy to point out today's first half. That performance hadn't been played at the point of our discussion. 
We'll have to disagree. Herrera hasn't been brilliant, in my opinion.

But I like him a lot, and think  he can be in the future.

3842~~~
He might get sucked into things and rush passes/kick it clear under little pressure, but when we have possession like this we need players with the balls to carry it forward and force it. Rooney and Fellaini aren't doing it. Januzaj and Di Maria are playing as bad as they can and at either side of that you've got Carrick and van Persie who can't do a great deal more.

3843~~~
It's not a debate to win or lose. Just talking about how it's easy to say Herrera was playing against easier opposition but fact remains that he did very well in those matches and Fellaini had the same opportunity and was bang average throughout.

3844~~~
Herrera not allowed?

Cant get in the team ahead of Fellaini <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3845~~~
He mustn't be completely fit. He's someone who simply has to start.

3846~~~
The ball was moving in slow motion without him.

3847~~~
The lack of Herrera in our side is baffling.

3848~~~
fecking frustrating that he's not playing.

3849~~~
Hererra would add so much to our pedestrian style. Bemusing to see him marginalised.

3850~~~
If we still insist on playing that shit 4141 then atleast put him alongside Fellaini and move Rooney up top if we're insisting so much on playing Rooney ahead of RVP.

3851~~~
He obviously isn't fit to play, there is no other explanation.

3852~~~
Does Van Gaal have a daughter?

3853~~~
The less he plays the better he gets. He'll be up to the Zidane level if he doesn't play in the next couple.

3854~~~
Surely he would have come on if we hadn't scored.

Assuming he's fit I'd like to see him back in the starting line-up, but I doubt he will be against Arsenal. I expect he'll replace Fellaini against Hull.

3855~~~
Yeah ok.

3856~~~
He must be injured. No other reason why he didn't come on after that turd.

3857~~~
Apart from his last game from us he was very good so far.

3858~~~
Less Fellaini more Herrera please. Put Ander, Mata and Di Maria centrally and we will be fine.

3859~~~
And the more Fellaini plays and does nothing, the more he valiantly battled his way through, executing any evidence of Herrera being positive for the side.

3860~~~
Eh?

3861~~~
I genuinely miss him. He was growing to be my favourite player in this team.

3862~~~
He's the new Kagawa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3863~~~
You're having a mare here. If you couldn't see he had a very good start to the season, then you're blind. Up until the West Brom game he was doing really well.

3864~~~
Van Gaal obviously doesn't agree with you. He wasn't a Van Gaal signing of course.

3865~~~
You're attention seeking here.

3866~~~
Except that pretty much everyone except you thinks he was one of our best players whenever he played(apart from the last game when he played injured). You're like anti MadWinger.

3867~~~
Van Gaal played him in every game up until his injury.

3868~~~
We need him back, look clueless and laboured without him. Hopefully he gets a start after the international break.

3869~~~
He will probably start against Arsenal

3870~~~
Really hope so. They're not a physical side at all, so the 'need' for Fellaini is lessened very much. Get him and Di Maria playing the ball at as high a pace as we can, and pray (if he's playing) van Persie shows up for a chance or two.

3871~~~
Has to be. Cannot fathom why van Gaal wouldn't want to use him. He brings so much energy to the team and was arguably our best player before getting injured.

3872~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3873~~~
Hopefully he is up and running for after the break, we need him back.

3874~~~
Very bad taste, mate.

Herrera is among the best midfielders we have and he deserves to play when possible.

3875~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the sheer ridiculousness of this post. He's shown more than Kagawa did already in his short spell here.

3876~~~
He had more good games in 2 months than Kagawa in 2 years.

3877~~~
I like him a load. Thought the choice not to play him today was the right one though: against massive cloggers like Palace he'd just get bullied until he beds into the league more, it's happened in earlier games. Fellaini suits thosesort of games much more. Imagine we'll be seeing Herrera vs l'Arse.

3878~~~
I think that is the sort of game that will suit Ander. Also he will have had two more weeks recuperation. Hopefully we will have some actual defenders back by then as well.

3879~~~
We could have used his ability to shift the gears in midfield today when we tried to break on Palace.

3880~~~
Van Gaal must be daily blind that he doesn't see on the training ground what Ander brings to our play... Carricks back and here we go we wittnessed the best of Zombie performances...

3881~~~
looks like his four bad passes against chelsea came really costly for him.. Its absolute BS decision not to play him...

3882~~~
We have been crying out for Michael to come back, yet seem to have erased from our memories all the criticism he got for slowing the game down and not creating anything. All that time out has clouded out judgement maybe. He has only just come back though. However he has been part of all those awful midfields we have had since Ronaldo and Hargreaves went. Since his injury he has morphed into this midfield messiah.

3883~~~
Didn't think Ander came on against Chelsea.

3884~~~
or was it against west brom? nevermind the match..

3885~~~
Clearly LvG hates this lad.Seriously cant understand why hes not starting or why he isnt coming off the bench even for five minutes!

3886~~~
Yes, he played the first half against WBA in the bloody corset. It was obviously too early and if LVG is holding that performance against the lad, I am not impressed.

3887~~~
He needs to be the 3rd name on the starting 11 behind DDG and Di Maria! Needs to play whenever fit! We look so much more mobile with him.

3888~~~
He might think he is lightweight at the moment, and not defensively disciplined. If we had anywhere near a decent defence it wouldn't matter. That isn't Anders fault.

3889~~~
Probably because he is still recovering from broken ribs? Will now get the entire international break to recover along with our other defenders. Hopefully we can them all back for the next match away against the gooners.

3890~~~
I like him but he was for me always as squad player we should never count on him as our 1st midfielder... scholes talent and level is obviously hard to replace but our midfield was by far the worst from top6 teams. Carrick figured there a lot.. He is so immobile that it pains me.. certainly has got good pass in him but he is not the level of a palyer that manchester united the biggest club in the world should aspire to be its first midfield option. I am beeing maybe too harsh on him as he came back.. but so what he is 34 and yet some people see him as you mention as another messiah which is ridiculous.. Blind is good squad player and yet here almost called new Modric.. We certainly need a better defensive midfielder/playmaker. Hope we try to snatch Schneiderlin last think to I want to see is Carrick making 15 fecking touches to finally play the ball and being scared to death when some player presses him unable to make space for him as he always stands on the ball. Anderson was bloody fantastic compared to carras as he always moved with the ball. Blind is decent contructive player has a good spin on him but still not the class we should aspire. He plays too many celverleyesque balls and doesn't provide any significant shield on defense.. his passing doesnt make up for it and its overrated.. I am being really harsh but I am right, right?

3891~~~
Nobody has to get a guaranteed place, if di Maria continues this poor form, eventually he needs to be benched. The only one who has been solid all season is DDG.

3892~~~
RVP has, a bit of nepotism there.

3893~~~
Di Maria won't be benched, he is just in bad form and playing out of position, but at least he still wins a corner or gets past players at times (admittedly sadly not enough). God help us if we have to bench him! Something is really really wrong with us if we can't get the best out of him.

3894~~~
You dont know how fast it can go, Mata was world/top class for two consecutive seasons, then benched at Chelsea and later on benched at United, if you dont perform you need to be benched eventually. It's now to early to bench him, bit if he continues this form till lets say Christmas, the bench will have to be his destination. You cant let players disorder the balance in the team just because of the name they carry or their pricetag, di Maria hasnt done anything right in his last 4 games, that's just unacceptable.

3895~~~
Can't wait for Ander to come back to the side. Hopefully his ribs is fully healed and he can contribute again

3896~~~
Carrick was excellent today. Big part of why we didn't concede. For me, Fellaini's is the spot that Herrera has to target. Hopefully with some proper defenders in the team and Carrick in front we wont need to use Fellaini's physicality and Herrera comes back in.

3897~~~
I'd have thought he is sitting out as long as possible to get over the injury. Of course, the situation does offer another stick to beat Fellaini with though.

3898~~~
I think LvG should be going for horses for courses in these situations. Fellaini is great against the City/Chelsea big midfielders where we can be easily bullied. Until we get a top class defence that will always happen. I would even play him against dirty scumbags like Stoke. However today and the likes of Arsenal that physicality isn't needed and is actually affecting the attacking side of our game as the ball isn't getting moved from the back to front quickly enough.

3899~~~
Kinda harsh, RVP wasn't fit at the start and Falcao hasn't had the chance and just when the team was scoring for all angels our defense gets fecked over by injuries making everyone sit deep as seen today, resulting our best attack and creative players being played out of position = no supply.  Playing against teams parking the bus doesn't help either.

3900~~~
Defo, unless he bulks up like the hulk or puts on a bog brush it ain't happening. I don't quite understand why though, we can say that we lack presence in midfield and that's why Fellaini is playing. I can't help but think all of Herrera ability shouldn't solely be replaceable just for the sake of presence, that kind of means that our set up is lacking.

3901~~~
In a way you wouldn't complain if it was a Viera/ Matic/ Toure/Keane type but it isn't, it's Fellaini who for all his presence and height offers nowhere near what Herrera does. I think if he can get that presence into the defence, Herrera will get his games. The defence is that soft he needs to but the physicality into the midfield.

3902~~~
Despite being a brilliant player all round - Herrara looks physically considerably off the pace in this league and I think he will need a year or two before he will be ready for the first team. We were getting absolutely murdered in midfield and defense when Herrera was in the team despite Herrera chipping in with a goal or two. Midfield and defense has been more solid with Fellaini in the team and there's no way I'd drop Fellaini for Herrera for the foreseeable future even though Fellaini is not the perfect player for the role either but with defending set pieces Fellaini is a huge asset to have and his all round play has been decent

3903~~~
Fellaini is not good as deep CM and because of his positional sense i wouldn't trust him as a defender, his only use is behind the striker. The issue i am also having with Fellaini's use upfront is that for all his use closer to goal we reaped 1 goal from and an arguable assist, other than that we have not scored a heading goal since his inclusion, the only 1 can remember this season was RVP (correct me if i'm wrong) where Falcao crossed the ball early. Its as though now every time we move forward with ball we slow down our attack waiting for Fellaini to get into the box and get on the end of crosses. This is the wrong way to go about it. Over the years we have had various strikers upfront and Rooney getting on the end of crosses that shouldn't change. The reason we was successful over that period was because we had the best passer of the ball in midfield Paul Scholes who moved the ball forward quickly to the wingers. Next to him sat a intelligent Carrick. This does not need to change, we have all the players (except another top winger and a CM) we need to continue on past success with the added dutch philosophical approach LVG can bring. We need to go back to basics. 4231.

Don't get me wrong we still need at least 2 players to get the best out of the bunch, Strootman (Carrick) and Cuadrado (winger) would be my choice of players. If things don't go to plan we can switch the wingers from wide wingers to inside wingers. Rooney and Falcao/RVP is more than enough presence in the box.

3904~~~
I think we need to live with Herrera's weaknesses and let him mature with the squad.  I hope it's sunk in for a lot of people today that he is the hub of our counterattack and when he is not in the game we are playing the same zombie shit that we've been having to stand watching for the past few years.  Carrick, as usual, was excellent defensively but our forward game comes to a literal halt when he's at the controls.

Herrera brings the right kind of energy to our game for Di Maria, Mata, and Rooney to be productive.

3905~~~
You would think he should be playing over the Christmas period. If ADM is struggling a bit now, goodness knows what he will be like when he realises he isn't getting Christmas off.

3906~~~
Is my feeling too. 

At the end of the day he had a cracked/bruised rib, regardless of the medication that can be very painful coming back from. I think its more a case of easing him back than throwing him back in - with our injury record we probably have to be more careful than before. I mean his performances before injury, for me, made him our best performer. Would be shocked if LvG dropped him for Fellaini.

3907~~~
He's been absolutely lightweight in some games. He's really struggled with the physical nature of the prem. That's not to say he doesn't like a tackle but needs to work out how's he's going to cope. Fellaini clear technically isn't even close but we've seen already the benefits of a bit of balls in the matches...

3908~~~
I really hope the reason for his absence is down to the rib injury. There is no other logical explanation for it.

Our attacking play was significantly better with him. Some say he wasn't THAT impressive which might be true, but he brought everyone into the game with his quick incisive passing, our pressing further up the pitch was a lot better too.

Fellaini is a good option when you might be on the back foot vs Chelsea or City, but I want to see our better passers like Mata and Herrera against shithouses like Palace.

3909~~~
He was one of our best performers before his injury so I don't know where you're getting that he 'really struggled'. There was no need to play Felllaini today as Palace were always going to set up defensively therefore a player who can actually create things would be useful. I do accept that Fellaini can do a 'job' in certain games but today wasn't one of them.

3910~~~
If I were manager I'd revert to the diamond and put either Herrera or Di Maria in the #10 spot. We're getting nothing from out wide and haven't for awhile, at least this way our influential players our on the pitch and playing in their natural positions.

I'll get flamed for this, but Januzaj hasn't justified his selection and if anyone should be dropped to accommodate Herrera it should be him and not Fellaini.

3911~~~
He'll get plenty games. One time it was Januzaj, then Mata and now it's Herrera, be patient people - they can't all play at the same time. We are trying to be a bit solid in midfield  due to our defensive problems, he'll be a mainstay in the team - we just need a little different something now to steady that ship.

3912~~~
Maybe we just thought we'd be on the safe side with his ribs and capitalise on Fellaini's form. Hopefully he'll come back for the Arsenal game after the break ready to go.

3913~~~
Very disappointing to see him out of the team after a very good start to the season, hopefully it's fitness issues and not van Gaal not wanting him in the first team for some reason.

3914~~~
It seems fairly obvious to me hat perhaps this was the first game where Herrera woudve been fit enough to play, as we were at home to probably the worst team in the league (missing their two best players) LVG thought we could risk giving him another weeks rest.

Our starting XI should always consist of Herrera, Blind and Di Maria in midfield. Carrick proved yesterday that for all his neatness he has completely lost any creative or attacking spark, it was the first game this season where we have seen Zombie passing of old. He should be reserved as an impact sub to see games out.

3915~~~
I suspect ribs is a pretty dificult injury to get over as you are constantly bending and twisting. Hope to see him back in the team ASAP.

3916~~~
People are saying about the fact he needs to bulk up a bit to be able to survive the rigours of the PL. Do we know if the club are doing this? You would hope they have realised this. From what I gather Gary Pallister was scrawny when he joined United, for a CB that isn't great. They bulked him up. Ander doesn't need it to that extent. Without seeing him with no shirt on we don't know how he is muscular wise.

3917~~~
Why does he <i>need</i> to bulk up? He takes care of himself pretty well whenever I've seen him, has a bit of a nasty streak in him. Scholes wasn't built like a tank, and Silva looks like a gust of wind might knock him over.

It actually seems to be detrimental to players like him, who are pretty agile and fairly quick. Hernandez turned to shit after he 'bulked up' and Nani has looked noticeably bigger since 11/12. Hasn't helped him.

3918~~~
That isn't my suggestion, I like him as he is, but I am a woman. It might be they think he gets knocked off the ball. That could be more having to learn to look after himself not needing to bulk up. I like it that he has that nasty streak as well.

3919~~~
No it shouldn't. That would get dominated by good sides, it is too lightweight.

3920~~~
I actually think Tom Cleverley's form suffered after he bulked up. It's a pity we don't encourage skill in this league rather than physicality.

3921~~~
Bulking up for the sake of it is pointless, look at David Silva, he ain't a strong guy but he plays a very clever type of football.

3922~~~
Then they need some muscle in there, that is the only thing Fellaini is useful for as it sure as hell isn't his creative play, but I want those players playing and not ruining their form by turning them into brick outhouses.

3923~~~
It was probably a shock to Silva when he first arrived. Ander will have to learn to be a bit canny and anticipate when he is going to get clobbered.

3924~~~
And it lacks discipline. 
You'd find so many occasions where Herrera and Di Maria struggle to contain there urge to move about and float about, leaving Blind isolated and the defence open to counters.

It may be okay for games against 'weaker' sides like yesterday at Old Trafford. But it's not a long term midfield at all. Especially if we're playing in Europe any time soon.

3925~~~
Of course, I'm sure he trained harder and gained more strength since his arrival. I just meant that he still looks like a player who uses more his brain than his muscles (I know it's an exaggeration). Modric wasn't a physical beast either. Herrera will be fine.

3926~~~
He brings balance, which is crucial. It isn't his job to be the main creative outlet.

3927~~~
I'm sorry, but stuff like this drives me crazy. It's the Rob Ford style of posting. Taking something that has rarely, if ever, been said by anyone, and posting it is a fact. As for the last bolded sentence, I'm assuming that 'carras' is meant to be 'Carrick'. Yet, if that is whom you are referring to, then it's one of the most ridiculous things I've read.

3928~~~
Herrera's only bad performance was a game in which he played with a broken fecking rib. Should be starting as far as I'm concerned.

3929~~~
The that is the problem, not so much Di Maria and Herrera that Blind maybe needs another body beside him. I would play with one up front and pack the midfield until he can sign some decent injury free defenders. If that isn't done in January, then the problem won't go away.

3930~~~
Was he on the bench yesterday?

3931~~~
That's fine, but I don't want it to be him or Herrera. We need his energy and creativity as well as Fellaini's strength. Some like him should be able to partner Blind, but not sure he can.

3932~~~
Modric is significantly smaller, so has a lower center of gravity. Plus Modric legs are massive, you cant just push him away easily. His balance is fantastic too. You dont need a lot of msucles if you have the other things, but Ander has none of them.

3933~~~
Yep, yet again. If we had scored a few goals early he might have got on. That has been the problem. They have not been comfortable enough in games to ease Ander back in.

3934~~~
I'd like to see Hererra playing as the furthest forward of a midfield three against Arsenal. With Rooney up top and Blind/Carrick the other two in central midfield. We would boss the centre of the pitch, all day long.

Never going to happen but a guy can dream...

3935~~~
I want Herrera, Fellaini and Blind. But that would involve doing something with Rooney that isn't going to happen.

3936~~~
What? I would play Rooney up top on his own, all these people who say he can play in midfield are nuts. Would LvG drop RVP probably not, he has a blind spot there.

3937~~~
Yeah I'd have Rooney take RvP's spot but it isn't going to happen. LvG seems pretty determined to play Rooney in midfield and play RvP no matter what.

3938~~~
If Rooney was scoring goals Rvp could get away with his performances as he would be contributing and vice versa. Unfortunately neither have been great and we cannot afford to shoehorn them both into the side.

3939~~~
If United get back into Europe next season the constant worrying about 'this player' or 'that player' getting into the team goes away.

After yesterdays game, you'd have thought Mata had been on the bench all season with the media's questions to LVG.

Mata(7), Rooney(8), Herrera(5) have all played enough games between them, some more than other due injuries and suspensions.

Herrera fractured his ribs not long ago so it is sensible to ease him back into the team.

3940~~~
Hope he plays instead of Adnan against Arsenal on the right of a diamond, the quality into the forwards whoever it is needs to be much better.

3941~~~
Not being in any form of european competition has made it difficult this season to give players games. The don't care attitude of some ex players against MK Dons also robbed LvG of giving players games in the Capital One Cup. We could do with a good run in the F.A. Cup.

3942~~~
Why would it? What's the alternative?

3943~~~
He's a good player with qualities but I'm yet to be convinced. I think our desperate nature of getting midfielders in means anything was an upgrade on what was here. I'm not convinced he was LVG signing, think this deal was done before he got here. I've seen him get overrun physically in midfield and only response is to foul players. He could have been set off on numerous occasions with multiply continuous fouls in games.
That's not to say he's not got qualities but LVG said it in an interview that he realised that he had to change his approach about the lack of physicality in midfield. I predict that he may not be here next season, in the same way Kagawa struggled. It's this that's open the door for Fellaini, but ideally when need to find a player that has both attributes. Problem is the best modern player that offers both is wearing a city shirt.

3944~~~
I find it quite funny that Ander has lost all his grittiness, love for a challenge, and general aggression since "physical presence" Fellaini has come into the side. He doesn't need to bulk up, he's just as good defensively as Fellaini. And am I really the only one who doesn't buy the fact that we 'look stronger defensively' without Ander? We look just as much of a bag of nerves at the back, it's just the other teams haven't created as much.

3945~~~
Nothing to do with his physicality imo, they just wanna make sure his rib is 100%. He's a tenacious player who isn't afraid of putting his foot in so he's clearly not bothered about the physical side of the game.

3946~~~
I agree, he is on the bench if desperately needed. As you say by the time the international break is over, that rib should be well and truly mended and he can get stuck in again.

I actually think LvG might be the same way with Rojo, that is another injury that it might reoccur if not left to mend properly.

3947~~~
I agree. I'm convinced his absence is LvG wanting to let his rib heal properly. I hope that's all it is anyway. He's key to our fluidity and tempo. Fellaini might be a more robust presence that is useful in a few games, but Herrera isn't afraid to get stuck in.

3948~~~
That, and put Di Maria as second striker.

3949~~~
Totally agree. Can't wait to have him back at 100%, he's proving to be one of our best signings.

All the players coming back from injury are going to pose some serious questions ahead of the Arsenal game. But those are good problems to have.

3950~~~
Who is expected back in terms of defenders more importantly for the Arsenal game....can see Sanchez running riot regardless.

3951~~~
Smalling obviously, Rafael and Evans might be back?

3952~~~
what about Jones?

3953~~~
From what I've read about shin splints it could take longer than we like. Depends really how bad it is for him, I guess.

3954~~~
The team is stuck, we have an unbalanced side the problem is the fact that we are still too slow. It makes too easy to defend against and always vulnerable in transition. I think he hasn't played because he is not fully fit. Felliani helps the dm but he offers very little going forward so the player who is meant to feed the attackers has to drop deeper to create and dictate. Our striker ends up being isolated and when it is one who is as immobile as RVP you will have problems. 

He just needs to gain a little strength for the physical battle in the middle. But i'm more worried about the work he does defensively to help Blind. Herrera has a very good tactical mind and he's good technically. We need him to play and dictate play in the middle.

3955~~~
Yeah, I cracked a rib and you don't realize how much when you move you use that part of the body. There is no way you can play at full strength, as you are constantly worrying bout hitting it or trying to avoid touching that side. I couldn't even fully breathe in or out without getting a sharp pain.

It took me a good 4 weeks to stop it hurting, and even then it felt a bit funny for a while after.

I think Ander should be OK for Arsenal though.

3956~~~
Yeah and thats before you factor in nasty feckers deliberately sticking their arms into your ribs to gain an advantage!

3957~~~

3958~~~
Oh hell naw ! <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3959~~~
It is my opinion too. I said it a few days ago, i think if he played against West Brom (still not 100% etc.), he could have played against City or Palace. If he wasnt fit, he wouldnt sit on the bench. It is clear to me that LvG doesnt rate him and he wont play against Arsenal. With a possibility of Strootman coming in, Mata and Ander should look for new clubs, they wont be starters here. It sounds dramatic but that is the way i see it. Otherwise i cant explain why he didnt play at least some minutes in those other games. Dont tell me he wasnt fit, he certainly was fit enough to sit on the bench for 3 games. Falcao and Young arent fit, he is.

3960~~~
The next Kagawa? I certainly bloody hope not. I really, really like him as a player, hopefully his lack of game time is precautionary and in relation to his injury. Want to see more of him after the international break

3961~~~
So why would he spend so much on a player he didn't rate

3962~~~
And what of Di Maria? Would him and Januzaj be playing on the wings? I like this idea in theory but it worries me that Di Maria hasnt really shown the quality of his early games since he moved out of midfield.

3963~~~
Not worried in the slightest about Herrera, that lad's quality and was a regular starter until his injury so I'm sure he'll be back in sooner rather than later.

Would have been harsh on Fellaini to bring Herrera back in for the Palace game given how well he played in the Chelsea and City games.

3964~~~
Another example of general overreaction, he's probably not 100% fit yet, that's it.

3965~~~
Obviously rumours of Herrera being unwanted will surface if he's been benched for 3 games, but I don't think it's true. Give him these next 2 weeks to fully recover from his rib injury and he'll be back in the team.

3966~~~
It's very debatable whether Herrera was van Gaal's signing or not. From what's been said it's pretty evident that we had already as good as signed him (and Shaw) and that when van Gaal was appointed he just "signed off" on them both.

So yes you can say that van Gaal must have liked him to sign off on him but I wouldn't go as far as to say that he's a van Gaal signing.

3967~~~
Exactly. Coupled with the fact that Fellaini has been playing well.

3968~~~
Typical Spanish media bullshit.

3969~~~
It is not his money, but the clubs money. He was the best CM we could get, he trusted our scouting department. The deal was probably as good as done and he just gave his ok. I dont think he doesnt rate him, but if Fellaini keeps him out of the team, that means something. I personally like Herrera, but after that West Brom performance, he lost his spot. He wasnt fit, but he shouldnt have played. Even if Fellaini is in good form, LvG has a clear philosophy and Fellaini doesnt suit that. So i could imagine that Herrera would be better for that, so he really isnt fit or he doesnt rate him anymore. Lets hope he palys against Arsenal.

3970~~~
Unlikely - everyone knows that the best way to beat Arsenal is to bully them off the park and Fellaini is perfect for that job

3971~~~
Others say we dont need Fellaini, because Arsenal dont play with longs balls and big men. I think both could play. But i think we will see a 4231 with the same midfielders and strikers that played against Palace

3972~~~
I bloody well hope not. If that is the case, it would serve LvG right if he signs Strootman and he breaks down, I know I shouldn't say that but it would just serve him right.

3973~~~
Im sure this business about Van Gaal not liking Herrera is a complete red herring. His absence is only in line with the originally anticipated recovery time, he's just waiting for him to be fully fit and rewarding Fellaini's performances. Herrera will get his chance again sooner rather than later and his quality will shine through and ensure he keeps his place.

3974~~~
Ah!, now it is Herrera, after Fellaini, Shaw, De Gea and Rafael. Who is the next ?

3975~~~
I find it criminal that no journalist asks the question, i am pretty sure van Gaal would answer it.

3976~~~
He's been injured and is recovering and therefore hasn't been featured. Sounds reasonable though Marca can't figure this out?

Bullshit.

3977~~~
That's fair enough, but different to what some are suggesting, still, for what he brings, we have nothing better. I just suppose it's a question of tactics

That's backwards logic, he's held accountable and judged on what he spends, and also is known for not just "buying" to fill a hole, he won't panic.

Even assuming Ander is 100% fit, all it means is LVG wanted a different approach.


If one bad game could kill a player, Fellaini wouldn't be afforded these opportunities to do so well now.

3978~~~
After cracking his ribs against West Ham Ander Herrera was meant to be out for six weeks (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/517405/Herrera-Man-Utd-Chelsea-injury-sidelines" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>). By my calculations the West Ham game was six weeks (and two days ago). So there's nothing strange about his absence.

What's strange is that the media seem to have forgotten Ander's diagnosis, and expect him to continue to play thanks to a corset. It sounded a desperate idea when it was floated, and a desperate performance from Herrera at West Brom showed it was silly to rush him back.

3979~~~
I said yesterday that if LvG can get defenders who stay fit, then you can be more expansive with you midfield and attack. At the moment we are having to be pragmatic. The defenders cannot even get through a game before coming off. He might get his chance in the F.A. Cup as well. If LvG is ignoring him then he is foolish. I want to see attractive football, not Fellaini putting himself about. When did that become a skill?

3980~~~
The fact LvG actually took the risk, maybe shows he needed him and was desperate for him to come back. He just struck it lucky that Fellaini actually contributed when he came on. At least Ander now has another two weeks to get himself right. The way our luck is one of our players will get injured while away with their international teams.

3981~~~
Was just going to say this. If you rush him back to the point of having him wear a corset then obviously he must be in LVGs plans. Fellaini just took his opportunity well.

3982~~~
I wouldn't worry about it too much, we saw it with Shaw that LVG is OTT when it comes to fitness. Plus Herrera was our best player before injury, one of them anyway.

3983~~~
LVG is giving everyone a chance to impress. Januzaj just started the last 4 games for god sake. He is still looking for the balance, if you look at the squad, almost every player has played a few games in a row. Maybe Fletcher aside, no one can say they haven't been given a fair chance to play.

3984~~~
Why do we let Marca get to us like this?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3985~~~
Januzaj isn't doing himself any favours to be fair either.

3986~~~
Yup. Di Maria and Januzaj wide in a front three. Not playing as wingers, as such. Which might help their form. Less defending required.

3987~~~
I can. His rib is still bruised and when Van Gaal played Herrera with his rib not fully recovered against West Brom, Herrera looked awful.

I must say though I am slightly worried that Van Gaal has convinced himself that he has to play Fellaini for his physicality. He's talked about physical presence a few times in his pressers. This would mean that Ander will play much less. Which would be silly because he looks like our best allround midfielder.

3988~~~
I don't understand why a player who's played so few games and was terrible in at least one of them is so highly rated on here.

Blind's been a more influential player thus far and Carrick was absolutely class in his first start of the season. Even Fellaini hasn't actually had a poor game yet. 

Herrera has been very good in 2 or 3 games so far this season but his reputation has obviously been boosted by a combination of not playing in the more defensive formation we've used in recent weeks and being on the pitch during the turkey shoot against a hopeless QPR team. Some good vibes also due to opening period of the Leicester game (combined with a touch of amnesia about his role in the subsequent capitulation).

He's a quality young player who's got a better eye for a through ball than our other CMs and loves a tackle but he's still got a lot to learn if he's going to be considered our best CM. How to pass the ball a lot more consistently for starters.

3989~~~
i dont know why you are offended by the statement that he is our best all around midfielder, thats what he is. Blind is versatile and excellent, but he isnt better allround than Herrera. Also Blind played poorly against Leicester, to discredit Herrera in saying he was on the field in that game is just wrong. Our whole team went to pieces, not just Herrera. I agree with his passing consistency though.

3990~~~
For a minute there I thought you was talking about Blind... he also capitulated against Leicester

3991~~~
He was part of that capitulation, agreed. He had an impossible task, though. Having to cover for both fullbacks who were consistently getting caught upfield with zero cover from Di Maria or Herrera. Not to mention being sucked into the absolute chaos in our central defence.

The fact Blind has been such a consistent performer with better disciplined players in front of him shows what a clusterfeck the Herrera/Di Maria central midfield would be against anyone half decent. Hence Van Gaal's obvious reluctance to repeat it. Which is not what you'd expect from a combination of Angel Di Maria and "our best all round midfielder".

3992~~~
The boring as shit International break has the journos scrambling for sensationalist United stories to sell their rags.

3993~~~
That midfield combination performed well against West Ham and Everton too.

Your talking about Blind consistent performances whilst at the same time critising a player (Herrera) who has played badly for 30 minutes of a game, in which the whole team fell apart... whilst at the same time making exuses for Blind in the same game....

The truth is THAT midfield 3 played very well together, ALL of them performed well together.

What happened around them was a cluster feck but that combination of players in midfield worked a treat, its a shame we didn't/wasn't able to play it against Chelsea IMO (even if that meant dropping one of the Strikers and playing Fellaini in there too to be slightly more defensive)

Blind has been brilliant don't get me wrong, but Herrera has done his fair share of defensive work in midfield when he has been fit, Blinds job is actually alot easy IMO when he plays in there with Herrera who seems to be on his wavelength and adds the required tenacity and legs in the middle of the park.

EDIT: I will also add that Herreras ommision from the team lately has been very noticable IMO

3994~~~
I'd be very disappointed if he weren't in LvG's plans and it'd be plain ridiculous but his omission from the last 3 games despite making the bench is indeed pretty weird and telling. I liked him in previous games apart from Chelsea and would feel truly sorry for him if he was to be benched permanently, van Gaal seems to be of the same ilk as Ferguson though i.e. quite stubborn (perhaps not as much) so if something like this was to happen at one point I'd not be shocked.

I think he'll win his place back. Not like he has much competition.

3995~~~
From what I've seen he likes to defend, has bags of energy, is box to box, can press and win the ball high up the pitch, good in possession, can play a decisive through ball and has an eye for goal.

Hence the term best "all round". I don't think any of our other mids offer all of that as a package.

3996~~~
Looked good for just over an hour against Everton, who were in the middle of a horrendous run of form. Had our arses handed to us in the closing stages though.

West Ham dominated us from even earlier in the game. Long before Rooney's red card.

And you can add the 45 minutes against WBA to be the list of not good performances. All of which probably adds up to not far short of the total minut in the list of good performances.

I rate Hererra and think he'll be a good player for us but he's been nowhere near as consistently good as you'd think from this thread. He's had a mixed bag of performances so far. Great going forwards and makes a lot of tackles but often careless with his passing, gets knocked off the ball fairly easily and positional sense leaves a lot to be desired. No way is he our "best all round midfielder".

3997~~~
Interesting, what are you basing this on? Ive reached the opposite conclusion, he doesnt seem stubborn he seems pragmatic - or if you want to frame it in a more negative light, borderline flaky / lacking in conviction (hence the constant tinkering). 

All of these other explanations seem considerably less plausible than the simple one based on a broken rib a matter of weeks ago, coupled with some good form from one of our other midfield options.

3998~~~
LVG has said it with every player thats been out injured...... no one is guaranteed a spot when fit.  He's giving Fellaini a chance based on his performances which I think is fair.
At the end of the day there are 25 players in the team and only 11 can start. Not everyone can play all the time.

3999~~~
That statement went too far (he has alot to prove before you want to go and call him that) especially when we have a player like Di Maria
However your assesment of his performances are a little on the harsh side. Someone even said he looks soft, he clearly isn't, he gets knocked off the ball a bit (but its usually a foul when he does in fariness as he plays on the edge of balance when moving with the ball, a bit like D Silva)

4000~~~
I think Bayern fans have said he was very stubborn in his approach there, he was heavily criticized for team having too much possession without doing much with it and he made some bold decisions (dropped Klose and Toni to play Muller if I remember correctly?). At United so far it was his insistence to play 352 which although short has cost us points plus van Persie being in the team despite playing poorly.

4001~~~
To be fair to him, apart from Herrera (who got injured early on) what were his other midfeild options? He needed to try something, it didn't work and he moved on quickly. Don't think you can call that stubborn.

As for RVP, well Falcao isn't fit so... who do you replace him with Wilson? He has already started subbing off RVP (who has goals this season) for Wilson (who hasn't) so again bit harsh to say that is stubborn.

4002~~~
Cant see why van Gaal would have a problem with Herrera. He has the technique and creative ability plus hes not afraid to put in a tackle. Sure its just bs

4003~~~
I probably am being a little harsh, you're right there. I tend to do that when I think someone is getting praise (or criticism) their performances don't justify. Just think a lot of people are overlooking the perfectly valid reasons Van Gaal might have for taking Herrera out of the team for a while. Blind is a bit of a freak in the way he's adjusted to life at Manchester United so quickly. Hererra's learning curve is a bit more normal and I wouldn't have expected him to have mastered every element of being a CM in the PL just yet.

So I'm not too bothered about him having a bit of time off (along with Di Maria being shunted out wide) if the manager thinks that's the best way to stop that alarming streak of defensive vulnerability we had in large portions of the Everton, West Ham, & Leicester games.

4004~~~
Yeah OK he clearly came with a reputation for being stubborn with a massive ruthless streak, I just dont think weve actually seen evidence of it at United yet. Which may be because he has mellowed a bit, or he may be biding his time and making further assessments before he fully commits to a plan and acts really decisively. I dont think the 352 thing has anything to do with stubbornness, personally. The RVP one is more in that direction but still falls short. I would call it more a man who believes in a player and is giving him a chance to play himself into form. Not least because he hasnt had too many other options (though I would like to see Rooney play up front) and RVP hasnt in my assessment been that bad. 

If RVP plays up front for the next 10 games then yes, Ill say it is stubborn (unless he is vindicated), I dont think people would see him that way if it wasnt for the reputation he arrived with.

4005~~~
He's a little bit overrated on here, he's rightfully been dropped to the bench for the last 3 games. He was shocking against West Brom and Leicester and his only really good game for us was against QPR in which every player in our team was good. He capitulated badly against Leicester in the second half and was invisible as was a lot of our players that day. Fellaini hasn't set the world on fire, but he's been solid and consistent, his physical presence is also a welcomed sight especially when we are defending in our own box, sorry but I just feel a bit more secure defensively when Fellaini/Carrick are playing. Herrera is also not our best midfielder, Di Maria and Carrick are both better, what exactly has Herrera done to be considered better than them two?

Although I actually think Herrera would be brilliant for us in a advanced position where his skills are put to better use, but I can't see LVG dropping Rooney to accommodate him, so unless Fellaini or Carrick mess up pretty bad in the next few games, I think we will be seeing a lot of Herrera on the bench. I think we should use him like Chelsea use Oscar, as an advanced midfielder who presses like crazy and wins the ball high up the pitch.

4006~~~
Just as much as he is overrated in this thread, you are underatting him right there.

He has played well against WestHam, QPR, majority of the game against Leicester.

Not that I am saying he is better than Di Maria but you make the statement you make as if Di Maria hasn't been shite for the last 3/4 games.

Fact is Herrera has played well apart from 30 mins against Leicester.Oh and the game against WestBrom which he was likely not even fit for.

4007~~~
I know what you mean...I think the journalist are really struggling to come with any real drama at the club this season. Apart from the Rooney red card it has all been vague/bland stories about who is and isn't in LVG's plans.

Same happened with Januzaj until he played 4 games back-to-back. Then Mata comes off the bench and you'd think he had been in the reserves all season from the interview questions afterwards.

4008~~~
I probably am underrating him abit, but I still think he'd be quality as a advanced MF. 

Yes he played well vs West Ham, forgot about that game, my bad.

Di Maria has still been assisting and creating chances, that's the sign of a top quality performer.

So what? We need consistant performers who can play for 90mins not 30mins.

4009~~~
In terms of goal contributions Herrera has 2 goals and an assist in what 4 games? Not to mention when he has been playing he has consistently been involved in creating chances.

You miss the point. The whole team played badly for 30 mins (including Di Maria before he was subbed off), my point was he has played well apart from 30 mins, so how has that all of a sudden made him an inconsistent performer?

4010~~~
Problem with giving Fellaini his chance, and yes he has earned it, is that we are now relying on not condeding goals and with him and Carrick in the side we will not be the threat going forward, so if we concede first we might not have the personel to get a win.

4011~~~
These new players will need time, it is a different type of football. If he starts shunting players out without letting them settle we will be in the same boat every season. New players coming in needing time to settle and not getting it. I think the defensive issues are dictating the type of midfield we play. A good strong defence and we can attack better without the worry of defensive cockups.

4012~~~
Also, people saying about the six weeks to mend his rib. Him playing in that corset might have added more time to the recovery and I believe it actually caused him a lot or irritation. If Ander was desperate to play, the manager should have put his foot down and said he needed recovery time. He didn't, so I think it was more LvG was desperate for him to play and it backfired.

4013~~~
He needs to get his tweet on like Falcao and shut this nonsense down.

4014~~~
You notice that these stories come out during and international break, no press conferences from the club managers to put the situation right. It depends if the press ask LvG in his next press conference to clear things up, Marca just like mischief making.

4015~~~
We can bring Mata or Herrera one <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
I agree but I don't think anyone should be freaking out that Herrera hasn't been back yet, they tried to rush him with that corset and it didn't work out so they'll give it time.
Other players need game time too

4016~~~
No saying LvG doesn't feel bad for setting his recovery back.

4017~~~
These games where he has been on the bench. There have been sending off/ injuries issues or both which may have changed the substitutions that were going to be made. He has most likely just been plain unlucky not to get a run out. With yet another international break there are no U-21 games to give him a bit of a run out like Carrick got.

4018~~~
I believe he will return to the first 11 once the injured rib clears.

4019~~~
Marca? The paper who photoshopped a stadium pre-season to make it look like there was more Madrid fans than United? They along with Jamie Hackson can do one.

4020~~~
I hope it will be soon. I really want to see his energy in midfield on a regular basis again.

4021~~~
He's looking well to me
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/vOdy24vA3I/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

4022~~~
Certainly looks to be moving freely, 2 more weeks off for this crappy international break should see him ready to come in against Arsenal.

4023~~~
The biggest disappointment is that he shone in the big games at Athletic Club last season (I only really watched him consistently last season because I had a feeling we would go back in for him) and he has missed our big games so far this season. I do think (and hope) his absence has been LvG not wanting to risk exacerbating his injury.

4024~~~
Needs to come straight back into midfield. Put Di Maria at the point of the diamond but largely let him do what the feck he wants.

4025~~~
Putting him at the point of a diamond is a waste too. He needs to be deeper. 

Until we have a strong defence behind him though that won't happe

4026~~~
It'll be two months after the rib injury when we play Arsenal. Considering he was first cleared to play just two weeks afterwards, we can safely assume that <b>if</b> he is benched against Arsenal it will have nothing to do with his ribs.

4027~~~

4028~~~
Definitely, I mean it's possible he aggravated the rib injury by playing so soon after, but looking at that vid and Mata's comments he's fully fit now. I hope he does start, I know most would say I have an agenda bias against Fellaini and I freely admit I get zero joy from seeing him lumber about, but I do think the tempo of our passing and our pressing has been hurt by Herrera's absence. I'd love to see a Blind/Carrick/Herrera midfield trio.

4029~~~
If LVG genuinly rates Fellaini above Herrera then my confidence in the man will take a massive battering.

4030~~~
We've really missed him in the past few matches. Having someone who can actually dictate our pace and tempo from midfield was a must in the past three matches. Rooney's played this dictator role twice now, and he hasn't had the influence that I'd expect from a player in that role.

Whilst Herrera's passing has been somewhat sloppy so far, his movement, vision, and energy made us play at a good tempo and pace. Without him, we've been lethargic and overly reliant on our wingers to create chances and offer us a quick tempo to our game. The opposition notice this, and they outnumber our wide players, thus limiting their influence.

With Herrera, the opposition would always be dragged around, and this would offer up space for everyone else on the attack. When Herrera isn't his energetic, active self, we struggle as no one else offers what he offers through the middle (I'd say that only Kagawa and Welbeck offered that before Herrera did).

4031~~~
I kinda agree even though I'd mean it less dramatic

4032~~~
I think it's safe to assume we rushed him back (made him play in that special corset) and that he might have aggregated it so didn't play vs chelsea. Fellaini took his chance and played really well, so then kept his spot vs city, and then vs palace it made sense to play him because of the added height and muscle because our center backs were McNair and blind, so we needed someone like fellaini to provide height. 

I don't buy that Van gaal doesn't rate him or whatever, I think he's a big fan of him, but it's just that when we have so many injuries in defence, we need more defensively minded midfielders to make up for it as well as some height so we aren't useless from corners(defending them, we'll always be useless from them going forward).

4033~~~
Agree with that last paragraph. 

What annoys me is not Fellaini being picked ahead of Hererra it's the fact he won't take Rooney out of midfield, to play him up front. That gives Hererra his game, keeps Fellaini for his defensive qualities and provides us with a lone striker who will cover the ground we need him to cover. 

Seems a no brainer and it's really frustrating Van Gaal sees things differently.

Pogue doing a Striker10.

The site has been acting up for me aswell today.

4045~~~
Wasn't sure which post to quote but I wanted to say, that I completly agree with that.

4046~~~
It never ceases to amaze me how much our last three managers seemed to love playing our best players completely out of position for no apparent reason at all. We're throwing Rooney into midfield and Di Maria on the wing purely to accommodate Adnan and Fellaini despite the fact that we have two superior players to both on the bench who you could just put in and allow Rooney and Di Maria to play in their best fecking positions.

It seems the most abundantly obvious flaw in the world to me, playing our best two players where they're not remotely as good or effective, yet still somehow he persists. What am I missing here?

4047~~~
I interpret the reasons differently. I dont think its about Januzaj and Fellaini. Rooney is playing in midfield because he prefers Van Persie up front. And Di Maria is playing on the wing because we dont have anyone better to play there.

4048~~~
Rooney should be playing up front. RvP is not justifying his selection. His selection smells of favourtism to the detriment of the team. Hopefully if we can get some defenders back and they can stay fit he will change the formation back.

4049~~~
Not being funny but Rooney hasn't set the world alight up top and was suspended for 3 games. His absesne seems to have elevated him somewhat. Saying that I'd like to see Rooney start up top vs Arsneal.

4050~~~
His shooting accuracy looked well below par against Palace. I'd not put him up top unless he improves significantly in the England games.

4051~~~
I am the choir. You are preaching to me.

4052~~~
Hallelujah!<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4053~~~
That's how I see it too.

4054~~~
This is probably right, but even though Rooney has not been great, he certainly, despite what people think, is not a midfielder and playing ADM on the wing has completely removed his effectiveness. Rooney has always wanted to be the main forward. Neither ADM or Januzaj are great wingers, which unfortunately says more about our past purchases regarding wingers. I am going to bang on about the defence again. If he can strengthen there, I think he will feel secure going back to the diamond again. At the moment it is a big risk.

4055~~~
I think he clearly doesn't like the idea of Rooney up front. Maybe its t
I agree with this. 

I don't have too much of a problem with RvP but I don't want him starting for any reason other than he deserves to. It also means we can get Rooney out of midfield and Herrera back in there like you say.

I find it a bit worrying that seemingly Rooney has to play because he's "his captain" and Van Persie has to play because he's Van Persie.

4056~~~
Rooney mentioned to LVG his best position is behind the striker.

Therefore his inclusion in the midfield has nothing to do with LVG being too scared to drop RVP.

The drama around Herrera is becoming slightly silly, he had an injury and hasn't walked straight back into the team! 

Nothing unusual or news worthy about his situation tbh.

4057~~~
You are assuming that where Rooney says his best position is is a deciding factor. But it isnt, Van Gaal makes his own decisions about where people should play. As evidenced by the fact that Rooney said his best position is behind the striker, but he has found himself playing in midfield. (Oh, but he never said how far behind the striker.)

The question is therefore whether he is "too scared" to drop RVP or otherwise disinclined to do it - because he thinks RVP is his best striker - or that Rooney isnt a very good striker and Falcao hasnt been fit enough to shoulder the burden on his own. I suspect he simply thinks RVP is his best striker and wants to allow him to play himself into form.

4058~~~
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him as a wide forward out on the left either. That way we can use herrera in a midfield 3, falcao up top and then di Maria part of the midfield or on the other wing with fellaini in the middle. I think up until now Van gaal was giving Van Persie plenty of chances to find his form while falcao is out, but I'm not sure how much longer he'll stick with him. He hasn't been terrible up top but he hasn't been very good either, and with the players we have you'd expect him to change it up soon.

4059~~~
I've never seen anything about Rooney telling Van Gaal his best position is behind a striker. Might have missed it, though. I also think I remember Rooney saying his favourite position was as a 9. If not this season, in one of the last two seasons?

What I <i>definitely </i>remember is Van Gaal saying something about him not being happy with what Rooney offers as a striker (or words to that effect). Made no sense to me at the time and makes even less sense with each ponderous performance from RvP.

4060~~~
Front three of Rooney-Falcao-Di Maria looks pretty damn excellent to me. Especially if that means Herrera playing ahead of two from Fellaini/Blind/Carrick in central midfield.

4061~~~
As I remember it, it was all part of the same quote. He said he hadnt been satisfied with Rooney up front - but then went on to say that Rooney had said his best position was behind the striker so he would now get a chance to play there. 

Could be wrong though.

4062~~~
Which would be fine if he was actually playing just behind RvP, but he is playing far too deep. I honestly think the captaincy is making Wayne think he has to play in every area of the pitch. I know he has to set an example, but he is not doing the job he should be doing. We then have RvP misfiring and Wayne nowhere near him.

4063~~~
In his last two games he's been asked to play as a central midfielder, which is what he's been doing.

4064~~~
Then they wonder why we are struggling to score goals. The guy who is hoping to break Sir Bobby Charltons scoring record is playing in central midfield.

4065~~~
Well, exactly.

4066~~~
So did Bobby Charlton, tbf.

4067~~~
Touche!

4068~~~
Should be playing if fit. Fellaini's all well and good for certain things, but just because he's remembered how to be a threat in the box doesn't mean we can afford to play him all the time instead of an actual quality central midfielder.

Van Gaal wants a balance between the gung-ho defensively leaky stuff of earlier in the season and the more solid, stolid stuff recently? Get Herrera back in. He makes our forwards more dangerous but he's also a more reliable defensive contributor than Fellaini. With him back in, I'd be happy for us to revert to the diamond, which brings the best out of so many of our players:

Then if he wants more of a defensive screen against a good team, sacrifice a striker for Carrick, like so:

*or RVP
**or RVP or Falcao
...but I've not been impressed with RVP at all this season. A different manager would have dropped him a while ago.

4069~~~
I feel exactly the same. 

Also, I doubt any of this 'LvG doesn't rate Herrera' stuff is true. He'll be back into the team sometime soon.

4070~~~
Seems to be a report based on a non-existent English report, but wouldn't it just be typical of the last few months if, having been given the chance to sign off on Herrera LVG agreed, only to change his mind a few months later. And so the cycle would begin again...

4071~~~
Sell Herrera and Mata, bring back Nani, why not it makes perfect sense.

4072~~~
Better hadn't be for sale. I would much rather have their type in the side than Fellaini/Carrick slowing down our midfield. We will be going backwards. Also if he treats these lads like that, he will have sod all chance of ever signing a spaniard again. These two seem to be close to a lot of spanish internationals. We will then be going down the hard working functional route.

4073~~~
Don't be ridiculous.

4074~~~
yawn! international break so plenty of newspapers to fill.

I guess LVG is aiming for a squad of 11 players with DDG, Herrera, Mata...all leaving! seems legit to me! <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4075~~~
Maybe we could just loan him to another PL side for a season to gather experience while we are at it.

4076~~~
I watched United in Press on Tuesday and they didn't even mention the article in Marca about how we are treating Herrera and Mata badly. Of course you can see that two ways, that there is absolutely no truth in it or that there is.<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4077~~~
Presumably just nonsense. With that said, as highly as I rate Van Gaal, I think he has serious potential to throw in a curve ball when it comes to some of the supposed highly-rated players in the squad. Selling Herrera and retaining Fellaini, for example, would be very, er, 'him'.

4078~~~
Amazing, Herrera breaks his ribs and the media speculate he's not wanted and for sale!? This is a bit like when the media decided LVG hated Luke Shaw and Rafael because neither were starting, this despite the fact they were both injured at the time... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4079~~~
If LvG does his job properly we will need a really big squad next season. Just hope he puts it all to bed after the break. LvG has a massive ego and it will be sad if he has told them they aren't in his plans. Can't see why they wouldn't be. I would rather have these lads, who seem to look after themselves, than the bunch, most of who didn't even contribute or are injured who go out on the lash to celebrate a boring 1-0 win against Crystal Palace.

4080~~~
Hes injured whats with all the hysterics!

4081~~~
It would that is the worrying part. In a way I could see him thinking Mata for all his goals doesn't contribute enough in a game, but you could never say Herrera doesn't work his socks off or isn't a valuable member of the squad. It would be an idiotic decision.

Especially with all the shit we put him through with David Moyes and then go in for him again, with LvG's approval to then dump him. That doesn't make sense.

4082~~~
Marca's article (which I haven't read in its entirety) is probably due to the fact that Herrera was close to getting a call up to the Spainish NT in the last two international breaks before injury prevented that and now he's supposedly fit he isn't playing. It's probably a bit frustrating. 

My view is that he isn't fully fit and although he's been on his bench LvG has been loath to use him because he'd rather give his ribs time to fully heal and Fellaini came in and did ok. I don't think he's out of favour (well I hope he isn't) because I think we lack a lot without him. 

Hopefully he will come back in, play well and get his first cap for Spain and the bullshit speculation will stop.

4083~~~
Where would we be without a bit of Marca shitstirring?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4084~~~
Yep. As long as they don't start on our Dave...

4085~~~
True, that'd be very Fergusonesque too. He was the sort of a manager who could refuse to play Herrera whilst fielding O'Shea in midfield week in week out. Once he's made up his mind on a player it was impossble to win him back.

4086~~~
He has lost his marbles if he is doing that. Yes Fellaini is playing well at the moment, but he would never be a first choice pick for me. Herrera has done nothing wrong but he won't drop his love child RvP or his captain, no matter what they do. That is wrong.

4087~~~
Herrera has been recovering from his rib injury.  He is such a LVG type of player, so any fears he isn't liked or will be got rid off is unfounded in my opinion.  Mata yep, clearly not favoured.. Herrera hasn't even come off the bench so clearly fitness wise something is amiss.

4088~~~
Herrera will get back in the team soon enough, he didn’t look comfortable playing with his injury at West Brom so it is no surprise he hasn’t been rushed back into the team. Fellaini is plugging a gap and adding some height and strength, I think he is just being used as a short term solution and I seriously doubt there is much intention for him to become a mainstay in the team long term.

4089~~~
Fellaini has been good though. Rooney should make space or more accurately van Persie.

4090~~~
I don’t think creating space for Fellaini is a priority really, but between all three of them they need to improve on the Palace performance. I wasn’t criticising Fellaini but I think there is a big difference between doing a good job of plugging a hole in the side and being an integral part of it. Long term I still think Fellaini’s future is likely to be either as a sub or at another club as there will be more emphasis on having better passing and movement in midfield.

4091~~~
If Lvg doesn't use him in his next 2 games then I think it's fair say Van Gaal doesn't like him. He even bought Fletcher on instead of him, Herrera was obviously fit as well otherwise he wouldn't be on the bench.

4092~~~
Don't know how many times that has been said. It happens loads of times, especially when teams have a lot of injuries that someone ends up on the bench and isn't completly fit. Also McNair went off and Blind wasn't exacly great at CB, so Carrick went back and Fletcher came on to support the midfield. The only way we will find out what is going on is for someone member of our useless press to ask.

Also how many chances are we creating that the ball is going into the box, not shots from outside the box? Constant shooting from outside the box usually shows a team that is struggling to break teams down to create guilt edged chances.

4093~~~
You're quite right, the main theme of the Marca reports was about the Spanish NT, the squad and the nearly-squad.

I did read the Marca article, I didn't bother posting it because it wasn't really about anything. I hadn't realised it had provoked a reaction on here. Herrera had been deemed close to call-up, but out of United's squad, he was out of the NT reckoning as well. The original article was pretty much factual with a "no one knows" slant. It certainly doesn't claim any knowledge of LvG or Herrera's thinking.

4094~~~
I thought so. Thanks for clearing it up. After the 'corset' thing LvG hasn't really said much about him so I suppose it'll naturally lead to speculation as to why he isn't in the team.

4095~~~
I wouldn't even read too much into that. LvG only seems to talk about players the press ask a question about. If they don't ask he says nothing.

4096~~~
Why won't anyone just accept Herrera has been dropped for an in form Fellaini?

I'm just personally glad we now seem to be a bit spilt for choice in midfield. I think having good competition for places is good anyway, especially in midfield, which we haven't really had over the last couple of years. Fellaini knows that he has to keep his high level of performances up, otherwise he could be replaced. Vice versa if/when Herrera comes back in.

4097~~~
That's fine, but I don't think we will be seeing many goals.

4098~~~
Why?

4099~~~
Because we couldn't break down Crystal Palace, who had no intention of trying to score, the only way they nearly did was from a hoof ball and a misunderstanding between McNair and Blind. We scored because he brought Mata on who funny enough has a bit of guile about him. If he hadn't it would likely have been 0-0 and everyone would have been seriously freaking out. They keep going on about possession and the defence. It is easy to defend if there is nothing to defend against and we nearly cocked that up. Possession is only of significance if you do something with it. We are Manchester United not Crystal Palace, we should have the flair and intelligence to be able to break down Crystal Palace. I don't have a problem with Fellaini as such, but LvG is showing favourtism to players who are not performing for him. No wonder Rooney and RvP as so chuffed he is the manager. They only have to remember to bring their boots and they play.

4100~~~
Hmmm, basically because to believe that we'd also have to believe that Fellaini was looking defensively or creatively stronger than Herrera and most of us don't have that kind of imagination.

If you mean Fellaini as part of a new way of lining up that included moving Di Maria to a position that he's less effective in and leaves Januzaj looking out of his depth, well maybe, but I doubt it. Compared to losing badly, a 1-1 with Chelsea, losing by a single goal to City and winning 1-0 against Palace is a good run - particularly with our defender injuries. But I don't believe that it's the way ahead.

So, no, I can't easily believe it's something other than a choice made easy by having a fully fit Fellaini competing for a place with a half fit Herrera. If it is something else then I'm disappointed because Herrera is a player I like watching in La Liga and who I think has great potential for us.

4101~~~
Exactly, Fellaini serves a purpose in certain games, will he be helpful in us not losing certain games, yes. Will he be vital in us winning games. No.

4102~~~
I agree with this.

I went off on one in the post-Palace game thread a bit, and I still haven't changed my opinion. Nothing about that game gave me any real confidence. We lucked a win against Palace in a way that would not have been out of place under Moyes.

Like you said, they came to defend and counter and we nearly messed that up too. People saying we are more stable now ignore that, as well as the fact that we could have conceded three penalties against City and Hazard and Ivanovic waltzed through our back line. Even West Brom scored twice against us!

At least with the diamond we had ambition, at least when we used the likes of Di Maria and Herrera in central areas we looked a threat to other teams: Good ballers, playing two touch, give and go football. This new rigid formation has made us much less creative and, arguably, no more more stable. It also seems set up to the strengths of workmanlike players at the expense of genuinely gifted ones. I don't understand how many reds can actually be happy with that.

4103~~~
Well if Di Maria couldn't break down that Palce defence I doubt Herrera would have.

4104~~~
Di Maria is atrocious on the wing. LvG has messed with the lineup to stop us shifting goals. They have, but only by the grace of god and forgiving referees. If it continues like this we will end up conceding and not be able to pull it back. I would rather watch us scoring goals and taking our chances at the back. At least it is exciting to watch. I hate this pragmatic stuff. That sort of stuff got the last manager sacked, along with him being useless of course.

4105~~~
It's obvious Herrera's a more creative player than Fellaini, but having him in our side against Palace doesn't necessarily mean we'd have broken them down any easier. I mean, we still had the likes of Di Maria, Rooney, Januzaj and Van Persie - four players who can create moments of magic at any given moment, and they didn't. How many times did Di Maria and Januzaj get the ball in good positions but were unable to beat the full back or create something?

Also, the high scoring come when we play a 41212, so it's a bit of an unfair judgement. Before that, we didn't exactly blow teams away with Herrera and Mata in our team, losing and drawing to the likes of Swansea and Sunderland, respectively. We even struggled to break down West Brom a few weeks with Herrera and Mata in our midfield, until Fellaini came on, funnily enough.

Like I said, it's clear Herrera is a more creative player than Fellaini, but if our creative players on the day did their job, I don't think Fellaini's lack of creativity (although I don't think he's in the team to give us that) would be a problem. Having said that, we created quite a few chances against City and Chelsea with Fellaini in the team.

4106~~~
Couldn't break down Crystal Palace with a midfield of <b>Rooney, Fellaini, Carrick</b> and everyone goes mad. 

Couldn't break down West Brom with a midifeld of <b>Blind, Herrera and Mata</b> and everyone blames the weather.

4107~~~
So why didn't Fellaini start against West Brom instead of the half fit Herrera?

If you heard Van Gaal's post match interview against West Brom, he said he felt we had a more physical balance with him in the side, and his performance when coming on seemed to have convinced Van Gaal to put Fellaini in, in the following games. Had Fellaini come on and not played well against West Brom, I very much doubt he would have started the following game against Chelsea. Give the guy some credit.

4108~~~
We scored twice against West Brom and generally looked threatening. 

It's the defending that cost us.

4109~~~
Haha very true. The same can be said of the Chelsea and City games where people thought we'd get dicked but actually did well given our circumstances.

4110~~~
When Fellaini was on <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

First half we were dire.

<span style="font-size: 22px">How Manchester United can accommodate £29m signing Ander Herrera

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/how-manchester-united-can-accommodate-29m-signing-ander-herrera/218966" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/how-manchester-united-can-accommodate-29m-signing-ander-herrera/218966</a></span>

4112~~~
I think Fellaini was played in the games against Chelsea and City because we were looking to play on the counter and capitalise on set pieces and his height and strength and his amazing ball control on his chest were good assets to have. Against Crystal Palace however, I don't think we needed these particular skills; a more creative, incisive passer with good movement was what was required and Herrera - fitness permitting - should have played.

LVG will settle on a system sooner than later and may look to play a more expansive game once the defence is sorted but for now, this is how it works.

4113~~~
I think he hasn't featured because as mentioned over and over, Van Gaal team's are all about balance and philosophy.

With our unsettled and constantly changing back four, I think LVG has gone with Felliani to try to strengthen up our mid / defence, and Di Maria shifted from his more productive CM role to a left wing role. 

I'm pretty sure Herrera will find himself back in the starting lineup once we get some consistency in our back four line up. We'll also see Di Maria reverted back to CM and Felliani dropped to the bench.

4114~~~
I think he would have come of the bench at some time, but we have either had someone sent off, so a defensive substitution has been needed. Then lo and behold a defender will then get injured and yet another defensive substitution has been needed. This defence has been cursed. Ander has just been unlucky. Hopefully it will all sort itself out. Signing people like Vlaar and Hummels might not be the answer to our injury woes.

4115~~~
This is really harsh. Fellaini played a big part in beating us once or twice for his old club. I'd put it more like: is Fellaini part of our strongest XI? No. Is he a useful squad player? Yes.

4116~~~
That is more what I meant to say. You'll have to write my scripts for me.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4117~~~
He's was not a 100% these past few games, I'm sure he'll be back.

4118~~~
Because we tried the new corset for Herrera and it failed.

4119~~~
Heh. You can cut the cognitive dissonance in this thread with a knife.

There's a bunch of people who firmly believe that:
<ul>
<li>Fellaini is not good enough to keep Hererra out of the team on merit.</li>
<li>Van Gaal would not make mistakes in his team selection.</li>
</ul>Only, both of those statements can't be true at the same time so they're desperately clinging to this idea that Hererra is somehow unfit to play. Still unfit to play, 7 weeks after an injury which was sufficiently healed 3 weeks after the original incident for the medical staff to allow him to start a competitive game. I mean, come on!

He fractured a rib. Broken bones usually take 4 weeks or so to heal. Sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. In a young, fit adult who got an un-displaced fractured of a bone with a good blood supply that timeline could be as short as 2 or 3 weeks. Which obviously happened here. There's no way he would have been allowed to start against WBA without x-ray evidence that the fracture had fully healed. Would be negligent to do otherwise as you'd be risking a ruptured lung, or worse. It's possible he still had a bit of soreness in the area at the time, hence the corset. Which would have been intended for psychological, as much as physical, protection. When you break a bone, it forms a callus around the fracture point. Which actually makes it thicker/stronger than it was before. Absolutely no chance that he re-fractured his rib in that game and it wasn't as though he broke down, anyway. He was subbed off at half time.

Plus you have the fact he's been on the bench in every game since WBA. Which again, goes completely against this idea that he somehow made his injury worse on his comeback. You just don't put players on the bench who have an injury that is not properly healed, as it would be beyond stupid to risk calling on a player who will be inhibited by his injury and unable to perform or at risk of aggravating the injury and need to be subbed off not long after he came on. The only time you get players on the bench who a manager would ideally prefer to start would be in scenarios where they've been out for a while and their stamina might not be up to scratch. They wouldn't be able to last the full 90, so makes sense to keep them on as an impact sub. Of course, Herrera hasn't even been getting minutes off the bench!

It's blatantly obvious that, right now, Van Gaal thinks Fellaini is a better option. If that forces any of you to reconsider your opinion on the manager or Fellaini, well tough. You either need to face up to this reality or keep living in denial. Because this thread has got an awful lot of people doing exactly that.

4120~~~
OK, I choose statement 1 as true and statement 2 as false.

4121~~~
I agree.

I think the mistake he's making is in not playing both Hererra <i>and </i>Fellaini fwiw.

4122~~~
So Di Maria on the wing? 

Id play Fellaini sometimes but Im not sure Id have him in our strongest XI.

Id have Blind and Carrick in front of the defence and Rooney, Herrera and Di Maria in front of them. With Falcao up front. Or Rooney up front and Mata where he was. Very passe to include Mata I know but I havent given up on him. 

Fellaini is a great option to have but I just think we have better players. Though to be fair on form he is worthy of being picked at the moment.

4123~~~
I agree with you, but i have one nuissance it is that i think that Van gaal is not necessarily convinced that Fellaini is a better option but only think that he has to seize the momentum Fellaini is in.

4124~~~
I definitely agree with the general principle that when someone is playing well they should be picked. Selection based on form, not reputation. It seems to me that is the way to keep the squad motivated. 

In that sense it is perfectly defensible to have selected Fellaini in recent games, he has done well. 

When Herrera gets his chance again he must take it and then he keeps his place.

4125~~~
Fellaini is in the team because of a lack of a physical presence and a makeshift defence and it makes sense from that perspective but it takes mean changing the shape of the team and it will effect the way we play in terms of how quickly and effectively we can pass the ball in midfield.  Herrera will be back in place of or alongside Fellaini at some point. For a top side having Fellaini as a box to box midfielder is a limitation and that is something I have no doubt LVG will correct as he takes the club forward.

4126~~~
That's the bottom line for me. If a player comes into the team and does well, keep picking him until he stops performing at that level.

I've got a few doubts about Van Gaal's team selections so far but his decision to keep picking Fellaini on the basis of what he's produced so far is something I'm really pleased about. I hate it when a player gets a chances as replacement for a big name, does a really good job and gets dropped through no fault of his own. Much rather the team be picked on merit.

If Herrera merits a start I would prefer that Van Gaal looks at re-shuffling things by dropping someone who <i>isn't</i> playing well. The obvious decision is to drop RvP, stick Rooney up top and play Hererra in midfield ahead of him. 

I'm not bothere at all by Di Maria playing wide. It's where he plays for Argentina, where he's played most of his career to date and playing him <i>and</i> Hererra in midfield together is a recipe for disaster IMO.

4127~~~
It will be interesting to see what the reaction will be if we actually lose to Arsenal with the same formation used in the previous 3 games. Even David Moyes did well against Arsenal. You can see the headlines now. God help us if Danny scores as well.

4128~~~
Shit will hit the fan mate!

4129~~~
You might see the first "Van Gaal out" thread of the season.

4130~~~
God won't move a finger, we already lost our soul.

4131~~~
I don't think I would take loosing to Arsenal.... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Would still keep the faith of course.

4132~~~
I'd also like Danny to score, as long as we win.

4133~~~
I think it will if we just go out to stop Arsenal playing without causing them any significant threat. Yes we drew against Chelsea, when we could have been further behind and they had someone sent off and we got as last minute equaliser. City our defensive brainfart came back again through Smalling and we can say all we like about keeping the score low etc, we didn't score and you don't get points for effort. Crystal Palace knew how to defend against us and it took a change for us to score. If we lose to Arsenal, we are still not capable of beating the big sides.

4134~~~
The media are starting to probe more at LvG. It might be more them that starts stirring the pot, rather than us. Then it will depend if he can keep his cool or if the conferences get seriously feisty. It will be interesting no matter what.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4135~~~
This is my opinion as well. The Palace game was the first time where I was genuinely worried with the direction the team were going in. I loved the diamond and the potential of that system if they can find the correct balance is huge but I understood moving to the 4-3-3 for the Chelsea and City games and agree it was the right move.

The take away for me from the City game (when everyone seemed to be losing their collective Sh!t about Smalling) was that in the first 30 minutes when United were on top and controlling the game there was zero creativity. City were really low on confidence and were there for the taking. I felt sure that for the Palace game there would be more creativity in the side.

I've convinced myself now that the more functional central midfield is to protect the inexperienced back 4 and that Fellaini is being picked for his height at set pieces. Once the defence is sorted it's back to ripping opposition defences apart with creative attacking football . . . I hope! That means Herrera back in the side. My biggest worry with Fellaini for the Arsenal game is that he's a penalty waiting to happen.

4136~~~
So the corset caused Herrera to give the ball away a number of times? 

Van Gaal didn't mention he took Herrera off due to injury, but because he wanted to get Fellaini on the end of Di Maria's crosses.

4137~~~
It's all well and good to pick players on form and tbf none of us has any idea of how Herrera has been in training. You also make a good point about who should be making way because currently RVP has been one of our worse performers. My biggest gripe is with how we are using Fellaini, we seem to want him in the box a lot which means that our attack is now structured around finding him with a deep cross/long ball, we are playing Rooney (by far the more dangerous of the two) deeper to allow for Fellaini's runs and off the ball teams can play through us at will but we have lost our ability to play through them. Frankly I would rather we go back to the gungho ways of the diamond or for Van Gaal to just do what every other manager is paid to do; make the decision to drop Van Persie and play a proper 4-3-3 with one of Rooney/Falcao/Van Persie as a lone striker.
I know it's a drastic and expensive step to keep £1m/week earners on the bench but we will lose more imo if we don't take the bitter medicine now. With the way our defense is now we need the stability a three men midfield offers more than the short term solace of massaging big egos to avoid confrontation.

4138~~~
We bought Herrera for 30M (could be mistaken) and he's looked class in all the games he's played. I can't believe people are really contemplating that LVG doesn't like him. When he's 100% fit he'll be back in the team.

4139~~~
By experience playing with broken ribs or a trapezius tear is a nightmare. Every movement is really painful.

4140~~~
Don't you think Ander would have had a fitness test before the game, though? It's not like we'd play him unless we knew he was fit enough to start.

4141~~~
Really? Players play all the time with injuries. Sometimes in the game they realise they can't play through it.
Ozil apparent played with a ruptured ligament for Arsenal vs Chelsea

4142~~~
A professional game is on another level though. I wouldn't read too much into it I'm sure he'll play soon. Fellaini can do a specific job but that's about it. Besides that he just doesn't offer enough as Herrera does

4143~~~
You remember last season, Rooney against Bayern, Diego Costa against Barcelona, Aguero in the world cup final, Ronaldo in 98 for the world cup final.

4144~~~
Every scenario is different, if the player is coming back from injury then some precautions will be taken. Sometimes injuries occur during the match and the players still play with them. Just to be clear, I'm agree with you.

4145~~~
The fact Herrera came back into the side ahead of schedule and played with the corset shows LVG rates him highly because he wanted him in the team ahead of his other midfield options, including Fellaini, even though he wasn’t 100%.

4146~~~
Yes, and look at the difference of the games you mentioned, (quarter finals, finals, etc) and the importance of those players to their teams. Herrera's good, but he's nowhere near as missed as the Rooney's, Ronaldo's, Aguero's, etc, of this world, in my opinion. 

We played West Brom. If Van Gaal was so worried about getting Ander fit for the Chelsea game, he should have rested him against West Brom. 

I also reiterate, Van Gaal did not take Herrera off because he was injured or feeling pain, but because he wanted to utilize Fellaini's height and physical presence. Had Herrera come limping off I could understand, but he didn't.

4147~~~
I agree that Herrera will most likely be back into the team soon, but I don't like how people are playing down Fellaini's performance since he's come into the team. Had Fellaini not come on and did well against West Brom, I honestly think we would have continued to play Herrera with his corset.

4148~~~
The problem I have now is I spend a lot of my day imagining all our players prancing around in corsets. And the later in the day it is, the sexier the corset.

4149~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4150~~~
To a certain extent, of course. If painkillers, or in Herrera's case, a corset can be used to lessen or get rid of the pain, I'm sure they can still play. Watching Herrera against West Brom, the physical aspect of his game didn't seem to let him down, he just gave the ball away a few times. 

As for Ozil, that was an injury that he picked up throughout game and was asked to be taken off but said no, which is different to Herrera. With Herrera, we knew his injury and were able to treat him accordingly, hence the 3 weeks rest and corset. As for Ozil, once he was diagnosed, Arsenal confirmed he was out for 3-4 month.

4151~~~
That's a bit random. What makes you think he injured his trapezius?

4152~~~
I just mentioned it because i had both and the problem was the same, you only understand your pain and discomfort when you try to go 100%.

4153~~~
Herrera is probably fit now but has simply lost his place to Fellaini. He just put a video playing basketball on instagram the other day and there was no sign of discomfort. I don't think he was 100% fit for that West Brom game and gave a poor performance. Fellaini has come into the team and done well. He has 1 goal and an assist and has not let the team down. It would take a bad performance from him for Herrera to get back in the team.

4154~~~
If is true what they said about his injury, as a medical doctor, I can tell you that he wasn't fit and isn't fit yet. He can run and all this, but contact is a big problem with these kind of injuries.

4155~~~
I suspect its more that LVG is using Fellaini's form to run the rule over him and see what he's capable of and what he isnt. Whether he's going to fit into what LVG wants longterm. While he's in and doing well it makes sense to start him and give him the chance to live up to what you want from your midfielders.

I dont think there's any chance Ander isnt doing what LVG wants and isnt set to be an important starter in his lineups. 

Not unless LVG hates football

4156~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4157~~~
If Herrera is fit he should be in our team. I really hope to see him against Arsenal.

4158~~~
After a while, I've come to realise that Fellaini isn't really replacing Herrera per se. Given our different formation, we have 1 defensive midfielder and two central midfielders (1 old-school box-to-box, 1 dictator). Ever since the West Brom match, Fellaini sealed that box-to-box role whilst the dictator role was taken by Mata and Rooney recently.

Now, we can't expect Fellaini to play like Herrera and try to dictate play from midfield. That's what Mata and Rooney were supposed to do. Having said that, though Fellaini still didn't do well enough to support our wingers as central midfielders should in the setup we've had for the past several matches. Same goes for Mata and Rooney as well. This is where Herrera can be very good at as well as dictating our game from midfield. I really don't know how Herrera couldn't get ahead of Mata and Rooney in the deeper playmaker role in midfield. Herrera's done well in the final third as well as from a deeper area.

4159~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Ander Herrera faces being squeezed out at Man Utd</b></span>

Ander Herrera is weighing up his future at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/english-premier-league/manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a>.

The <i>Daily Express</i> says Herrera could leave Old Trafford as early as January.

The 25-year-old has played five times in the league but four of his appearances came within the club's first six games.

He suffered an injury in the 2-1 win against West Ham at Old Trafford at the end of September and has play just 45 minutes since - in the 2-2 draw with West Brom.

Reports in Italy suggest Herrera could leave the club in January to make way and clear up some funds.


Lol surely these rumours have to be complete BS?? honestly?

He's played well?

Sell Mata and Herrera, bring back Nani and play Fellaini 

MAKES. PERFECT. SENSE.

4160~~~
LVG rushed back Herrera to play against West Brom ahead of Fellaini so unless he's suddenly jumped way ahead of Herrera in 2 games, it's nonsense.

4161~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Actually cannot believe that some papers are suggesting he'll be sold. It boggles the mind how many dickheads there are in the media.

4162~~~
Thats exactly what we were saying when in  Summer 2013 the media were suggesting Jose didnt like Mata and Luiz. It happens, not saying they are right but  its not entirely unfounded that LVG doesnt rate him that much.

4163~~~
But Mata and David Luiz weren't bought under Mourinho.

4164~~~
Wasnt Herrera already agreed before though? Not saying its true but its not always completely unfounded as ridiculous as it sounds at the time.

4165~~~
Van Gaal said in his first press conference that he liked Herrera which is why we signed him. We wouldn't have signed him without his approval. He's not playing because Fellaini has done well and is keeping him out. It's very harsh to drop players who are in form and van Gaal will not do that.

4166~~~
Are we actually discussing something from Tribalfootball and the Daily Express ?

4167~~~
Herrera should be starting ahead of Fellaini. Fellaini has done nothing wrong, but Herrera offers much more creativity in midfield than Fellaini ever could. Fellaini is fine as a battering ram in the opposition box, but he cannot create from midfield, and is suspect defensively. Need to get back to the diamond formation that was played for a few games as this current formation looks horrible.

4168~~~
Apparently, Shaw and Herrera were proposed to him and he agreed for both. He also said that he already knew Herrera and that he was a player that he likes.

4169~~~
We will have to see what side he picks against Arsenal. They are a different type of midfield to Chelsea and City. Fellaini might bully them, but he could also be given the run around and that could be his own downfall, if he get frustrated. We more than likely won't see much of the ball, so will have to be creative when we get it.

4170~~~
If we revert back to the diamond, I think it could be possible for Blind, Herrera, Fellaini and Di Maria to be the diamond. I don't rate Rooney as the tip of the diamond, and Mata's form is erratic. Between the aforementioned 4, there is a lot of balance. Defensive solidity, physical presence, creativity, speed. I'd like to see it.

4171~~~
Based on reports from Italy, I don't think it gets anymore legit than that. He's as good as gone I say.

4172~~~
They need to get this defence sorted as well. They have been an disaster. They are all talented, but three of them cannot stay fit. That is why I don't believe these stories. If I was Rafael, Jones or Evans I would be more worried about still being at United than Herrera should ever be. Rojo was a one of those things injuries and Smalling was just being Smalling. Herrera was another of those things. He cannot be holding Leicester against him as the whole team went into meltdown, especially the one person who shouldn't, the captain. He shouldn't have played in the West Brom game and unfortunately for him Fellaini came on and did well. In the meantime we have had even more injury woes at the back along with Smalling sending off prevented him coming on as a substitute as other changes were needed. He will get his chance. The press are just trying to destabalise the team, not just Ander, but the Falcao stories as well.

4173~~~
Why on earth would there be a report from Italy?

4174~~~
I guess the Italians enjoy a good old transfer story too.

4175~~~
football is so fickle, nothing would surprise you.

one minute we're all thinking Herrera is the key, next min Fellaini is keeping him out, and we're suddenly thinking, och he's not as bad as we thought this lad.

give it a month, and we'll re-assess it all again

4176~~~
Probably, I know he likes Strootman, but to sign him in January would be a hell of a risk. Tbh we need Strootman and Herrera, if we do get into the CL we need a much bigger and more quality squad. The rumours about Hummels, Khedira and Strootman, why does he appear, according to the press, want players with injury issues? Don't forget Vlaar as well. Maybe he likes telling the press how many injuries we have each week.The quality of this sqaud has been allowed over the years to deteriorate, Herrera is a quality signing and is still of value to this squad.

4177~~~
It's our new style of transfer. Buy players in for £30-40m, then sell them for £15-20. Genius work. Mata and Herrera out for £35 combined, and then lash £45m on Falcao who'll have played 12games over the year

4178~~~
It's these bloody international breaks that do it. We start off thinking we are doing well and by the end of it our squad is crap, they are all being sold and the manager is useless. That is what boredom does to you.

4179~~~
If that's the case the Chief Executive needs sacking, are you listening Ed?

4180~~~
A number of journalists will have been idle this fortnight, if not covering England, they will be making up stories right, left and centre about players, not just ours. Especially as coming up to the transfer window. With our injury record I wouldn't be selling anyone in January. It could be it disaster waiting to happen.

4181~~~
I used to really detest international breaks. But the way our last 2 seasons have gone, I'm normally well pleased that we have a chance to get some of our usually huge injury list down a bit.
This season feels really odd though, the smallest number of games we'll have ever played in recent memory!
Superb for me trying to organise my season ticket rota..but generally rubbish!

4182~~~
I remember reading some insider press guy talking about how they get stories, and he simply admitted they'll look at who hasn't played for a while at a big club, and simply make some nonsense up about them.

Give Falcao a couple more weeks out, and it'll all be "Man Utd are looking to exercise their clause to pull out of the deal,.....

4183~~~
Exactly, journalists used to do real research, now they are lazy and just guess and cause disruption in the process.

4184~~~
It really is as simple as that. 
Journos have got to write stories whether there's anything to say or not.

4185~~~
I'm pretty sure we've already had a couple of those...

4186~~~
That's one of the worst transfer rumours I've heard in a while. On par with the ridiculous swap deals that the press always conjure up as if they are an everyday occurrence. As far as I'm concerned Herrera is just being eased back from his injury. No need to rush him back or play him when he isn't 100% considering Fellaini has been decent in his absence.

4187~~~
Especially when you consider the folly of rushing him back in the first place. I'm pretty sure LVG is just being sensible by both playing the form player, Fellaini, and resting the guy whom he sees as the long-term answer, Herrera. Makes sense to me.

4188~~~
Surely if Blind and Carrick are injured Herrera will start against Arsenal?

4189~~~
I wouldn't trust Fletcher back in the team, not for a whole game, pre-illness Fletcher, yes, not now. Knowing Anders luck he will be in goal.

4190~~~
As long as its the Danish one I don't mind.
On a serious note I dread to think what our midfield and defence will look like.

4191~~~
So do I.

4192~~~
Are they injured? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4193~~~
Blind out for 4-6 weeks, Carrick pulled out the England squad. He might be back for Arsenal though.

4194~~~
Anything to sell papers. There's no integrity in football journalism. While people keep buying their papers and clicking on their websites it's not going to change.

4195~~~
You're just stirring here. That's giving you the benefit of the doubt.

4196~~~
Might as well use him at the base of a midfield diamond with Rooney, Fellaini & Di Maria if Carrick & Blind both miss out vs Arsenal.

4197~~~
Swap Rooney with Valencia, and put Rooney as one of the forwards and I think that's what we will go with.

4198~~~
I thought Toni was injured or am I making it up in my head?

4199~~~
Not that I've heard.

4200~~~
Don't think so. Although its probably easier to just assume that everyone is injured atm!

4201~~~
Give it time, it's inevitable.

4202~~~
He didn't play CB last game, so not yet but it may not be long before we see him back there.

4203~~~
So now some german newspaper is saying he's off to Bayern. Probably just paper talk but I'm tired of United signing these players who are "destined" to play somewhere else.

4204~~~
The only solution to that "problem" would be targetting players that aren't good enough for other clubs to be interested.

4205~~~

4206~~~
Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, Vidic, Evra, VDS, are part of the top top players and never was this feeling that they would end up playing at other club.

I have the feeling that the Herreras or De Geas are going to put pressure in signing for other clubs once they become top top class.

4207~~~
Who are these players destined to play somewhere else ?

4208~~~
Weren't Evra and Keane heavily linked with moves to other top European clubs during their time here? Evra certainly admitted he was very close to leaving at one point and I'm pretty sure Keane admitted he seriously considered it too. Maybe we didn't <i>feel</i> like they might move away but our feelings were obviously wrong if they were that close to actually doing it.

Plus when Van Der Sar came here I think everyone pretty much knew we were going to be his last club, no? If he'd been 20 it would likely have been quite different.

4209~~~
Scholes and Giggs were extraordinary youth products and British on top so obviously they will feel much more attached to United than other top players. 
Keane was heavily linked with Bayern and Juve and admits this in his first book. We had to break our wage structure back then to keep him. For all we know a player can be linked with another club every season but still ends up staying at the club for 10 years. Then there's Zlatan, nothing wrong with either, especially in today's world.

4210~~~
Anything new on his fitness issues?

4211~~~
Going off-topic a little.

I saw Ibrahimovic's goal, which I rate as one of the best I've ever seen:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RM_5tJncHww?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Then I saw a few interviews, which show that he has a very high opinion of himself.
In fact, I dont think I have ever seen anybody, in my 40 year life, with such a high opinion of themselves.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HAH8GicUtN0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Take a look at 0m 40s. Most of his interviews are like this.

I'd actually love him to join Man Utd, if only to have LvG cut him down to size.
Apparently, when LvG gets angry, he really hits the fan.
He once shouted so hard at one of his players that his denture fell out.

4212~~~
You have a short memory then, as I recall both these guys being rumoured to be off to other clubs during their time at United. I even think there was some speculation regarding Giggs during the early 2000s. I think you're actually being a bit paranoid. De Gea is the only one of our current lot that I'm a bit worried will end up elsewhere (simply because Real strikes me as the perfect destination for the future Spanish #1.) And for all we know, Real fans may well be feeling the same thing about Bale; that it's only a matter of time before he returns to England.

4213~~~
As well, the nature of media nowadays (twitter rumours, shit sites like givemefootball and the online tabloids,) means that we're subject to every rumour that comes up, no matter whether it comes from an agent or some gimp sitting behind his computer. I remember some lazy rumours flying around after Scholes had his brief falling out with Fergie back in 2001. Imagine the twitter uproar if that had happened during present times.

4214~~~
Aye, in my eyes he could have been the next Cantona.

4215~~~
The Herrera rumours don't seem to stem from him wanting away or clubs wanting him though, they seem to stem from this belief the media have the LvG doesn't rate him.

4216~~~
Is it right that he played in a friendly against Blackpool on Tuesday. That sounds like LvG wants to make sure he is match fit to me. He's such a nice lad, I doubt he is angling for a move. We need to be building this sqaud up not chopping and changing the personel all the time. There will be other players gone before him.

4217~~~
I highly doubt he's angling for a move. In fact, he's the only foreign player at the club who I believe holds us in as much esteem as the English lads. Possibly Rafael and Valencia do too.

Everyone else is here for the money or the lack of opportunities elsewhere, imo.

4218~~~
There's only one of each.

4219~~~
Exactly, didn't he even consider a pay cut to join you guys.

I think Herrera is one of the few who genuinely wants to be at United.

4220~~~
Goodness..rumours about Di Maria, Herrera thinking about options for leaving? They've only been at the club 5 minutes..what on earth is happening to football...

4221~~~
Sensationalism.

4222~~~
International Break.

Thankfully, no more breaks till March.

4223~~~
A bored reported at work.

4224~~~
Any word on him from the presser? Surely he must be fit to play on Saturday?

4225~~~
I think he's been fit for a while, and LVG's just been choosing Fellaini over him recently. He's been on the bench, after all.

4226~~~
Even if he is on the bench, unless there are more injuries or someone is stupid enough to get themselves sent off, he should at least get some game time. He has been unfortunate that the injuries have happened to defenders, so he cannot be used as a replacement. Then the sending offs have been defenders as well. LvG seems to spend most of his press conferences talking about who isn't available rather than who is.

4227~~~
Oh I completely agree that he should be playing. Just pointing out that it looks like LVG actually dropped him, not that he was injured.

4228~~~

4229~~~
Its probably been a mix of both really. Not that Herrera played poorly apart from when he was blatantly injured, but fellaini just took his chance vs Chelsea  and it would be harsh to drop him. Against palace I think Herrera would've played, but we needed height in there because of blind and McNair being pur centerbacm partnershipm

4230~~~
I think he thought Fellaini a better option against the oppostion, City and Chelsea. He was to an extent, but due to other deficiencies at the back it has curtailed our offensive side. Herrera will get his chances, you need all sorts of types and options depending on the game. If we didn't have so many injuries, our squad would be great.

4231~~~
Yeah, I suppose he's just been the victim of circumstances. I hope that stops now though. I realise Fellaini's proven that he can be useful in certain situations and matches, but he shouldn't be a regular starter ahead of Herrera in my opinion.

4232~~~
Seeing his name in the starting line-up on Saturday next to Carrick would boost my optimism for the game.

4233~~~
Fellaini has been selected because LVG has been trying to find that balance defensively and he has provided that whereas Herrera was perhaps found wanting in some games.

Be happy to see him an Fellaini start - both bring varying attributes that would help us and perhaps more importantly both are likely to give that extra bite in CM as Herrera is not shy about putting himself about and Fellaini will just swallow up little Jack up.

4234~~~
I don't think there is any doubt that Van Gaal rates him. When he got injured and fractured a rib, Van Gaal rushed him back and had him play in a protective corset, instead of just playing another midfielder from the start. Unfortunately for Herrera, he didn't play well whilst injured understandably, and Fellaini really stepped up when he finally did come into the side for him.

4235~~~
I'd like to see a midfield trio of Fellaini, Carrick and Herrera on Saturday. Think there'd be a nice balance.

4236~~~
Who'd you play in central defence?

4237~~~
Smalling and Blackett.

4238~~~
Central what?

4239~~~
I agree with your midfield, but why play Blackett instead of Mcnair ? Unless you are playing him because he is a leftie, like Van gaal.

4240~~~
Who plays at LB then?

4241~~~
Yep, I'm assuming van Gaal will pick a left footed centre-back.
Dunno, if Shaw isn't fit to start then obviously Blackett will have to play there.

4242~~~
Yeah, just seen your formation in the match day thread, would probably be the best-case scenario.

4243~~~
This is what I want to see. I have been saying it for quite sometime (as have others). It's unfortunate that there is still this Rooney/RvP situation where both have to play.

4244~~~
Not sure about that. He's been on the bench because we've had no one else. A bit like Carrick being on the bench. In Carrick's case injuries meant he had to play

4245~~~
Yeh, don't understand the argument that people have for van Gaal dropping him. If anything, he rushed him back too quick, he clearly wasn't right to play against West Brom with his rib injury, now he is just biding his time in training. I'm sure once he gets his chance in the starting side, he will stay there.

4246~~~
It's a bit of a shame if LvG has actually "dropped" him, after his horror 45 mins against WBA. That was partly understandable, because he was rushed back and clearly not ready but up until his injury, he was one of our top 3 performers this season. So he should have been back in the starting lineup before then.

The only irritation I have with the situation is that RvP has been stinking the place up for most of the season (bar the odd goal), yet he seems to be invincible, yet someone like Herrera has a terrible 45 minutes, and he's seemingly dropped.

I'd actually love to see Carrick- Fellaini and Herrera in midfield on Saturday, if we're going 4-3-3, with Rooney up top. Doubt there's any chance that's going to happen though, with RvP fit and all.

4247~~~
horror? terrible? he was far from that bad. struggled at times but not suprising considering his injury.

4248~~~
What the hell happened now? Wasn't training today by the looks of it.

What's De Gea doing with a MacBook?

4251~~~
I bet Ander didn't realise a simple selfie could bring so much joy.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4252~~~
Is that a copy of Forbes, that Mata seems to have?

4253~~~
Everytime one these threads gets bumped I pray it isn't because of an injury...

4254~~~
You are totally wrong, agent Dave has orchestrated all that, he knew that we needed that. And organised this selfie.

4255~~~
Forbes, does that belong to Mata?

4256~~~
He's bloody right, we do need our Ander fix.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4257~~~
Wow, got scared there for a moment.

4258~~~
What book is Mata reading?

4259~~~
I mentioned it earlier, Forbes something or other. I thought it was Fables, until I turned my laptop upside down.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4260~~~
So is De gea playing or is he just going there to watch from the stands?

4261~~~
Seems like Forbes, so obviously belongs to Mata!

4262~~~
Intelligent as well as good looking? Very nice.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4263~~~
Oh man I'm glad he's fit (well, he seems to be).

Mata seems to be more interested in the back of Herrera's head than the selfie.

4264~~~
Wow so much you can get from one selfie.
DDG writing his application to RM?

4265~~~
Well if Herrera doesn't start this weekend, given all the injuries, then LVG really <i>doesn't</i> rate him!

4266~~~
Not really. It just means he sees fellaini as more suitable for this game. Carrick will play the holding role so its between Herrera or fellaini, and though obviously I love Herrera, I could see the argument in starting fellaini as well, to bully arsenal basically. Our injuries are all defensive pretty much so they don't impact him.

4267~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B2-Z5DJCMAE7gQv.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B2-Z5DJCMAE7gQv.jpg:large"/>

He can be seen in the background of one of the training videos.

4268~~~
If he doesn't trust Herrera to play the big games.....?  Can't imagine Mourinho taking out Fabregas for Mikkel or whoever for a big game.

4269~~~
Fabregas is a much better player though.

4270~~~
Seems unlikely he'll drop Fellaini against Arsenal, especially given Arsenal's susceptibility to physical bullying and Hair's relatively decent form. I would love to see Herrera play because he is willing to play risky but high reward balls through the defence, and he is always available and wants to be on the ball. Our movement is so much better with him in the team. Given the constant injuries elsewhere, however, it might not make sense to make yet another change and bring him in for this game. 

I trust LVG. I'm sure Herrera will be integrated at some point soon.

4271~~~
I'd argue Fellaini is much better than Mikel as well

4272~~~
Fellainis been in decent form though and you can't deny that he adds some much needed height and strength to a pretty short and weak team. If we had Rio and vidic at the back, I'm sure van Gaal would always play Herrera ahead of fellaini without thinking twice as hes a better player. Sometimes you need something else though, and we all know arsenal are susceptible to height and you can easily bully him. Playing Herrera instead of fellaini, which I hope we do, would be more risky and pretty much just ignoring arsenals weaknesses instead of exploiting them. Personally I'd play them both and use Rooney as the sole striker, but as Rvp and Rooney always play, its either putting Herrera on the right wing for Mata, or between him and fellaini.

4273~~~
Then if it goes wrong LvG will get questioned. Hopefully it won't and Ander will still get his game time. He seems pretty relaxed about things.

4274~~~
<i>Surely</i> he'll start this weekend. There were understandable reasons for each of his recent omissions: easing him back after the rib injury, LVG wanting to include Fellaini for his aerial goal threat or to man-mark or to add height in defensive corners when we were using a makeshift back four.

But none of those reasons apply to this match. He's clearly well past the rib injury. There's no one midfielder pulling all the strings in Arsenal's midfield the way Fabregas or Silva does. And not only is Arsenal's aerial threat unremarkable, but hopefully we'll have a pair of proper CBs to defend against that threat anyway, with big lads like Smalling and Jones available. So there's no particular need to play Fellaini.

<i>Surely</i>.

4275~~~
He is studying or has a business degree, can't remember which. So that explains his choice fappin material.

4276~~~
None of them left.

4277~~~
I like Fellaini recent form but we are really looking stupid by not playing Herrera more.

4278~~~
People said Moyes was stupid for not appreciating RVP more and now look.....

4279~~~
Apart from the fact Fellaini ripped Arsenal a new one just like he did to us whilst at Everton and they are known for hating that type of footballer. He's also proved very good recently. He's also fit and getting fitter. I'm a huge herrera fan but he's not match fit, and he will still be nursing what must now be a bruised rib as opposed to a broken one. One hard challenge and he's walking round like a fairy.....

4280~~~
He should play both and move Rooney to the #9 role IMO.

4281~~~
Can't we play them both though?

------------------------DDG---------------------
Rafael----------Jones-------McNair--------Shaw

Could that work...?

It's not what he had on the table, but he's actually just tweeted he's reading Andre Agassi's 'Open'.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This is the truest thing I've seen in my time here.

4285~~~
Neither has Herrera. Of course, he might be off at some point in the future (other than homegrown players, of whom we have precious few, that's always going to be the case, and not just for us,) but I really wouldn't worry about it. The alternative would be, as someone mentioned, to buy only local and/or players who aren't of the requisite standard.

4286~~~
I am enjoying us playing when he is in the team, hope we see him finally against a better side and how he will cope.

4287~~~
I really hope he's back for the Arsenal game too. He should play in Rooney's spot in midfield with Rooney replacing Januzaj in the wide forward role. Dropping RVP for this game would be crazy.

4288~~~
Arsenal are made for him, they lack physicality which would give him more time on the ball.

4289~~~
You know if we play 4,2,3,1 again, I would really like to see Ander as one of the 3 behind the striker. I know its unlikely because we have Rooney as our number 10, Di Maria and Januzaj on the right and left but I really think Ander's could take any of those 3 positions and play it just as effectively. You might argue he doesn't have the pace but I don't see that being an issue because he has a tremendous football brain and his link up play could help simplify the problem we are having in unlocking defences quickly. I do believe Rooney has to be more courageous at times but if he had Herrera next to him and Di Maria on the other side then I think they can help him gain that extra yard to get into the box with fast interchanging passes.

4290~~~
I thought he was terrible - maybe horror is a bit of an exaggeration but yeah, he was rightly pulled off & I don't think anyone disputes that he was rushed back too soon.

4291~~~
It looks like LVG just prefers Fellaini. 

Amazing.

4292~~~
the writing was on the wall tbh. I said it 2 weeks ago, if he wasnt match fit, he wouldnt sit on the bench. I am absolutely surprised that van Gaal benched him, he played pretty much every game since pre sason before the West Brom game.

4293~~~
I think the useless bunch at the back have done for Ander. If we had a full defence playing he would be in the side. LvG will learn in the end.

4294~~~
Noo. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

4295~~~
I refuse to believe this. I can't believe it, honestly. I don't even think Moyes would do so.

4296~~~
LVG prefers Fellaini because of his height and general big frame.

But there is no reason why you can't get Carrick, Fellaini <i>and </i>Herrara in the same midfield.

4297~~~
Don't be so dramatic. Herreara has been out for a while, chucking him in after a long lay off is a bad idea.

Although, I don't like this three at the back crap, has been a nightmare for us.

4298~~~
Disappointed, it looked like he could be a breath of fresh air in midfield and he started off very well but could now have no future here. Must be very frustrating.

4299~~~
In what universe in Fellaini a better player than Herrera? Absolute farce, Herrera gets benched for afroman.

4300~~~
Exactly this.

4301~~~
Can only do that in the diamond with Di maria in his best position. For any other formation, its either 1 striker and Di maria wide or its Herrera vs fellaini. Herrera wins almost every time for me, but he's just been a victim of circumstance the past month. Broke a rib so lost his place, fellaini played well, and then vs palace and now his height can come in use (for different reasons).

4302~~~
Oh ffs. What on earth does LVG see in Fellaini?

4303~~~
This was the ideal game for him as Arsenal don't have any physicality in midfield. Herrera has the tenacity and skill to match up with Arteta and Wilshire comfortably, we don't need a big lumberer whose elbows are at the head height of their CM's.

4304~~~
You can also say that is ideal for Fellaini as they won't be able to handle him and he could possibly destroy them like he used to do at Everton.

4305~~~
Carrick has been out for much longer. Injury has nothing to do with Herrera being left out.

4306~~~
Fellaini is a good chester of the ball. THat's about it. Herrera is better in every other aspect.

We finally sign a brilliant CM only to put him on the bench. ffs

4307~~~
More like he's odds on to elbow one of Arsenal's minis given they all are at the right height for him to get a red.

4308~~~
Well, it kinda does. Fellaini is a like for like replacement (not as good of course) but has other qualities like his height and strength, which is exactly what Arsenal are weak against. Against Palace you could say we needed height as well because our defence was Blind and McNair, so we really needed that extra height and sstrength to make up for it. Of course, that could all be bollocks but I think it's just the circumstances of Herrera's injury, fellaini's form and the opposition we have played against have given Fellaini the spot for now.

4309~~~
Fellaini is more physical, which is well known to be the way to get to Arsenal. I'm surprised so many of you are surprised by this decision! The only way Herrera was getting into this starting XI was in a wide role. He'll probably be back in the starting XI vs Hull, and probably in place of Fellaini, unless he has an absolute stormer today.

4310~~~
I didn't like movement and 1-2s anyway.

4311~~~
Similar to mata, he also has a very good record for us Moyes played him quite a lot but under LVG he doesn't seem to get a look in

I guess LVG is just racist towards skinny spaniards <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4312~~~
I hope that's all it is cause it's upsetting not seeing Herrera play. Would think he'd be great in this game. Christ I'm worried..

4313~~~
We should play to our strengths. He's started the last 3 games and we've been rubbish going forward in all three. Baffling.

4314~~~
It's not even like Fellaini has been good in any of these, either. A few average performances, none of which have been anywhere near as good as Ander's best.

4315~~~
Exactly and even worse, we're playing our 3rd highest scorer of all time deeper to accomadate him in the team <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4316~~~
We can't play to our strengths with this many injuries. Fellaini is there to shield the young, inexperienced defence. Herrera is obviously a more exciting attacking option, but playing Fellaini is hardly baffling... It's just a bit disappointing!

4317~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This thread overall, Jesus fecking Christ, it's almost as if Fellaini picked himself again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

4318~~~
No one believes that, though. It's just that they don't really rate him and don't want him to play.

4319~~~
Arsenal are weak against good, fast, clever attacks. Ander helps us create with his passing and goals, while closing people high up the pitch. Thats what would worry them

Fellaini up front to physically impose himself on Monreal? Thats different. Because he's not there. But that would be another danger for them. It just isnt on the cards aside from set pieces

4320~~~
Didn't you know Ander isn't allowed to play? The kid just wants to play football and he isn't allowed.

4321~~~
What exactly does Fellaini bring to the team that Herrera doesn't? He's not better defensively, he's not better going forward, he's not even the better tackler and his movement is shite. I don't even buy this 'more physical' theory. Herrera like to get stuck in. You could argue he brings more when it comes to set pieces but that's about it.

4322~~~
What?

I'm not criticizing Fellaini. It's obviously not his fault he's in the team.

4323~~~
He doesn't shield, because he doesn't read danger or track runs. And Ander wins the ball in the middle of the pitch just the same as Fellaini does, in fact Carrick, Blind and Ander have all won more tackles than he has this season

4324~~~
He's capable of doing it when he's on his game, but often he'll switch into lazy mode and not bother.

4325~~~
He doesn't rate him. He'd rather this defensive lineup than play another CM for security.

4326~~~
We have been there before...Young, Valencia...

4327~~~
They have had shitloads of trouble against Fellaini in these first 15 minutes.

4328~~~
Herrera sits on the bench for Fellaini...

It's clear now, he's not injured anymore surely...

/sigh

4329~~~
Physical presence apparently...

4330~~~
I dont think the personal is the problem today. Putting Herrera on for Fellaini in this formation wouldnt change much.

4331~~~
He's incapable. He should be able to learn but doesn't show improvement, even when we played him in the defensive role in front of the defence for a period of time

The same goes for the likes of Valencia at right back. He should be able to learn the basics of the role, but despite playing there plenty of times now he still doesn't do everything required

There are intelligent footballers, and then there are the other guys

4332~~~
I'd put him in the midfield and get RvP off. He might as well not be playing.

4333~~~
This.

4334~~~
It's not about putting him on <i>for </i>Fellaini - it's about putting him on <i>with </i>Fellaini. RVP is completely ineffectual and Rooney is playing some weird man-marking job on Arteta(!). How about: take RVP for Herrera, move Rooney up front next to Di Maria, and let Herrera come in to create a midfield three. Arsenal pretty much have a 5-man midfield, not to mention Welbeck comes deep a lot. So we've got 6 against two - two who happen to be very slow. Crazy tactics.

4335~~~
Yep. Rvp yet again is useless.

4336~~~
Hopefully the likes of him, Mata and Januzaj will get a run out against Hull.

4337~~~
Pretty annoying when Fletcher got the nod over him at the end. Is there any way we can field a team with both Herrera and Fellaini in it?

4338~~~
Can't blame him mate, he was on the bench.

4339~~~
He's basically too short to get in the team right now.

4340~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4341~~~
Has he slept with LvG's daughter?

I hope we see him against Hull.

4342~~~
So annoying watching him not start a single game knowing it's not the injuries. If Van Gaal is so intent on starting Fellaini, he has to drop Rvp for Herrera, simple as that.

4343~~~
I am starting to think LvG is protecting his injury by not revealing anything. He was sorely needed today and he's not played for quite a while. He's our best midfielder and we played some great stuff with him on the pitch.

4344~~~
Im guessing he is still not fully recovered from the rib injury?

No reason otherwise not to be playing him. We will likely see him against hull though. Hopefully Mata too because its precisely the type of match where you know we will need to unlock an 11 man defence.

4345~~~
Should've come on for RVP today, unless he's injured I don't understand why he's not getting a chance.

4346~~~
Yeah It could be, it's the one thing that he is not starting games, but he didn't even get a minute in the last few games. That's a bit strange to be honest.

4347~~~
Fellaini's physicality was more effective alongside Carrick than Herrera would've been imo. I'm guessing that was LvG's logic as well.

4348~~~
Fellaini played well. I'm not arguing about him starting, but I would've brought Herrera on as a sub after we went 1-0 up to add another body in midfield. Unless I'm mistaken, he's not played at all since the WBA game which is strange if he's not injured.

4349~~~
It's weird that we haven't seen him at all which is a shame because I think he's a great player. I wonder what's going on with him.

4350~~~
I think it's just because he's been injured and Fellaini has done well. Playing him today wouldn't of been wise due to him lacking fitness, especially after seeing how we played. I bet he'll return against Hull.

4351~~~
I feel for the lad.

4352~~~
Rib injuries take a very long time to heal. I am sure LVG doesn't want to rush him back too early.
I remember bruising my ribs twice and both times I needed 3 weeks before being able to run without pain,
much less a rib fracture that Herrera suffered.

4353~~~
I would give him a half against Blackburn in the Lancashire Senior Cup on Tuesday, Evans is supposed to be having a runout then.

4354~~~
Likewise. Be great to have him back. I really do think he'll feature at some stage against Hull. It's a better game to bed him back into.

4355~~~
DOnt panic people, he'll be back, Fellaini did good today and LVG probably thought he'd be more useful, but Herrera will be back in the next game I bet. DOnt think LVG doesnt rate him, its just people kneejerking just cause he isnt playing.

4356~~~
If he didn't rate him he wouldn't have tried to rush him back, also with all the injuries I think he is being especially cautious now in not bringing players back too quickly and then losing them for months. In a way the WBA game and Ander might have given LvG a bit of a fright regarding players fitness.

4357~~~
Exactly. It doesnt have to be Fellaini or Herrera,I want to see all 3 of them in there(Carrick as well).

4358~~~
Exactly. Plus we have been all right without him. Although I think he should play. 
Lvg is cautios and given all these injuries he should be.

4359~~~
I have a question and hopefully someone can answer it.
Herrera is currently injured.
It'll be another few weeks till he is able to play 90 minutes.
The last game he played, he was subbed off because he was terrible (probably due to his injury).
So given this information, why are people expecting him to play?
People are also expecting us to play the injured Falcao...while he is injured. 

Am I missing something?

4360~~~
He has been on the bench for the last 4 matches, he can't be that injured.

4361~~~
He might be just filling the bench, could come on for a short time if desperate, but those four games the situations have not been comfortable enough to risk him. I think LvG has become wary of when to bring players back from injury. Especially this the Ander/WBA farce earlier in the season. That might have even made his recovery longer than expected. Hopefully he will get a game against Hull. It might be a good idea to rest a couple of the team now being used, even though they are doing a job, we don't want to risk one of them getting an injury.

4362~~~
I think that Fellaini's form has meant he deserves his spot, and Blind/Carrick preferred as a DM. I was surprised that Fletcher was brought on an Carrick pushed to CM as Herrera is generally far better at retaining the ball which is what we needed at the time.

4363~~~
I am writing this everywere <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>. If they didn't lie about the injury it takes 1-2 months to heal, mostly 6 weaks to 2 months.

4364~~~
LVG, about a month ago, said something about him needing to adopt physically to the English game or something.

Maybe it's that?! He did take Shaw out for awhile also if you remember

4365~~~
I thought about this but that still frustrates me.

4366~~~
Is that another way of saying he's smashing the gym at the minute?

4367~~~
He might we working on beefing him up a bit. He is not scared of tackling, but he may feel he need to be more muscular, not too much I hope, so he doesn't get knocked off the ball. Funny enough him breaking his rib and depending how he broke it, might be what convinced LvG of this.

4368~~~
I'd assume so.

Either that, or Rooney and co. are beating the shit out of him in training everyday. Toughen him up

4369~~~
The Ref ran into him and he broke it.

Not joking

4370~~~
Hopefully for the next game we see something like:
With the front 3 drifting and interchanging as they did today. Get's Di Maria relatively central like he was today, and has Herrera in there as well as Fellaini as he deserves to stay in the lineup. The problem is really playing 2 strikers currently IMO. Put Rooney as the main focal point and we'd be better off for it I think.

4371~~~
Ander might be one of these players who needs a season to get used to the physicality of the league. It can be difficult coming to a league where a lot of teams have pub players whose only job in life is to send you into row Z.

4372~~~
I think that would be fine, with Carrick and Fellaini giving a bit of strength in midfield and Ander giving the energy and intelligence.

4373~~~
Touch dramatic, no? Why don't we wait until the end of the season before starting the doomsday prophecies.

4374~~~
Why isn't he playing? I am actually baffled as to why he doesn't even get subbed on anymore. He's our best proper central midfielder.

4375~~~
How can you possibly know that? He played something like 5 games for us.

4376~~~
Blind hadnt played many more and that was the popular belief? I could tell you right now Vidal after 90 seconds could be called that also....

4377~~~
Because he is.

4378~~~
Yes because Vidal has been instrumental for a top European team over a number of seasons. Herrera played for a second tier team and no top team showed any interest in him bar us. He has loads of potential and might turn out to be a wonderful player but this is simply way too premature especially when we have Carrick who has been a mainstay for a team that won 5 titles and a CL medal.

4379~~~
He has not good a look recently and has not even been brought as a substitute. Even Fletcher seems to be ahead of him now which is ridiculous, and it isn't because of injury. It is pretty clear to me that van Gaal doesn't like him, a part of me thinks he is going to move him on so he can accomodate Strootman - if Herrera was playing well consistently van Gaal wouldn't have the reason to sign Strootman.

4380~~~
It made sense as Fellaini is more physically imposing. That's how you beat Arsenal.

4381~~~
Ander the new Kagawa then?

4382~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

He's a midfielder that we've been missing for ages. Fellaini was the right choice today but I definitely think he'll become the more integral player.

4383~~~
yes, with the difference that Athletic wont take him back, so no #FreeAnder.

4384~~~
Also, it would hardly be fair on Fellaini to drop him considering his form. Herrera will get chances because he is a good player.

4385~~~
Surely has to come in soon? The 'battler' games are nearly out the way.

4386~~~
The result was the only positive today, the quality of football was dire so i hope to see Herrera back in the side soon. 

You could argue away at Arsenal is not the most ideal game to put him back in the team, so i understand LVG's thinking, but after today he should give Herrera a start in the next match.

4387~~~
I wish one of the journo's would ask LVG what's going on with Ander, is he still not 100% or has he just been dropped.

4388~~~
He doesn't talk about individuals.

4389~~~
Yeah I'd like that too. It's a shame he hasn't even come off the bench in the last few weeks. Hopefully we see him again sometime soon. Still think Carrick, Fellaini and Herrera would be our best midfield.

4390~~~
Van Persie needs to be replaced by Herrera.

4391~~~
I'm all for it too. It's one thing to let his rib injury heal, but this is getting ridiculous to see him on the bench for 3 games in a row without earning a single minute of playing action. If he's not fit, then he shouldn't be on the bench. However if he is fit enough, there should be very little reason to drop him considering how the rest of our central midfielders are not even on par with him.

4392~~~
As much as I want the guy to be playing I can only see him in a number 10 role for us at the moment. Would like to see this vs Hull:

-------------De Gea-------------
Raf---Smalling--Jones--Shaw
------------Carrick--------------
-----Fellaini--------Di Maria-----
------------Herrera---------------
-------Rooney-------Wilson------

I really like him but Fellaini has been very solid for us and can't be dropped, he also has the issue of Mata, Januzaj and Rooney playing in the number 10 spot but it's the only place I can see him fitting in at the moment.

4393~~~
I had thought LvG was protecting his rib injury, but now I think he's just been dropped. Disappointing. I think we lack fluidity without him.

4394~~~
We played Fellaini over him in the Palace game at home and we really lacked the cutting edge, tempo and pace Herrera provides. I don't think Fellaini offers anything that is necessarily needed over Herrera in these sorts of matches.

4395~~~
Bulking him up a bit I reckon.

4396~~~
Start him ahead of Van Persie in the next game. We need more control in midfield.

4397~~~
This. Herrera looked absolutely miles off the pace in most games he's played for us bar 1 or 2. I can't see him getting much football this season. Next season he should start to make an impact. I wouldn't pick him often if I was LVG this season

4398~~~
What are you talking about? WBA was his first bad game for us, and he was injured there.

4399~~~
Luckily for us, you aren't.

4400~~~
Don't want. He should be on the pitch, and nothing less.

4401~~~
Spot on. Let Mata and AdM play behind Rooney as lone striker and include Herrera in the mid.

4402~~~
Which games are you talking about?

4403~~~
No one worried about the Bayern rumours?

4404~~~
No way. I thought he was our best player after Di Maria in the matches he has played. He goes forward and puts in a defensive shift.

4405~~~
Poor Mata, thought he came here to get regular football.

4406~~~
I'm more worried about the Xaquiri rumours (overrated).

4407~~~
Well to be fair, the only reason I'm not scared is because
1) Even we're not dumb enough to sell to Bayern without it being a swap deal or some sort
2) They're midfield is stacked anyway; they don't need another midfielder.

4408~~~
Yes, and while we are at it we ought to loan Di Maria to Sunderland so he can get used to the new league. I think it will be 4 to 5 years before we can start playing Herrera week in week out.

This is nonsense. WBA was his only truly bad performance this season, otherwise he has been good for us. It is not really that often that footballers need a full year to adapt to the new league.

4409~~~
Why is he not playing though? Due to poor fitness or form? When he has played I've thought he is our most useful signing this season.

4410~~~
IMO van Gaal just decided he doesn't like him so he won't start. If there is a manager who can make bold decisions without feeling the need to explain them it is van Gaal. He had made similar decisions before.

4411~~~
People are so impatient, I'm positive he will start v Hull.

4412~~~
That is the thing i dont understand. If there was one player having no problems with van Gaal, it shoud be him. He is versatile, can play as a 10 or 8, relentless, technically very good and has experience with a similar system. I really dont get it why he suddenly fell in the pecking order.

4413~~~
£5 he does not.

4414~~~
It's like when he gave Shaw longer to get fit, people were saying he didn't rate Shaw. Same thing happening with Herrera. Realised he shouldn't have brought him back with the rib injury, now giving him time to get fit but just hasn't been able to bring him yet. Fellaini has been doing well.

Herrera will start v Hull, it's the perfect opportunity for him to come back. I am willing to take any bet on that.

4415~~~
See above.

4416~~~
I dont believe this at all. I think after his injury and our injury problem hes being a bit more cautious about bringing him back too early. A cracked rib can take at least 6 weeks to really recover and given how bad he was against West Brom i understand that he might not want to risk him again.

Also lets not completely discount Fellainis good form for us. LvG seems like the type of manager who will pick players on form and telling other players to prove him wrong and fight for their place

4417~~~
It is impossible understanding Van Gaal, to be fair. He is a great manager but he makes some really weird decisions (which may or may not be the right ones).

4418~~~
Cliche, I know, but I just think Van Gaal realized he needs that bit of power and physicality in the PL and Fellaini is the one providing it. There's simply no place for Ander in the starting XI right now. Simple as that.

4419~~~
the rumours from the sunday express about swapping him with Shaqiri are annoying me.I know rumours and all that, but the fact that they are out there for weeks now are just making me sick.

4420~~~
same here, £5 he wont start against Hull.

4421~~~
He scored goals and was sublime pre injury. The telling thing here is lack of substitute minutes. Protecting him from injury in my opinion.

4422~~~
If LVG is serious about giving players a good chunk time to prove themselves fit and ready to go, then he should have done the same to a certain Dutch striker here... basically throwing him on the bench if not in the reserves.

Our current approach has fecking no pace nor quick passes in midfield. We are trying to get rid of our zombie football and I'm not sure Fellaini, despite the solid performances he put recently, is the kind of player who would help us completing that transition into something more fluid.

4423~~~
The fact that the express are reporting he's off makes me think he'll sign a new contract this month even though he's in his first year.

4424~~~
I'm not that worried LvG doesn't want to play him. I think he is not 100% fit and LvG does not want to play him while he is not 100% fit. Also the moment he chose for a 3-5-2 formation, Herrera was benched. He lacks the physicallity at the moment to be of great defending use. So because of that Fellaini payed instead of him. Carrick and Di Maria are starters no matter what. In a 4-4-2 formation, there is room for Herrera. In a 3-5-2 there simply isn't.

4425~~~
He looked really good in preseason for us, and in the early stages of the season too. It's a tad unfair to extrapolate any conclusions about his physicality given that we don't have that many games to judge him on. Personally though, I think he seemed fit and strong enough for me to handle the league, seems like a real fighter and has that extra bit of quality. Really hope he takes the next chance he gets. 

Not sure why we've put him on the bench if injury is the reason he hasn't played if we have/had zero intention of bringing him on. With Blind out I really think we can accommodate him, Fellaini and Carrick in the same team but yes a bit of rotation in the Hull game should see him get his chance.

4426~~~
There's no way he'll be involved in a swap deal. You can't judge a player after a handful of matches and so far he does look as though he'll be a good signing so this just doesn't make sense at all. Newspaper sensationalism once again.

4427~~~
Well he really isn't. How many 50/50 tussles did he win against Ramsey, Oxlade, Wilshere, Arteta etc... Not many. He offers an aerial threat, sure, but he definitely isn't offering any real 'physicality'. I'd rather have Ander's bite and grittiness, to be honest. He's more than capable to play in the big, bad, mean premier league.

4428~~~
I'm not going on these reports but I don't think LVG rates him. Or at least he thinks we need something different in this league. 

Which, if true, brings me back to my pet peeve. We apparently bought him based on the judgement of the last manager, who we deemed not good enough, and then asked LVG to sign off on it. I'm presuming he hadn't scouted him in that much depth prior so he trusted the judgement of the club. So if he now decides it was a mistake it'll just have been an utter waste of time and money. You either allow the manager to choose the players or not. This halfway house we operated during the summer where it appears he was getting players identified by the previous regime and also possibly players Woodward was doing deals for, like Falcao, just seems like it always had a high risk of going wrong.

I'm sure Van Gaal can and does explain to Herrera what he likes and what he doesn't like about his game. Him liking or not liking a player is a matter of analysis, not of gut feeling. Than it's clear for the player what he needs to improve.

Surely he doesn't feel the need to explain it to the press, because he protects his players and his not going to tell the whole world about their weaknesses.

4430~~~
SAF has said he was looking at him, so Moyes might actually have been going on his recommendation.

4431~~~
This. Hull have powerful midfielders in huddlestone and Livermore. Fellaini will keep his place

4432~~~
Might as well try him as the #10. 

Both him and Fellaini can alternate ahead of Carrick.

4433~~~
People supposedly think Van Gaal doesn't like him, yet he started every game while he was fit? It's a matter of fitness and finding the correct game to carefully bring him back. Fairly confident he'll feature against Hull.

4434~~~
Carrick might not though.

4435~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Louis Van Gaal is preparing to capture his first January signing ahead of the opening of the transfer window with a deal for Bayern Munich attacker Xherdan Shaqiri.</b></span>


The Switzerland international has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League, with the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool all reportedly showing an interest in the winger.



According to the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/538729/Ander-Herrera-set-for-Man-Utd-exit-as-Van-Gaal-accepts-Bayern-s-Shaqiri-swap-deal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Express</a>, United are set to secure the signing of Shaqiri by allowing summer signing Ander Herrera to move in the opposite direction. German giants Bayern are keen to add another central midfielder to play alongside Xabi Alonso and have expressed an interest in the former Athletic Bilbao star.



Injuries have hampered his progression at United since his £30 switch, and Pep Guardiola is close to sealing the switch which would see Shaqiri and £7m head to Old Trafford.



Van Gaal has already spent £150m since his arrival at United, and is prepared to continue bringing in talent from across the world to bolster his side.



Selling someone less than six months after buying them, plenty of patience at United obviously.


Another player in a position we don't need.

We have enough up front at the moment, we need to focus on the Defence and then still need another CM, not get rid of the ones we have...

4436~~~
Actually I think Shaqiri would be a good move as we need some quality in the wide attacking positions.

4437~~~
If this is LVG's thinking then I feckin' despair. Fortunately I doubt it is though.

4438~~~
Finally get a midfielder who looks like he can pass the ball forwards, and score a few goals, and then move him on after 4 months?! luckily it's the Express so it can be safely dismissed.

Wouldn't mind Shaqiri though.

4439~~~
We have no alternatives with Blind injured

4440~~~
I could see van Gaal going for that. Shaqiri is the sort of player he likes to have and he would fit a 433 perfectly. It would be silly though because if he gave up on Herrera now it means he was never a fan, why agree a £30m transfer he doesn't like? Shaqiri is not worth more than £15m now so we would make a significant loss. That and swap deals never happen.

4441~~~
Shaqiri really would be a Liverpool type of signing tho. 

He isn't really the type of wide player we need too.

4442~~~
What about our vice captain?

4443~~~
Perhaps its more that Ander is in demand and Fellaini isn't. So if LVG can add a player he wants, he's willing to use him and use what he has left in CM

Sadly needs to become our former vice captain

4444~~~
Napoli went in for Fellaini publicly IIRC at the summer and now with his form coming back can see decent interest. And we should have enough money to buy another if we want.

This all seems made up rumors as Herrera is out of the team right now. He got injured during which he had that one poor game and since then Fellaini has been playing well and keeping his spot. It also helped that we needed height and more physique in the team.

4445~~~
Yeah, I'm of the exact same opinion.

Shaqiri would be a great player for a lot of teams and I'm sure he would improve us up front.

However..

We have needed a creative CM good on the ball and that can score goals for a long time and we finally have it, unless he has a very good alternative lined up we shouldn't be getting rid.

He should be putting his focus into a defender now anyway.

4446~~~
I said yesterday Strootman might be his target and van Gaal might be willing to sacrifice Herrera to grant his wish.

4447~~~
£30million midfielder who can't even get ahead of Darren Fletcher <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, Dunno what he does in training these days, but I refuse to believe we've actually splashed that much money on someone we don't even use wdf?

I would like to see him have a run in the team now, but he needs to offer more protection to the defence, because second half against Leicester and West Brom he was shocking, but seeing as our midfield literally still can't control games, I think we need to give Herrera another run in the team to prove himself, I would also like to maybe see him further forward ahead of Fellaini and Carrick because no one in our midfield presses and it's annoying to see us over run every game.

4448~~~
There's absolutely no chance LVG doesn't fancy him. It seems just like a similar situation to Shaw at the start of the season to me, except recovering from the rib injury rather than general fatigue.

4449~~~
Its hilarious people are taking an article written in the Express with any credibility whatsoever.

4450~~~
They wanted him on the cheap/on loan and didnt want to pay his wages. Else he'd be there now

Quite the contrast to a club like Bayern wanting to buy you

4451~~~
Is the ghost of Princess Di not a reliable transfer source?

4452~~~
I'll take one of you up on 5 quid.

4453~~~
He has to be lacking fitness/sharpness.

4454~~~
The Express ? What's the point in even discussing it.

4455~~~
Honestly, if LVG has lost faith in Herrera then ice lost faith in LVG.

Dramatic, but it's that stupid a decision.

4456~~~
This is precisely how bullshit propagates on the internet.

- A tabloid invents a click bait story out of thin air

- Someone posts it on a forum or social media

- Others discuss the merits as if its a legitimate story that warrants a degree of analysis.

- Like clockwork, at the beginning of the next summer window, someone will hark back to when we were "linked" with Shaqiri as if a bullshit fabrication by a rag is a real link

- Repeat and rinse.

4457~~~
Well we play Stoke 3 days later so maybe van Gaal might just rest Fellaini against Hull.

4458~~~
Or that VG thinks is better/only suited to play as an attacking midfielder. If that is the case, and with captain Rooney in the kind of form he is in, Herrera would find himself on the bench alongside Mata for a lot longer.

4459~~~
We started to get goals from midfield and lo and behold we are back to relying on Rooney to get the goals. Madness. RvP should be benched and Wilson is not ready yet for taking full responsibility for playing at CF. We need to strengthen at the back not another slightly above average winger with a not great attitude. Regarding physicality, there are plenty of players in this league who are built like Herrera. He just has to get used to the league like most new players. Hell, Victor Moses is built like a brick outhouse and he struggles with the physicality the way he is always falling flat on his face.

Also looking at the purchases Liverpool have made, I wouldn't want any player they were linked with.

4460~~~
It's also at home, so I would expect us to have more time on the ball against Hull. Not to mention Steve Bruce has always approached games against United a bit tentatively. He's one of the few managers left in the league who we can rely on to be wary against us now. 

(now watch them attack us from the very first minute and win 3-2 <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>)

4461~~~
It would be that rib injury, I am guessing. He is training, but won't be 100% match fit to start games.
Herrera hasn't played as an AM for us - till now. And anyway, with the kind of form Fellaini is in currently (touchwood), and Herrara's ribs, guess LvG is taking the safest option right now, so as to give proper time for Herrera to heal and be fit.

4462~~~
Hey, I agree with you. The whole thing baffles me. 

I can understand the need to strengthen down the midfield as we looked porous in the Leicester City game. Thought Herrera would be asked to play a more disciplined role, but seems like he has been given the shaft. How imposing is Cesc compared to him? Or was Scholes? 

The Shaqiri rumors should be nothing but the usual crap.

4463~~~
We're playing Hull at home. If we're not going to start our best CM because Hull have powerful CM's of the calibre of Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore then Herrera might as well pack his bags.

Only United could sign a type of CM we've needed desperately for so many years only to drop him after a game where he shouldn't have fecking played.

4464~~~
There is something about our midfield that makes managers go mental. First Ferguson neglected the issue for several years while fielding Anderson, Cleverley, even O'Shea in midfield, then Moyes brought Fellaini who was clearly not up for the position last year and now van Gaal might have just decided to drop our first good midfielder since, well, Carrick, for no clear reason whatsoever and seems to place Fletcher over him.

4465~~~
I think it's just being safe, because he isn't a 100% fit after his injury.

4466~~~
Nah, I was buying that before Arsenal game, for him to not even come from the bench against Arsenal where we clearly needed to bolster the midfield was very strange. Maybe van Gaal wants him to improve certain areas of his game and won't start or play him until he does.

4467~~~
Well, he has been playing RvP and Fellaini time and again.

4468~~~
That's the problem, the club keep the fans so much in the dark over injuries. We don't know how bad a break it was, how much more damage the corset did against WBA, if the muscles got damaged as well, how much bruising there was. He keeps saying Ander wasn't what he called fit. He couldn't play, so he wasn't fit. It is not like Rojo who even though he has a dislocation, he can still run and keep fit that way. Ander would not be able to.

4469~~~
What has Fellaini done to not deserve his place?

4470~~~
He might want him to be more disciplined on the defensive side. There again Fellaini has no idea when people are running off him.

4471~~~
Fellaini does deserve to play, but with him and Carrick it slows the middle down and Ander is a better passer and gets us playing quicker. If RVP wasn't in the side, there would be room for both of them.

4472~~~
Why are you thinking that? I think it's very likely that he just isn't fit enough yet.

4473~~~
That's fair. If Herrera doesn't start against Hull then I think LVG may not rate him that highly, maybe he's waiting to combine him with Falcao, who knows?

4474~~~
I am not saying that he doesn't deserve his place. He has come leaps and bounds since the disaster of last season. I was just countering the fact that Herrera needs to learn some aspects of the game, because with him, our tempo was completely different compared to right now, and probably with Herrera in the team, it brought the best out of everyone.

4475~~~
He's on the bench, he's fit enough.

4476~~~
I think it is Rafael he has a great understanding with. Unfortunately Rafael cannot stay fit. If he comes back, we might see both of them.

4477~~~
It will be interesting to see who starts when everyone is fit. For me Herrera should be in our best 11, I'm starting to think LVG thinks otherwise.

4478~~~
Our tactics against Arsenal was to hurt them on counter attacks and we were doing okay. Fellaini was doing his job so why change it. Only player who didn't do his job was RVP and he came off for Wilson. Fletcher came on to protect our lead when Young was to tired.

People are making to much about Herrera not starting matches. He will be in first team sooner rather than later. ATM Fellaini is doing great and Rooney too. Herrera is competing with those two for his place in the first team in that formation. But i think he will get back in the first team as soon as we established regular back four. It is good that we gave him time to recover.

4479~~~
Don't think so, just on the bench for emergencies (Fellaini gets sent off and Carrick injured for example).

4480~~~
I sincerely hope he's actually injured and not been dropped because otherwise Van Gaal has lost it.

4481~~~
Well, that escalated quickly...

4482~~~
So Carrick gets injured in the first minute? Then what? What's the point in having an unfit player on the bench when we already have cover for central midfield on the bench and Rooney who can cover that position when needed?
Our bench on Saturday was Mata, Januza, Young, Herrera, Fletcher and Wilson, Herrera is 100% fit IMO.

4483~~~
It's not 100% unfit or 100% fit. If really needed he could play, but we just didn't want to take the risk, since there's still an elevated injury risk. IMO there was no need for us to risk him against Arsenal. Especially not in the 89th minute, when it was all about being physical and defending and Fletcher came on.

4484~~~
It's possible he's not match fit. Carrick wasn't match fit even when he was on the bench until we had no choice but to bring him on.

4485~~~
I don't believe for a second LvG doesn't rate Herrera.

4486~~~
As soon as we have a more balanced and settled back 4, with more experience, we will see Herrera.  LvG has to protect the back 4 as best he can at the moment and Carrick and Fellaini are the best of the match fit candidates to do that.
Like most people, I'd love to see him start against Hull City.  Carrick looked knackered at the end of the Arsenal game.

4487~~~
Surely with all the injuries we have at the moment LvG is not going to risk anyone he doesn't feel is 100%, yes he was on the bench, but he didn't really have a choice. Herrera will play when LvG feels it's right, we can't risk things becoming worse because the fans need pleasing. He is a great manager who knows what he is doing, anyone else in his position might not do the same. I respect the fact that he doesn't play anyone who is less than capable of putting in their best performance. Herrera will be back for Hull and I can see Falcao back for Stoke.

4488~~~
He's been on the bench since we played Chelsea on the 26th October. If he was so unfit he wouldn't be on the bench for so long. If he was so unfit we would have had Pereira on the bench instead of him yesterday. I think it's a simple case of LVG not wanting to start or play him.

4489~~~
Has anyone on here broken ribs before? 

There is your answer.  On the bench or not, he's not fit to be playing a professional football match.

4490~~~
Exactly, I know people who have broken ribs and it can be painful just breathing...never mind running around a football pitch for 90 mins, would be agony

4491~~~
1. As a general rule, player swap rumours are almost never true.
2. Manchester United and Louis van Gaal won't kick out a player, who's been at the club for less than six months.
3. Pep Guardiola at Bayern already stated that there will be no further additions to the squad in the winter break.
4. Herrera is not Bayern quality and Shaqiri can be sold to a number of clubs without having to put money on the table for a player we don't need.

The rumour is most certainly BS.

4492~~~
If this is the case then why would he be on the bench? I'd question LVG and why he's wasting a spot on the bench.

4493~~~
5.  Daily Express

4494~~~
Carrick was out for over 3 months and couldn't train, Herrera was 3 weeks and could, I don't think his match fitness would play to big a part? Obviously can't be sure though.

4495~~~
Has a journalist still not queried LvG about it yet?

4496~~~
I think the Leicester game made LVG realise we can't play the diamond formation with our defence, which Herrera did so well in, this also coincided with Herrera's injury and Fellaini's excellent form. Fellaini, Carrick, Di Maria and Rooney won't be dropped any time soon so Ander will be seeing a lot of the bench.

4497~~~
I think Herrera might still have some pain. He was good before his injury but poor with that protecting corset. Maybe LvG think's he better returns fully fit.

Herrera has a future at our club, he's quality. Would be totally stupid to let him go!

4498~~~
Yep. I'm surprised that he's even on the bench to be honest. He had a very good start to the season and then got injured. I can't believe for one second that LVG now doesn't rate him. It makes no sense.

4499~~~
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Then people ask why we keep playing slow zombie football. It's nowhere surprising with these two in there, no disrespect to Fellaini's recent performances. We are in a dire need of a spark in midfield in order to have us play the way we are supposed to play, a.k.a. attacking the opposition by dropping the hammer on them with quick and accurate passes.

Having said that, playing Carrick, Fellaini and Herrera as out 3-man midfield would be more than fine by me in the current situation.

4500~~~
I really, really, really, REALLY hope we see Herrera start in the next match. If we dont I might be reduced to such an extreme state of mental fragility I might start believing what is written in The Express.

4501~~~
And were would you play Rooney then. Especially when Falcao come back. Rooney showed against Arsenal how good he is in that midfield/number 10 role. For me this is the best position for our, at least ATM, best player. 

When LVG described his system in one of the interviews he said that he like to play with real number 9 and not a false 9 like Barcelona. If you put Rooney uptop he is best described as false 9. And i think this is why LVG said that he was not happy with Rooney playing as a striker.

As i said before i think, when we established regular back four, Herrera will come in the first team. I think he will replace Fellaini. But i think his recovery is a priority ATM. People should be happy that we have options for midfield.

4502~~~
That's the hilarious part, we have been moaning for years about the midfield, now we are still moaning when we have all these choices.

4503~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4504~~~
It speaks bad about LVG the fact that he can't get this guy playing, Herrera is what we have been missing for years and once we have it we are going to lose it to Bayern to get another wide player? Why?

4505~~~
Im sure there will be reasons but no way he's match fit.  Breathing is difficult post broken ribs.  I believe he will have him on the bench in the event of an injury to Fellaini but he is most likely playing with a corset which will restrict him. 

He'll be back soon enough.

4506~~~
You really believe that?

4507~~~
It's about having options for a squad. If all goes to plan, next year we will be in Europe and have a lot more games to play. Herrera isn't really a #6, he's in competition at the moment with Fellaini for the #8 role. Fellaini has been in good form, and offers a physical presence against the better teams that Herrera doesn't. Also, he's had a broken rib. 

He'll be back. Wouldn't surprise me to see him get some game time against Hull, then start the fixture after.

4508~~~
I just want to see him being played.

4509~~~
Me too. But it's probably a combinaton of injury, Fellaini being decent and possibly our defensive misfortunes.

4510~~~
Honestly think Playing Rooney as a striker and putting Herrera as the 10 would be better. He showed he has an eye for a pass in pre season. Also has the work ethic to help us dominate too.

4511~~~
You could very be correct.

4512~~~
Van Gaal probably just feels a little bit of pressure because of his poor start. The last time he started Herrera he was clearly unfit and performed poorly. Does he really want to risk a half fit player (whether half fit because of injury or lack of game time), at a time when we need points on the board? Probably not.

We have an easier run of fixtures now so I think we'll see him feature against Hull (60 mins) and if he does decent then start against Stoke.

4513~~~
I really hope he is part of our future plans. Swapping him for Shaqiri sounds like a very bad idea and I hope this is just the usual bs.

4514~~~
Does anyone else remember the interview where Herrera said that LvG had instructed to play deeper than he was used to? It wouldn't surprise me if he's been doing extra sessions to get him accustomed to playing the Scholesy role.

4515~~~
Who is he going to put on the bench?  Pearson?  Rothwell?  The guy selling prawn sandwiches?

4516~~~
I was thinking of Pereira but those two as well. I'm not sure why it's so difficult to comprehend.

4517~~~
Tom Thorpe too as we had no defender on the bench.

I can not believe that Ander would be on the bench for the last 4 matches if he wasn't fit. Maybe the first match or two but its been a month of him sitting on the bench, no way we are wasting on a bench spot on him if he is injured and hurts when he breathes.

4518~~~
Pearson and Rothwell are not good enough yet, no matter what all the ones who watch the kids think, probably McNair and Blackett aren't either, but needs must. He isn't going to risk even more kids on the bench if he can help it. I hate all this a kid has a good game against somebodies U-12's and they are ready for the first team rubbish, because that's what United do. No they only bring kids in if we are desperate i.e. the defence or they are exceptional, Class of '92.

4519~~~
Sorry, but the guy selling prawn sandwiches is not an option any more. He has been chosen for Liverpool's starting line-up on Wednesday. It'll be another Brentanesque piece of genius.

4520~~~
I think he isn't match fit and none of these games we have been in such a strong position to bring him on to get that fitness. Saturday LvG would have been desperate to get that first away win. I am a bit surprised he hasn't tried him in the U-21's. There again, the U-21's don't exactly play regularly, it is a crap league.

By the way is Tom Thorpe L or R footed? I am actually surprised he wasn't picked over both McNair or especially Blackett.

Also I think the boss is in a Catch 22 situation, that he would like to put him on, but due to the players he is picking and the loss of goal threat from RvP we are not getting in a strong enough position. Yet if he picked Ander we would probably score more goals, but the defence would not as yet get the protection. Earlier in the season, nobody was worried about that, but now we seen happy to not concede but be a bit boring going forward. I want to win, but would rather it was a bit more exciting to watch.

4521~~~
Hasn't Pereira been on the bench multiple times recently?

4522~~~
I like Herrera but he is definitely a player who seems to have grown more and more in stature as he has been out.

Good player who will become important for us, but he doesnt have all the answers to all the issues right this second.

Regarding him not being in the team, I am confident it is just fitness and that LVG doesnt want to drop Fellaini for him in a 2-man midfield. If we revert to a 3-man midfield then I would love to see Fellaini, Herrera and Blind/Carrick together,

4523~~~
He played in a BHC match against Blackpool last week. 

Thorpe is right footed.

I'd agree with that, I definitely think van Gaal rates him but due to the tough opposition lately and Fellaini playing well he just hasn't been able to get him into the line-up.

4524~~~
LvG has said, regarding Falcao that he likes them to have a couple of comeback games before coming back into the first team, that is why I wondered if it would be a good idea for Ander to have another game tomorrow against Blackburn.

4525~~~
Shaw was on the bench and Van gaal was still saying that he wasn't fit enough, the same with Carrick and Falcao, i think that Van gaal is a weird human being with a very strange logic.

4526~~~
I think we have sussed that one out. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4527~~~
A lad I played amateur rugby with when I we as younger broke quite a few ribs during a game he was rushed to hospital mid game and had to undergo surgery he was out in a week he was back playing within 4 weeks.

Unless Ander broke his whole damn rib cage then there's no reason for him Not to be playing now. Unless the lad hasn't been drinking his milk for strong bones which will be slowing the repairs down

4528~~~
Christ. Take some Midol and have a lie down.

4529~~~
When Shaw was on the bench, I'm assuming that if need be he could play. Maybe he is strange but I'm just struggling to see why he'd put Herrera on the bench if he didn't think he was capable of playing say 15 minutes.

I totally get that but surely it's better having a kid on the bench who's fit than a senior player who can play no part?

He's not been on the bench since the Chelsea game.

4530~~~
Hah. We have fooled Liverpool. That guy got injured last week.

4531~~~
So 3 games?

4532~~~
He can still make prawn sandwiches making him more useful than Slippy.

4533~~~
I wonder if we've put him on an extensive weight training regime in this period post the rib injury. Would be a wise move while we wait for his injury to fully recover. Could do wonders for his mentality to toughen it up and give the stick back a bit like it did for De Gea.

4534~~~
think he has done well whenever he is on the pitch. it is understandable if van gaal chooses fellaini ahead of herrera though, especially for games which we need some physical presence.

at this moment i think herrera would suit us when we are playing at home, while fellaini when we are away.

4535~~~
Any concrete information on when he will play. He is costing me in my lineup predictor, and I missed his play style. (But not that we can say we missed him in terms of results, as defense seems heaps better compared to the Herrera di Maria midfield)

4536~~~
I wish he'd get on his twatter like Falcao and shut these constant transfer rumours down.

4537~~~
It's obvious Van Gaal has not been impressed by him so far. At least a LOT less impressed than most people on the caf.

Hopefully Hererra can turn things round but about time people faced facts and stopped looking for excuses (broken ribs) when the truth is much more simple.

4538~~~
The last thing you want to be doing with a rib injury is chucking weights about.

4539~~~
After reading through all the various theories, I believe the one that appeals to me most is the fact that we've had an absolutely torrid time at the back with injuries, fielding what could be our 19th and 20th choice combinations in theory, and LVG has decided has 2 DMs would allow us to cope better.

4540~~~
no white text?

On serious note- we know shit all for sure. 
Not bothered about the rumors at all.

4541~~~
I am actually beginning to think that is the most reasonable explanation. Our fragile defence is hampering our attacking play. I can see a couple of them going in the summer, unless they can go on a run of no injuries.

4542~~~
Exactly, we are all speculating when we actually no nowt.

4543~~~
Sherlock.

4544~~~
Aye. I think it's partly because of how Herrera has done for us, although I think he has mostly been good and should be allowed much more time to adapt. He has shown glimpses of a very good midfielder and is way better on the ball than anyone we have. There's absolutely no way he should be behind Fletcher in pecking order and he's probably far better than Carrick right now too. On current form Fellaini deserves his place.

I also think this is largely because van Gaal wants Strootman badly so he's willing to cast Herrera out in order to generate funds and open up a space and justify Strootman's transfer, even it means letting Herrera go for half the money we bought him for only a few months back.

4545~~~
If that is true, it's another case of nepotism from LvG and nothing will happen in January. Strootman will need to prove his fitness to the end of the season. Not sure the board will be happy paying all that money for Ander for him not to be played, then losing loads on him just for LvG to pay Roma an arm and a leg for Strootman. Ander needs to play to prove his worth to us or another club. If he plays well why sell him. We will need a massive squad next season and could do with both of these players. There are other players I would rather have gone that this lad. If he goes and then Strootman breaks down, LvG will look a phenominal idiot.

4546~~~
I think its quite ridiculous to suggest LvG doesn't rate him. The chronology just doesn't add up. 

He was doing well and playing when he was fit. 
Then he got injured. 
Then he went straight back into the team when he was deemed to be fit
Turned out he wasn't fit at all and got subbed off
In came Fellaini and has given very good performances in his place

Now unless someone is suggesting Herrera can play the Blind/Carrick deep lying role, there is no way you can conclude Herrera isn't rated by LvG, based on him not featuring recently.

4547~~~
Its the fact that Fletcher of all players comes on instead of him that drives me nuts!!!

4548~~~
To play a defensive role, for a few minutes, no? If he doesn't play over the busy run of fixtures coming up, <i>then</i> I'd be worried. But not yet.

4549~~~
I think with Ander, it’s just a case of competition for a starting place. For the moment it seems that we play with one defensive midfielder and two numbers 8. One of them is Rooney, so is undroppable, and the other is Fellaini. The man who gives us balance since the WBA game we have to admit, and as we saw against Arsenal, he’s the second shield with Carrick, and with this form it’s difficult to bench him to be honest

Well, as LVG said, we’re maybe less effective going forward, or less cavalier than we were against Leicester, Swansea etc, but we concede very few goals (exclusively thanks to De Gea in fact), but our defense is less exposed since we’re back in a 4-1-4-1.

I would prefer having Herrera in my team (and also Mata too), than having Fellaini and the current RVP. We would be far better technically and would retain the ball far better, but probably weaker defensively and more exposed. I just hope that this weekend we can add some touch to our game with Ander and Mata maybe and be back in a diamond with Rooney upfront, and Ander showing what a terrific footballer he’s

I hope that we can soon fix our defensive issues and be back playing real footballer that we have this year. (we used to have Cleverley Anderson in the midfield, now we have Mata and Herrera on the bench)

4550~~~
The same negative things were said about him not being a fan and not rating Luke Shaw, right?

4551~~~
Yep. Caf over-reacting shock horror.

4552~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Not sure if serious..

4553~~~
LvG usually tells players if he doesn't want them, I would have thought if he has said this to Ander we would have heard something from the player himself on Twitter. Ander seems very relaxed and happy, so it is bullshit.

4554~~~
I understand that LvG okay-ed the deals for Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera before he started at United. And suddenly, he doesn't like him anymore, will swap him for Shaqiri, blah blah. 

Media, eh?

4555~~~
what would he say? bye bye United <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.... He isnt the type of guy to write these things on Twitter and van Gaal probably didnt tell him that he will leave, more likely that he has to improve to get back in the team like everyone else on the bench.

4556~~~
It's bollocks, you don't rate your wide players, so get another one, keep the wide players you don't rate and give Bayern one of our best midfielders. I know who would be getting the best of that deal. Newpapers, you have to love them.

4557~~~
He will get his chance, that midfield is due for another injury or suspension. Be interesting to know if he has been as critical of RvP.

4558~~~
Also( I am in full rant mode here), yes we could do with a Strootman type players, but it is the defence that is the priority. We can cope with the midfielders we have very well. LvG should be concentrating on sorting the back out. If he isn't, that isn't great.

4559~~~
Bayern wouldn't want him, so I've no idea why you're all worrying about losing him to them.

4560~~~
why not? Thiago injured, Schweini too and doesnt get younger. Alonso pretty old too. They could do with a player like him.

4561~~~
Bayern need to add another midfielder amidst injury crisis, they could certainly do with Herrera.

4562~~~
All those injuries and they will still stroll the league.

4563~~~
Their injury crisis will ease, though. Schweinsteiger is back already. They'd hardly buy a midfielder just for a few months, especially an expensive one. Think they've already said as much anyway.

Nothing to worry about.

4564~~~
Schweinsteiger has had injury problems for a while and he's not getting any younger, ditto Alonso who's only a stop gap signing. They had to play Lahm out of necessity previous season if I remember correctly. Herrera won't be very expensive if we sell him six months into his contract after giving him a handful of games, probably half the money we paid for him to Athletic would suffice.

4565~~~
Sorry, but if Bayern do fancy him, all the reason not to sell him as too valuable to us. I wouldn't be doing them any favours especially if they are sending us a cast off winger.

4566~~~
People overreacting as usual, he's not Zidane.

4567~~~
Who is apart from Zidane?

4568~~~
Indeed. Just the media cashing in, as usual.

4569~~~
That's why I don't even look at the papers now. Trouble is people will insist on posting the articles on here.

4570~~~
If LVG didn't rate him, why did he rush him back for the West Brom game? Or keep playing him before the injury?

It just doesn't add up.

4571~~~
Tom Cleverly.

4572~~~
Aaaah! Forget about that little gem.

4573~~~
They played Lahm in midfield because Guardiola likes him in midfield. I don't know why you think they'll buy when they've said they won't, but even if they did I'm sure they'd be wanting someone better than Ander Herrera. He seems to have got better since he injured himself. Since when was he good enough for Bayern?

4574~~~
I would love LvG to rip into the press about this on Friday. They just love to destabalise our squad.

4575~~~
I think this is where us not having any mid week games comes into play.. We would have had enough games to rotate all our players and keep such rumours at bay.. Hopefully with the FA cup starting he ll get a chance to play mid week,as Van Gaal is happy presently with Fellaini's performance and will not drop him at present..

4576~~~
Its selectively believing all the negative stuff that gets on my nerves!

Precisely my point. Players in form and fitness are being preferred*. Nothing wrong with that.


*Except RvP of course.

4577~~~
Also, as for the people talking about him needing to bulk up and all that nonsense. Just watch this video...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIr6UjUTPxg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He's settled brilliantly into the PL. This bulking up nonsense is just the standard line trotted out when any smallish foreign player joins the league.

4578~~~
That video just shows why we miss him. He looks up everytime he has the ball for the best option. not just hit and hope balls. Not frightened to get stuck in. Isn't knocked off the ball as easily as people think. Better finishing from some players and he would have a lot more assists.

4579~~~
Yep. Our football has definitely suffered since he's been out of the team. I really miss the lad, he's been a joy to watch so far.

4580~~~
He will get some playing time in the next couple of games and provide us with some fluidity and link up play in midfield area. LvG is just waiting for Ander to be fully fit. As for the transfer rumours, I can see Fellaini and RvP being shipped out much much earlier, before it comes to Herrera. Its just the press doing their usual work: creating speculations.

4581~~~
Great video there, almost forgot about how good our passing looked before the Chelsea game. Herrera's not just creative, he's pretty good at winning the ball back.

And RVP seems so much more involved there than he's been recently. Would love to see this kind of football against Hull.

4582~~~
Iniesta.

4583~~~

4584~~~
Far better than Carrick? Seriously? Based on what, exactly?

Hererra seems to be this season's Kagawa. A reputation which is increasingly out of whack with what he's actually produced on the pitch. 

Just like Kagawa, you can see the potential and I really hope he ends up becoming an important player for us. Meanwhile, the reasons behind the very high rating he already has with so many on here will remain a mystery to me.

4585~~~
Far better was an exaggeration but he's probably better than a 34-year old Carrick coming back from a long injury, yes.

He has been good this season. The only times he looked off the pace was against West Brom where he was rushed from the injury. The state our midfield is in he ought to be getting games, let's not forget that despite the win our midfield was largely non-existent against Arsenal the other day. He's the sort of player you're bound to dislike mind.

4586~~~
Why is that ? What's so dislikable about a cultured, high octane, technically proficient mid-felder who uses his brain before whacking the ball ?

4587~~~
Maybe not dislike but usually when there's a player most people like Pogue will feel somewhat reserved about him and it'll look like he dislikes/doesn't rate him.

4588~~~
The 30 odd million fee might have something to to with that, Pogue. Plus, the fact that we almost signed him before under Moyes. It's clear the club desperately wanted him. Rather Van Gaal felt the same is another story.

I do agree with you to an extent regarding the comparison to Kagawa though. Two clearly talented players with qualities that fans believe the team needs/needed, but nothing much shown on the pitch to show he can deliver yet.

4589~~~
He's a very likeable player. Both in terms of personality and the way he plays the game. 

Needs to pass more consistently, be a bit stronger on the ball and be more aware defensively if he wants games in central midfield though.

4590~~~
He's strong enough on the ball and he should never ever be used with no protection in midfield, he needs Blind or Carrick next to him or else it's pointless (preferably Blind as he offers more energy).

4591~~~
So you mean to say he is poorer than Rooney and Fellaini in midfield?

4592~~~
Aye, that's the 30 million quid question. Not a reflection on how good Hererra is at football but it's really odd the way Moyes was deemed a failure yet the club still showed that much faith in his eye for a new signing. Smacks of Woody being desperate to sign someone, anyone, after the damage to his reputation last summer. Very unlikely Van Gaal was the driving force behind this move. 

Of course, that's not to say he won't turn out a good signing. Just strange the way it came about.

4593~~~
That's obviously Van Gaal's conclusion, yes. Right now, anyway.

4594~~~
Ah ok. Gotcha.

Anyway I'm a bit surprised that :

1) Ander's quality mystifies some people. He played a massive part in demolishing United's midfield 3 seasons ago with Martinez, was one of the (maybe couple dozen) best players in La Liga and raised him game at critical times vs Madrid and Barcelona. And he was out best performer alongside Blind and Di Maria until his injury and subsequent mediocre display at West Brom.

2) We have people jumping to conclusions about Van Gaal not rating Ander. Wasn't he supposed to really loathe Luke Shaw too (post his fitness related comments in the USA) ? Anyway it might just all be moot. We bought Ander for big money just 6 months ago, after breaking the poor man's heart once and then reigniting our interest this summer. He ain't going nowhere. Journos can piss off.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He scored twice and gave one assist in 4 starts (including West Brom), was the 2nd highest rated midfielder in the whole league (apart from Cesc) and brought the team's attacking dynamism up leaps and bounds in a departure from zombie passing.

What more does one expect of someone making his debut in the league ? Like really, Jesus.

4595~~~
Reading the posts above has me thinking "aah sh*t,maybe he is the new Kagawa". And also the link to him being indentified as a Moyes pick(correctly) has me thinking "well Van Gaal always wanted Strootman".

4596~~~
The comparison with Kagawa is ridiculous. Kagawa had very mixed games over a very pro-longed period yet his good games made you believe.

At least let the lad have a few bad games before the "overrated" nonsense.

LvG isn't picking him so he must be overrated by the caf. Such insight

4597~~~
No manager worth their salt would think he's underperformed so far. Not unless the manager has very unconventional requirements that he's not fulfilling, which is my concern here.

4598~~~
Another popular but untrue legend that has gathered momentum in recent months. Herrera was not a Moyes target. He was one of the players brought to David attention by erstwhile scouts who had been monitoring his (and Thiago's) progress since Spain's triumphant U-21 campaign in 2011 and (specifically in Ander and Martinez' case) - Bilbao fixtures vs United in Europa League. Fergie himself touched upon the issue in a fairly recent interview :

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11160846/Alex-Ferguson-reveals-he-identified-Luke-Shaw-and-Ander-Herrera-as-Manchester-United-targets.html" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...der-Herrera-as-Manchester-United-targets.html</a>

Sir Alex speaks of his aggression and work-rate in positive light. Yet suddenly he's not aggressive enough or not assertive enough to play in the league.

4599~~~
Amazing how we (LvG) can reach conclusions on players who are recovering from an injury! 

In that case, Evans, Jones and Rafael should be the first ones out of the door in January.

4600~~~
He's more aware of his defensive duties than Fellaini. Fellaini's trademark defensive position is somehow finding himself on the wrong side of the man despite him supposedly being a DM.

4601~~~
Poor Blind <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4602~~~
Recovering?

He'll have recovered from that injury weeks ago. Hence he's been on the bench for the last few games, unlike any of the other players you mention.

4603~~~
Watching that West Ham comp above just reinforces for me the absurdity of the idea that Van Gaal has given up on Herrera. Like a half of football with a rib injury is going to undermine the good performances that preceded it. Clearly among our best midfielders and will be back in the team sooner rather than later.

4604~~~
He is a fine player and so is Kagawa. Undoubtedly Carrick has been our best midfielder in the last 5-6 seasons and since Scholes and Giggs became too old to be able to play week in and week out and since Fletcher's illness, Hargreaves' injuries, Anderson's laziness and Cleverley's inability to make an impact in the first team, there has always been a question about who should play next to Carrick.

Some would say that we need a player like Vidal, a ball winning midfielder with high energy levels and incredible stamina but that discussion doesn't belong here. Ferguson's choices indicate that he wanted a player who could operate as a play maker in deeper positions and do his share of defending but most importantly with the ability to carry the ball through the midfield and provide key passes, through balls and goals in more advanced positions. Someone like Modric or Schweinsteiger.

It's amazing that since the Anderson fiasco we haven't bought a single ready made player who can come here and do the job from day one. Instead of that we kept signing #10s (Kagawa, Mata and now Herrera) and tried to turn them into CMs. We were also linked with several other players these past few seasons, like Kroos and Sneijder, who are also better when playing in more advanced positions.

From what we've seen so far Herrera seems to be adopting to the role better than all the others. The game against WHU, where he played as a right box-to-box midfielder was his best with us. He was very good for 60 minutes against Leicester too until his energy levels dropped dramatically. He has also been decent in the 3-5-2 but his communication with Rooney and (especially) Mata wasn't good. But he still needs time to learn the position.

So, when you're thinking that LvG wants Strootman, or a similar player, you're absolutely right. Our slow build up play cries out for a player like him. He has the physicality to help us win the midfield battles (we use Fellaini to do that right now) but he is also good on the ball. If we finally do sign a player like him, it doesn't mean that Herrera will be benched, he will be able to play as the box to box midfielder with more attacking duties, a role he understands better and needs less time to learn.

4605~~~
How's about we list those players I was reserved about because everyone else liked them?

Anderson, Nani, Hernandez, Kagawa are the first that spring to mind. Do you see a theme there?

To be fair, Rafael is on the list too and he's proved me wrong. So far. DDG as well. Although I've always said they could both go on to become great players. Which looks like happening.

4606~~~
To me it seems pretty clear. Given how long he's been on the bench for, it's pretty unlikely he's still recovering from injury. If he's injured enough not to get a minute of playing time, but not injured enough to be left out of the squad altogether, then you'd have to ask exactly what have they been doing since he got injured? Why the lack of progress? If he is fit and hasn't gotten minutes then that's not a great sign, is it?

I imagine it's down to Fellaini doing well and LVG deciding he prefers what he offers. Fletch coming on instead of him suggests that LVg wanted more of a physical presence and conservative approach with the ball than he would have offered. Doesn't bode very well for him, IMO.

Fwiw if I had to guess I'd say we'll be minus 3 Spaniards this time next season.

4607~~~
If he comes in against Hull and rediscovers his pre-injury form then it might be someone elses turn to have their backside superglued to the subs bench.

4608~~~
Comparing him to Kagawa? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I saw very little of Herrera before he came to United and had my reservations about his signing but he's already done more in his 5 games for us than Kagawa did in his entire United career. He's actually fitted into our team and there's not really a valid excuse why he isn't playing. With Kagawa, there were plenty but people didn't want to accept it.

4609~~~
The recovering period also includes match fitness. Which is why Herrera isn't playing, and there is no one else to put on the bench, should an injury happen to one of the starting midfielders. Combined with the fact that Fellaini is playing well for the very first time in his United career, it would have been nonsensical to drop Afro. 

Herrera was injured before the WBA game, and yet started the WBA game and performed poorly. At the most, LvG is taking his time with injured players instead of just rushing them back as quickly as possible, which imo is the right thing to do.

4610~~~
That would be a great shame as they bring so much to the team as people. If that is the case, I would be worried if I were a player who was here pre LvG reign as it looks like he is bringing all his boys in and they will be untouchable. Any bad performances will not be blamed on them. Just look at how RvP has played, he knows he will never be dropped. I would rather have the 3 amigos in the squad than Fellaini tbh.

4611~~~
Yep, they all came from abroad.

4612~~~
Mata is a 100% goner IMO, Herrera is 50/50 but I don't think we will let De Gea go (although I find it more likely now than I did a few weeks ago) and even if we do we'll replace him with Valdes so there'll still be a Spaniard in goal.

4613~~~
Aye, I'm well known for hating on Valencia and Evra too, right?

Oh wait...

4614~~~
Valencia didn't come from abroad, he was a PL player.

Was there anyone in history of the world who liked United and didn't like Evra?

4615~~~
My list of flops which  i knew would turn flops includes: Foster, Berbatov, Hargo, Fellaini, Anderson, Blanc, Barthez, Obertan, Chadwick..,blah

Your point is??

4616~~~
Match fitness? Come off it. He injured his ribs ffs. He'll be almost exactly as fit now as he was walking off the pitch against West Ham. 

Re the last para, how does that fit with playing Ashley Young when he was so lacking in fitness that he had to sub him off after subbing him on?

4617~~~
Obvious. 

And not addressed to you.

4618~~~
You're not seriously saying Evra didn't get much stick on here? Cause that would be absurd.

4619~~~
Again, just look at the timelines. He was poor and looked unfit against West Brom. Since then we've had big, tough games, in which Fellaini has justified his place game after game. Surely you're not advocating he should have been thrown in, in one of these big games? I hardly see a reason to be worried based on the games gone by. However, if he's still stuck on the bench over the oncoming busy period, then it would make sense to be worried.

4620~~~
Yes agreed with this, and literally every other games he's had (mainly pre-season admittedly) he looked like a very good central midfielder. Hard working, mobile, creative, not afraid of a tackle, good passing range and willing to get forward. Technically I think he looked more proficient than Blind and Carrick. I will admit a small sample size I am judging him on. Really bizarre if he is not "rated". I've put it down to injury but can't understand Van Gaal not playing. 

Don't understand the rationale of putting him on the bench and then not using him if injury has been the case. Really think he should be given a chance to prove himself and hope that's soon. Looked really good early on.

4621~~~
He can't be match fit, how can he. He won't have trained properly for a time and then hasn't played. He will need to be brought in a bit at a time to make sure he doesn't pick up some damn muscle injury from trying too hard too soon. I am sure he would have had some minutes, but the circumstances haven't arisen to allow it, i.e being far enough in a game that it wouldn't be a risk with the state of our defence to bring him on. Unfortunately him being missing is why we are never in that position. Hull would be the perfect game and they will have to rotate over Christmas or we will risk players who are not used to playing over Christmas getting worn down and other getting even more injuries. I am so angry with our brittle defenders getting injured, i.e. Evans, Jones and Rafael ( Rojo was a freak) as I think if we were at full strength he would be playing. I do think he need a protector in there with him, say Carrick, who has more defensive nous. Fellaini for all the praise is clueless defensively.

4622~~~
There is discomfort with broken ribs. Infact, discomfort is probably an understatement. Also walking != playing football. 

Who else would you play at LB if not Young? We still have Rooney-Fellaini-Carrick to play in the midfield with Blind's/Herrera's injury. At LB, we have absolutely no one to cover. (No for Blackett, because he wouldn't have stood a chance against Chamberlain).

4623~~~
Would it be fair to say you are more a fan of grafters than of the lighter weight flair players?

4624~~~
With Van Gaal it's all about composure and retention of posession. Hererra's occasionally wayward passing and the panicky hoofing in the last half hour of the Leicester game will be two big black marks against him. 

Still loads of time to turn things round though. He seems like a real student of the game who will work his socks off on any weaknesses in his game. Hopefully Van Gaal is open-minded about his potential to iron out those flaws.

4625~~~
Yes, that's definitely fair.

4626~~~
Do you feel Herrera falls more into the latter category? I mean he's lighter but I wouldn't say he lacks graft.

4627~~~
No. One thing I really like about him is the effort he puts in. Definitely not someone I would consider as lacking in graft. He loves a tackle.

4628~~~
You're just jealous of their smooth ebony skins.

4629~~~
Maybe Rooney thought the team was getting too good looking and wants some ugly blokes bringing in to make him feel better.

4630~~~
Yeah, a bit too much at times you could argue. I am a bit of a fence sitter on what is going on with Herrera in truth, I just think LvG is prioritizing physicality in midfield due to our backline, it's not about what he sees long term or how he wants to play, it's about the need for 3 points over all else and to get that we need to protect our biggest weakness with a bit of brute force. I mean I think Rooney is wasted man marking people in midfield, he's a top forward, but right now it's needs must and Rooney's physicality is needed to compete in the midfield in LvG's eyes I think.

4631~~~
Contrary to popular opinion, Herrera has an excellent passing range. Not much of a difference between him and Carrick or Blind (two of our best passers) when it comes down to it even if one includes the solitary botched performance vs West Brom where he was obviously far from 100 % match fitness.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s27.postimg.org/71vsk8a37/Untitled.png" src="http://s27.postimg.org/71vsk8a37/Untitled.png"/></a>

It would be even higher if he wasn't so adventurous and converted to the sedate, risk averse style adopted by some other United midfielders. The last central midfielder to score 10 goals for United in a season was a decade ago (Scholes). The club finally buys one after all these years, yet we're still unsure of his quality.

4632~~~
I'm not suggesting anything, other than the fact that it's obvious he's been completely left out. I don't necessarily disagree with Fellaini playing. Whether that's down to Herrera's fitness, which I don't believe for a second, simply not being able to get his shirt back from the man in form, which I don't really believe as he hasn't had a single minute which you'd think he'd get just to keep him ticking over, or just being utterly frozen out is up for debate.

4633~~~
Maybe it's just that some fans need to adjust, we have had some bloody awful midfielders. Quinton Fortune is a bloody legend to some.

4634~~~
It is a bit curiously bipolar indeed. On one hand we decry the lack of penetration in our passing game with the "mere possession in itself counts for nothing" lament. Yet when a player wants to be proactive and make something happen, he's slammed for being a wayward passer.

4635~~~
That's a concern alright. Although none of the recent fixtures have panned out in a way which would allow Van Gaal the luxury of handing out minutes just to keep someone ticking over. 

Next couple of games will be very interesting. If he remains as marginalised as he has been in recent weeks then his days are numbered, that's for damn sure.

4636~~~
I'm not sure that holds up when his replacement is Fellaini, who may be more conservative, but also lacks the touch and composure to be a calming presence when things get really tight.

As for the latter, I suspect it'll be a case of him going to bring in a player he does want, Strootman being the most obvious suggestion.

4637~~~
Yeah fair enough. I don't think he's being frozen out, its just a combination of several factors and circumstances, some of which you've listed.

Anyways, this is why not being in Europe and crashing out of the league cup is a bastard. He'd be nailed on to start this midweek, for example.

4638~~~
For me the weirdest thing is that, if i'm not mistaken he played Fletcher 2 or 3 times when Herrera was on the bench and Fletcher is woeful.

4639~~~
It's like our midfield has been so bloody boring for the last years, since Ronaldo went, that we don't want to be taken out of our comfort zone. Flair, baaah humbug.

4640~~~
Before his injury, he was doing brilliantly. I don't get the fact people are suggesting he will be sold after this season, based on almost nothing?

4641~~~
Neither do I. It just goes to show how much power the press have. We might sign somebody else, but not sure Ander would go. I love Mata, but I prefer Herrera's work rate. Nani might be gone, we know Cleverley will be gone, some of the defenders will be gone. Anderson will be barbecued sometime before next season, that would be his only use. If RvP doesn't buck up, he might surprise everyone and sell him. Even someone like Januzaj might be loaned to see how he does playing every week. He is not yet good enough to do that here. I worry more that DeGea will leave than if Ander will be sold. If he tears this squad apart again, we will then be in europe but with even more players trying to settle in.

4642~~~
Lets recap. A random poster on internet forum pretends to have  a superior set of skills on judging footballers' ability. This poster enlists footballers who according to him didnt make it while at United as as proof of his ability.

This poster, however, omits players he got wrong though.

Seems legit.

Yeah, i guess im not naive enough to be lured by your patronising tone.

Later!

4643~~~
Its symptomatic of things here these days. Any thing <i>slightly</i> suspicious will be construed as the world falling down on us. I really don't understand the self pity on here these days.

4644~~~
I dont know why he should start against Hull or Stoke if he hasnt played one of the last 3 games. Our players are not that tired to rotate. Imo he wont get any minutes in the next 2 games and the discussion will never end until we sell him and buy Strootman. I like him, but the signs are there. I dont think van Gaal dislikes him, i just think he isnt what van Gaal wants as a number 8. Therefore, i really think he has no future here.

4645~~~
No argument there. 

I disagree that this is actually a problem, you and <a class="username" data-user="23692, @Brophs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23692/">@Brophs</a> dont buy that this has anything to do with injuries, I can see why you feel that way but to me, even if it seems odd, it makes more sense than the alternatives. 

Actually its not that odd, really. 
1) He got injured
2) LVG tried to bring him back straight away. Presumably because he saw him as one of his best midfielders. 
3) That didnt pan out. 
4) Fellaini came in instead and has done really well. 
5) A tough run of fixtures has made it difficult to ease him back in. 

As you said, the next two/three games will clear this up. If he cant get himself some playing time against Hull or Stoke then Ill accept something is very wrong, even if I find it quite impossible to fathom what that could be. But Ill accept there must be something. 

What I expect to happen is for him to get some minutes against Hull and by Southampton to be starting. At that point this whole conversation will be nothing but a rather boring memory.

4646~~~
It's probably an overreaction but if your theory is true , then Van gaal can follow Herrera threw the door we don't need a manager who spend 35m€ for a player and than sell him 1 year later because he don't know how to use him.

4647~~~
Spot on. Its all very easy to explain, IMO.

4648~~~
I can't even...

4649~~~
Quite possibly all correct. Hopefully that's how it pans out. Though personally I don't see it.

4650~~~
That's what I'm hoping for or rather, clinging on to.

If Van Gaal actually prefers Fellaini over Herrera and/or intends to sell him and replace him with a crocked up and overrated Strootman then he's going senile.

4651~~~
Btw, Herrera starts tonight for the U21 match.

4652~~~
Like Falcao?

4653~~~
Interesting. A great opportunity for him to force Van Gaal's hand.

4654~~~
Made to rot in the reserves now, huh? Definitely going to be sold...

4655~~~
Where's all this stuff about selling Herrera coming from? I think I've seen one snippet that originated in the <i>Star</i> of all places. Has Van Gaal actually said anything about this or are we taking a non-story from one of the red-tops and giving it life?

4656~~~
Not sure if that's good news or bad news. Probably lends more weight to the theory of him not being fit enough...

Yes.

The Falcao signing never made any sense for me, not after LVG spent most of pre-season moaning about a lack of balance in the squad.  But that's for a different thread...

4657~~~
Sarcasm?

4658~~~
Yup, sorry should have used one or the other smiley.

4659~~~
What the feck? U-21s not being televised? MUTV subscription is a pisstake.

4660~~~
The latter I think. 

Or rather, looking at some arguably quite puzzling developments (Herrera being out a lot longer than initially expected, not getting any game time) and coming to the same conclusion as the tabloid hacks did.

4661~~~
Pogue is a racist?

4662~~~
I'm starting to think it has more to do with help him get more weight, he must be fit but not in the "standars" of the EPL.

4663~~~
He must have picked up some other injury in the mean time, that or his original injury was worse then normal or took longer to recover from. Either way, I don't buy that Van Gaal doesn't rate him at all. He started all of our games at the start, got rushed back from injury and he was made to wear a special corset even, just so he can play. Now all of a sudden because he was poor in the game that he was clearly still injured in, he doesn't rate him? No chance. 
Since then it's just been unfortunate circumstances that there hasn't really been the ideal game to get him back match fit.

4664~~~
If he's starting from the reserves, then it's quite plausible that his injury was the reason why we didn't start him in the previous matches.

4665~~~
I suggested he should do this, this will be the 2 games LvG likes players to have to test their fitness. I knew I was a genius.<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

4666~~~
Yes it is, according to my Sky schedule 6.30pm. It is an away game, but both them and Blackburn play games at this ground.

4667~~~
Yep. My bad. Saw it was an LSC game and when they didn't say "Live" I assumed it was a replay of a match from a few weeks back.

4668~~~
So this proves that he's not 100% fit yet because van Gaal has previously started other injured players like Shaw, Evans and Smalling in the reserves to help them recover faster from injuries.

4669~~~
You could also use Januzaj as an example of a player playing in the U21 just to get game time though.

4670~~~
And Anderson as a player Van Gaal starts in U21s games after deciding he has no future as a first team player.

Basically, Hererra starting tonight tells us nothing other than he was physically capable of starting against Arsenal.

Hope he has a really good game, mind you.

4671~~~
There again Anderson doesn't even make the bench, they play him the reserves to just prove we haven't bumped him off.

4672~~~
You lot really are making a mountain out of a molehill. He hasnt been 100% and there is no point rushing him back when Fellaini has been doing well and it would mean dropping him to play Herrera.

I hope/expect that if RVP doesnt shape up then we will revert to a 4-3-3 and have a Fellaini/Herrera/Carrick midfield roughly.

4673~~~
Results matter! nothing else comes close until United are back in the CL. Every fan has their favorites but individual players come way behind the Team.

The drama around Herrera is entirely media driven, a few months ago it was Januzaj, then Mata, now its Herrera's turn. But every story in the press this season has been so weak on genuine controversy or interest it's just <i>boring!</i>

4674~~~
Does not have to be racist to prefer British based players over foreign imports. As he said he liked Valencia from the beginning and I think he likes Fellaini too.

4675~~~
Perhaps you should apply to be his agent/personal manager!

4676~~~
Yes pleeease. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4677~~~
I'm not sure, and I wasn't criticising him, I was saying that he hasn't yet shown that he's the answer to our midfield woes that some thought he was. LVG will pick the players that are helping us rack up the points right now, not make us look fancy in our play. Fellaini for example is fulfilling instructions that Herrera and Mata aren't IMO and that's what matters right now. Mata scored a winning goal in his appearance before the International break and still didn't get a look in vs Arsenal, which is why I completely agree with the concern made by Pocco below.

4678~~~
<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

4679~~~
Fair enough.

But see this is something where I feel a disconnect with that sentiment. A subpar midfield (like we had prior to this summer window) isn't improved by adding one quality player, it's much more textured. You have to add multiple players (which we did in fairness), let them develop and get some chemistry together as part of a defined structure that a good manager can lay out.

It's a substantial process and requires time. Ander wasn't and isn't a panacea to single-handedly transform our midfield. There isn't any player in football who could've done that to be honest (not Modric, not Kroos, not Fabregas etc). What he does bring however is a very well rounded skillset - creativity from central areas (something we've lacked since Scholes' retirement and Carrick injury concerns/ relative loss of form), tenacity, a bit of leadership, and a general sense of purpose and drive. Kind of like a cross between a flamboyant Spanish rondo and an industrious English midfield general.

This is why a lot of people prognosticated that we would benefit United, adapt to the league at a faster rate than some others might and conform with what a manager like Van Gaal wants from his players. So it is a bit bothersome that a lot folks are coming up with (mostly unsubstantiated) assumptions that manager who introduced Xavi and Iniesta and made Guardiola his captain at Barcelona and helped mold Schweinsteiger wants rid of a talented midfielder on the cusp of being world class based on his performances these past couple of seasons.

I guess what <a class="username" data-user="49976, @pocco" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49976/">@pocco</a> said might be true though. Van Gaal certainly has the propensity to be obtuse at times if he feels the team is better balanced by some weird methods. But it would be a crying shame if a midfielder as talented as Ander isn't allowed to fully express himself and is sent packing without getting a fair shot. (Not that I believe the bolloxy press stories mind).

4680~~~
We'll just find new reasons to moan about how players are used. Everybody has their own favorites. It was Mata before, suddenly you had to drop Mata because Januzaj will pine for a transfer, everyone was happy with Fellaini being an oaf because he didn't have to be considered while fitting 11 favorite players together, now he's turned into Groot, now people want to include him in whatever plans. We've all been guilty, I would like Rafael in the squad. This is why I miss Fergie. It was so difficult for anybody to criticize him because he had so much good will and he was Fergie. Now, every decision by the manager is scrutinized and individual opinions thrown in. Confrontations, innuendo and arguments are created where there are none. 

The good thing it seems, that the players are happy and working together. Obviously, none of us are involved in daily training ground activities and it's impossible to know one way or other, but leaks coming out of United seem to suggest that, which is nice.

4681~~~
To be fair it was ever thus, we used to lament SAF's decisions and selections all the time as well.

4682~~~
I'm not sure of that though, there was always criticism, but it was mild at best and they were immediately shouted down. At least, it was not to the same extent. Funnily enough, most of these blokes preached patience when Moyes was in charge.

4683~~~
Wow, you have to really feel for the lad.

4684~~~
You have to see things from Van Gaal's point of view, asked to do the impossible over the summer.

After three years of international management, attention focused on Dutch players, he's required to sell and buy half a team by the accountant in charge of Manchester United. He knows, thanks to their mismanagement of their own affairs, United need, or think they need, this big influx and outflow - if he's unprepared to preside over it, they may turn to somebody else. So - he's seen a little of Ander, and maybe a few videos of Shaw, thinks they've got talent, and gives them the nod, saying to himself 'if things don't work out, I can sort it once I get my feet under the table at Old Trafford. The first thing is to get the job.'

Regardless of whether the above is an accurate representation of events, with no Director of Football in place, overseeing a summer spending spree was an essential part of any incoming manager's remit. Van Gaal had to do it, even if he hadn't given a moments thought to what a team like United might need in the market before being approached about the job. And, of course, his duties with the Dutch team didn't give him much opportunity to think about it afterwards.

4685~~~
The only problem is that Van gaal is shit on the transfer market and can turn against his own players quickly.

I'm not saying that it's the case here but he needs a Director of football or change his approach regarding transfers.

4686~~~
Calm down really

4687~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4688~~~
So you've made two posts, if Van Gaal doesn't know how to use Herrera, he should be given the boot. Why? If he is not fitting the model he wants to play, then he'd be transferred out. What's the problem?

4689~~~
Yes it was less. But not insignificant. One example is Valencia, the exasperation with him didn't start under Moyes, the whole of SAF's last season he was regularly picked and many / most on here openly ridiculed it and suggested he was completely spent as a footballer and SAF was out of his mind. Or "SAF's Lovechild" Fletcher in years gone by, the rubbish player who had a place in the squad because of nepotism. It happened quite a bit really.

4690~~~
Fellaini has taken his chance, played reasonably well and offered the team something different in a difficult run of games. This is normal guys. We actually have a manager now that doesn't incessantly rotate his squad to detrimental effect. Herrera will get his chance soon and if he performs will remain in the team on merit.

4691~~~
I agree with player criticism before, but I think manager was pretty much above it. But you could be right too. Even at the height of Berbatov/Tevez debate, it was more about who fits the team better instead of 'Fergie out, he didn't play Berbatov'.

4692~~~
That's not what i said, if a coach spend 35m€ for a player and then after 4 months decide to get rid of the player because he's not perfect for his system than the coach is the first responsible.
In that scenario no one forced him to buy the player, and if he thinks that you can get rid of a player easily, the board should show him how easy it is to get rid of a coach.

Now for me Adebesi's scenario is probably the right one, with all this injuries LVG is just wary and wants to take his time before using players who come back from injuries.

4693~~~
There's a difference between Herrera not perfect for the system against Arsenal and him not being perfect for any of Van Gaal's system.

4694~~~
Aaaaand Herrera Scores !!!

4695~~~
If anything, Fergies lineups were one of the most frustrating things. I remember a lot of people joking and saying that noe that he's retired we might get some more normal team selections and more consistent lineups. There were certain players that he never moved around, but a lot of the time he rotated.

4696~~~
Just scored a great goal from a practiced free kick from Janujaz. Rolled it to the spot, finsihed to the bottom corner.

4697~~~
Sorry, I don't understand.

Edit: i was advocating the devil. I was going along Izec theory.

4698~~~
Yes the manager was above criticism. Sorry, if that was your original point then I misunderstood it. It's definitely a culture shock getting used to fallible managers.

4699~~~
Tidy goal!

4700~~~
He was really happy to score it as well.

4701~~~
Fletcher plays a defensive role??? What does he contribute to defensively? Running around after ghosts?

4702~~~
Interesting that he's playing for the reserves tonight. Have there been any other reserve matches in the time between the West Brom game and now?

4703~~~
Januzaj played today likely to continue to get minutes developing, Evans playing to get fitness back - Herrera is bit of both seeing as he's been on the bench but, not played minutes for several weeks.

4704~~~
Impressed with Januzaj and Herrera. Real class.

4705~~~
He played in a BHC match last week against Blackpool.

4706~~~
Interesting, wonder if its just for the minutes, or because he genuinely is trying to work his way back to fitness after the injury.

4707~~~
Danny Higginbottom seemed to think he might have asked to play in this game. He definitely enjoyed playing in it. Not like some first teamers who don't give a hoot. He was everywhere.

4708~~~
Thats great to hear! I properly love this little lad already.

4709~~~
He was giving High Fives with Pearson. Had a big grin on his face when he scored. He's a great lad.

4710~~~
Incredible how people love the create shitty theories and factoids. Herrera got injured, tried to rush back, proved a mistake. Fellaini got in, had a great job, while the Spaniard got his fitness back.

He was probably one of our our best players until the injury, and people are going nuts about him not fitting the team. FFS.

4711~~~
Its the way that, since his injury, his early season performances have been played down that gets me. He's gone from being one of our best early season performers to being average and lightweight. Its ridiculous.

4712~~~
He looked very relaxed tonight, played well. Didn't look like someone worrying about his future at the club.

4713~~~
This. Also MUTV heavily pushing the return from injury angle on Ander. Listen to the commentary and look the write up in this tweet from the club's official feed:

4714~~~
The plot thickens...

4715~~~
If you remember LVG's remarks about our subs on Sat, he pointed out that Young was not fit enough to last 90 mins (but was available on the bench) so he was played as long as he felt was sensible then subbed in turn.

Combine that with LVG's desire for 1st team starters to play a number of minutes and train for 2 weeks.

Result: Herrera plays tonight.

He was fit enough for maybe part of a Prem league game but was not chosen to come on under the particular circumstances. So he gets to add to his match fitness in the LSC. I am sure he is slated for some minutes in the next 2 games.

4716~~~
Asking to play in a reserve match after signing in a £30m deal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Fantastic attitude, no ego about the lad, but a lot of bite and bravery. Love him.

4717~~~
I bloody love Herrera, get him back in the side ASAP!

It's tough on Fellaini who has had his first decent run of performances in a United shirt but Herrera is a considerably better football and will make us play a lot better.

4718~~~
I love him.

4719~~~
Higginbotham was just speculating. No evidence at all that he asked to play.

Besides, would be a worry if he had to ask. As that would mean Van Gaal wasn't fussed about giving him a game to keep him sharp for the first team (the reason Evans and Januzaj played)

Played well though. Albeit in an easy game where all our central midfielders looked great (Rothwell's second goal was a thing of beauty)

4720~~~
What's up with you Pogues? You're on a fierce downer this weather.

4721~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm just a contrary old git. Don't mind me!

4722~~~
Good thing he was kept busy running around with the reserves tonight, watching Bilbao winning in the Champions League might have had him missing home. Being backup to Fellaini, question marks about your managers opinion of you and the Winter here is not a good combination.

4723~~~
Herrera was out for over a month with a rib injury. I really wouldn't read too much into him not playing for the first team yet. He could still be in a bit of discomfort and by playing in the reserve games it's easing him back to fitness.

4724~~~
Depends if there is only one aspect to football then yeah Herrera is considerably better but, it's not. Fellaini and him both have their positives / negatives and both have a lot to offer the team. Herrera has only played a few games from us and while he did help with us looking good going forward in some games, we also were looking vulnerable as well and it wasn't all down to the defense. Herrera playing won't necessarily get us playing a lot better both ways.

4725~~~
There's no way you look that happy if you are in anyway being excluded or forced out.

4726~~~
Top bloke

4727~~~
My thoughts as well. I'm still convinced that he's not fully recovered from the rib injury and him playing tonight was a big step in him getting back on the pitch for the first team. I don't believe the nonsense that he's fallen out of favor with van Gaal.

He looked absolutely delighted to be playing a game of football again. I just love the guy's demeanor.

4728~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMqw3hB2pNA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4729~~~
I think some would actually prefer to think LvG doesn't like him. For whatever reason. 

I'm pretty sure he will play in the upcoming games. Just hope he keeps his place as he brings a tempo, fluidity and energy to our play that we lack without him. Blind and Herrera are our best CMs by some distance.

4730~~~
What reason would that be? Seriously. I can't think of any. What do you mean?

4731~~~
Review your posts from few days back pal.

4732~~~
Great to see him back playing look forward to him coming back into starting line up. Hard to get into a winning team, but maybe this weekend we could put out more of an attacking line up. 

How have the ressie's got set piece routines and it doesnt look like we can do anything half as creative from similar positions....wide free kicks / corners

4733~~~
Herrera is miles better than Fellaini all things considered. We looked vulnerable due to the formation. Defensively, Herrera is better than Fellaini anyway.

4734~~~
True. He's by far the better player and although Fellaini proved to be able to do a specific job, he's still a limited player who suits our team only when he has a specific job like against Chelsea or City.

We badly missed Herrera's allrounder qualities and his creativity and urgency in our midfield. I hope he's back next Saturday

4735~~~
I don't think Van Gaal sees it that way. 

Hererra will probably make more tackles but Fellaini seems to covers more ground and his aerial presence is a huge bonus at set-pieces and competing for high balls in and around our box. Plus Fellaini's a lot less likely to concede possession with a loose pass in a dangerous area of the pitch (yes, he did it against Arsenal but he had been very safe with his passing in the last few games) 

It depends what you're looking for really. With a full strength, settled defence make more sense to play Hererra ahead of Fellaini because his defensive qualities might suit us better in that scenario. With the cobbled together defence of the last few weeks Fellaini's been a great help and playing Herrera ahead of him would have made us a lot more vulnerable.

4736~~~
Is there any stat to suggest that Fellaini covers more ground than Herrera? As for being likely to lose possession, it's all about instructions from the manager. Ask Ander to play it safe, and he will do so, could probably even indulge in tiki-taka, if need be. Ander is a much better passer than Fellaini, and moreover, he keeps the midfield clicking, which is also an extremely useful way of keeping the pressure off the defense and actually trying to put some pressure on opposition. Herrera is faster, covers more ground, is the better passer and actually a good reader of the game. Fellaini's advantage is his height (aerial duels) and physicality. I also believe that Herrera is much less likely to commit a dangerous foul compared to Marouane.

4737~~~
I dunno. You seem to have access to them, so maybe you tell me?

My comment was based on previous discussions about Fellaini where someone posted stats about him consistently covering more ground than anyone else on the pitch. I'll admit I'm making an assumption that he covers more ground than Hererra but it seems more likely than the reverse being true (your claim)

4738~~~
People are definitely revising sentiments and conjuring up fachts in the attempt to discredit Ander's performances and prove that Fellaini is better defensively. A lot of basic stats prove otherwise almost across the board :

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s2.postimg.org/obwph1cx5/Untitled.png" src="http://s2.postimg.org/obwph1cx5/Untitled.png"/></a>


Can't find credible distance stats ATM but one does get the sense that certain players are branded lazy twats/ soft/ weak for no apparent reasons just to suit prevalent narrative. eg. Ozil was being called out for a lack of effort some weeks ago despite covering a lot of ground for Arsenal in the preceding league fixture which was a bit unfair because he's clearly trying to improve upon that aspect of his game.



It's a tough tag to shake off once there's a perception surrounding you (rightly or wrongly).

4739~~~
Fellaini runs more but he is not more effective than Herrera.

By covering you mean running a longer distance ?

4740~~~
Ozil is clearly a lazy twat though, so that's just evidence of how deceptive these stats can be.

Nobody is accusing Hererra of being lazy/soft/weak so not sure where you're going with this anyway.

4741~~~
I remember reading that in the Chelsea game, Fellaini covered more ground than anyone else on both teams.

Erm, there's barely anything in it. And before you jump on me, i definitely prefer Herrera to Fellaini.

4742~~~
He is at times, I'm not disputing that. But Ozil does get a fair bit of stick (unjustly IMO) even when he puts in a solid shift while certain players who're established as 'workhorses' in the media's consciousness get an easy ride. Mesut is a very easy scapegoat for Arsenal's maladies and has been for the past year or so.

In reference to your second point - I've seen plenty of posters (won't name names) mention Ander's weak frame (he's a tough, spirited lad despite the slightness and almost 6 feet tall to be fair) and poorer defensive work-rate as reasons for Van Gaal not rating him. These views are a bit disingenuous because none of us have the foggiest about Louis' plans or preferences at United. This aside from the fact the Herrera might not be 100 % fit (I dunno, can't comment on this, not a medical expert).

I'm sorry but whoever jumped on you ?

4743~~~
Nobody. Just as well that I didn't say anyone did.

4744~~~
I think thats what you call winning <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4745~~~
Those stats mean feck all without context. What's a better test of defensive mettle? Playing against Leicester, QPR and West Ham? Or City, Chelsea and Arsenal?

4746~~~
You really don't like Herrera do you? Just add him to the list that includes Nani, RVP, LVG, Di Maria. Yet you seem to love the likes of Moyes, Fellaini, Valencia, and Rooney. Hmmm. There's a trend developing in there.

4747~~~
The only thing Fellaini is better at is chesting the ball.

4748~~~
Would love to know how much of the ground Fellaini is covering is because he has no clue where to position himself. 
He has done well in recent weeks no doubt about it but when it comes to who is the better midfielder between him and Herrera there is just no competition

4749~~~
I think Pogue summed up Fellaini's defensive advantage when he said his "aerial presence is a huge bonus at set-pieces and competing for high balls in and around our box." 

I think that is the long and short of it. That and, while Im not saying Herrera is weak on the ball just because he is small, Fellaini clearly has an advantage here, both in strength on the ball himself and going out and roughing the opposition up - an especially handy attribute against Arsenal. 

But he also conceded that if we had a properly functioning defense it would probably be less of an issue. Overall Herrera looks the better defensive presence to me. But both are capable there, and neither specialise in it.

4750~~~
It's a myth that Fellaini is an effective defensive midfielder. He's not. He's a good man-marker, he's a real asset when defending set-pieces, but his actual in-play defending is not good. He doesn't have the positional sense or tackling ability.

He's got back to his Everton levels in terms of the things which he <i>does</i> provide: the aforementioned man-marking and aerial defending, his aerial goal-threat, his brilliant holding-up of the ball up top. But because of that people seem to be unduly praising him whenever he manages to do very basic midfield jobs. A game where he doesn't misplace half his passes and makes a few interceptions is called an 'impressive midfield performance', but any other midfielder would be expected to do those things as the bare minimum.

Except in circumstances where we need that specific set of assets that Fellaini offers, he shouldn't be starting ahead of a proper midfielder like Herrera.

4751~~~
What about his highly advanced elbowing skills?

4752~~~
And the worst thing is he's actually in great form, the guy can't do anything right according to some people here.

4753~~~
If there is you'll have to spell it out for me.

I'll help by listing other players I have (Scholes, Giggs, Ronaldo, Berbatov, Rio, Evra, Fletcher, Ruud) and haven't (Fabio, Hernandez, Kagawa, Anderson, Kleberson, Smith) rated over the years.

Now, what is this trend you speak of?

4754~~~
Who called him an effective defensive midfielder?

He was only mentioned in this thread as someone who has certain defensive qualities that Hererra does not. Some of which you've gone on to spell out.

The reason for these being mentioned was to explain why he might be preferred to Hererra against tough opposition, when we've a threadbare back four.

4755~~~
That's not quite as straight forward as it seems, those teams play like terriers, like it's their cup finals, they'll run and hassle all afternoon. Also there is a difference in the type of player you come up against in the two cases, I mean look at those big shit kickers in West Ham's team vs the softness of Arsenal just as one example of a team that might not have the status but would be physically harder to play again in a defensive aspect.

4756~~~
Well both will get a lot of games this season so I don't get why people love the comparison that much.

4757~~~
The lad has played 4 games for us. Remeber Evra's status after 4 games? It's a nonsense to expect to be able to judge a player on 4 games especially with all the change and transition here this season.

4758~~~
I genuinely thought the Djemba twins were going to be great for us.

I was wrong.

4759~~~
Don't quite see why this is framed as an either/or situation. If Hererra is fit and we go back to 2 CBs I would expect to see both of them out there. I suppose that, if we stick with 3 CBs, Fellaini is more likely to get the nod because he'll fit better into LvG's tactical plan, but I don't see why that should be taken as an indication of LvG liking or not liking either of the players - Herrera might be the best round peg in the world, but if LvG sees a square hole he's going to pick a square peg.

4760~~~
Before the Arsenal game, I read that they are one of the worst teams at defending set pieces. That's another factor LvG would have considered, not just his defensive set piece contributions.

True. But stats aside, when you're limiting quality sides like City, Chelsea and Arsenal to relatively (emphasis on relatively!) few opportunities, while coughing up chance after chance to poor teams teams like Leicester, West Ham or Everton (and they really were shite when we played them) then whoever played in midfield in those big games has done a better job at defending than whoever played against weaker opposition. Irrespective of what the stats say.

4762~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if Felllaini did cover a lot of ground, as he is always in one penalty box or the other. 

But I wouldn't think it was significantly more than Ander, who is a willing runner.

4763~~~
Milan could get a better and more sophisticated DM/CM than Gatusso. But everyone could see that Gatusso was perfect to the balance of that team. There are so many example that a 'less' footballer is preferred to the superior one, because of what the former could offer to the team is better than the latter.

4764~~~
I think you can also make a shout for it being the whole set up which was more balanced in these last few games. Before, we played di maria in midfield, next to Herrera, which would be fine if there wasn't also 3 strikers in front of them as well. Put Di maria and Herrera in midfield in the 4-1-4-1 and I'm sure it'd be a lot more balanced defensively.

4765~~~
Was gonna say this.
Quality of opposition is a massive factor when analysing performances.
I like Herrera and I like Fellaini, I find it sad and pathetic that folk on here go to such huge lengths to try to discredit one of our own players.

I would like to see us field both of them, along with Blind/Carrick in the holding role. Would be an excellent mix in my opinion.

4766~~~
Do you just not like Fellaini at all? That seems to be the only reason I can see based on performances so far you can say Herrera is miles better than Fellaini. Herrera has played 5 games for us and against opposition he should be miles better - especially if he is miles better than Fellaini - he should have absolutely bossed those games if he is miles better but, he didn't. 

Herrera has the potential to be a very good player and once we do get our defense stablized and depending on the formations/personnel we play, he could offer more to the team. I really do want to see him in the team and I also am relishing the type of style of football we could play with him in the team however, I don't see yet him making our team far better than with Fellaini in it.

4767~~~
Herrera, Blind and di Maria in a midfield 3 could have actually seen us keep the ball a bit against Arsenal.

I'm glad we won, but we were not dominant in the game at all.

4768~~~
Di Maria was playing as a striker, so by the same logic - Blind, Fellaini and Di Maria could have done equally well.

As it was, we had a two man midfield of Carrick and Fellaini. I doubt Herrera being there instead of Fellaini would have changed the fact that we were outnumbered and dominated in the first half.

I like Herrera and think he will be a really good player for us, but he is definitely one whose reputation seems to have substantially increased while he has been out injured. He was/is a solid all-round midfielder - tenacious and tidy on the ball, but he wasnt the second coming of Messi. As <a class="username" data-user="47413, @Shimo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47413/">@Shimo</a> said, in the games Herrera played we were playing teams that we should have comfortably beat. It may not been Herrera's fault that we didnt meet expectation, but his performances were obviously not so good that he single handedly dragged us to victory in those games, which is what folk on here seem to be making out.

4769~~~
But the "lesser player" was superior to most players tactically, he was intelligent, had great stamina, great positioning and was positively aggressive. Bottom line he wasn't a lesser player.

4770~~~
In terms of defensive interventions (tackles, interceptions, clearances and blocks) Herrera averages 6.9 per 90 minutes; Fellaini averages 10. Not surprisingly, Fellaini has a 6-1 advantage in winning aerial duels. Herrera edges pass completion 88.5 - 87.9. Funnily enough, neither has been credited with a through ball or a cross and they've both played a total of 11 long balls. None of this tells us a lot about the players - there're a lot of other statistics that doubtless paint a different picture. As I said above, LvG is probably going to continue picking round pegs for round holes and square pegs for square holes. We may see the holes differently and have different views on the qualities of the pegs - it doesn't really matter, we aren't deciding the tactics or picking the team. For the last 3 games Fellaini has been a good fit for the tactics chosen - for Hull and Stoke the tactics will probably be different, so perhaps we'll see Herrera (or both of them).

4771~~~
Nothing you have said contradicts anything I said.

Instead of 3 in midfield it was 3 in central defense, but that may be because of losing Blind, Carrick is not good holding on his own, imho. 

This way the constant outlet was the third cb instead of the third cm. And since Blind wasnt available is hard to say how Herrera would have done with say Carrick and Fellaini with Herrera. He's had Blind up till now to cover for his bombastic style.

4772~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.imgflip.com/8u2b.jpg" src="https://i.imgflip.com/8u2b.jpg"/> 
Herrera never played against Everton! It was Valencia who played in his place! So many people have made this mistake, but no one ever corrected this!

Anyways in the matches that Herrera did play in, the only one where I would say he was defensively poor was against Swansea, where his weak man-marking and aggressiveness was exposed by Swansea's midfielders. Otherwise, he did very well defensively, and the opposition had to frequently play long balls to our aerially weak defenders to have a chance at attacking us.

The reason Fellaini's played so often ahead is because he's very strong in the air. This helps us out in set pieces, and it helps us out when we go forward as we'd have another target for the crosses.

Defensively, there's small differences between Herrera and Fellaini. Herrera reads the game better, but Fellaini's stronger and more aggressive.

Ever since we've played with Fellaini instead of Herrera, our attacking play has worsened, whilst our defensive game has slightly improved with Fellaini's extra strength and aggression along with his aerial strengths. Our wingers struggle because no central midfielder goes out to support them, which is what Herrera does very well (and Fellaini only did this against Chelsea with Januzaj but failed to do this since then). Without Herrera, we've had no one to dictate play from midfield and control our pace, rhythm, and tempo.

Fellaini may have his strengths, but without Herrera, our midfield cannot control the match, and our creative burden falls on the wingers who receive little to no support and are frequently closed down in numbers.

4773~~~
The whole "defensive" approach and "player`s work rate" is overrated anyway. Paul Scholes wasn't exactly great at defending and he controlled the United midfield for two decades. Give me a good passer of the ball over a "hard worker" any day of the week. The statistic approach to football is making us think that a player with a lot of tackles who can cover large parts of the pitch is better than the one that can control and pass the ball with ease, nonsense.

4774~~~
Play them both, Fellaini and Herrera. You can fit Carrick in there too and we will be good attacking-wise with Rooney and Di Maria attacking. Think Carrick and Herrera will be good together too. Our overall play will significantly be better too I feel and the defense won't be exposed.

4775~~~
It's arguable that the exact opposite has happened. Some strange accusations have been levelled at Herrera recently. Naturally, his slight frame has allowed for the physicality debate to open up, even though he's demonstrated he's more than capable of winning and shielding the ball. The "loose passing" accusation is another strange one and hasn't been in evidence since the second or third game of pre season. His statistics are very high considering the direct nature of his passes.

Herrera has had a good start to life at United, or as much as you can given a mere 5 games played. That shouldn't be forgotten either.

4776~~~
Scholes could do so much more than pass a ball though. There isn't a single player we have right now capable of controlling the midfield like he did. Knew exactly when to speed the game up and when to pass it around with the defence. 

OT - Herrera will play when he's fully fit. A good player to transition the ball from defence to attack.

4777~~~
This would be more than welcome, giving us the best of both worlds. There's a great Dutch problem preventing that, however.

4778~~~
I know what you mean - he certainly isnt the typical Spanish playmaker, definitely has a bit more bite and tenacity to him. As usual people seem to either overrate or underrate him though.

4779~~~
It's no surprise that when he hasn't played in the past three/four games are football has been fairly dry and languid. He adds a much needed level of impetus and should play near to every match.

4780~~~
That fact that we have played Chelsea, City and Arsenal obviously cant have anything to do with it...

4781~~~
Granted, but a fairly complacent Chelsea who saw a 1-0 or even a draw away at Old Trafford as content, a fairly poor formed City (prior to Smalling's red) who were there to be matched (and we did so, could have been better with the tenacity Ander provides) and a very, very weak Arsenal side who were very reliant on one player. The latter game we did go with the game plan to absorb pressure and counter, but had Ander been fit and playing, our instigation into these attacks with the energy of Rooney and Di Maria upfront would have been more frequent. I'm not saying he would have completely revamped those games and been the absolute changer, but it's clear he adds an extra edge nobody else in central midfield does.

4782~~~
Arsenal aside since they could have ended the game in the first 25 minutes, that's a fair point, but I don't recall us giving much up to West Ham until right near the death and in the 3 games you mention we were still playing the diamond, a much more defensively open formation than the 4-3-3 we played against City and Chelsea. At the end of the day though it's fine margins and guessing, but one thing I think is undeniable is that even if it could be proven we are more secure with Fellaini than Herrera by even a narrow margin, we lose a lot in terms of our attacking play and passing tempo without him.

4783~~~
Even against Palace we were pretty pedestrian and looked out of ideas.

It's undoubted that Herrera massively adds to our attacking threat. He's the best number #8 at the club. 

Some of the comment on the Caf about Ander has been ridiculous. Soft? He played on against West Ham after cracking his ribs in the first half. Definitely wet then..

He'll probably have to wait until Fellaini has a bad game, or the boss wants to make a tactical switch he suits, to get back in. However, making out that Herrera ain't up to it is silly.

4784~~~
I expect him to get about half an hour in the next game now that he's played for the reserves and if he does well, he could start the game after that.

4785~~~
Again I like Herrera, but I fail to see how he would have had any major impact in any of those three games (unless we are talking about including him and changing formation by dropping RVP or similar, which is a different debate).
Chelsea are the best in the league by far, we matched them for the most part.
City we were well on top until Smalling got sent off, after that we struggled.
Arsenal came out all guns blazing and put a lot of pressure on our inexperienced back line, after we survived their initial onslaught we were on top.

I dont think having Herrera would have changed much in any of those scenarios.

Again, good player and I want to see him with Carrick and Fellaini in a 3-man midfield (drop RVP), but he isnt the messiah.

4786~~~
Agreed about Herrera. The lad is a quality player. But you are doing what you accuse others of. You've correctly taken exception to the over the top negative comments on Herrera to justify his exclusion from starting XI, but then gone on to say we looked pedestrian against Palace and implied subtly that Herrera would have solved that problem. We didn't look pedestrian or out of ideas against Palace.

4787~~~
Err...?

4788~~~
Err what? They had one chance in the game due a to defensive mix up. We dominated possession, scored a goal, hit the post, substitutions were ok and we won. Granted the first half was a bit meh though.

4789~~~
Had plenty of other chances to score as well. Had Rooney scored one of his chances, RvP scored his rebound/ mata's post shot went in, it would've been a standard 3 or 4-0 win.

4790~~~
We won the game and it was fairly sound bar the communication mishap, but that doesn't change the fact that we were pedestrian or out of ideas.

4791~~~
Agree with you, we created feck all and it was so boring, hardly created clear cut chances.

4792~~~
We'll just have to agree to disagree then.

4793~~~
We were hideous against Palace. Moyesian.

4794~~~
We did look pedestrian, though.

4795~~~
Well there's no real reason to throw everyone forward and go gung ho considering how the game went. We just sustained pressure while they camped inside their box, and we eventually broke them down, and even after that they didn't really try to go forward, or at least never had the chance to because we kept the ball. The way the game went, there just wasn't too much of a reason to change it too much as we had the win in the bag pretty much. We could've been better going forward of course, better decision making, better finishing, but the pace of our passing wasn't the problem at all I don't think.

4796~~~
Back on Herrera though, I doubt he'll start on the weekend. More likely midweek next week or against Southampton the week after, same with Falcao. He played 90 minutes yesterday on his return from injury, the next logical step with how LvG likes to do things is a sub appearance in the next game before he starts. Nothing to do with him not being rated or whatever. No need to rush him back either as we have a few decent options there anyways.

4797~~~
I've got my stupid tag for saying the same.

4798~~~
I don't remember exactly what you said about him from back then, but I do believe that you went farther than just this and started to go over the top with the criticism.

Anyways, in terms of whether Herrera could have made an impact against the other teams, I believe he certainly would have helped make di Maria and Januzaj more influential than they were, particularly in the second half. The same goes for when we played against Man. City. Against Crystal Palace, we may have done well in terms of creating chances in the final third, but we were slow and static in our build-up, making it easy for Crystal Palace to organise themselves. Plus, our attack didn't have much support, particularly van Persie.

Herrera would certainly have improved us in all of those matches, I believe, including Arsenal, where, even if we were under the cosh, we wouldn't have been so disjointed in our possession play, particularly during the first half.

4799~~~
and Wilshere's head...

4800~~~
I'd say recently (mainly in the last couple of years) you seem to have developed a soft spot for players/personnel that work hard but ultimately lack that top quality. The grafters if you like. Whereas you have less time/patience for flair like players that are technically better but may not work as hard. You seem to be very quick to get onto the back of people like RVP, Nani, Kagawa, Di Maria, LVG yet spend a lot of time defending people like Moyes, Valencia, Fellaini, Rooney.

4801~~~
The only obvious theme is so many of the "flair like players" in recent years being found surplus to requirements, while "grafters" seem to be more valued by successive managers, from Fergie right through to Van Gaal. So the obvious theme is me being eventually proved right!

In terms of my personal preference, I was always clearly on the Berbatov side of the great Berba vs Tevez debate (and I definitely got this one wrong, with the benefit of hindsight) That particular stance couldn't be more different to what you're accusing me of here.

4802~~~
Ha ha, gotta love that you make it so obvious that your hatred of Fellaini is due to your hatred of Moyes. You'd be despising Herrera now if Moyes had bought him!
You're the worst kind of 'fan' on here. It's always about individuals, never about the team. You'd probably love it if Fellaini got sent off in a game and it cost us. 
A proper United fan wouldn't care what personalities are involved as long as United are winning and progressing.

4803~~~
I hate Fellaini because of Moyes? Ah, in the same way I guess I hate Mata because of Moyes? Oh no wait...

4804~~~
I'd suggest that half the reason why we're in this mess is because to many grafters were prefered over flair like players. The lack of quality in the squad pre-LVG, in comparison with the top clubs in Europe was quite apparent.

4805~~~
I don't think the issue is too many grafters and not enough flair players so much as signing flair players who weren't good enough. Although, to be fair, really top class flair players are few and far between and extremely expensive.

4806~~~
Or he could actively dislike perceived popular players in an attempt to look like a controversial big man on an anonymous internet site. I don't think you post when you're not trying to sarcastically demean somebody or a player that somebody seems to admire.

4807~~~

4808~~~
The type of bullshit I expect from the mirror, yet there will be people on here who will lap it up.

4809~~~
Why don't the journalists ask what's going on with Herrera in the press conf instead of spouting bs at every turn?

4810~~~
Guys, considering Fellaini's form lately, what do you think of this:
------------Carrick------------
----Fellaini--------Di Maria---
------------Herrera------------
--Wilson---------Rooney------

I think it's a very balanced team- pace from Di Maria and Wilson, Carrick staying deep, Herrera at the tip of the diamond (covering for Di Maria when he goes forward), Rooney as a striker.

4811~~~
Because if they did, that would mean the end of their speculative articles, and you know that they want to milk as much from this situation as possible.

4812~~~
Question is, when will we have the personnel to play 4 at the back?

4813~~~
A cracked rib can take up to 6 weeks to heal. I am not surprised he hasn't featured until now.

4814~~~
I think it's highly likely we will sign Strootman sometime within the next 2 transfer windows, but doesn't he play in the same position as Herrera? Box to box role? Herrera cost a massive amount of money and I doubt any club would pay £28million to buy him off us either, but then why keep a £28million player on the bench or even buy him in the first place?

Only thing I can think of is LVG including both Herrera and Strootman is going to a 4-3-3 formation but that has it's own problems as well lol, Falcao, RVP, Rooney, only 1 of them would be able to play.

4815~~~
RvP is more or less done anyways and shouldn't be starting anymore, so it would be Rooney, Falcao and then probably Di Maria for the front 3 with Herrera, Strootman and Blind in midfield. Seems fine to me.

4816~~~
Strootman isn't the greatest box-to-box player around though despite his evenly distributed skillset. Really doubt he'll be in direct competition with Herrera for the role. He's a bit like Matic or a more robust version of of Carrick and has the ability to develop into a very well rounded defensive midfielder given his tenacity, good passing range and spatial intelligence on the pitch. A midfield three of Ander, Strootman and Di Maria would be extremely well rounded going forward with a healthy mix of graft, skill, pressing ability and dynamism. Additionally, one could feasibly expect about 20 goals per season from such a setup which would be nice.

4817~~~
That is the answer. I think LVG put him on the bench in terms of an unforseen accident or injury but wouldnt really risk him if not really necessary. Arsenal was surely not the game for him to come back so with the Reserves game under his belt I'm confident that he will get minutes now again

4818~~~
The fabled "physicality of the PL", how slight of frame is oscar, hes probably the smallest player in the league, the physicality doesnt seem to affect him, or silva, even mata

This physicality stuff, people seem to go a bit overboard with it

4819~~~
He's a gritty bugger. He can take the challenges no problem. As long as we keep him away from refs with sharp elbows.

4820~~~
You should tweet David McDonnell, the author of the piece <a class="username" data-user="23692, @Brophs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23692/">@Brophs</a> pasted, and ask him if he's going to follow up on what he wrote with questions to LVG on Herrera in today's press conference.

4821~~~
Herrera was mentioned on the RedMancunian podcast today and one of the contributors suggested there had been rumors that he had been "enjoying the Manchester nightlife" and possibly turning up late for injury rehab sessions. Sounds like 2+2=5 type conjecture to me and the reality is more likely a combination of his recovery taking a bit longer than expected and Fellaini's form.

4822~~~

4823~~~
Tell-tale signs. He's definitely leaving...

4824~~~
He's going to be investigated because of match-fixing allegations in a match between Levante and Zaragosa in 2011, if a ban is imposed it could affect him even if he's not playing in the LFP anymore.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.marca.com/2014/11/28/futbol/1417174417.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.marca.com/2014/11/28/futbol/1417174417.html</a>

4825~~~
What?!

4826~~~
Old news. He did nothing wrong IMO, and will be cleared.

4827~~~
Sounds like utter BS is what it sounds like. Doesn't seem the type at all.

4828~~~
Honestly, it seems the papers just read the caf and post the opinions of the most fretful. He broke his ribs, he came back too soon and he's being eased back into it, Van Gaal has a very strict regime.

4829~~~
From what I recall of that story was he not simply being called as a witness rather than being the subject of the investigation?

4830~~~
Obviously Van Gaal's not telling the truth because the Daily Express knows more about his players than he does. Herrera's definitely leaving.

4831~~~
At least we know something now.

4832~~~
That's good to hear. Puts all these unsubstantial assertions of Van Gaal not rating Herrera to bed. Hopefully he starts vs Hull or atleast turns out for a good 30 or 45 minutes in the second half. A fully fit Ander is needed now more than ever with the injury to Blind.

4833~~~
LvG didn't say that, was said by Herrera on his interview on MUTV I'm reading.

4834~~~
Does it matter who said it, if Herrera was still in pain, then that is why he wasn't playing.

4835~~~
So what was he doing on the bench if he couldn't play?

4836~~~
More quotes. Anyone able to verify? Do these come from the manager's in house pre-game interview with MUTV?

4837~~~
Maybe Ander needed that reserve game to prove to himself that he could play without pain and take tackles etc. It was probably a big confidence boost for him. He may never have had that sort of injury before and there must be some fear there that you will injure yourself again. That game against Blackburn and the behind closed door game against Blackpool will have done wonders for him.

4838~~~
Yup, watch out for his body language tomorrow. He's sure to wave goodbye to the home crowd.

4839~~~
Ander will need to take his chance when he gets it. We still have a big squad and they have to learn that they don't always play, but he will get a game.

4840~~~
WTF is this ?

4841~~~
Has the world gone made, players gets injured, misses few games and suddenly he's leaving..

4842~~~
Quality. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4843~~~
Newspapers read the caf, any theories we conjure up usually get turned into print

4844~~~
He said in the press conference about everybody has to fight for his place. This is just another way of saying it really.

4845~~~
Hasn't been here long enough to miss United when he leaves. Three fecking months from his league debut.

4846~~~
Yeah, both newspapers and theories here about him leaving are mad. 

Btw I like your tagline. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4847~~~
Just the caf, mate.

4848~~~
In the interview on MUTV, Ander says he understands there are a lot of good players and that he might not always play. He said he was a lucky guy to play for Manchester United. That he is happy here and that he want to be ready when the boss wants him.

4849~~~
Saying nobody is an automatic starter pretty much, which is true. 

As for him still being on the bench, well that would probably be because with his rib injury, he could run and all, but any 50/50 duel would leave him in pain so he couldn't really play and was there in case somebody got injured.

4850~~~
Herrera is so fecking good, cannot wait til he's back <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> .. however Fellaini doesn't deserve to be dropped which is the truth. At least we're getting a return on our 28 million investment of the Belgian.

4851~~~
So are those quotes about the rib injury true? Its so hard to verify anything that comes from twitter. You can't even trust the official site nowadays either <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4852~~~
Fair enough. But IIRC, Louis has consistently maintained that he wants a very small selection to work with as a way of maintaining consistency and developing automation. Injury aside, why should our best natural midfielder (based off his career so far at Bilbao, Zaragoza not so much) have to struggle to find game-time, especially in lieu of the human microphone. A bit double standard-ish that Mata (our second highest goalscorer and third highest assist provider in just 7 starts) and Herrera (again, just to re-emphasize - aside from the injuries) find themselves in a dogfight for playing time yet Robin (who I really appreciate mind) walks into every selection despite being off the boil since the start of the season pretty much.

4853~~~
From his interview he said his rib was fine. That he was in pain, but as to when that pain went, only Ander knows that. He obviously is proud as punch to play here. I think he needed the two games he has had to build his confidence back up, he mentioned about the confidence. It could have been at the back of his mind that another tackle or challenge and his rib would break again. Now he knows he is fine. It's now up to the lad to take his chance when he gets it. He is such a lovely personality and wants to do well.

4854~~~
The Robin situation needs to be sorted or LvG will look like a hypocrite. If there are any press reading this, why not ask LvG why Robin plays even though he has been dire. If you are hard enough.

4855~~~
Good to hear that. Gotta love the lads attitude.

4856~~~
By the way, I am not sure I heard LvG mention about Herrera, but Ander himself in his interview said he realised he had to fight for his place and that there are a lot of good players here. Seems to be some confusion about who said what. Bloody twitter.

4857~~~
Yup, it's a bit much. That said, even though it's a bitter pill to swallow, as long as we're getting results on a consistent basis - I really don't mind if some of my favorite players aren't starting regularly. These things are just a part of sporting fabric. Hope Ander takes it in his stride and ousts his competitor (I'm guessing the rather functional Marouane) for a starting role.

4858~~~
I presume there will be a game where we don't score or create nothing with Fellaini and Carrick and LvG will realise we need something in there. I know he likes Strootman but for me that is a risk in January. Summer transfer window is when he will go for him. Still not sure about him tbh.

4859~~~
Aye, the duo of Carrick (brilliant TBF) and Fellaini is a bit static and if a team marks Michael out, we have little creativity left in the centre of the park, something that came to light in the first half at the Emirates. As for Strootman, he might be a Van Gaal protege but the ACL injury worries me too, given our track record with players having far from perfect injury records (Hargreaves and Jones are two prime example I can think of, off the top of my head). Though admittedly, no doubt some might point out Ruud who made a smashing recovery from a similar injury and I'd have no comeback for that.. Err..

4860~~~
Are these quotes genuine? Would b surprised if he did say that.

4861~~~
Rvp is far from done lol and he's still easily our best striker. But he deserves to be on the bench for the form he's showing in recent weeks though but who exactly can we replace him with? Falcao's been injured and Wilson hasn't done much either.

I would like to see us bring Carvalho in to play the holding role then alongside Strootman and Herrera, could be a incredible midfield tbh, although I need to see more of Herrera.

4862~~~
Van Persie at his best wasn't even easily our best striker. Many people would say that Falcao at his best is better then RvP at his best, and you can make an argument for Rooney at his best being better then RvP a few years ago when he was at his best. That's besides the point though. The form he's shown for the most part of the last year and a half shows signs that he's been declining for a while, and he is 31 now, he's not exactly young. Both Rooney and Falcao are 2 years younger, and both should be in their primes still. 

As for who can replace him? Falcao when he's fit of course, but otherwise either Mata and push Rooney up top where he should be, or Januzaj to play as a winger, or someone else like that. We have plenty of options and RvP is far from a key player these days. If he finds his form from 2012, then he'd be brilliant of course, but I'd put money on that not happening considering his age and all the injury problems he's had so of course that takes its toll on him.

4863~~~
Which quotes? He said in his most recent interview that he feels very lucky to be here, is enjoying it and realises that with lots of good players in the squad he may not always get to start.

4864~~~
What? Who was better then? None of Rooney, Welbeck or Hernandez was even close to RVP's level in the 2012/13 season and definitely not 2011/12 season when he was at Arsenal. Falcao at his best wasn't better than RVP at his best either, in the 2011/12 season he scored 37 goals for Arsenal and single handidly carried them to 3rd in the league, go and look at that Arsenal team he was playing in and tell me that isn't an achievement. Van Persie was the best player in the league when we bought him.

4865~~~
The ones from LvG about Herrera.

4866~~~
Back to Herrera, apparently according to MUTV he's been in pain for the last 3 games so couldn't play. Very interesting to see if he gets minutes tomorrow at home against a side we should ideally be beating quite easily.

4867~~~
Some of them actually seem to be just quotes from Herrera's interview misreported as if Van Gaal said them. 'There are good players here so I can't always start' was definitely something Herrera said, not LVG. On that basis, I wouldn't trust that source. I'm pretty sure the 'United Today' blog on the official site covers the entirety of the interview, so that's the best place to look if you want to know everything that was said.

4868~~~
Outstanding 32 minute cameo, he brought our good passing moves back

4869~~~
I can't really comment on today, I'm far too biased. I liked him at Athletic, I liked him even more when he signed for us. I think he makes the team play better - he's alert, he's active, he's the bloke who "makes himself available", he could become absolutely critical to us. I would be really disappointed if the philosophy can't accommodate him.

Hopefully by the end of the season no one will have any doubts, and he'll be an obvious choice in every game.

4870~~~
He has to be in the starting 11 somewhere every week. Amazing player.

4871~~~
I think those quotes were actually from Herrera as said above. He loves it here and know he might not always play. He said what a lucky guy he is to play for us. Love him.

4872~~~
This the same as my post in the Mata thread but they were as good as each other today. Great performance. Him and Mata create so much space in attack it's just brilliant to watch. It's what made the Spain team of 2008-2012 so unstoppable. At least one of them needs to play almost every week. They are both too good to be sat on the bench.

4873~~~
Love the guy.

4874~~~
Not sure why our strikers insist on taking another touch when he puts them through on goal. Just shoot, its on a platter. Fantastic little player, his little one twos with Mata were a highlight for me.

4875~~~
the wonderfull thing about Herrera is that he is always available for a pass always moving and has got great reactions and anticipation and fight spirit he can loos the ball to suddenly regain possession back. He set up goal for RVP. Rooney has got this as well and also diMaria - sucha a shame that he is injured now because him and herrera in the side its just different match. Movement everywhere I love that. We desperately need players like that.

4878~~~
Deserved. His performance was thoroughly enjoyable to watch. 

What a player.

4879~~~
Love watching Herrera play. While I was disappointed that Di Maria picked up an injury, I was really happy to see Herrera come on.

4880~~~
Best player out there today. Good positioning and passing. Was involved in two of the goals as well.

4881~~~
Was loving seeing him play today. He definitely adds more to our play in general.

4882~~~
Why would we sell for half the price?

Crazy idea that ain't gonna happen.  I could see Mata going as he does not seem to fit the formations but Herrera has a great future with us.

4883~~~
Predictably excellent. While Carrick was the ringleader of our dominance today, you simply can't do it without players like Herrera and Mata in there who know how to pass and move and play it through the middle.

I'm warming to Fellaini and there's no question he was good today, but if it's between him and Herrera then it should be Herrera except in very particular circumstances.

4884~~~
Top performance when he came on. Very precise with his passing and even when he did misplace a pass he did all he could to win the ball back.

4885~~~
agreed. Herrera was literally everywhere. May put something in here about his performance later

4886~~~
???

Reminds me of Blackadder's procedure on stepping on a landmine - leap high into the air and spread yourself over a wide area.

4887~~~
Herrera's probably my favourite player, alongside De Gea. He's just a joy to watch, particularly as his own passion for the game shines through ever second he plays.

4888~~~
He moves the ball around so fast he has a fantastic footballing brain. Start him every game boss.

4889~~~
Got this from RoM - quote from LVG

Seems to suggest he's been fine to play, just hasn't wanted to use him for recent games for whatever reason. Regardless, Saturday's performance and hopefully a start against Stoke will give LVG some hard decisions to make - it's really nice to have options for CM.

4890~~~
FWIW, I think van Gaal just wanted some continuity in midfield, especially when the defence is changing every game. Don't fix what's not broken etc. 
And yes, it's really lovely to have midfield <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4891~~~

4892~~~
By the way, he was playing as a number 10.

It's where I think he's at his best. If we stick with the diamond I would have him and Carrick at opposite ends, with two from Mata, Fellaini, Di Maria and Januzaj competing for the slots on either side of the diamond (obviously, right now, Fellaini and Mata don't deserve to be dropped).

4893~~~
so ADM up front?

4894~~~
That was Van Gaal's intention, apparently.

4895~~~
Great performance this weekend against................Hull.

Let's see him build on that and put some similar performances in against tougher opposition.

4896~~~
Just what worries me... I'd rather he was influencing games further up, if we insist with the diamond of Fellaini and Mata flanking Herrera up top and Carrick at the base, why not play the striker off Herrera and give ADM a free role in the middle of the diamond? kind of B2B..

4897~~~
Despite generally being pretty vocal about wanting AdM back in the midfield, in games like Saturday's I don't mind him nominally starting up top. He's got the pace to keep defenders on their toes and when we're as fluid as we were against Hull he can pop up as and when he likes. 

If we're playing possession football it also makes sense to keep him higher up the pitch, he's our best player but he's also one of our most direct and LvG might not want him making risky decisions in the middle of park

4898~~~
He is embarassing

4899~~~
Well looks like he'll be on the bench for the next 4 weeks on this showing.

4900~~~
Says the guy who supports AC Milan.

4901~~~
Ok

4902~~~
Assist. Good job making me look like a dick Ander.

4903~~~
He's created 50% of our last 4 goals. #stats

4904~~~
Embarrassing cross and assist too.

4905~~~
That was a shot.

4906~~~
Yeah, an embarrassing assist.

4907~~~
Glad he got that assist. Was looking out of sorts earlier

4908~~~
Great cross. Been defending very well but really poor on the ball apart from that one moment. Hopefully just early game jitters.

4909~~~
Great cross for the goal, but he has been terrible other than that.

4910~~~
He seems in too much of a rush when the ball comes to him tonight, needs to calm down a bit.

4911~~~
Been very sloppy, needs to improve in the second half. Good cross for the goal.

4912~~~
Seems to have a habit of giving the ball away then immediately win it back. Disappointing half from him considering his performance vs Hull

4913~~~
Second the other opinions here so far. Amazing cross for the goal, but absolutely shocking game otherwise. Sloppy in passing and possession, and the less said about that finish, the better.

4914~~~
He really should have scored from that forced error. He probably had time to take a touch, though he probably wasn't to know that. Still, a poor strike when Begovic was in no mans land.

4915~~~
He gives it back way too quickly at times whereas he has time and space to move forward with the ball.

4916~~~
Not his best performance, started pretty slowly but finished fairly well. Even after his assist Herrera still looked off the pace. It wasn't until 10 or so minutes into the second half that he really started to move the ball well. I thought we lost an outlet when he went off. After Herrera left the field Stoke started their onslaught. Coincidence? I think not.

4917~~~
Sloppy.

4918~~~
Really good 2nd half. Sloppy in the first but still a great assist.

4919~~~
I thought he was very good in the second half. His linkup with Mata was a joy to watch at times.

4920~~~
Didn't do enough tonight to displace Fellaini. Did well with his assist but he was poor at times.

4921~~~
Didn't see the first half, thought he was good in the second though.

4922~~~
I actually thought he wasn't as bad as some are making out. He did get caught in possession a few times but he linked well with Mata in the midfield. 

Put it this way, we looked a lot more vulnerable when he was replaced by Fletcher.

4923~~~
It's interesting. People talk about LvG loving him because of his technical ability but in reality he gives the ball away a decent amount for a team that wants to dominate possession. I understand he takes more risks but he has to work on his game to make sure they are the right risks to take. Not the best game but a good cross for the goal. Hope he isn't injured either.

4924~~~
Didn't catch the first half so can't comment but I thought he was very good in the second. The most creative player on the park.

4925~~~
To be fair the first half was partly expected. Ander's still a bit short of 100 % match fitness given that he's only played about 150 odd minutes including U-21 level since West Brom. Seemed to be in a bit of a rush initially but calmed down considerably in the 2nd half. Maybe the added competition has made him anxious to prove himself in the manager's eyes and he got carried away with the exuberance or maybe he's hasn't fully synced with the speed of the league, that can sometimes throw a player off because of alterations to their internal rhythm. Reckon he'll be much better vs Southampton with some quality starting time under his belt (provided Van Gaal continues with him in the starting XI). Was our biggest creative outlet vs Stoke anyway IMO.

4926~~~
Some very good passes and vision shown but he was somewhat sloppy and rushed in the tackle. Decent performance overall with an assist.

4927~~~
A bit of sloppiness in the first half, but I wasn't too disappointed with him. His only issue that he sometimes tries to overcomplicate things, but most of the time, he uses the ball very well and is a very creative player, not to mention that he's very good at winning the ball.

He was awesome in the second half. Once Stoke started to push up, he was very good at creating chances and getting into great positions.

Once again, as well, once he went off, we lost all control of the match. This is quite concerning, and van Gaal should talk to his teammates to make sure that we don't concede possession so easily towards the end.

4928~~~
Not his best game but he grew into it and grabbed an assist. I was fearful that he'd get bullied by the Stoke players but he did reasonably well in the end.

Has to improve though.

4929~~~
I agree with most of the comments above however what struck me most was even in a performance where you can level a few sloppy passes and moans at Herrera, the difference when Fletcher replaced him was so significant that it really showed what he's all about. The mantra of you're better when you're not playing etc really stood true in those 10 mins of Fletcher game time.

Get the feeling he will be one of those players where there will always more that Herrera can do in certain fans eyes during games but the essence is that generally when he plays, we are a far better team progressively, tactically, on the ball and off the ball.

4930~~~
Good cross for Fellaini's goal, nice touches here and there but on the whole thought he was poor today. He's a forward thinking player so understandable he gives away possession more than others but positionally he needs to gain a better understanding.

4931~~~
Poor first half but very good second half. You could see the difference instantly when he went off. His work rate is impressive.

4932~~~
Love his energy levels. Give it away a few times, but generally did well. Let's not forget, prior to Hull, he hasn't had much game time.

4933~~~
Grew into the game I thought. Not got much to complain about him going forward but feel like he needs to improve defensively, positionally can be suspect and dribbled past too easily.

4934~~~
Put it this way, that cross was so good I thought it was RVP or a left footed player that put it in. 

He also created about 3 other chances for others apart from the goal. He had a decent game to me !

4935~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I yelled out "great cross RVP!" before I realised it was Herrera.

4936~~~
Started slowly but got back to his normal level afterwards. Great cross for the goal, and he's such a useful player to have. Even when his passing is off as it was in the first half, his pressing and work rate is invaluable to us.

4937~~~
Absolutely diabolical until the assist, every touch went to shit. But more competent after that.

4938~~~
I thought he did fairly well. I can understand the criticism of his touch and failing to play the right pass at times but he was up against a physical stoke side and he did well given his size. His work rate was excellent and he never let his head drop even after a few bad touches and that miss - which was unforgivable if you ask me.

4939~~~
He lost a little bit of touch from the previous game and it was due to the fact that it was on Satturday and he is not in the est shape after injury. He needs some competitive game time, because he is a player who runs his socks of all match.. his distribution and passing was excellent against HUll today he struggled little bit but again it was maybe two times when he lost the ball and won the ball back straight away invaluable player for us.. Once he get his sharpness back he will be great and he also needs movement around him.. Players were tired today and stoked played in a deep block..

4940~~~
I only really saw the 2nd half but I thought he had a decent game.
You'd have hoped for more control and possession in the middle i guess but stoke did a good job of denying it.
He did pretty well despite that and we always look drastically better with him than we do without him.
Tiredness from having played so recently, the recent come back from injury etc. give him a good excuse for a below par performance.
(Like Fellaini we look better with him than without though)

4941~~~
Had a shocking first 20 mins but improved throughout the game.

4942~~~
I'm surprised a bit by his productivity, only had 5 goals and 5 assists all season last year, but has 2 goals and 3 assists so far this season in 7 appearances, and he could have easily got another goal or assist in the last 2 games if we weren't so wasteful. Been a very long time since we had a goal threat from midfield, refreshing to see.

4943~~~
Very frustrating at times today. Gave the ball away a lot, and generally looked like he was suffering from playing in the cold.

4944~~~
We discussed, but didn't enjoy his performance as a no. 10 <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> 

It felt as if when under a fair bit of attention, he was unable to get out of tight spaces (which is what happens when you are a no. 10). Not that Mata doesn't have that problem, but I was hoping Herrera and Mata would swap positions at half time.

4945~~~
I wonder if the match-fixing investigation has done his head in a bit? Something was off.

4946~~~
A good game, moments of quality, followed by really poor moments. Overall though, he was decent and you can see the qualities he brings us.

4947~~~
Would have got a goal last night if he wasn't so wasteful, no "we" about it.

4948~~~
Got bullied a bit last night, which resulting in loosing possession a few times - but on the whole he needs to start every game. His movement and quick passing has sped our general play up ten-fold.

4949~~~
Wasn't great yesterday but he hasn't been playing regularly for a while, he will get better.

4950~~~
Was the reason he came off due to injury looked like he was holding his ribs after that challenge, and stayed down then came off  moments later? Wasnt sure though. Not another injury!

4951~~~
There's a trend here for overly criticising players who are still to settle in and also haven't had a decent run of games without absence through injury. To my mind his performances against Hull and Stoke are those of someone coming back from a month off whilst still trying to find their feet at a new club, in transition, in a foreign league. He's already got 2 goals and 3 assists and is going to get even better.

4952~~~
Don't think it's anything serious.

4953~~~
I thought it was Mata and had double cause for celebration as i just brought him into my fantasy team. Then realised it was Herrera and thought I'd live without 3 points.

4954~~~
I knew it was Herrera right away, those 3 are too different in looks and movement to be confused with each other.

4955~~~
Prefer him a little deeper in a normal CM role than the 10 role.

4956~~~
Started very badly, but improved on the second half.

4957~~~
Not on a stream which was not high quality.

4958~~~
At the start of the game he was being robbed of the ball quite a bit and playing passes to Stoke players.  I was not overly conscious of his efforts other than that.  I remember the shot he sent into the stands when he was on goal too.  He played a part and I am glad we have him on the squad but he didn't have a great game.

4959~~~
Personally I was a little dissappointed in his performance. Last game I came in here talking about how he added tempo to the team, was happy to play the ball quickly with one touch play and it vastly improved our attack.

Last night none of that was present. He had his moments, a good left footed cross for someone like Fellaini, and since we had Fellaini he was able to head it home. By the way the cross from the left is exactly why he should be playing on the left of the diamond, not Mata. And he also made a run down the right and put a good ball across the box in the 2nd half.

But he picked the wrong pass a couple of times and missed what should have been a goal, like others he was guilty of losing the ball too often

4960~~~
Being made MOM in the Hull game might have caused him to be trying too hard last night. Just play your own simple game Ander, don't try to over complicate things. You are a good player for us and don't need to prove otherwise.

4961~~~
It was also a different role without Rooney in the team, so there are factors. Still I was expecting him to play the same way trying to move the ball about quickly and easily

4962~~~
Surprisingly positive Guardian article...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/02/manchester-united-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...united-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report</a>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Manchester United’s Ander Herrera inspires hard-earned win against Stoke</b></span>

Manchester United are beginning to resemble the juggernaut of old. This was a fourth consecutive league win under Louis van Gaal, as the side continues to settle as the manager predicted they would on becoming familiar with his methods.

These remain early days, yet before Monday’s visit to Southampton there can only be optimism regarding United’s consistent form. At the close they rode their luck but had earned this fortune due to a display that left players and fans content, though Van Gaal less so.

“I’m happy with the result – tomorrow we have a Christmas party and it’s important we can enjoy that. I am not happy with the performance. I wasnot pleased with the first half. We were not so aggressive as in the last match and we want to play in the same style. I think we don’t keep our positions on the pitch, so we don’t create so many chances in the first half. Only the chance from [Ander] Herrera and then we have to finish that of course,” he said before hailing Marouane Fellaini’s header. “OK, the goal was a very nice goal also.”

The team news consisted of Wayne Rooney being unfit due to a knee problem suffered in <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/29/manchester-united-hull-city-premier-league-match-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Saturday’s 3-0 win over Hull City</a>. This meant James Wilson was named ahead of Radamel Falcao for only a second Premier League start of his career. The other change from the weekend was Herrera for Ángel di María, who had suffered a hamstring injury.

Of Rooney Van Gaal said: “It is his knee but we have to wait for tomorrow to say anything about it because you never know with a knee. In my opinion it is not so heavy but I am not a doctor.

“We have to wait a scan and we will know more. Di María is not so heavy but, of course, he shall not play against Southampton but you never know.”

United should have taken the lead when Asmir Begovic’s mistake handed possession to Robin van Persie inside the goalkeeper’s area. Yet despite Wilson being available, the Dutch striker chose to pass to Herrera, who skied over from close in.

<b><i>Herrera was about to make amends. The No21 lined up in the middle of United’s advanced midfield trident, yet was using much of the turf. When Juan Mata moved along the left, it was Herrera who provided the overlap to run on to the ball and swing in a perfect left-foot cross that had Fellaini rising to head home in the 21st minute.</i></b>

Stoke had barely threatened the home side and, as the half went on, there was a sense that only United could undo themselves. And so it proved six minutes before the interval. When Herrera passed to Fellaini, the midfielder suddenly went down holding his neck. From the ensuing move the ball ricocheted off Chris Smalling, following a Bojan Krkic run, and into Steven Nzonzi’s path. The midfielder emphatically beat David de Gea and it was one apiece.

Before this the home support had been singing their favourite carol. This is the one that goes to the tune of Twelve Days of Christmas and that starts with “Five Cantonas”. When the referee, Jon Moss, blew for half-time this festive cheer had dissipated.

Fellaini had walked off having missed a chance to register his and the team’s second while holding the troublesome neck. However, he was fit to resume after the break and was soon linking up with Herrera and Antonio Valencia along United’s right.

<i><b>As on Saturday Herrera was involved in much of his team’s smart play. </b></i>The next time came when he appeared down Valencia’s flank and with a smart soft-shoe shuffle won a free-kick with which Mata should have done better than hit straight at Begovic.

United were pouring forward. Fellaini, Van Persie, Herrera and Wilson were all involved as the 20-times champions threatened to retake the lead only to be repelled by stiff Stoke resistance.

This was about to crumple. From the right Mata again curved in a high ball and this time, with Marcos Rojo in attendance, a host of Stoke players, including Ryan Shawcross, merely watched as it bounced past Begovic and in to give United the advantage again in the 59th minute.

Rojo’s girlfriend later posted a photograph online to prove he had got the final touch but by the close no one in red cared. Wilson provided the contest’s exhilarating moment. Receiving the ball near halfway, a burst of pace swept him through and, though the shot was wide, here was an impressive marker from the 18-year-old. After Mame Diouf twice had efforts repelled off the United line, including a memorable save from De Gea and an Ashley Young clearance, the same could be said of United.

Van Gaal added: “In the second half we played much better, more aggressive but then you have to finish it. Wilson could have finished it, Fellaini could have finished it. We knew in advance it is difficult to defend long balls and [we had] a great save from De Gea and a little bit of luck from Ashley Young. You have to see the whole match and say there is one team that deserved it and that is Manchester United.”

He was not wrong.

Also got our highest rating in the Mail... 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2858093/Manchester-United-2-1-Stoke-PLAYER-RATINGS-Ander-Herrera-revels-advanced-role-Wayne-Rooney-s-absence.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...els-advanced-role-Wayne-Rooney-s-absence.html</a>

4964~~~
Didn't watch the game but from what I hear he lost possession a few times. I think when your playing a team like stoke who hound their opponents and aren't afraid to get stuck in, then you have to accept you will loose the ball a few times. What I don't want to see is are players being afraid to make a risky pass just because they make one bad one. The more you try, the better chance you will succeed. Patience is the key.

4965~~~
Playing in the 10 role means he takes more risks when in possession than he would normally, it's to be expected and I'm not sure what the big criticism was in the first half. Go read the Di Maria thread before we signed him pages full of posters claiming he lost the ball too much.

4966~~~
Would it be fair to say that Herrera offers us a lot of what Shinji was supposed to offer us, but also provides us qualities Shinji never had? I appreciate that they are capable of taking up different positions on the pitch.

4967~~~
He provides a lot of elements that both Cleverley and Kagawa were meant to but didn't, really. He provides the gritty, tenacious mobility necessary in the middle of the park, as well as being technically tidy and really increasing the tempo and intensity we play at. Along with this, he has began to provide the statistical value - 2 goals and 3 assists in 7 matches playing as a box-to-box/free form #10 is pretty impressive.
I really rate him very highly. Once he fully beds into the league, I genuinely think he could be one of the best midfielders around.

4968~~~
This guy...he's such a joy to watch; the one touch passing, the pass accuracy, his ability to remain open at all times.

For me he's our most important player, the creative midfielder is the heartbeat of the team.

And just the sort of guy who should flourish under van Gaal.

4969~~~
On the bench again...

4970~~~
Hmm....

4971~~~
Wasn't exactly fantastic last week to be fair.

4972~~~
I thought Herrera was one of the best performers in the 2nd half and he created Fellani's goal was a great cross. Disappointing he's not starting.

4973~~~
Neither was the rest of the side, bar Smalling and De Gea/Young's last 5 minutes.

4974~~~
I wouldn't be dropping him right now as he's one of the few who is consistently in the mix of creating chances and scoring but it's not an easy game away to So'ton.

He'll be the first subbed on I reckon.

4975~~~
Disappointing to see him dropped. He's one of the few players in the squad that tries to inject a quick tempo to our play.

4976~~~
He might think he will be more valuable against Liverpool. Remember Liverpool will have played in Europe. A faster paced game might be better then.

4977~~~
Neither were a lot of the other players. Mata was worse than him and he starts.

4978~~~
Surprised he is not in the starting eleven, would prefer him instead of Mata considering we have Rooney back now.

4979~~~
He was okay against Stoke but maybe Van Gaal didn't think he can stay in top form while playing 3 times a week so soon after coming back from injury, he did look a bit tired against Stoke and a bit off in the start at least. You can see he wants more defensive solidity and strength with Fellaini which is fair enough. He'll probably be subbed on though as he's useful for his creativity and his pressing so can be used for different situations.

4980~~~
I don't understand why we require 3 centre backs and a defensive midfielder against a team that plays a lone striker, Herrera wouldve been a huge asset in there.

4981~~~
Can't understand why the feck we revert to that 352 shit again. It's definitely not playing to our strengths.

4982~~~
Quite a surprise van Gaal prefers Mata than him behind RvP and Rooney. On the basis of recent performances I thought it was the other way around.

4983~~~
It's weird. In the summer, Herrera was the type of player LVG loved, some argued more suited to us (in terms of style of play) than Kroos or Fabregas. 

Fellaini has heralded as the guy a manager like LVG would get rid of ASAP.

Also had a fair few, including myself, unsure how LVG would take to Rooney.

Maybe LVG just doesn't rate Herrera all that highly, or rates Fellani quite high?

4984~~~
I doubt he cares either way. Its about the system, not individual players.

4985~~~
Hey, Young and Valencia are wingers by trade. with that in mind, Its a more attacking formation than not...

4986~~~
The problem is that we have no one to increase the tempo in this side, and we don't look any more defensively solid in a 3-5-2 anyway. Fellaini and Carrick in a 2 man CM is a worry as well, thankfully they also have injuries to some of their main players.

4987~~~
We've played them in a back 4 before, comfortably, then I understand the use of Carrick, but otherwise it seems overly defensive.

4988~~~
If his poor game against Stoke is the reason he doesn't start, well, why is RvP still starting game after game?

I'd have preferred him to start and to change our back 4 again is not just giving us consistancy

4989~~~
Must be that rib injury again.

4990~~~
WTF hes been dropped for young?

4991~~~
Stop making excuses. Dropped him, nothing to do wih Liverpool.

4992~~~
This thread will only end up one way. Stupidity and attention-seeking from both sides no doubt. Two instances already.

4993~~~
No, he hasn't.

People are overreacting and overrating Herrera. He was average against Stoke, and poor in the first half. It's no surprise he is out because we want to be more solid defensively away from home. He'll be on at some point.

4994~~~
Rather see him than Fellaini but the latter has done well recently. May also be a thought that he can match Wanyama physically.

4995~~~
Does LVG not really rate Herrera?  Fellaini seems to have gone ahead of him in the pecking order now with Herrera only played as a last resort.

4996~~~
You can say that for every game though - every team (well most) have a robust midfielder.

4997~~~
Did he not get a knock in the last game that forced him off?

4998~~~
I think Van Gaal may have missed a trick here, to be honest. Wanyama dumps his kegs when pressed. Is Mata really going to hound him and steal the ball? I'm not sure. I think Herrera at #10, marking Wanyama with Fellaini helping out physically, would have been a good tactic tonight.

Rooney aside, our attack is horribly laboured.

4999~~~
Forgot about that too. Good point!

5000~~~
Victor Wanyama's physicality would not suit Herrera and would limit his influence. 

The guy bullied Xavi and Ineista before.

5001~~~
I seem to remember everyone on here panicing about his rib when it happened.

5002~~~
You won't get any arguments from me about that.

5003~~~
Hasn't Van Gaal said that this is the formation he wants to play?  Obviously he's been unable to play it recently due to most of our central defenders being injured!

5004~~~
Right. I think one thing is abundantly clear. Van Gaal doesn't rate Herrera as highly as most people on the caf.

5005~~~
Stop coming in here and throwing a grenade in the room.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

5006~~~
Has he said that?

5007~~~
To be fair, there's been some sort of mass delusion in this thread for ages. That he was somehow just injured enough to make the bench but not to play. For two or three weeks in a row. Can we put that one to bed now?

5008~~~
I thought he did, I might be wrong!

5009~~~
Right after LVG made the comments after the WBA game about needing more physicality in midfield and all.

5010~~~
I remember people dismissing the 'Are Herrera and Shaw van Gaal signings?' thread.
Here's potentially why it was a question worth asking.

5011~~~
I don't either. For me he doesn't have a specialist ability, goal threat, assister, ball winner, none really. Seems sloppy at times too. Hope he proves me wrong but puzzled how high the caf rates him.

5012~~~
I said it in the match thread and I will say it here:

6 Week lay off followed by 2 games in 4 days, the second game he was visibly fatigued and subbed off and you then expect Van Gaal to make it 3 games in 9 days?

Yeah, it's because he doesn't rate him despite his excellent contributions and is in no way related to trying to keep legs fresh leading into the Christmas period.

5013~~~
I don't think we need to read into this as if LVG doesn't rate Herrera.

We're playing 3-5-2 because both our full backs are injured. Fellaini has to play because of Wanyama. That means it's Mata or Herrera for one spot, and I'd certainly choose Mata for that role. The problem will be solved when Rafael and Shaw are back.

5014~~~
I'd say that van Gaal thinks Herrera doesn't fit in currently. After all for van Gaal the team is more important the individual. He probably feels we need someone physical like Fellaini in the centre and he's not goind to drop Carrick or Blind entirely. Could all change with signing Strootman and moving to 4-3-3.

5015~~~
A lot of people were saying that too!

5016~~~
Who said he "doesn't rate him"?
Not rating him and not rating him as highly as the fans are completely different things.

I'm sure he thinks he's a very good footballer. Doesn't mean he's necessarily his cup of tea though.

5017~~~
Remind me how many games Falcao has made the bench for but not been an option to start due to his fitness levels?

5018~~~
6 week layoff. Must be hard for him. 

Remind me. How long has Carrick been out for? Or Ashley Young? And Rojo?

By the way, the length of "lay off" was mainly down to Van Gaal not playing him when he could. Compare and contrast with the others named above. Got fit. Got picked. Stayed in the team.

5019~~~
He's woefully out of shape. Different discussion though. Really hope Herrera is nowhere near as lacking in fitness as Falcao. Seriously doubt it.

5020~~~
Not saying he's shit, by the way. Also don't think Van Gaal thinks he's shit. Just that he's obviously not in the "Hererra must start" camp.

5021~~~
Yeah hes on now, better late than never

5022~~~
I'd say bringing him on after 40 minutes played is a fairly good indication of Van Gaal wanting him on the pitch.

5023~~~
And an excellent indication that your theory about him somehow not being fit enough to start this soon after the last game was a crock of shite.

5024~~~
Eh? There's a massive difference between playing half a game and playing a full game.

5025~~~
He already seems to have injected more urgency into our attacking.

5026~~~
Did more in 6 minutes than Mata, Rooney and Fellaini combined in 45.

5027~~~
Sad thing is, this is a fact. Mata shouldnt get in the team for a long time, as he doesnt offer half as much offensively as Herrera does.

5028~~~
In general play I certainly agree. However Mata has found the net plenty so he still has some value. But he's so much slower to pass the ball around and less active than Ander

5029~~~
Please please start him every fecking game!

5030~~~
The key link between defense, midfield and attack. Thank feck he is back.

5031~~~
Yeah, and tbf that's also important as Mata brings us goals.

5032~~~
Needs to start the next match Definately.

5033~~~
Been kind of crap tonight tbh.

One of many, obviously.

5034~~~
Reading posts like this makes me think I watched a different game. And not for the first time.

5035~~~
Herrera was one of the few players tonight willing to take the ball under pressure, turn look up and do something, anything! The quality of our football improved immensely after his introduction. Can't see why he doesn't start more. Loved the way he bought us time with a bit of gamesmanship and rolling around at the end. P'd Southampton off something fierce, which I'm glad about after all their dirty tackles.

5036~~~
Look at the time I posted it, wasn't based on today game clearly

5037~~~
Oops. Apologies.

5038~~~
Was a bit shite tonight I thought, got about well enough but was pretty poor with the ball.

5039~~~
He should be in every starting lineup. 

A midfielder who doesn't panic under pressure. I'd forgotten they existed till this kid came along.

5040~~~
Let's not polish a turd. He was crap tonight. If we're gonna start praising our players for faking injury we're <i>really</i> scraping the barrel.

5041~~~
Another one. 

Weird.

5042~~~
I wasnt that impressed but at least he created something on the night. The same can only really be said of Young and Van Persie

5043~~~
Forget the goals, that was his best performance since Fergie left I'd say.

Excellent.

Good touch, hold up play, worked hard, fed on scraps from a non existent midfield.

Much improved.

5044~~~
We're a much much better team with him playing.

Its funny how Fellaini just had the worst game of his season, and yet you're in the Herrera thread criticising. No agenda at all. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

5045~~~
Cant be in the Nani thread blaming him, he's injured and in another country

5046~~~
I disagree with you. I don't think he was crap by any stretch of the imagination. He received the ball decently under pressure, played positively, drove forward with the ball at his feet a few times, played some good touch stuff (including in the build up to the free kick that led to our winner). If that's crap what about the rest of the side who seemed to struggle to control and pass besides RVP?

5047~~~
wrong thread?

5048~~~
Personally i dont think he suits this advance position at the tip of the diamond but i guess LvG prefers to have a left footed player play on the left of the midfield

5049~~~
Fair enough he's composed and skillful with the ball generally and should be a starter when fit but his performance in isolation tonight was no better than anyone else. Fellaini was rubbish, as was Mata and Rooney who struggled when pressed. Ander struggled too but he didn't make as many loose passes as the others. Although that contradicts the the part where people saying he'd offer a short pass for the defence.

5050~~~
We looked better when he came on, wasn't his best game but you can see what he brings for us.

5051~~~
Try reading the Fellaini thread <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

The main difference is there's less comments in that thread from fanbois who have no idea what just happened on the pitch. Fellaini was shit and is being called out as such. Only in this thread are we getting stupid posts like the one of yours I quoted.

5052~~~
Has to start against Liverpool

5053~~~
He was better than Fellaini at least, and did very well when we desperately needed someone to press the ball and try to keep possession.

Granted, it wasn't his best performance, but he was our better performers. He helped stem the Southampton tide once McNair came off.

5054~~~
I agree, never liked this clamour for him to head the diamond. Like Di Maria, we need him in the deeper CM roles in the diamond having space to run into while having the freedom to press and harry all over the pitch with his excellent work rate.

5055~~~
Wasn't great, but it was nice to see the occasional surge forward from..someone!

5056~~~
I would sooner we move Fellaini up behind the 2 strikers than Herrera

5057~~~
By saying we're a better team with him on the pitch? As we have been everytime he's played (bar one 45 minutes injured away to West Brom)

Yeah, totally stupid.

5058~~~
And yet again, not his best game, but he changed our game completely. Though it's his second poor/average game in a row, he needs to improve.

Love his attitude and style.

5059~~~
Yes, Fellaini could hold up the play and allow Di Maria and Ander to advance while Rooney/Rvp/Falcao stretch the defence with runs in behind. All a bit idealistic but Fellaini could perform an excellent withdrawn target man role for us.

5060~~~
Agree. It seemed easier to move the ball forward when Herrera received it in deeper positions, had more calm and range than Fellaini. Fellaini is at his best when he can menace defenders and make a nuisance of himself further forward. Herrera has played #6 in the past and has enough strings to his bow, and intelligence, to carry out Van Gaal's instructions there. Plus he still likes a tackle. I'd have definitely given Fellaini the freedom of the forward role, especially as our build up wasn't great tonight, and let Herrera hold.

5061~~~
Correct!

I give up tonight!

Sorry!

5062~~~
One of his worst games in a united shirt but still our best midfielder tonight.

5063~~~
Have to agree with this. The system didn't do any of our players any favours on an individual level, Ander included. Everyone struggled in the 3-5-2 bar Young and RVP. I wouldn't hold it against him but he certainly wasn't great tonight.

5064~~~
Thought when he came on that he'd change the game for us after but apart from a couple of bright moments he did nothing of note.

5065~~~
Weird thing was he probably was the main reason for us looking a lot better after he came on, yet he didn't have a very good game. Still love his style.

5066~~~
I thought Young was crap too!

Goddam formation had 9 out of 10 outfield players stinking the joint out. Only the two blokes at each end of the pitch - RvP and DDG - looked in any way decent.

5067~~~
I didn't expect him to contribute much since he came on.So,I am not surprised at him having an average game.He is the kind of player who is at his best when we are attacking or trying to create chances.In a game when we hardly created 3-4 opportunities its ridiculous to say "worst game of the season" etc etc

5068~~~
Not his best game, but did enough to get a start. We don't know what the instructions from the manager were. None of us seem to be happy with the system, not sure the players like it either, but if we can get the results until we get out fullback returned, then needs must. By the way who the hell voted for Fellaini in the MOM poll?

5069~~~
Fair assessment. Hence he should always play.

His movement and style alone make us a better team, even when he's not having his best game.

5070~~~
Personally I thought he was anonymous tonight along with Mata. I dont recall any meaningful contribution except wasting a bit of time at the end of the game by feigning an injury.

That said I think the blame tonight goes squarely on LVG - the team looked disjointed, clueless and really, really poor under pressure... it was like watching a game from last season.

5071~~~
I'm obviously in the minority but I thought he did well while adding more energy to the midfield.

5072~~~
I thought he was poor tonight, along side many others. I'd like to see him start against Liverpool though.

5073~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5074~~~
Considering he had no midfield around him (Carrick at back, Fellaini and Mata shit), he was ok. Hope he starts now

5075~~~
80% pass completion is woeful for a CM. Even our strikers passed the ball better than that. Both of them.

5076~~~
was shite today. not Fellaini shite but shite nonetheless.

5077~~~
I blame the tactics more than I blame him. We didn't try to control the midfield against Wanyama and Davis for some reason and nearly paid the price.

5078~~~
Dont know where you took this stat from but it look worse during the game.

5079~~~
I agree with you.

5080~~~
Decent performance and he was the best out of the bad bunch in midfield. Still managed to influence things a bit despite not having a great game. He doesn't dissapear like Mata or stink up the place like Fellaini on his off day. Silver lining and all...

5081~~~
That's because a few of the misplaced passes were under no pressure whatsoever, so they stuck in the memory.

5082~~~
You're not even trying to hide your agenda anymore <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5083~~~
Stats and miniskirts again. 

Two of his "passes" were clearances late in the game. Discount them and its 86%

5084~~~
How about Fellaini's misplaced pass that lead straight to a goal? Going post about that?

No? Thought not. Lets just bash Herrera instead, despite him playing about 100x better then the big useless Belgium.

5085~~~
Erm... That was a statistic. HTH.

5086~~~
It's like a vicarious defence mechanism for his main man. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

5087~~~
Done nothing today really. Pretty much the same performance as everybody's else bar for RVP.

I feel for everybody.

5088~~~
It's difficult to shine in a midfield when the rest of it is awful as well. You all have to be on the same wavelength and he quite often links up with Rooney and he was awful as well. As long as we beat Liverpool as well I don't care.

5089~~~
Might blow your tiny mind but it is possible I thought they were both terrible?

If you want to share your piercing insights on Fellaini you're in the wrong thread btw.

5090~~~
It was you who voted for Fellaini in the MOM poll. Come on own up.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5091~~~
Funny how you're in here posting Herrera's statistics, and not in the Fellaini thread posting his. Or talking about his misplaced pass that lead straight to a goal.

Well I say funny. What I mean is utterly predictable.

5092~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5093~~~
Are we arguing over who was shitter? They were both shit

5094~~~
How on earth was Herrera terrible? Was one of our better players (small praise obviously) and generally did a lot more to help us get the ball forward.

5095~~~
What's the betting Pogue has an 80's perm?

5096~~~
Fellaini was definitely shitter.

5097~~~
A mind-blowing concept to dumb and dumber who keep quoting my posts.

5098~~~
He is getting stick for his performance? He is a player who plays quick passes and moves. People have to give him options for him to be able to make passes. Most people turned their backs to him today.

5099~~~
We were all over the place again (like Arsenal) so they all struggled. Can't really be bothered to be negative though as we won again. Been a great weekend for us bar the Smalling injury.

5100~~~
It's impossible for Herrera to be shit. He's the world's greatest midfielder. Even when he feigns injury he feigns it better than anyone!

One can only wonder why Van Gaal does not see this...

5101~~~
Pogue and Fellaini share a selfie


<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/><img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

5102~~~
I like Herrera a lot but I'm not really sure what positives people saw in that performance. For my money he looked lightweight and, perhaps more worryingly - and based only on tonight -  not especially suited towards tough away games where you have to do different things than at OT.

5103~~~
I don't understand some of these twisted arguments to be fair. By no means did Ander excel today, I like him a lot but even I'm not deluded enough to state that but -

1a) If Herrera has a relatively decent or weak game in an overall poor performance by the team he's called out for it by some and slammed regardless without any excuses being made for his person in terms of acclimatizing to an new league, lack of support from the other players, injury etc etc.

1b) If Fellaini has a relatively decent or weak game in an overall poor performance by the team, a lot of times (NOTE : not always incase someone jumps up in defense) he's cleared of blame which is then equitably distributed among 10 others (or everyone's favorite go-to excuse Moyes for last season's atrocious displays) by the very people who're criticizing Herrera.

Seems like a deliberate self-serving shifting of goalposts to validate one's opinions. Oh well, guess there no way around it.

5104~~~
He's always been sloppy on the ball. That's why I thought he was much better for Athletic Club as a number 10, less risk of him losing it in a dangerous area.

5105~~~
Think it's more that he generally raises the performance of the whole team even if he's not at his best. Not sure about your last point, if anything he's one of the few who I think should be in the team in big games because of his pressing and work rate. Wasn't at his best today on the ball no doubt about that, but was still better then pretty much any other attacking player bar Van Persie and the thing I like more with him over Mata, if one would have to miss out in big games, it would be his pressing and defensive work.

5106~~~
He's learning the ropes, to be fair. If it wasn't for so many gimps desperately talking up mediocre performances I'd spend more time defending him. This is the kind of game that would always be tricky for a debutant from La Liga. Kicked around by physical opponents, aided by a lenient ref. Hopefully he learns from it.

5107~~~
Having to move Carrick back and Blind not being theren as DM doesn't help. Someone in the Post match thread brought up.

5108~~~
Struggled at times today I thought, worked hard but wasn't his day.

Always hard coming on in the 1st half though.

5109~~~
What? Fellaini defended like a beast the last 15 minutes and helped us over the line.  I like Herrrera but he was poor today and I think he needs this season to settle.

I am still hopeful for him - I love the way he plays.

5110~~~
I'm not sure he was ever going to do well coming on with the absurd tactics we were playing.

The whole 'not suited to a tough away fixture' could possibly be true if we were a team who you would expect to set up like this often. You'd hope we'd be able to dominate possession even away from home against the majority of teams in the premier league and not play 5 at the back and on the counter.

5111~~~
It could be next season until he is at his best. Players from La Liga do take at least one season to settle. Even David Silva needed that and no I am not comparing them. This is a very frantic, physical league. It is a shock to some players system, some don't settle. Watching Ander's attitude and his personality, I think he will be fine. He isn't a world beater, but you need his type of hard worker in your side.

5112~~~
Carrick was imo by far the best midfielder today.

5113~~~
I really like this lad, very rarely gives the ball away. He needs to start every game for us.

5114~~~
Eh? He's careless with the ball, gives it away a lot.

5115~~~
Played as a defender. Was class as always though, we missed him so much when he was out injured. Still such a key player to us after all these years of people underrating him or writing him off.

5116~~~
Sorry but that is just not true.

5117~~~
Ah ok, well even as a defender he was the best midfielder on the pitch. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

5118~~~
I like him, particularly his energy, and I wish he'd get more pitch time, but today's performance will hopefully remind people that he's not the sole solution to all our problems. He can misplace passes and lose possession sometimes just like everyone else.

5119~~~
He's very erratic on the ball. But he's forward thinking which I like and once he's settled and understands his role in the team he'll be quality. Tonight he was no better than anyone else in possession. He was pretty rubbish. But he's one of those players who I don't think suit being an impact from the bench because he takes 10-15 minutes to ease into the game.

5120~~~
was a bit shite today, will end up again on the bench the next game. His 2nd worst performance for us.

5121~~~
Maybe. But it's not like everyone else was great either.

5122~~~
I'm a big fan, but he was shit in the last 2 games.

5123~~~
true. But van Gaal seems to be pretty harsh on him. One average game and he finds himself on the bench. We have more options in his postitons too.

5124~~~
I thought he was better than Mata and Fellaini but that's not saying much, disappointing from him tonight.

5125~~~
Herrera was fine tonight.  He wasn't great, but the team clearly was able to retain possession more effectively as soon as he came in to the game even if we didn't create much with the ball in that time.

5126~~~
No - only Fellaini does these things did you not get the memo?

5127~~~
A bit harsh. He had an ok-ish performance and didn't do anything particularly bad like Fellaini. 
I like his attitude, always work his arse off.  It could've been worse if someone else had played in his position.

5128~~~
When he was moved to CB he was MOTM, at CB.

5129~~~
I thought he wasn't that bad. Not brilliant or even good by any means but it wasn't a shocking performance. When the while XI barely functions as a team I can make it a forgettable performance from him.

5130~~~
Herrera seems to be judged more harshly by LvG than, say, Fellaini.

Fellaini was absolutely abject yesterday - if LvG is to apply his much-vaunted philosophy at the weekend, he should drop the Bogbrush.

5131~~~
I can see why Herrera isn't an automatic starter.

I just hope other posters don't overreact the next time he is on the bench.

5132~~~
And Fellaini is?

5133~~~
Fellaini is supposedly in there for his physicality, but got bullied by Wanyama and was getting beaten in the air, supposedly another strength of his. Ander dares to give the ball away and he is rubbish. Fellaini last night was the cause of us conceding one. LvG has to get that defence sorted or we will be seeing more of this type of football. It is no good if Blind/Carrick are forever being drafted into the backline. The midfield needs them.

5134~~~
I don't understand why LVG keeps playing him as an AM, Mata most of the time was almost playing as a CM alongside Fellani yesterday while Herrera was in the AM role. If we had played Herrera in the middle, i felt he would have been more involved in the play, even against Hull and Stoke i felt he was being played in an AM role, when we signed him i was delighted by the fact that we have signed a CM, he has all the attributes to play that position, and he has played for Bilbao in that CM role, yesterday we were crying for someone who can collect the ball from the CB's and play forward, Fellani was awful yesterday in that aspect and we just couldn't keep the ball.

5135~~~
He was poor but the whole team was sh!te apart for RVP, Young and De Gea.

5136~~~
To be fair Fellaini had been one of our best players for the past month. Herrera has been up and down.

5137~~~
That's what disappointed me most yesterday about Fellaini (well, next to his piss poor passing). Herrera was ok and did better than any of our other midfielders

5138~~~
He was shit last night I thought, though in fairness the whole team was really. Reading through bits of this thread is odd though, it's similar to the Kagawa one I find. One of them players who's stock has risen by not playing, probably due to the rest of squad being pretty poor mainly.

5139~~~
yeah, it's very similar to the Kagawa situation. Becomes world class when he does not play. When he does play, a poor performance by him is put down to the the rest of the team not playing well, or an injury he had months ago. And much distress and confusion is expressed when the manager chooses not to pick this world class player.

Hopefully Herrera will ultimately prove to be a much better player for United than Kagawa though. He's still early in his time in England, and I think he more about him than Kagawa.

5140~~~
We were terrible before Herrera came on, so the problems were there already. He did help improve things, but I think last night was more down to that damn formation and yet another injury. All these constant changes. We were playing reasonably well in the 4 previous games, so why change it. I think LvG tries to prove he is some tactical genius sometimes when it isn't necessary.

5141~~~
We were just as bad against Arsenal. And I don't think we were great against Palace or Stoke.

5142~~~
Score was misleading against Palace, we could have won that game 2-0 or 3-0 which would have made it look more convincing but still the performance was good. Against Stoke we went missing for about 2 minutes of the game at the end of each half, other than that we were comfortable.

5143~~~
We weren't great against Palace and Stoke, but TBH they are extremely well organised and tough to beat. Stoke have won 1-0 at the Etihad, beat Arsenal 3-2 (should've been 4-0 up before Arsenal got two goals back), only marginally lost at Anfield and just about lost to us. They are hugely improved this season IMO, not an easy three points. Besides that we made enough chances to put 4 or 5 past them, just one of those days where we couldn't put the ball into the net.

Crystal Palace on the other hand are quite similar, beating Liverpool 3-1, only lost 1-2 against Chelsea and held us until the 75th minute mark to a nil nil draw. Again we played OK, but I really think it's getting harder beating those so-called small teams these days. There is so much money involved in British football now that even teams like Stoke, Hull, Palace can stockpile decent to good players.

Furthermore, we're building from ground zero and it takes time. Our players are still getting their confidence back from last season's disaster. 3-5-2 needs to stop though, we keep shooting ourselves in the foot by using it.

5144~~~
Exactly, we have some of the pieces needed but not all. People are saying about players going, but we need more players not getting rid of some and then replacing them and the extra ones. Unfortunately having to reduce the squad size due to lack of games might not have helped, but tbh the players who have gone out on loan are not in the defence where we have been found short. I can see him having to get defenders in January. Don't think he has a choice.

5145~~~
Good post. 

Our result against West Ham is looking better and better with each passing week too. 

Agree about 3-5-2 too. We're making tough fixtures even tougher.

I am really not sure why you think I hate Herrera, but if you care to actually read my posts in this thread you will likely see that that is not the case at all.

5148~~~
I don't think you hate Herrera, I am just teasing you, don't worry mate. But you are big fan of Fellaini, that's for sure.

5149~~~
Once Herrera came on, we got more control of the game and matched Southampton towards the end of the first half. Without him, we were always hoofing the ball forward and relying on Rojo or Smalling/Evans to play our players into the game. Carrick was easily closed down, and Fellaini was frequently going long, looking for a long ball, whilst Mata would drop deep at times but play too safely with the ball. When Herrera came on, he joined up the defence and attack and made us more assured in possession against Southampton.

In the second half, Herrera was very important in us keeping control of the match. He was getting Mata into the game, and Fellaini always had an option when playing the deeper role. I was disappointed that we didn't do more with this possession, control, and fluidity that Herrera provided us. Once we scored the second goal, we became very negative in our approach, preferring to play the ball back at every opportunity then hoof it away, which made everyone including Herrera ineffective.

Every time I see Herrera on the pitch, we become much better on the attack and gain much more control of the game. We also start creating gaps in the middle, and attacking players like Mata and Rooney get more involved in the game.

5150~~~
He only made 19 passes with an accuracy of 75%. Impressive he could do all that while hardly getting involved at all.

5151~~~
If he was a bit more polished he'd make a great 'number 10'. He has the eye for the pass, the ability to link up, but his technique can be sloppy and he sometimes shows a lack of urgency.

He's been good so far. Nothing more or less. I think people see the positive impact that they want to see a lot of the time. He tends to have a few nice moments each game, but I don't think he's been as great as other people seem to think.

It's possible that van Gaal isn't as keen on him as many people on here. And no, that doesn't mean van Gaal hates him, doesn't rate him at all, or wont ever play him.

5152~~~
Agreed. I like him because of his style of play and creativity but his passing can be atrocious at times recently. Not sure if it's related to his injury? Is he fully fit yet? Saw him holding his chest at the end of the Stoke (I think, might have been arsenal actually) game.

5153~~~
His involvement was only possible during the period before we scored the 2nd goal, as I mentioned. Otherwise, we were very negative and static in our game. As I also said in my last post, once we scored the second goal, the team decided to not keep possession to see the game off and, instead, drop deep and clear the ball away at almost every opportunity. It was only during the brief period after he came on and during the second half before van Persie scored that we were in control of the match, with Herrera being very involved in our build up.

The one thing that was clear from this match is that, whilst Herrera may make us better, he's not someone who will singlehandedly make us better. The same goes for everyone else in the team. Everyone has to perform well if the team is to perform well.

5154~~~
Na, from what I saw of him before, while obviously he's capable of great passes and dribbling (he showed that against us at Old Trafford obviously) his technique can seem a bit rushed and scrappy at times. A bit like Aaron Ramsey's.

It's just how he is really. I don't think it's got much to do with any injuries.

5155~~~
I'd agree. He was the same at Athletic Club so the injury isn't an excuse. I think he needs to learn that sometimes it's better to play...slower. He seems to want to play at 100mph every game, probably a result of playing for Athletic for so long.

5156~~~
Yeah, definitely.

I think it's too late for that to be taken out of his game. But if somehow it <i>was</i>, I think he'd make a great number 10 option. His vision and intelligence is still so typically Spanish. I don't think his ability to see a pass is far (if at all) off Thiago's, but their composure, technique and execution is quite far apart.

I haven't watched much of Athletic Club for a good while now, but they seemed to have a few players like that. Definitely Muniain has that same untidiness too.

5157~~~
Oh God. Herrera is becoming the new Kagawa. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy, and think he's a good player, but he did not play well the other night.

5158~~~
Of course. He was rarely involved and almost invisible. I'm not talking about him playing well or poorly. All I'm saying is that he brought us more control into our game, allowing Mata to get into his game whilst also playing Rooney and Mata through into dangerous areas. By his standards, I wouldn't say he was that good. He was average, a 6/10. He was rarely involved on the ball due to seemingly playing a higher role (#10 by the looks of it) with Mata dropping deeper more frequently. To be honest, I'd wish it was the other way as Herrera is less of a #10 than Mata is and more of a #8 than Mata is.

Herrera took several good positions on the pitch, but we played so slowly and safely against Southampton that he was never getting involved. I think <a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> and <a class="username" data-user="85690, @Bob Loblaw" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85690/">@Bob Loblaw</a> both mentioned it well when they said that Herrera seems rushed in his game. Of course, this style of play is very fun to watch, but in a match like against Southampton, when the whole team was playing slowly and safely, he would have been more involved if he played more safely and slowly. However, I doubt him playing like everyone else was would have led us to our second goal. He was good at attracting Wanyama and giving Mata the space to become more influential, whilst when Mata attracted Wanyama, Herrera would drop deep and either carry the ball forward, causing havoc, or play the ball to Mata/Rooney in dangerous spaces. If he were to play more safely and slowly, we might have struggled to build up our attacks during our good period.

5159~~~
i am pretty sure van Gaal went to every player and shook their hands, i dont know what you want to express with the picture. As soon as Strootman arrives, his place will be the bench for most of the time. Just isnt good enough as an 8 or 10 or to be more exact, not what van Gaal wants.

5160~~~
Not yet. We'd need a Mad Winger equivalent to obsess over him, and know his exact average short passes per minute ratio or something insane like that. But I think it's more that people just have a lot of hope for him, and he has impressive technical ability.

5161~~~
Way too early to call. And didn't van Gaal green-light the purchase? I like him, I think he'll improve quickly given a run of games, and he did set the tone for expectations in pre-season when he bossed his first game IIRC. Were we to acquire Strootman we'd finally have actual quality competition for places in midfield (and a midfielder enforcer). Top quality center back has got to be a priority though.

5162~~~
Im becoming a bit of a fanboy tbh (hes quite likable to be fair).
I just think when he plays we look more fluid and have better movement in general.
Even when hes not having a particularly good game (like monday) i think his presence leads to better play from us.
I cant remember us playing really well in a game that didn't involve him (though the draw against chelsea was impressive in a sense I suppose).

I think our midfield is just badly balanced basically. Its hard to get 3 midfielders in that'll cover everything you want / need.
Di Maria being our only source of pace and being far better in midfield than elsewhere along with rooney having been better playing in midfield exacerbates the problem too.
Fellaini being our only real physical presence makes him pretty necessary and then you need a dm on top of that so its kind of impossible to fit all of them in.

5163~~~
Damn. I like him and would like him to do well here but being Ander's Mad Winger would take serious amount of work and dedication.

5164~~~
herrera's attributes:

as a spanish he is a natural good passer;
he possesses good fundamental ball sense; 
he is tall, which should allow him to cover up big area in midfield with relative ease;

his weaknesses:

his balance is not ideal, this is especially obvious when he makes twist;
he is relatively physically weak, he might want to gain some more weight to play in the premier league;
and the last is,  his attitude and mind towards a game

from numerous interviews herrera has stressed on how much he wants to play in the no 10 role.  however, despite he is a good passer but he still don't have the precision to make acute and agile passes in a small area within extreme fast speed.  this is a very critical quality that a prolific no 10 needs to possess.  in addition of his body balance is in question, i doubt he can excel in a no 10 role for us.  he might be able to play there for a mid table club, but for a elite club whose always wants to build up an invincible squad, i'm afraid herrera will not be an ideal candidate.

in pre-season herrera was quite settled in a pure midfield role.  but after the season kicked, he tried quite hard to prove himself is a no 10.  we observed he had moved himself too up front and had exposed our midfield for opponents to counter.  so, right now how he thinks he would be a player for united is quite essential in his play and his future here.

herrera has his quality.  but i don't think he will become a pillar like keano.  the best i can rate him is to put him into the same class as flecther, carrick alike.  if he settles with a pure midfielder role, i see him as a quality addition to our squad.  otherwise, he might let himself even to be a liability.  nani is a good example how a quality player depletes.

he has just joined us for less than half a year.  as lvg once said, there was competition inside our dressing room to build up a new hierarchy.  i won't blame him for his ambition.  but the earlier he can realize where his future lies, the better for him to settle in united.

i won't be too pessimistic about his future.

5165~~~
We play the possession game so much better when Herrera plays in a deeper role. He's a natural at the pass and move game, perfect combination with either Carrick/Blind. 

Like its been pointed out already in the thread, he loves to push forward a lot and seems like he fancies himself as a #10 but I think he's so much beter carrying the ball out of defense and offering a quick short passing option..

5166~~~
I think he's done fine up until now and will get better as the season progresses.

He's technically very good and does lift the tempo of our play but sometimes his over eagerness does result in giving the ball away alittle too much. But I don't believe that's gonna be a problem once he fully settles into his new surroundings and adapts to LVG's philosophy.

5167~~~
Do you think you're up to the job?

5168~~~
Doesn't start again. No Di Maria or Herrera and our midfield looks bang average.

5169~~~
Agreed. We're playing Mata at RCM ffs. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5170~~~
i really dont like Fellaini starting ahead of him. Granted against physical sides i can make a argument for it but against Liverpool i would have preferred Herreras ability on the ball. It seems LvG prefers to have left sided players play in the central left position which means either Mata/Di Maria and on the right position its Fellaini/Fletcher/Herrera.

And it seems LvG prefers Fellaini having opted to use Herrera at the tip of the diamond. Oh why cant we have Herrera and Mata swap roles!

5171~~~
He should be starting every game. Disappointing.

5172~~~
I love the lads to bits already, gutted he doesnt start again. His tenacity and willingness to chase everything would have been a great help vs Gerrard.

5173~~~
I would drop one of Mata or Fellaini for him. Mata in CM really makes no sense.

5174~~~
What does he have to do to start ahead of Mata? More creative, works harder and increases the tempo of our play. Very disappointed.

5175~~~
More likely Rooney at LCM I think. LVG will want to bully them in the middle with Carrick, Fellaini and Rooney controlling it and Mata in a free role behing the strikers.

5176~~~
Very disappointed he isn't starting today - we need someone in midfield with legs and energy against Coutinho and Lallana and I think without Herrera we're gonna get over-run in midfield.

5177~~~
Might be another philosophy hard-on. Mata and Wilson are the only left footers. Our LCB and LB are both right footed. RvP too.

5178~~~
I would have rather had him instead of Mata in midfield.

5179~~~
He should be dropped more often. Gets better and better each time. If Van Gaal makes him sit out the next few games we'll have the best CM in the league on our books.

5180~~~
Likewise with Fellaini after every 6/10 he plays, eh?

5181~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Stirring. 

...It's true though.

5182~~~
What use would it be if we dont play him anyways?

5183~~~
Nobody here says he has been perfect, but to drop him for Fellaini and Mata who have been terrible most of their games? It's just stupid.

5184~~~
I wonder what LvG thinks of him.

5185~~~
He's probably been faulted for our bad end of games performances pre Leicester.

5186~~~
Fellaini hasn't been terrible in most games though.

5187~~~
By his usual standards.

5188~~~
You really do hate him, don't you?

5189~~~
By any standards, to say he was is clearly wrong.

5190~~~
He's actually the only impact player we have in midfield.

Liverpool are going to have some very tired legs in there around the hour mark. Herrera's energy could be a fantastic addition around then.

EDIT - In fact I actually think this will be his role. On for Mata around then and he will be a breath of fresh air and everyone will ask why he didn't start, oblivious to the benefit of his perfectly timed fresh legs.

5191~~~
We finally get a centre midfielder that can play a bit and we're still playing Rooney and Mata in there with Fellaini.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Why do you hate him?

5192~~~
He's been much better than his usual standards.

5193~~~
Possibly, but midfield is the hardest place to be an impact sub. If Fellaini's shit then we might have lost the midfield battle by then and there's not always much a sub can do to change that. Look at the Southampton game; we <i>slightly</i> improved when he came on, but it was too late to resurrect an actual good team performance.

This is my only real gripe with this lineup. Fellaini was utterly shite against Southampton, and with no big strikers to defend against from set-pieces, I'm not sure that he offers enough to be in there ahead of Herrera.

5194~~~
Not really, his usual standards were always good for Everton too. Last season was the exception, not the norm.

5195~~~
On the basis of the Southampton game Fellaini offers more accurate passing.

/devilsadvocate

5196~~~
I still can't get my head round what it is he does worse than the rest of our midfield. Sloppy passes and mis-controls. Really? Fellaini and even Rooney aren't exactly blameless there.

What he does better than the rest of our midfield is keep the ball moving and make himself available. I'm not sure what the philosophy is if Herrera doesn't suit it. Hopefully it's just a form or fitness issue and not something more profound.

5197~~~
His best season at Everton wasnt in CM. At CM, he was decent, not the player he was in his last year there.

5198~~~
Surprised that mata got the nod ahead of him in what seems to be a more natural position for Senior Ander

5199~~~
Well, it took 3 minutes for Fellaini to make this look ridiculous.

5200~~~
Feel really bad for Ander, and given his exuberant personality and profile in La Liga as a dynamic young-ish midfielder evidenced by his performances for Bilbao, I am a bit biased towards the guy. This is actually the kind of central midfielder we've been crying about for years. Always on the move and creates space for his team-mates, is a bit of a leader, plays in an adventurous up-tempo style with plenty of intricate ball rotation, isn't risk averse and hounds the ball-carrier like a terrier.

Yet he inevitably finds himself on the bench for the most crucial of matches, either due to earlier fitness concerns or us reverting to a 3-5-2. Maybe Van Gaal sees some flaws that us mere mortals can't but surely, he would offer more in terms of technical and tactical dexterity than Fellaini, who I'm definitely not a fan of and sorry, just can't cut his mustard against top opposition where his weaknesses become magnified or even Wayne who's best position is in forward areas. 

That said, if dropping him in favor of others gets us positive results (which should be of primary importance this season) I'm all for it.

5201~~~
He's been poor so far but 3 minutes is too soon to make any sort of judgement.

5202~~~
Who the feck does he have to blow to get a fecking match?!

5203~~~
It took him 3 minutes to piss the ball away deep into our own half.

5204~~~
Herrera shouid be up for the Balon D'Or. The less he plays the more his stock seems to rise on here.

5205~~~
Another victim of the 352 in my book. Mata can be invisible but he'll pop up with a goal, assist or generally speaking 90%+ passing accuracy. Fellaini is utilised as a CDM (which Herrera can't play either) and Rooney is the captain.

5206~~~
Yes but a game of football lasts 90 minutes and a lot of players are likely to have spells in which they make a few mistakes so judging after 3 minutes and saying "well that has certainly proved that blah blah blah" is a bit silly. 

Anyway this thread isn't about Fellaini, let's take it to the Fellaini thread.

5207~~~
You seem to have a problem when people recognize him as one of our better midfielders. He is better than Fellaini and I refuse to believe he would have been as bad as afroman has been today.

5208~~~
Fellaini was worse in that game. Accurate passing means feck all when it is unadventurous and back or sideways most of the time. Cleverley had good passing stats as well, does not mean he was a good CM.

At least Herrera did not give the ball away that led to the goal in that match.

5209~~~
If he didn't do it on a regular basis this would be the case, however he does.

5210~~~
You fanboys never see the faults in your idols. Every game they don't play they wouid have dominated. When they do play, and are poor, then it's always the fault of the rest of the team.
VG picks the team.  I'm so so sorry that the 'afro' offends you so.

5211~~~
i don't think there is much negative personal discontent towards herrera, more likely he is the one being sacrificed of our overall ineffective play way.  when we need to rely on fellaini to provide some physical strength there then we need to take out some one also.
it seems that rooney is dropping more deeply and taking over his role.  look like we are using rooney+fellaini to protect the back three

5212~~~
I may be a fan of Herrera, but I think it's better than the likes of you who would like to knock them down despite them playing well. All while bigging up other players who you would prefer. Well done!

5213~~~
He was great when he came on and Mata looked comfortable when he came on. Some of his ball control was sublime.

5214~~~
He makes others feel comfortable due to his control, passing and movement

5215~~~
Passing looked so much more fluid when he came on, but there were a lot of needless sloppy passes that Liverpool fortunately did nothing with. He really should be starting against Villa next week.

5216~~~
Most definitely.

5217~~~
The sort of midfield Villa might have, he could have a field day. Yes there might be some sloppy passes from him, but it's the same with the other players as well. I am not going to hang, draw and quarter the lad for that.

5218~~~
He was quite sublime.

5219~~~
Looked very good when he came on. Feck knows what he has to do to get a start.

5220~~~
Understand why he doesn't start in a 3-5-2. His instinct is to follow the ball so with Mata or even Januzaj being given a free role with two strikers we need to be more balanced defensively.

5221~~~
I am definitely thinking that LvG will only trust him when he has a solid defence to allow him to do his stuff. Until the we need to have a solid midfield. Unfortunately it doesn't make us very attractive. Hope he starts against Villa.

5222~~~
Because we scored a third shortly after. 3-0 up at old Trafford with 20 minutes to go - you're going to look comfortable regardless of Herrera coming on or not.
Wouldn't really put it down to him, to be honest.

5223~~~
Ha ha, the hypocrisy. I'm showing objectivity. Herrera hasn't been the second coming of Scholes when he's played. He's been off the pace unless the opposition has been weak or tired. That's what I've seen, and guess what, that's what VG sees. As I've said before, I hope he turns it around eventually. Unlike you, I don't really care if  Fellaini, who you hate so much plays, or Herera plays, as long as they do well and United win.

5224~~~
So he plays Wilson instead? This 2 striker thingy when we have Rooney in midfield is bs anyway. Herrera in there all day long.

5225~~~
Really? So actually me telling that a player has not played fell is hatred while you talking down Herrera is being objective? Again, as I said, well done!
Also, this thing about Herrera doing well because of opposition being tired or weak really does not make sense. He was better than Fellaini when he replaced di Maria and he certainly brought a spark to our game once he came on. Now he can only prove himself in the opportunities he is given. Fellaini was awful today, giving the ball away on numerous occasions and almost gifting a goal similar to the one he did against Southampton. But yeah, me criticizing that is biased while you mouthing Herrera off makes perfect sense.

5226~~~
He was poor vs West Brom while still recovering from a broken rib.

Other than that though I think he's done very well basically any time he's been in the side. He makes the players around him tick by making himself available for the pass all the time.

5227~~~
hehe I hear ya <a class="username" data-user="20558, @charleysurf" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20558/">@charleysurf</a> I swear some fans love individual players more than the actual team!

Herrera is a decent young midfielder but the hysteria in the match day threads when he doesn't start is comical

5228~~~
Pfft, VG agrees with me anyway and I'll go with his judgement more than yours! He can see Herrera can only come on when the oppo is tired at the moment. But hopefully he will be better able to cope eventually. He has it in him. Unlike you I want to think the best of all our players. 

As I say, I don't care who plays as long as United win. But if Fellaini keeps on starting, then the increase in blind hate and confusion in fanboys like you will be rather amusing to me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5229~~~
He's able to take the ball under pressure, turn and make a forward pass. He should be starting every game for me.

5230~~~
VG also thinks playing 3-5-2 is excellent. I assume you agree with that as well. And since you seem to be a Fellaini lover (fanboi), I will let you be with your Herrera hatred.

5231~~~
Cracking player and should be starting, particularly while Di Maria is out, as he offers more energy and creativity from midfield than our remaining options.

5232~~~
Some of these player threads are hilarious. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5233~~~
Did well when he came on and added more than Wilson in the advanced role close to RvP. He's gonna have to ride out the formation fubar and injury situation before he's a regular though.

5234~~~
I'd still have him ahead of Mata. He's much more dynamic IMO.

5235~~~
The after-effects of Kagawa?

Surely you can genuinely see a case for why people question why he hasn't started more games?

5236~~~
Van Gaal says we've only had two dominant performances this season, vs QPR and Hull.

Herrera was absolutely outstanding in both and a key part of the performances.

5237~~~
I support VG, but more importantly  I'm not so full of hate for any of our players that I desperately want to write them off. I really want them all to prove useful for us eventually ( although Anderson is really pushing it).
But you run along and fill your lungs with bile.

5238~~~
I'll have him ahead of Mata, but my God, just pass it forward! We had a counter attack, Falcao and Young had made good runs, all he needed to do was pick out one of them with a pass, but he just decided to turn back and he was fouled, he's been doing this so much of late and I hate it. He's not playing as well as he can, everyone has to be patient, he went through this same process at Bilbao last season.

5239~~~
It's the same drop RVP and play Falcao argument, new toys etc. The manager obviously knows what he's doing. Herrera is a fantastic player, but let's not go bnow, he didn't do much when he came on today [understandably] but I've seen people calling his performance today "fantastic" and stuff like that, steady on lads!

5240~~~
Please stop calling him VG.

5241~~~
They play better when they're both together. They bring the best out of each other, very obviously at that. I'd start them both and utilise that connection if it was up to me.

5242~~~
Such a classy operator.

Anyone have a gif of the ball that he plucked out of the air in the Liverpool box? Great bit of skill, that.

There should be a rule that whenever Mata is on the pitch, Herrera has to be there too.

5243~~~
He needs more playing time, and not just cameos here and there.

But I can see why playing Fellaini ahead of Herrera makes sense too. "Physicality"

5244~~~
Oh right, you slagging off Herrera was like honey drips. Grow up.

No one wants any of our players to fail. I praised Fellaini for his string of good performances and was thinking he had turned a corner. But just because I say he has been poor these last two games does not mean I hate him or have written him off.
Also, supporting does not mean blindly agreeing with everything that is said or done. I support LvG as much as the next fan but I feel that his use of 3-5-2 has hindered how we play and that has resulted in our poor performances of late (despite the run of wins). But I think you will somehow construe this as hatred for the man from my end.

5245~~~
Mata always performs better when Herrera is on this season. They are on the same wave length with regards to the passing (same when Di Maria is with them)

I actually want to see Herrera start against Villa and give Fellaini a break. Not drop him completely but just rest him in that match (use as a sub if needed).

5246~~~
Should be a definite starter for me, as a rule we look much better when he's on the pitch. He's always on the move, always an option, our build up play is much better with him on the pitch.

5247~~~
No he didn't. He just turned the other way to make the pass when starfish fouled him. At least watch it properly before commenting.

5248~~~
He should start for us IMO. Him and Mata have very good understanding of each other. Just feck this 5-3-2, play Carrick as defensive midfielder and then play Herrera in midfield. I really hope that we go back to diamond with Carrick, Herrera, Di Maria and Mata in our midfield. That midfield can control the gamea against any (English) team.

5249~~~
Don't be touchy, he turned the other way or back, fact is he turned away and that chance was gone, he could have just played it forward, he's been doing that lately in other games too. If you want to translate that as me not liking Herrera then that's your cup of tea.

5250~~~
Did I say you did not like Herrera? Why are you getting all defensive. You commented on a piece of play and I just pointed it out that you were wrong. Go and see it again. He turned around, and not back as you said, to make the pass before he was fouled.

5251~~~
He brings something to the team that we lack without him. However, I wonder why he sometimes plays higher up than Mata - I personally would play him deeper and Mata further upfront

5252~~~
i guess it has something to do with him making sloppy passes at times, while Mata keeps it more simple and therefore dont loses posession.

5253~~~
He was in a good/better position to make the pass without having to turn around, that's what am saying. I've seen you picking on anyone who has a semblance of criticism against Herrera, I don't get it. He could have done better with that chance or maybe I expect too much because I've been watching him a long time and know what he's capable of.

5254~~~

5255~~~
I picked up on the nonsense you spoke about that chance. He made a decision to turn around to pass and he would have done that had it not been for the foul. Whether you take it as me trying to defend him or not is irrelevant to the point I made.

5256~~~
Think it happens too often for it to be a coincidence, but we play way better going forwards and on the ball when he's on the pitch.

5257~~~
That's the one. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Good man, cheers for that.

5258~~~
Should be starting, especially at home! He is brilliant!

5259~~~
I shamelessly stole it from the GIF thread. But yes, it was a beautiful touch <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5260~~~
Mystified as to how he's not starting for us, if Mata isn't going to play behind the front two I have Herrera in with Fellaini every time at the moment.

5261~~~
Too good and too smart and mentally flexible a footballer not to start for us when healthy. Only question is where exactly in midfield he should play, but for now, that's more of a question of the formation Van Gaal wants to play that game, the health of Di Maria and Mata's form.

5262~~~
If anything, he passes it forward too much at times. He could have passed it there, but I don't think neither of Falcao and Young made good runs in that attack(from what I can remember, but could be wrong though).

5263~~~
Gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside knowing we have player like him in our midfield, can only think his broken rib has taken a while to get over,  & LvG is just easing him back in.

Love to see Carrick, Herrera, Di Maria, Mata, Rooney, Falcao on pitch at the same time,  with a solid back four behind, stuff of dreams after last season.

5264~~~
I kind of think Blind being out is a bit issue for him getting minutes too. We all know how anal LvG is with his philosophy, and without Blind, there is no midfielder with a left foot, which probably is the reasoning as to why Mata has started ahead of him a few times. I hope we see him, Di Maria and Rafael against Villa. Him and Rafael have a great bit of interplay on that right flank too.

5265~~~
You're talking rubbish, he made a TURN when a forward pass was on. And you absolutely have no idea what he wanted to do after that turn [unless you can tell the future], so shut it right there. He made a turn and that's the point, the forward pass was on to more than one player.

5266~~~
I want him to start but please not mata-Herrera-Rooney

5267~~~
I think that's a bit of a myth. It may be true Van Gaal prefers to have at least one left footer in midfield, but I don't believe for a second he would give priority to it over performances and suitability. He's too good a manager for that. It might be the deciding factor between two balanced options but he's not going to pick a less functioning midfield because of it.

5268~~~
Please exactly that. (Well, all three on the pitch. Not sure if you're objecting to a particular formation.)

5269~~~
I mean as a central midfield 

Like today only Fellaini played instead of Herrera

5270~~~
I think if Herrera had played instead of Fellaini, Rooney would've been up front. LVG only dropped Rooney into CM to provide what Fellaini doesn't (and Herrera does).

5271~~~
So you do agree that he didn't turn "back" which was my whole point all along. Your blind dislike for the guy just showed up here. Absolutely talking nonsense to try and prove your point all because you don't like a player personally. So I will leave you now to stew in your bile.

5272~~~
From what I remember the only runner Herrera had was Falcao who went left and got tracked, Herrera looked right and there was no one there so he turned back and got fouled. My initial feeling was that Falcao's run wasn't the best.

5273~~~
I suspect when Blind makes a return, so will Hererra.

Perhaps LvG doesn't rate Hererra's defensive capabilities and doesn't like to play him without a player like Blind around.

Or I am just talking out of my arse and he's not fully fit yet.

5274~~~
I think van Gaal's reintroducing Herrera into the first team gradually, there's no need to rush him. He's still adapting to a new league, and wouldn't be used to the Christmas period. This coupled with the fact Fellaini has been very good has kept him out of the team. He's a quality player though, gem of a midfielder.

5275~~~
He's overrated horribly by a lot in this thread. That being said, I'd like to see him start a game soon. Can understand why van Gaal has been cautious playing him though.

5276~~~
People are treating him like a player who has been here for years. We have to remember he is still a new signing, in a new team, in a new country. We can't expect him to just have great games week in week out. He is doing very well and is a key member of the team.

5277~~~
Very weird negativity and criticism of him on here. It's almost as if some people have to be contrary..

Anyway, LVG moans about not keeping the ball well enough and leaves Herrera on the bench. Logic.

5278~~~
My exact thoughts. I admit I didn't see Young's run, but The Falcao pass would have resulted in a loss of possession. I felt he did the right thing there.

5279~~~
Still can't understand how Fellaini get games ahead of him.

5280~~~
We need Fellaini for his physical presence at set pieces vs Villa. Plus he gives the team some real physicality that hopefully Strootman (if we sign him) will add. Herrera although a little terrier just gets swatted aside albeit his other assets more than make up for this. Right now I'd stick with Fellaini the only changes I'd make is Rojo or Smalling for Evans and Shaw for Young who has been great since coming in. Valencia and RVP have hit form and don't deserve to be dropped. Di Maria as always should play if fit.

5281~~~
I feel his omission from starting could be due to his fitness.  In the few games he started, he tailed off after the 70 minutes mark which is why Fellaini is still starting ahead of him.

5282~~~
Which isnt the biggest problem. Fellaini, Carrick and Herrera as a midfield three and Mata in front of them (diamond if you say Carrick can drop into a back three) allows rooney even more freedom and has RVP has the focal point.

5283~~~
Based on their respective performances yesterday, that logic would be vindicated.

Fellaini had an absolute nightmare in the first half but still completed a higher % of passes over the 90 minutes than Herrera did in his cameo.

The latter only managed 75% pass completion which is just about acceptable for a really creative winger or support striker but downright poor for a CM. 84% vs 70% in the Southampton game. If Van Gaal really is linking his decision to omit Hererra with concerns about ball retention (although I've not heard him say that?) then his logic is absolutely sound.

Before the usual suspects wade in calling me a "hater" I accept that Hererra is a more creative passer so won't complete as high a % of passes. I also happen to think he has the potential to be a much better CM than Fellaini will ever be but I'm genuinely baffled at how many people can't see the flaws that I (and presumably Van Gaal?) have seen in his game this season. He's a young player, adapting to a new league so I'm sure the best is yet to come but it's <i>really </i>not hard to see why Van Gaal has reservations about starting him.

5284~~~
Herrera's defensive stats were excellent before the rib injury. Loads of tackles and interceptions being made and he seemed to relish the physical aspect of the games. With the exception of aerial prowess he seems to be better than Fellaini in every department and even in the 3-5-2 he's having a bigger impact on our play than Fellaini. By no means a Fellaini hater and i'm glad we've got him as a squad option but the boy herrera really needs to be playing more IMO.

5285~~~
He never came close to the kind of defensive stats Fellaini achieved against Liverpool. 10 out of 12 tackles, 2 interceptions and 4 blocks.

Looking at the season as a whole, Fellaini is ahead of him with all of his <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/marouane_fellaini/126/126/466/38/p|premier_league/2014/2015/ander_herrera/126/126/1538/0/p#tackles_won/tackles_lost/interceptions/blocks/aerial_duels_won_%#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">defensive stats</a>, bar interceptions where he is fractionally behind.

5286~~~
Why is it always one or the other? Why not Fellaini for the physical side and Herrera for the tenacious, creative side? Sorted.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5287~~~
He's a lovely footballer to watch, and I love the way he links up with Mata. Its going to be tough for him to nail down a regular berth, but I hope LVG can find a way to get him plenty of pitch time

5288~~~
He will get plenty of time on the pitch and next season there will be even more games. I don't see the big problem.

5289~~~
Herrera's rib break seems to have taken him off his stride a bit. He still looks nowhere near as proactive or aggressive as he did in the hour before he was subbed against West Ham. With the ball at his feet, arguably Herrera offers more than any of our other centre midfielders. However, he seems to have developed a touch of shyness. Maybe getting injured has knocked him back a bit? 

Given the state Liverpool were in when he came on I didn't think Ander did very much. I thought the effect he had on the Southampton game, where his introduction coincided with us trying to pass the ball through midfield, was a lot more noticeable. You could say Herrera isn't well served in the number 10 position and looks better filling one of the spots on the side of the diamond. However, he switched quite a bit with Mata yesterday and ended up on the left side of the diamond more than once. It was not a bad performance, he showed his eye for a through ball more than once (including a peach that cut through the middle of the Liverpool right back and right centre half to Young), it just wasn't that noteworthy.

5290~~~
You can tell he won't be one of those players to rock the boat if he doesn't start a lot of games. It looks like he absolutely loves playing for us, whenever he's given the opportunity.

I'm sure minutes and better performances will follow.

5291~~~
You're probably the definition of a contrary poster on this site, to be fair. 

If Herrera's job was to win the ball and play an easy pass, he'd post those stats too. We'll agree to disagree.

5292~~~
Yes, but lot of these tackles come after Fellaini runs totally out of position, other players have to press and then he comes from behind and takes the ball... Carrick NEVER had such numbers and was still at least 2 classes above Fellaini in that department alone. If Fellaini would have a better overall game he wouldn't even need to make all these things.

5293~~~
They might actually work well together. We have a problem of riches in midfield right now, Carrick and Blind also have a good case for playing there and then there's obviously Di Maria and Mata.

5294~~~
Do we really need Herrera to match those stats once Carrick is playing in midfield? Scholes did nothing bar foul with the odd good interception through not going through the player as intended as Keane was there to to the dirty work. IO think this physicality thing is in vogue like tika taka was 5-6 yrs back!

5295~~~
This is absolutely 100% spot on.

5296~~~

5297~~~
No it's not <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5298~~~
Pogue used to go out with Mary Mary Quite Contrary at school but she broke it off cause he was too argumentative.

5299~~~
It's amazing that we were all moaning that we had no midfielders, now we have a glut and we are still moaning. We should be thrilled. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Now all we need is defenders.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5300~~~
I think you'll actually find it was he who broke it off, statistics included.

5301~~~
We've made one of the midfielders that!

5302~~~
True, and a forward a midfielder.

5303~~~
who mentioned there being "a big problem" ??

5304~~~
Not you personally, sorry, but some seem to think LvG doesn't like him, he will be sold. That's rubbish, we might strengthen the midfield further, but we will need them all. I am more worried about all this stuff coming out of Spain then if LvG likes the lad or not. I just hope everything goes well for him and there is nothing for him to answer to.

5305~~~
TBH I'm more worried about whether or not he will be happy being a squad player (I very much doubt he will) so if he doesn't nail down a first 11 spot I would be worried as I wouldn't think he would stick around for years in that position.

5306~~~
Wonder if him not playing much has to do with this.

5307~~~
Whats it say?

5308~~~
I suppose it depends how much time you get playing. If you start a good number of games and come on in other, the playing time mounts up. He is never going to be in the Anderson situation and he will get used plenty of times. I think he loves it here. I would rather be at United and have a good chance of winning things, than play every game at a lesser club and win nothing.

5309~~~
Atleti captain Gabi & Manchester United man Ander Herrera implicated in La Liga match fixing case

5310~~~
The stats were almost identical a couple of weeks ago between them, I remember posting them, with herrera having the edge in most apart from interceptions I think, just yesterday fellaini had a great game in that regard. 
Also as for his pass completion being lower recently, you can easily put that down to him playing as the attacking midfielder in recent weeks, rather then as a proper central midfielder. When he did play as a central midfielder, his pass accuracy was like 88 or 89% I think. He's obivously a bit more loose with his passing then he likes of Carrick, but he takes a lot of risks on the ball and always tries to up the tempo and move it on quickly, which sometimes results in misplaces passes. What everyone likes about him is that he does take risks and ups the tempo, but that comes hand in hand with sometimes losing possession imo.

5311~~~
Really it's not telling us anything we didn't already know. It will now come down to what they players say in their defence. Also if all of them will now have to go to court to testify. You wonder why clubs don't just take relegation on the chin.

5312~~~
Eaxctly, it is easy to pass the ball backwards and sideways, we have been doing that for a few years and have all been moaning about it. Sometimes you have to be a bit brave.

5313~~~
I wonder against the weaker teams in the league at home whether we can play Carrick CB more often, and then have Fellaini and Herrera in the same team. 

Carrick can be the passer from defense like he does already, and that allows us to have both in midfield.

5314~~~
There you go, showing your true color. Saying a pro footballer can do well is somehow translated as hate or dislike, I don't understand people like you. He turned back, turned around or whatever, pass was on but he did not pass forward and that's the point. Rot in your stupidity.

5315~~~
Ok, now someone agrees that he actually turned back, and that idiot has somehow concluded i hate him because I said he should have passed it forward rather than turning back. I thought Falcao made a good run [might be wrong] and he should have passed, but he did turn back as you noticed. This other guy thinks I hate Herrera for stating something so obvious.

5316~~~
I think Carrick will only play in defense when we play the 3-5-2 system. LvG said he can play as a 6 or 3, the latter being a sweeper, I don't see him playing Carrick as a CB in a back 4 that we'll hopefully be reverting to once Shaw is fit.

5317~~~
I think it's clear he turned back, but you are stating it as a negative thing. In his eyes the pass to Falcao was not on, I need to see a replay to be 100% but I am quite sure he was being marked out, so the pass was most likely going to fail. Instead he turned back and wanted to see another pass instead, and concequently won a foul in a dangerous position. That isn't bad play, it's clever. 

Sure the pass may have crept through, but it's just 1 of those things.

5318~~~
I have watched the game, that is exactly what happened. He won a good free kick in a good position and we didn't take advantage. Nobody moaned when he won that free kick against QPR and Di Maria scored.

5319~~~
I really didn't state it as a negative thing, just a passage of play that frustrated me, that's all. I thought the pass was on and i was very angry [at the time] as to why he turned back. I think it's a very simple point, so, I don't understand why I'm being accused of "hating" haha. It's funny because last season in the newbies I was banging on about this player before we signed him.

5320~~~
It's not moaning, saying your player could have done better in certain situations isn't moaning, it's just an opinion [which could be right or wrong]. Herrera can't be criticized it seems.

5321~~~
So we bought a central midfielder and he's susceptible to be going to jail. We do have the worst luck at that position in terms of transfers.

Anderson => Fat
Hargreaves => Guinea Pig
Carrick => Center back
Blind => Broke his knee
Herrera => Convict
Afroman => God have mercy

5322~~~
Haha

5323~~~
I don't think Herrera is that much worse... 
He just didn't play enough but his defensive stats are quite excellent for someone who was considered by some as no 10.. His tackling is more successful I guess.. He looked in preseason as a player who commits loads of fouls but he got much much better and looked very good in premier league in this aspect.. Fellaini can chest the ball and win some aerial duels and outmuscle more players but still his contribution to the game as whole is not as good as Herrera's. We need more legs in midfield and intelligence and I don't think we would lose much of that balance van Gaal is talking about if Herrera played instead of Fellaini. Fellaini tends to do much more mistakes in passing and often commit fouls as he is very clumsy btw I was very pleased and surprised that he wasn't sent off against pool. I think his second half performance was fantastic.. but very disappointing in first half including his stupid yellow card in fourth minute of the match. Herrera over Fellaini any day. His defensive stats are underrated.

5324~~~
People like you trying to insult a poster instead of disagreeing with view and stewing in your bile while licking another player's arse. Funny <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5325~~~
You love each other really, don't you?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5326~~~
Wow if he went to jail his career is over I guess, hopefully that won't happen.

5327~~~
Haha, he's talking rubbish now. I don't know of another player whose ass am licking hahahahaha....

5328~~~
hahahahahaa. that's all you have posted apart from parroting your original comment, which was wrong and has been mentioned by other posters as well. And then you turn it on me saying I have a problem with people who point out mistakes when I said that it is irrelevant to the point that I am making that he did not turn BACK but turned the other side to look for another option. You cry again, repeat the same wrong point of how he turned back (or around, as you later agreed), then cry some more and insult me and then cry some more. That's been your contribution in this thread since last night.

5329~~~
Not sure, there are players who have been in jail, depends if he is found guilty of course, there might be deals made. I was watching an Italian game and someone in that had just come back from a ban for match fixing, Not sure if jail time was served. It could end up as a lot of one person's word against anothers depending on what evidence they have and what the Zaragoza players were told. The ones who actually threw the game surely don't have a leg to stand on.

5330~~~
The thing is if he does go to jail, I don't think the club would stick by him, and I'm not sure he can recover emotionally from this sort of thing.

5331~~~
At long last we sign a midfielder capable of playing a box to box role only for him to possibly end up in prison<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Only at United.

5332~~~
De Gea could save him, the lad can save anything.

5333~~~
That's the worry. I hope it doesn't come to that. If he is banned, yes we would keep him. He has cost too much money, jail not so sure. It might also depend if the club think he has been fairly dealt with.

5334~~~
Right now it's really not fair to think about how the club would do, I'm sure we'd be fine, but 'm really worried about the lad, he looks like a really nice guy and it would be really sad for a player with his kind of talent to be in this position.

5335~~~
We'll have to have a petition, like Deirdre in Coronation Street.

5336~~~
The ones who run Real Zaragoza are scumbags who were thinking about their own necks. Didn't they realise that they could ruin someones career, even if they were indirectly involved? He was only around 21 at the time, so no saying a deal couldn't be made. However, again it all depends what he was told to justify the money being put into his account.

5337~~~
They have him on video accepting a plain, brown bag in a restaurant. He claims it was a lettuce and mayonnaise sandwich to go; they say it was 1 million Euro. The authorities have recovered the bag from his garbage, and are testing it as we speak. If they don't find lettuce DNA, he's toast (with no lettuce).

5338~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5339~~~
After I read what Gabi said it seems like the players didn't know what the money was for, it also depends on how the judge sees it.

5340~~~
Wait, so he could actually end up in prison?

feck me we have no luck with midfielders.

5341~~~
I don't know about you, but it's not often I'm given a brown paper bag with cash in it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5342~~~
If I was the judge I would be after the bosses of Zaragoza and the players of Levante. They are the ones who threw the match and knew what they were doing. It might be harder to prove that the Zaragoza players did anything knowing exactly what was going on.

5343~~~
If found guilty, career is over.

5344~~~
Seems like it, man what an ugly part of football that is.

5345~~~
According to the MEN United knew of the implications of the case and still signed him. I presume they have investigated themselves about what happened and have spoken to the player about it.

5346~~~
Err.. That statistical argument can be very easily turned on its head mate.


That includes the all important aggregate defensive score.

5347~~~
Why have you included take-ons, replaced aerial duels with total duels (which includes take-ons anyway) and taken out all the other stats where Fellaini was superior?

How do they calculate the overall defensive score?

(I'm assuming a take-on is an attempt to dribble past an opponent - is this correct?)

5348~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Brilliant

5349~~~
Might explain why his playing time has been limited, aside from the broken rib, his head can't be in a good place atm.

5350~~~
It seems the club knew all about this and still signed him. Maybe they know there will be no problem in the end. I hope so. Ander has always seemed quite relaxed, so maybe it is us being over worried.

5351~~~
It was just an illustration of how the argument could be twisted in Herrera's favor too. Because the stats provided by the poster I was quoting were clearly tailored to suit Fellaini while discounting areas where Herrera is statistically superior.

Try this :

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/football-stats-definitions" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/football-stats-definitions</a>

or contact squawkadave on his twitter acc.

Most of these take-ons were in defensive zones though so in a vague sense it can be counted in the pro-Ander column (as a form of easing pressure on the defense). Total duels portray a more lucid picture than raw tackling stats.

5352~~~
What if Herrera stood on Jack Wilshere's shoulders, and they wore a long overcoat to look like one person? Do you think they'd be able to 'have' Fellaini?

5353~~~
What a thought.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

5354~~~
What the fecks going on here then? Herreras going to prison? Is this just the latest in line for our midfield feck ups?

5355~~~
We certainly hope not.

5356~~~
Neither Herrera nor Fellaini are very good defensively and shouldn't be playing in that position. However when we are faced with injury troubles we were against Liverpool I'd prefer Fellaini in there. Not because he's necessarily better but because his physical approach often leads to him breaking up attacks and generally being a right pest.

5357~~~
Can we claim a buyer's refund from Athletic if Ander goes to prison though ? An argument could be made for them deceiving the club and dangling the carrot in front of our faces as a pretext for off-loading him. Maybe Woody should sue them.. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

5358~~~
I said earlier that according to MEN we knew about this. So it we cannot pull that one. The club can't be that worried about it.

5359~~~
All you've done then is add in 2 stats that are arguably not purely defensive (especially the take ons one, which forms part of the other stat anyway).

Plus a score for which you have no idea how it is calculated.

While keeping the one stat from pogue which favoured Herrera and taking out all the ones that didn't.

I don't think pogue was that dishonest in what he posted.

5360~~~
Drat. 

I'm pretty sure the jury won't indict him as a felon though. Just look at that cherubic face.. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5361~~~
Exactly, how can such a sweet innocent face be a crook. It's all lies I tell you. I just hope he doesn't get a judge who wants a big name to hang out to dry, if he deserves it or not. There will be ones who are far more guilty in this than Ander.

5362~~~
Oh jebus what are you on about ? Did I call him dishonest ? 

Just pointing out that stats can be used to offer a differing perspective. It's not my fault you dunno how the total defensive stats are calculated (which BTW are more comprehensive than tackles - which don't put the area of pitch into context or blocks - Ander has played as a #10 in recent weeks so he'll obviously stop a lesser amount of shots duh or aerial duels - which are inflated by long balls from De Gea to velcro's head).

5363~~~
You implied that he's cherry picked stats to suit his argument and that you can do the same to achieve the same results for Herrera. My point is that his choice of stats were a lot more honest than yours especially since 3 of your stats contribute to each other.

Do you know how the defensive score is calculated?

(You must have quoted before I edited from "dishonest" to "that dishonest" which admittedly changes the point a lot so apologies for that)

5364~~~
This should be a separate thread. It's in no way relevant to his performances.

5365~~~
Yeah, if you specifically select the only defensive criteria where Fellaini isn't superior. Including one ("take ons")which isn't even defensive. That would be absurdly biased though.

5366~~~
How can we define honest stats though ? I could provide an argument for some of those tackling, blocking or aerial duel stats being contextually dishonest too, as stated in the post above.

Fair enough mate. But isn't overall defensive score over an average period of 90 minutes a better indicator than raw tackling or blocking stats ?

5367~~~
I've no idea. Because I've no idea how it's calculated. I can only make sense of stats that I understand.

5368~~~
Ah okay fair enough mate. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

They used to have a faq manual detailing the process algorithm I read before but it seems that's been taken down and condensed now. Shame..

Take on – Attempted dribble past an opponent.

via <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/football-stats-definitions" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/football-stats-definitions</a>

Counted for both attacking and defensive zones.

5371~~~
Thanks

5372~~~
No big deal. We're on a bit of a tangent anyway. Plus, judging Hererra on defensive stats is unfair and ignores his best qualities. It's my fault for taking issue with someone who said Hererra was better at defending than Fellaini. He's not. But there's a bunch of other stuff he does much better than the Belgian.

5373~~~
I'm not sure that any stats on their own without context are honest and the context you mentioned with regard to goal kicks contributing to the duels won % is a fair one.

+What Pogue said above

5374~~~
This times a berjillion.

5375~~~
It's funny that some people are comparing Herrera to Fellaini because of the assumption of one's taking other's place (maybe because of one game (Wes Brom)). In other games after that, Herrera was subbed in always for players other than Fellaini.

5376~~~
This is the thing I don't get with the never ending comparison.

5377~~~
Yeah. It's to the extent that on our last game, some people wanted to sub Fellaini for Herrera. Fully known that it would mean we had Rooney/Mata - Herrera as CM with 3 forwards in a big game. It's borderline insane, from team balance perspective.

5378~~~
I think a lot of people get too obsessed with wanting particular players in the team rather than looking at the bigger picture of team balance like you've said.

5379~~~
We all know that Herrera is a very good CM, but just like Kagawa in the past, he needs to make himself irreplaceable. Even Mata, a more proven player than him, is still in and out of the team often.

5380~~~
I think we paid for his release from his Bilbao contract, there's no refunds there even if we were to play that angle.

5381~~~
That's why we will have to hope things turn out fine for him. Otherwise it is a lot of money lost. Things might not be as serious for him as people think. Depends what is going on in the background and who they are seriously going after.

5382~~~
I was only being facetious.. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5383~~~
I hope Zaragoza didn't pay the money into the players accounts and then they withdraw the amount needed.

5384~~~
I don't get people saying he's the next Kagawa, he's already done more than Kagawa did in his two seasons with us.

5385~~~
Because Fellaini is the one that they personally think should be out of the team in favour of Herrera?

5386~~~
The argument can also be used that fellaini is a lot better going forwards, especially as his passing isn't as costly. Its not like Herrera is shir defensively either, he's quite good actually. Though I'd agree that it would probably be too attacking, it would also result in us attacking a lot better and controlling the game more.

5387~~~
I have no doubt that Herrera as a sole DM in big game would be a disaster. We had so many attacking players there, why would we need more if we were playing counter-attack football? Had he ever played as DM before?

5388~~~
As many games have proved, Fellaini has offered something different to the team's balance as LvG wants him to. Those subs have proved that LvG sees Herrera competing with players other than Fellaini. 

It is understandable than LvG wants to steady the ship first, after the horrid early season, as we are winning games right now. Thus he tends to use the tried and trusted method by playing the system and players that have been contributing to the recent 'success'. 

As it is right now, I personally think that points are more urgent than style, which the later will take time to shape up.

5389~~~
Agree. Its substance over style at mo. Fellaini over Herrera, and at present until other positions are sorted on the pitch, its working. TBH I get the feeling both players should be worried in the longer term cause if we buy a YaYa type of midfielder who's capable of doing a bit of both, makes them both redundant.

5390~~~
I don't doubt that it would be! Just that there is a chance it could work if he was asked to play a more disciplined role. He has played a defensive midfield role before I'm pretty sure though not very often. Where in one sense we'd be worse off in terms of winning the ball back and defending long balls, we would be much better at passing the ball out from the back and moving up the pitch IMO.

5391~~~
I think the pass was on but the windows was a very small one and after that the little space was completely covered by the defender. It would required some pinpoint and fast execution.

5392~~~
Fair enough Fellaini did have an excellent defensive performance on sunday but obviously overall he'll have better stats because he's played more. Could you show me where to find game by game stats mate cus i'm sure Ander's were not too shabby at all and considering that we would potentially have carrick playing holding midfield and possibly a similarly hardworking ADM in our midfield i'm honestly curious as to your take on fellaini over herrera? do you not think that we are far less ponderous and more mobile and penetrative when ander plays? give me your thoughts mate

5393~~~
Stats available on that website I linked to, squawka.com. They're all "per 90 minutes" so it doesn't matter who's played the most.

Re the two of them, as compared to each other, I can only base my opinion on what I've seen this season. I think Fellaini has been better for us so far. Although does seem to be entering a bit of a dip in form, with those two terrible first half performances in a row.

Both obviously have different qualities and I really like Hererra as a footballer but I can totally understand Van Gaal's team selection in recent weeks. Fellaini replaced Hererra at half time against West Brom, played a massive part in turning things round and has been playing well enough to retain his place. Herrera looked like forcing his way into our starting Xi with one great performance off the bench but followed it up with a poor performance and was justifiably dropped. There's loads of competition for places in midfield, right now. Which is great. I'm sure Van Gaal wouldn't have hesitated to drop Fellaini if he hadn't recovered so well from his last two first half disasters. He's probably just about clinging to his place but could easily make way for Hererra soon enough. Which is absolutely fine by me and I'd be delighted if Hererra made himself undroppable the same way Fellaini did with his first few games this season. Here's hoping he does exactly that.

5394~~~
Time for Herrera to step up and cement his place then with Fellaini missing out.

5395~~~
Do you think he'll actually start given what's going on with him?

5396~~~
Yes. He is only a witness, people have played on with much worse things going on in their lives. If anything getting on the pitch will be a welcome distraction.

That's if LVG doesn't put Rooney next to Carrick and Falcao up front of course.

5397~~~
That's what I was thinking might happen. Would like Herrera to play though. Nice to have these sorts of selection headaches given what we have had in the near past (Cleverley!)

5398~~~
Ander in his younger days. 

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/wycDDnvAyT/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

5399~~~
With Fellaini ill i really hope he can show the gaffer why he should be playing week in and week out. I actually think he has the physicality and ball winning skills needed to be a proper number 8. He showed a lot of this in Spain and we saw glimpses here and there in the first couple matches. To have his creativity and passing ability but still have a bit of bite in midfield will be vital for us if he is able to do it. I am hoping to see him rip apart villa tomorrow.

5400~~~
Is Fellaini definitely out?

5401~~~
Is he the one on the far left or far right? He looks a little bit like both of them.

5402~~~
I think Fellaini will be a big loss. His defensive steel and work rate will be sorely missed against a tough away opponent. I guess tomorrow will give a clearer picture of whether Fellaini or Herrera should play with Carrick in central mid

5403~~~
Yep. He's finally admitted that his hair is gay.

5404~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5405~~~
We have won many a game at villa Park without fellaini, and without needing  a "thug type"  player in the middle. I suspect we will be fine to be honest.

5406~~~
He's the one on the left.

5407~~~
Hope he gets a start tomorrow. The only 3 reasons I can assume he's not been getting much game time are:
1. His injury and fitness took longer to recover than expected.
2. He's not favoured in games needing physicality.
3. Fellaini's been playing well.

None of these are issues tomorrow so I expect him to start. Hope he does well.

5408~~~
I am sure he will play tomorrow, I also hope and there's not a small chance that we will see Pereira on the bench as Fellaini's out, Valencia/Young playing wingbacks/fullbacks, Blind out, Fletcher ill, Carrick may also play center back for another time. DiMaría is not nailed to necessarily make the bench he can be saved completely but he will not start anyway.  Am I missing someone? Rooney dropping deep would mean start for Wilson so I am already happy for the young lads and for Ander as well.. Also we could see some odd appearance for Januzaj

5409~~~
Taken last year.

5410~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Why do junior football teams always kit out their kids in shirts 10 sizes too big?

5411~~~
A tough away opponent? Villa are the yoyo team of the PL. Their home form is not impressive at all they are one of the teams we regularly beat, even at our worst under Moyes last season. Im glad Herrera is starting. Maybe finally he'll make that place his own once again. I hate us playing to Fellaini's limited attributes.

5412~~~
Because kids grow fast so it's on the safe side to just kit them up a few sizes bigger?

5413~~~
I thought that was just mums and school uniforms. So it's a man thing as well.

5414~~~
Why are people constantly refering to Villa like they are West Ham in terms of physicality? Am I missing something?

5415~~~
Just Benteke. If on song, he'l be a handful in the air specially on set pieces. We're missing both our best defensive headers.

5416~~~
Assuming he starts, I would be expecting a strong performance today from Herrera (and Mata, for that matter).

Villa have 8 players out and are generally rubbish. Its the sort of game where we should be putting 4 or 5 goals past them I would say.

5417~~~
I know there is Benteke, but there is really no one else apart from him that make them physical side, their midfielders are pretty much softer than ours.

5418~~~
Baffling if its true fletcher starting in front of him.

5419~~~
If Fletcher starts, then maybe people here will now understand that it wasn't Fellaini keeping him out. It's Mata/Rooney.

5420~~~
I guess he doesn't want to change the system, and doesn't think Herrera is suited to that anchor role. But still.

5421~~~

5422~~~
Well if that's true then at least there's an explanation for Fletcher being picked ahead of him.

5423~~~
That makes more sense. Appears Blind has had food poisoning at his parents house in Amsterdam. You couldn't make it up.

5424~~~
The curse is real.

5425~~~
Grow a pair Ander. Was a big chance for him today and he should've gone out there even if he was shitting his keks. Wuss.

5426~~~
Pfff, I was looking forward seeing him play today. It would have been a good chance for him to get ahead of Fellaini. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5427~~~
Haven't been keeping up with it properly, but anyone think him being 'unwell' has anything to do with those match-fixing allegations being thrown at him?

5428~~~
He'd have been unwell before now if that was the case. He has probably got whatever Fellaini has got. There might be others before we know where we are.

5429~~~
Just him, in set pieces specially.

5430~~~
Then we will have to make sure they don't get too many set pieces.

5431~~~
Cue brainless fouls when the opposition have nowhere to go

5432~~~
I feel unwell looking at our midfield as well.

5433~~~
I thought we couldn't get away with losing just one player to illness. Once a bug hits a squad it tends to get around fast, mad that it's hit another midfielder first. Hopefully they'll all be through it by the time we get to Boxing Day.

5434~~~
It's typical of the luck we have been having. If it is just a bug, a few days and they should be better. You worry more about the flu.

5435~~~
When Jones isn't around tackling defenders he is poisoning our midfielders. I wonder what's he got for forwards.

5436~~~
What shit luck to be ill when you finally get the chance to start.

5437~~~
Typical that he should be ill when we need him the most.

Whats wrong with our luck this year?

We really need to get rid of whoever is in charge of fitness.

5438~~~
Herrera might be the only midfielder in the squad that knows what a through ball is. We need more guys like this.

5439~~~
If there was one player we missed today it was him. Some people on here can criticize him for whatever reason, but nobody can deny he adds a lot more creativity and increases our whole passing speed and we just look a lot more fluid and better going forward with him on the pitch. Van Gaal said he was injured so hopefully it's only a little knock.

5440~~~
What gets me is that LvG will say these players are soft for picking up injuries, well funnily enough Chelsea players don't get them and their training isn't as intense. Maybe it is about time we looked not so much at what training they do, but how much training they do.

5441~~~
What? How can someone in charge of fitness prevent illness? Clearly a bug going around and sadly some players caught it.

5442~~~
LvG is saying an injury, seems to be some confusion with Steve Bates saying illness. Maybe we need Ander to tweet what the problem is.

5443~~~
Doubt it's anything to do with the training methods. Van Persie has managed to go the entire season without picking up injuries, it's mostly just the defenders and a few unfortunate injuries with midfielders.

5447~~~
ffs

5448~~~
That result and performance doesn't deserve a well done. Especially given they had 10 men for 30 minutes.

5449~~~
He's not going to post 'You were shit and I would have run the show'. Now is he? He is just giving encouragement.

5450~~~
So not illness?

How many times have we had this happen now? Do we kick lumps out of each other before every game day. As these injuries seem to happen the day before a game.

5451~~~
They showed him training during the press conference in the early session, now did it happen then or when they play a game later in the day. Probably Fletch kicked him one. He seemed fine early on.

5452~~~
He would have added some urgency to our slow motion build at the very least.

5453~~~

5454~~~
Feck, again!

5455~~~
Stop nuzzling, Carrick.

5456~~~
Can only have happened in training. I hate all these injuries in training. At least in a game you see what happened.

5457~~~
Injured.

FFS.

Seems LVG should have a bit more softer trainings. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5458~~~
Admit it, you would nuzzle Falcao as well.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

5459~~~
I'd go as if to nuzzle him and then just as I got to his ear I'd scream "TELL ME WHAT THE feck IS GOING ON WITH JORGE MENDES!!! IS HE HURTING YOU??"

5460~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a tease you are.

5461~~~
He needs to play every game.

5462~~~
Looking at today definitely. You wonder how annoyed LvG was knowing that he didn't have him there to bring on. He has been a good sub in the last few games and does change the intensity of games. Maybe LvG now knows that.

5463~~~
Sack Steve McNally, sign Eva Carneiro and let her dictate the whole process of training the players Chelsea-style I say. Did I already say that our managers (yes, including Fergie and Moyes) and other staff are acting like retarded Neanderthals when it comes to training methods?

5464~~~
Any news about his injury?

5465~~~
He tweeted about it. Saying was nothing serious and he'd be back very soon (or words to that effect)

EDIT: The tweet is on the same damn page you just posted on!

5466~~~
I saw that tweet already.

5467~~~
Di Maria's wife told it was not serious and was off for 3 weeks, so until Ander is back I won't read this kind of message

5468~~~
Sick of these fecking injuries. We haven't seen a proper performance in so long. Results have been great but I want to see Herrera and Di Maria play with Carrick in the midfield. We have been robbed of watching g a proper squad. Very frustrating.

5469~~~
"Ill" now "injured". I wouldn't be surprised if he's had a bit of compassionate leave to sort things out with this court case.

5470~~~
Cant see that.  Media blowing that all out of proportion - he's one of 41 people been asked to give evidence. 

Fully expect its a muscle injury and i wouldnt expect him back for a couple of weeks - its been the standard prognosis for virtually every injury we've had this season.

5471~~~
I heard he's been charged or at least accused of something. Not just being called as a witness.

5472~~~
He has said himself he has been cited as a witness.  We wont know facts for a while yet but i find it highly unlikely he's been given time off what is a hectic period for the club when we are also under pressure from injuries. 

It will most likely be a muscle injury.

5473~~~
Being charged with even a minor criminal offence can be devastating pychologically. He could lose a great deal if found guilty of this offence (and only he knows for now if he is.) I'm not at all suprised he isn't playing.

5474~~~
My vote goes for compassionate leave, to sort out his troubles.

5475~~~
Any news about him?

5476~~~
Van Gaal says he is ready to return this week.Great news.

5477~~~
Coming back as in playing, or coming back as in back to training?

5478~~~
Thx, great news.

5479~~~
Hope LvG starts him vs Stoke.

5480~~~
He doesn't make that clear but I'd imagine he'll at least make the bench against Stoke.

5481~~~
As with everyone he's had an injury hit season but even when fit he hasn't generally been in the team, probably too early to ask this but does anyone see him as a regular starter in the future?

5482~~~
I've definitely been underwhelmed so far. To be frank, I hadn't seen much of him before but when you fork out 28 million on a midfielder who was reportedly traced by Barca as well, you expect so much more than what we've seen when he has played. My main gripe is that it's hard to see anything he's spectacularly good at. I suppose his passing is his strongest asset but it's not quite as good as you might think considering his Spanishness. He does everything reasonably well but doesn't really excel at anything.

He's a pretty tidy player but certainly a disappointment at that price. He might still start quite a few games in the next few years but he's certainly not the mainstay to build our midfield around that I'd hoped, and there's no doubt we could still improve on him. It's a bit tragic to think that we neglected our midfield for so long and now we've spent 65 million on midfielders in the space of 18 months. Yet maybe both of them are more suited for the bench than the starting eleven.

5483~~~
I'm not sure, because LVG doesn't seem to want to use him as often as his performances suggest he should

5484~~~
Suspect he's been badly upset by the match fixing accusations and LvG will be protecting him. He's really quite young and this is his first season away from home. Wouldn't be suprised if the injury is a bit phony. The quote doesn't actually say he was injured.

5485~~~
Would love to know if it's true that van Gaal chose him over Kroos. Would make even less sense now given that he doesn't seem to fancy him much.

5486~~~
Christ, at least give the guy time to settle fully before bringing up his transfer fee as a stick to beat him with. Fellaini has only started to perform to his level for us after a hopeless first season. Some players, especially players new to a league, need time.

5487~~~
Transfer fees aren't irrelevant. You expect top-class at that price. When you consider the impact Kroos has had at Real at a lower price, I think it's fair to feel a bit underwhelmed.

Plus, Fellaini, while improved, is still not good enough for a United starting XI for me. Of course Herrera should be given time to settle, just saying that based on what we've seen so far, which is all I have to go by, I'm not seeing the top-class midfielder I'd hoped for.

5488~~~
There is something about Van Gaal, he can bench a player that he loves, just because he thinks that the rest of the team doesn't suit the said player abilities, for example Depay.

5489~~~
I highly doubt it.

5490~~~
Kroos had contract issues and chose Madrid. We were incredibly unlikely to be chosen instead of them, as is almost always the case. Kroos' fee is a lot less than it would normally be

Having said that we paid a large amount for Ander. A similar amount to Fabregas

5491~~~
Fabregas is probably a better reference. I only made the Kroos comparison because, according to some papers, it was a choice between Kroos and Herrera. If that's true (which I doubt because I trust that LVG knows football), I don't think anyone would argue that we got the better deal.

Of course, as with all our players, it's important to take into account that he's playing in a team that isn't playing incredibly well. He'd likely look a lot better if we were playing fast, fluid, one-touch football. That said, he's on the pitch to make that happen.

5492~~~
Kroos was quoted as saying that if he did join an English team, he'd only choose Chelsea.
The problem at the time was that Man Utd were a 7th place team and players were skeptical about joining a team who no longer had a top line manager.
He wanted to join a top team, so Man Utd was not really an option.
I think had LvG come a year earlier, it may have been different. But the choice was Kroos's to join Madrid.

5493~~~
He does make that happen. The pace of passing through the central areas has been noticeably quicker when Herrera has been on the pitch. When he has played he's been largely good for us. Perhaps his lack of game time is underwhelming but I think that's to our detriment. He can't really impress while sat on the bench, can he?

5494~~~
We'll just have to agree to disagree. I think he has done okay when he has played but not much more than that, bar a few games. Wouldn't say we've generally been better with him than without. The last two games, for instance, have been some of our most productive in terms of creating chances.

5495~~~
I don't think Fellaini is good enough for our starting XI either for the record, but my point is, he's still performed a country mile better than last season and it took him a long time to settle here despite playing in this league for around five season with Everton. Mata is another fine example isn't he?

Herrera has made nine appearances for us so far and it's not as if he'd walked into a settled midfield or team for that matter. We lost 5-3 to Leicester early doors, which says it all. I think it's still way to early to judge Herrera until he's gotten a few strings of games under his belt in the much improved side that we're starting to look now. Not the mess we were at the beginning of the season.

5496~~~
Is the concept of protecting him also include doing something that is detrimental to our team? We have been complaining that we don't have a midfield while we have one of the stepping stones out there to build a midfield. For me, it doesn't make any sense for him to spend that much time on the bench if not in the stands.

If he's anywhere fit, he should and must play. Some people say that he needs time to adapt to a new league and all that jazz, but I believe the only way he can achieve that is by playing more and more minutes on the pitch.

5497~~~
We will, although I'll reaffirm that I think it's blindingly obvious he makes a noticeable attempt to speed up our play. He really does do this and it would surprise me if you can't see this. I agree that we've been creating more chances in recent games, which is a good sign. 

I'd sooner see us drop a striker when our midfielders return as I think we'll create even more.

5498~~~
That I agree with, there's just a certain other, even more expensive midfielder I'd see in the team before Herrera.

5499~~~
As a CM, I haven't seen anything from him to suggest he's close to Fabregas or Kroos considering his price tag, but as a CAM of Advanced midfielder he can definitely be worth the money we spent on him. I would love to see him replace Mata in the hole, he has looked good when he's further up the pitch.

5500~~~
I was expecting a lot more from him, but I will go with what Fergie said. The first six months are not enough to judge new signings. If we start making a report card right now, we screwed up big time in the summer. Apart from Blind, we have doubts about everyone whom we bought in the summer.
This team is in transition, the manager is settling in, the players are settling in, the club is recovering from a shock of a last season.
Di Maria, Falcao and Blind will have impacts this season. Herrera, Rojo and Shaw will be big players next season IMO.

5501~~~
If he's a nervous wreck there's not much point in playing him I suppose.

5502~~~
I think he improves our tempo quite a bit and also he provides an option and can take the ball under pressure, something a lot of our other players struggle with.

5503~~~
Van Gaal has said Herrera is back this week. Rooney and Mata have been doing well there but Herrera would add some more balance to the team.

5504~~~
I love the guy, but I don't see how he can get in the team at this time, if we still keep playing 3-5-2. Our midfielders are playing really good.

5505~~~
Two draws in the past three matches, and the return of Shaw and Rafael suggest things might change soon. As others have pointed out Herrera increases our tempo and is always a welcome addition to our midfield.

5506~~~
This is becoming a typical caf "let's bash a player before we all eat a humble pie when he proves us wrong" thread. Give the guy time ffs!

5507~~~
dont think he will start. Rarely do players start under van Gaal coming back from an injury. I like him, think he adds a lot to the team, especially with his movement and quick passing. In fact, the more i think about it the more i cant wait to see him again.

5508~~~
At least it's not as comical as RAWK's "All our players are world class (or potentially world class) until we eat a humble pie halfway through the season".

5509~~~
How far have we fallen when RAWK becomes the standard for comparison!<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

5510~~~
Yes because that's the standard we should be aiming at. Also, I never claimed he is world class, just pointing out the fact that it's too early to judge him. Players are going from championship standard to world class within a week.

5511~~~
Is there anywhere in my post that claims that you said Anders is world class?

All my post is to juxtapose the attitudes on CAF and RAWK.

5512~~~
Herrera seems to me to be the kind of footballer who fits much better into a side that's firing on all cylinders rather than grinding out results, which is how we've settled into third place after a pretty wretched start to the season.

I am not concerned.

5513~~~
I think most players are better when their team is playing well.

5514~~~
Mata,Herrera and Di maria all playing together played some of our best football this whole season, I know qpr are dogshite, but still this was great football

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ef1wPqShZto?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

5515~~~
That's not quite what I'm saying.  

A team can play very well when they're grinding out results that are less than pleasing to the eye.  The old Chelsea under Jose and United during Ferguson's last days come to mind.  Scholes thrived in the high octane United sides of the treble side, the Ruud years and the Ronaldo years, the last of which were typified by a lot of defensive, ugly 1-0 and 2-0 wins, wins made possible by a moment of lone genius from Ronaldo.  

We're only getting to know Ander Herrera now so it's hard to be sure, but he looks like a midfielder prefers a high tempo game than a defend and hit on the counter game.

5516~~~
From his Liga days, I'd say he certainly prefers a high tempo game. Patience with the ball in his own half was never really his thing, he wanted it upfield whether that meant taking it himself or looking for someone who would.

However the games he really stood out in compared to Athletic teammates were the really hard fought matches, against the biggest teams. The defend and hit on the counter games in fact. Again though, it was for the same reason, he was happy to take responsibility for taking the ball forward and he'd never stop trying or fighting for it.

If LvG wants him to learn to take a more conservative approach, to feel comfortable with the ball being recirculated from the back it may take time. Hopefully that's all it will take.

5517~~~
I actually think Fellaini's been the bigger loss over the last few games but Hererra could have been a brilliant option off the bench. Our inability to make attacking substitutions really fecked us over against Villa and Spurs. 

Rooney, Carrick and Mata have all been very good and Van Gaal will be loving watching his 352 formation finally click so I would be surprised if either of Fellaini and Hererra start our next game.

5518~~~
I don't think they will either, Herrera will get a full game against Yeovil. If we lose or struggle to score or create chances against Stoke, he might have to rethink his lineup. I think Herrera might be on the bench and will come on if necessary. We could have done with him and Fellaini at Spurs, definitely. Herrera is the type of player you need when teams are tiring or are playing with everyone back and you need someone who can up the pace and has the eye for a quick pass. We can be a bit one dimensional when we struggling a bit. That is the same for a lot of teams.

5519~~~
"Finally clicked" has given us 1 goal in the last two games and I do wonder how well Falcao and RvP will get on against Stoke. Our first half at Spurs did look very nice though.

Fellaini or Herrera's a difficult one. Prior to this season I'd say Herrera would always be the first choice. Longer term I still think we'll play better football (and win more games) with Herrera. However right now Fellaini was playing well and doing an important job for us in a team that's still misfiring, so dropping him for Herrera wouldn't seem right.

It's the subs issue that's intriguing me. I don't think I would ever put Ander on to defend a lead or a point, he's someone you bring on to chase a game or a winner. Unfortunately I'd put the same label on Fellaini if he was on the bench. I've no idea who we bring on to hold onto what we've got.

5520~~~
We scored 3 against Newcastle?

5521~~~
Ooops, skipped a match! I blame the turkey leftovers.

5522~~~
Herrera is a very good player. He started well and due to injury had a bit of a dip in form. Put him into a good midfield and he will show his qualities. A midfield of Carrick and Herrera with ADM in there and the support of Rooney or Mata could dominate and create chance after chance

5523~~~
Heh. Please don't do that. Even seeing the word "turkey" written down makes me queasy. 

But yeah, the Newcastle game was the first time I thought this 352 might work. Although it has to be said they did us a huge favour lining up the same way, so it was reassuring to see it looks so effective against Spuds too. Until we got knackered anyway. I don't see Van Gaal reverting to a back four against Stoke but he might think he needs Fellaini's height. Will be an intriguing team selection but I'd be amazed if Herrera made the XI.

5524~~~
On recent form, benching either of them would be a terrible decision.

5525~~~
You wouldn't drop either of them, one of RvP or Falcao would be dropped and Rooney plays up front.

5526~~~
Based on the season so far,  there's absolutely no chance of Van Gaal doing that. 

Although I wouldn't be averse to it myself.

5527~~~
I like him a lot but for me struggled with the physical nature of the Prem. His endeavour there but concedes a lot of fouls when trying to match people's physicality. LVG has noted this and although technical not as good, Fellaini added this to the midfield and has contributed to us winning matches. If we sign a player that does both equally well, they will both have a challenge getting into the first team imo.

5528~~~
I don't know if he had a dip in a form it seems to me that he didn't pay at all and people start to talk about dip in for, it is the same with Rafael people accusing him of playing bad at times while he doesn't play at all. Herrera had a below average half of football against Westbrom? and that is it, Apart that he was brilliant, after his comeback he was great then okay the next game but then got injured again but dip in a form? I don't think so, I see more dips in form of any other single player in our team.

Some other people mentioning his lack of physicality but I think his movement and smart play is good enough to compensate that, Mata struggles more IMO.. 
And he doesn't concede fouls that much, he used to in preseason but he got much much better and he wins a lot of tackles for the team, doesn't conced more fouls than for example fellaini who is as clumsy as player can be. Can't wait for him to be back in the side. No matter for what reasons he didn't play but we need him back immediately as we play without midfield for some time and have the same problem what we had for three years+ I only fear for his ankles as he apparently suffered another ankle injury couple of weeks ago, because his play is based on quick turns and good balance, this issues wouldn't help his career at all..

5529~~~
He doesn't conceed that many fouls and he often wins many freekicks. I don't think he really struggles physically as much as being made out tbh.

5530~~~
But you must concede for whatever reason it doesnt appear he's a LVG favourite right now. We are all coming up with various reasons for this and expecting this to change but based on the facts he's as favoured as Kagawa was by management........

5531~~~
Yeah I'm not debating that.

5532~~~
It's debateable but LVG made reference to the team lacking physicality for which Felliani offered. I expect that Herrea wasn't LVG wasn't his choice but already bought before he arrived. I like Herrea but I suspect we will find eventually a player that will be able to offer the physically of Felliani and the technical ability of Herrea....

5533~~~
Has Mata been that convincing in anything other than wins against the non-CL types (the bottom 12) at home? If healthy, I'd rather see Herrera away at Stoke next to Rooney and then Mata can be our option off the bench to provide offense if need be.

5534~~~
And which CL types has Herrera been amazing against?? There is zero basis so far for saying Mata is not as good as Herrera.

5535~~~
Has Herrera?

Seriously, you'd think we're talking about golden ball winner here.

5536~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> people <i>still </i>on about LvG not liking Herrera, what a load of bollocks.
He's probably been on a tough training schedule to get him up to speed with the physicality of EPL hence the injuries. People forget he has played in that pussy league La Liga all his career.
Fantastic player

5537~~~
These comments are fair, in that I'm giving an opinion on how I think he would do, not arguing he's proven himself here yet. 

I don't think Herrera is perfect (too wayward a passer) but I think his game is really impressive and he works hard. 

Against a good team away or a very good team at home, I find it hard to believe that Mata-Rooney in CM with 2 strikers can work without an incredible back 6 supporting them defensively and providing with in attack. 

Throw Herrera in for Mata or Rooney and you have better balance. 

There have been times this season where Mata stopped paying attention off the ball and marking a CM and the player surged forward and got in a good position. That isn't going to stop happening. 

Do you think Rooney-Mata-Carrick is a serious long-term plan?

5538~~~
Put Rooney up front and play Herrera in midfield. Simples.

5539~~~
Just like Falcao, when he's fit enough, he'll play. I don't understand the drama. I think United fans are the worst, we'll moan about everything. A notable feature of LVG's tenure is that players have to train for 1-2 weeks after recovery to be considered for the first team, and he won't drop a player in your position who is doing well. People go on here about Herrera as if he's a Ballon D'or winner, he still fecking has it all to prove here. When he is fit and ready to play, LVG will ease him in, if you can't deal with that then it's your problem.

5540~~~
The fact we presumed Ander was already back in training, that was until LvG said he only started training yesterday. You wonder if they have realised that it might not be the fact players have been thrown back into games too early and are getting injured again, but due to the strenuous training they have been getting them back into training too early. He might be on the bench tomorrow and play against Yeovil. He will ease him back into games slowly as legball said about Falcao. These lads are valuable assets and have to be treated as such. We need both Herrera and Mata playing well. We have to have a first team and bench that will scare people. Not as soon as changes are made that we might lose control of a game.

5541~~~
Yes. His best performance this season was against Spurs away. 

Now, same question about Hererra.

5542~~~
I really rate Herrera, I think he is a great player and has given us something we have not had in years and while I can see him performing well in the 10 role, it's something that I just don't see. Yes he can be a creative player but I think he just an out and out CM, both sides of the game, energy, all that comes with the modern CM. I think that's where he should be, leave the 10 for Mata and Rooney.

5543~~~
Fair point. He played well and probably only faded due to having played 2 days before. We weren't very good as a team in the 2nd half, but again, probably more about energy levels in this crazy period. 

Herrera has played very well against good teams many times while at Bilbao, and I think he'll do the same here. 

I like Mata, I just don't think our box of 4 central attackers is sustainable. Next year we'll be in the CL and rotating more. As a CM in a 3 man midfield with Rooney involved,I think Herrera is better suited to the tougher games and Mata better suited to breaking teams down.

5544~~~
I agree. Herrera for me is not a no.10, I prefer to see him in a midfield with Carrick and ADM. He can help bring the ball forward and with his urgency and creativity he can make us tick

5545~~~
I think it will next season before Herrera settles. Juan Mata has been in the PL for a while. It must be a shock to the system how fast and physical our league is and takes some adapting to. I think he would have been good in CL games as they are at a different pace, but unfortunately due to circumstances we aren't in it. Hopefully next year we are.

5546~~~
They are very different players, and who should play depends on their teammates, the role they are filling and the opponents.

5547~~~
Isn't this the problem with fans, we will insist on comparing players who are not the same, just like comparing Fellaini with Herrera. Ridiculous. LvG will pick who is suitable for a particular game and as someone said who is playing round them.

5548~~~
What you're saying does kind of make sense but there's no way we should drop Mata in current form. Our best player against Spurs and one of the first names on the team-sheet against Stoke.

5549~~~
I don't think he will drop him. Herrera will have to sit on the bench and make a good contribution when he comes on. I think he will be happy to play, simple as. We need to be in a position to be able to make changes in games. At the moment the midfield options are gash and we are risking the form players either being worn out or god forbid picking up injuries.

5550~~~
As always against Stoke, they'll put some big fecker on Mata and he'll kick and kick until he gets booked, then pass the mantle onto one of his team mates.

There's a lot of talk about Stoke's improved football, but they still love a kick, thrive on the set piece and hoof it up to Crouch half the time. The only real difference in my eyes is that they've recruited wide players with actual technical ability.

It's their cup final every year so it'll be a big old scrap. I'll be there, hungover in the cold. Why were early kick offs on New Year's Day ever a thing?

5551~~~
They are still thugs, you are right, thugs with a bit more finesse, but still thugs.

5552~~~
It really is that simple.

But the complication comes from Mata.  He's a high quality footballer of course, but he goes missing a bit too often.  In Herrera I see a more consistent, though not as outstanding, footballer.  

I hope it's not a case of Ander being in the manager's doghouse and just a matter of working toward fitness.

5558~~~
They're about to eat their grapes (not a euphemism).

5559~~~
While obviously Mata has shown more in his career and is a better player, Herrera for Bilbao was consistently at his best against the likes of Barca and Madrid. That said, I think both suit each other really well and I'd rather drop Falcao and have Rooney up there behind Van Persie, and put Herrera in midfield next to Mata.

5560~~~
Just as long as they go with the sparkling water instead of the cava.

5561~~~
He looked in good form today. Touch was very good and played some nice passes. Why he and Carrick aren't given a chance together in midfield is beyond me. He can do everything Rooney can there and more!

5562~~~
Can see some big changes to our next line up including a start for Herrera

5563~~~
How we've missed him. Such a refreshing player to watch.

5564~~~
he has to play every time. He inject some urgency & pace with quick passing

5565~~~
Good cameo he made an instant difference in the middle. Please make him a starter.

5566~~~
Did feck all to improve us when he came on. In fact Stoke got right on top of us. 
He really needs to do more to live up to this 'world class' hype.

5567~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5568~~~
I get the argument that hes too lightweight but his movement and passing is so good we are really stupid not to play him. Granted hes had a terrible time with injuries but we should have started him today

5569~~~
What world class hype?

5570~~~
If you're going to be an intolerable WUM I'll just thread ban you.

5571~~~
Don't care how we do it but he has to be a starter for us when fit

5572~~~
We were completely pinned back when he came on. Sorry if that offends you.

5573~~~
Hopefully he gets a run of starts now, eases the pressure on Carrick a little bit.

5574~~~
Bollocks we were. I think you're just posting this stuff to provoke people. Also bugger all have said he's world class so you're being ridiculous.

5575~~~
Not because of him though. Coincidental or perhaps more likely Falcao going off who was working so hard, slowing the game down by winning/giving fouls. 

He was very tidy and we looked to have more controlled impetus. Our midfield looked like it could do more than the Hollywood ball or spread wide once he moved there.

5576~~~
Hopefully will get to start the next few matches.

Will be interesting to see how he gets incorporated into the side now that Young is out.

5577~~~
We conceded a few corners.

5578~~~
Behave man.

5579~~~
Agenda as always.

5580~~~
When you see how watery our midfield is and how difficult he finds it to get in, it's not hard to gauge LVG's opinion on him (possibly at this moment in time, if he settles well).

5581~~~
A good performance.

5582~~~
Agreed.

5583~~~
Who the feck called him world class? He's a very good player and still plenty of potential to improve, you're just going for every little chance to criticize him for some strange reason. It's really baffling actually. He's a classy player on the ball, always puts in a shift and works very hard, does a fair bit defensively and doesn't shirk out of challenges, and generally is just a very likable player all around. 
Individually when he came on he was one of our better players probably, but you're basically blaming Stoke having a few more chances with more long balls on him getting subbed on which is ridiculous.

5584~~~
Yes, judge him on 10 minutes of football he has played in a month.

5585~~~
I liked him a lot, every time he got the ball, we looked better, it wasn't easy to take it from him, and his movement was good. But why did he play in front of Mata and not behind him?

How the game went on, we did become more dangerous and the reason we get overrun is not him, but has lot to do with the fact that we don't have any real CM playing.

We have Carrick, who is DFM and looks really tired, Rooney who isn't a midfielder at all, and Mata who can't play CM. That's not a huge problem when your full backs, wingers do the job, but when they can't, you have to play it through the middle and these players can't do it on a regular basis. With Herrera, di Maria and Blind it should look much better.

5586~~~
A cameo in which he actually played well no less. He just has an obvious agenda against him.

5587~~~
Showed something that was severely lacking when he came on - good quick, incisive passing and movement afterwards.

He's one of the only ones who was playing it and immediately making a sprint movement forward or at an angle, getting between the lines - so disappointing to see neither Rooney or Mata able to create anything at all for our strikers and constantly opt for poor passes and hide behind Stoke players - difficult conditions granted.

5588~~~
He did much better than Januzaj when he came on, we were instantly weaker down that left side but our attacks picked up pace thanks to Herrera.

5589~~~
That's what he is good at, gets the ball moves it forward and moves for the return pass. The rest get the ball and look around and either pass it backwards or try to hoof it in gale force winds.

5590~~~
Absolutely, we can make excuses due to conditions but really - if you haven't figured out after 5 minutes what's required in those conditions to get at this Stoke side (ball on the floor and movement) then you deserve what you get.

5591~~~
Hopefully he gets 90 minutes in the cup.

5592~~~
He's a great player but way too lightweight. I'd have Fellaini any day of the week in the team ahead of him for this season anyways. If we went 433 then he might not be a bad option as a right wing forward instead of mata in certain games

5593~~~
If Fellaini would know how to play as a midfielder, than fine, but he just doesn't, so I really hope that Herrera will be picked.

5594~~~
Hes such an iteligent player. I love his passing and movement.

5595~~~
Looked good to me. Love his movement, passing, work ethic and intelligence. 

When we're a good side again, playing 4 at the back, he'll be a very good #8, pressing hard in midfield to try to create turnovers, with a holder behind him, like Gabi does at Atletico, Modric at Real or Gundogan at Dortmund.

5596~~~
charleysurf has a great tagline. I wonder how he got it.

5597~~~
Whats even more amusing is that he is not banned despite such a tagline.

5598~~~
He had some good moments where he clearly helped us move the ball better into attack but not quite the impact I was hoping for

5599~~~
I'd like to us try the Carrick-Herrera combination for a bit.

5600~~~
Much better when this lad came on. Not much cop defensively in my view but presses well and like people have said, it was so nice to see someone running forward into space and generally looking lively.

5601~~~
He's one of the few players in our squad now who can play the perfectly weighted and angled pass. He a real technical footballer. Looking forward to him starting more games. Needs to bulk up though.

5602~~~
He isn't really (top quality) number 8 material although I would still give him games there until we sign a Strootman like player that can perform box to box, the other central midfielder (assuming diamond with Carrick or Blind holding) should really provide width to help stretch teams and at the very least have di maria's taking people on qualities because we need that.

For me, his best position is probably in a 4-3-3 as the most advanced central midfielder performing the advanced playmaker function but also he can work in a diamond with two ahead of him as the 10 especially since his pressing high up the pitch is insane and what a position to win the ball back.

He is competing with Mata and Rooney for this, that's the problem, although I think he could be better than both in those mentioned positions, Rooney and Mata will be better as the number 10 in a 4-2-3-1 with only one striker ahead.

To play as an 8 it's not just bulking up but he needs better positioning for that position and also he needs to know when to join the attack, i don't think he has the balance like a strootman, he is more attacking.

5603~~~
To be fair, in Bilbao, especially under Bielsa, it wasn't as if he was so cavalier and free in his game. I remember, in the matches against us, de Marcos, Muniain, and Susaeta were the really free attacking players in the team. Javi Martinez was the energetic midfielder in the side whilst Ander Herrera was the main playmaker in the team. It wasn't as if Javi Martinez was doing all of the defensive work all by himself, either. Ander was also useful defensively with de Marcos being very free and aggressive in his game.

It's only from his Zaragoza loan spell and his last season at Bilbao when people thought that he is a #10 sort of player who plays with too much freedom for a central midfielder. If that really was the case, he should have more goals and assists to his name than he has in his time in Spain.

5604~~~
Well if he can do the job of Strootman then we've got nothing to worry about but I suspect he isn't that type of player.

In the diamond with Full Backs ferociously attacking down the flanks, there will be left the goal keeper, the two centre backs and the 6, the number 8 has to be solid defensively whilst supporting the offence otherwise we risk being exposed.

It's one thing doing the job at Bilbao but if we want to compete with the best club as is Louis van Gaal's ambition then either he is of the highest quality as an 8 or he isn't, from what I have seen of him he looks to be that quality slightly more advanced because even the advanced central midfielder needs to contribute much more defensively than your 10 in the 4-2-3-1.

Louis van Gaal will know whether he can perform the role I'm talking about, perhaps in a 4-3-3 he could play as the 8 due to the wing backs having more support down the flank but I still think in the diamond with Carrick, Herrera, di Maria, Rooney, RVP, Falcao (my guess on LvG's preference) we are too attacking.

EDIT - In my initial post you would see me refer to him as an advanced central midfielder, not your 10 like Ozil, but in a 4-3-3 with carsick anchor and two ahead, I would see his best position as alongside a strootman like player as the most attacking of the three but still contributing much defensively so the wingers can do less.

5605~~~
He's going to destroy Yeovil if he starts today.

5606~~~
Okay, I see your point now that you've clarified it a bit more. I thought you were talking about him playing a very free role in central midfield like Iniesta did for Barcelona. However, I agree with you in that you can't expect him to have a great reading of the game from central midfield. Strootman definitely offers that, but Herrera, for an advanced central midfielder a.k.a. #8, has pretty good defensive reading of the game thanks to Bielsa and Valverde. I do agree with you that him alongside Strootman with Blind behind him would be the best approach as you can't expect Herrera to read the game from midfield excellently. However, I would say that he's a better option there than Rooney and Mata whilst reserving di Maria for a winger role under van Gaal's system.

5607~~~
He better book his ideas up, otherwise he'll be strapped to the bench.

5608~~~
He's had a couple of nice touches, but hasn't been influencial enough. Still, a lot better than Rooney who cant find a teammate and Fletcher

5609~~~
erm...

5610~~~
He's not really the kind of combative defender to easily handle the situation. And its certainly a new experience for him. However, if Yeovil tire a bit, he should come into his own more. I think the fullbacks have been the bigger issue in the game though.

5611~~~
Now I know why he always finds himself on the bench, absolutely invisible so far and I didn't even know he was playing until later. Carrick/Blind and even Fellaini just offer more right now, he needs to pick it up second half, we all know his qualities and what he is capable of/

5612~~~
Not been nearly the worst player for us today. And he's still been pretty average overall. Shocking team performance.

5613~~~
He won't be ready for the first team for another year , he's miles of the pace, but he's got a great pass in him

5614~~~
What a goal!!

5615~~~
What a beauty...will do his confidence a world of good

5616~~~
Peach of a goal and some lovely touches earlier on. Him and Wilson the only two United players impressing today.

5617~~~
Gif that shit!

5618~~~
Only if he starts the next game!

Its been my only major annoyance with LvG this season that he hasnt started more games... outside the whole 352 business

5619~~~
Excellent strike but I don't think his overall performance has been anything special - he seems to be playing almost like a #10 when we really need someone linking the defence and creating from deep.

Great goal though, lovely tekkers.

5620~~~
Best player on the pitch today.  Midfield ticks so much more smoother with him on.

5621~~~
You have to be kidding nothing has ticked for our midfield today. Him and Rooney has been very poor they are constantly to far up the pitch when our defenders have the ball. Time and time again when our defenders had the ball there was just a big empty hole in the middle because Rooney and Herrera was stood to far up the pitch.

I like Herrera as a player. He works hard for the team and wins back his fair share of possession. He looks to move ball forward quickly and play the attacking pass. But he's sloppy in possession and gives the ball away too often. Fr a possession based side like LvG is trying to turn us into, that's a cardinal sin. I'm not sure if he'll be a regular if he can't cut that out of his game.

5623~~~
O I'm not saying it was a good midfield performance, for from. But what I meant that Herrera's control and forward passing makes us look a lot more positive. Plus Herrera was getting stuck in and winning challenges, good to see.

You have to remember the midfield had Darren Fletcher in it, which might as well be a big gap anyways, any central midfielder would struggle next to him.

5624~~~
Sloppy at times but still a good performance. I really like him.

5625~~~
He had plenty of good pieces of play, but also gave the ball away too much and had too little influence in the first half. The goal was a piece of magic and overall he was clearly our best midfielder, but things to work on

5626~~~
very average performance riddled with mistakes, masked by a world class goal.

HE is still adjusting to PL football and perhaps LVGs expectations and philosophy.

5627~~~
He was average but his midfield partners were crap.

Looked better when Mata and Di maria were on the pitch

5628~~~
Can't believe how poor he was in the first half. Smashing goal though.

5629~~~
No chance.

Scored a good goal but otherwise he was thoroughly average. Invisible for most of the first half, he came into it a bit towards the end as did most of the team, as Yeovil started to tire, but that isn't a good enough standard.

I would like to see Herrera operating a bit deeper, he plays too much like a #10 and we have a team overloaded with attackers already, but that is up to LVG

5630~~~
Poor today for me.

He looks great when we're in top and he has space but much less so when we're under pressure or struggling to get into a game.

And he gives the ball away far too often.

5631~~~
Only watched the second half, great goal but I thought he was very sloppy today.

5632~~~
Wasn't great, as wasn't the rest of the team, but had a few moments of class that shows why he should be starting games for us. Goal was cherry on top.

5633~~~

5634~~~
He does not seem geared for that. He's not a Carrick.  He seems to be competing with Mata for his place.

5635~~~
You have to take into account that everyone was sloppy and gave the ball away far too much. Rooney was just as guilty of it and Fletcher could only pass to the CBs

5636~~~
The best of a bad bunch. Not great at all, but I prefer to see someone attempting the trickier stuff rather than popping the ball off backwards and passing the buck. 

Still hasn't really settled because of injuries, illness and criminal convictions or whatever but the signs are good.

5637~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You got it right after all!

5638~~~
There seems to be this bizarre division between DM and AM at our club, either you have to be a Carrick or a Mata - what happened to just being a good old central midfielder? Look at Fabregas at Chelsea, he normally plays deep alongside Matic. That is the role I would like to see Herrera in, alongside Carrick or Blind.

5639~~~
ah yes, Chelsea should now be our template in all things.     We don't have a Matic-style player, never mind trying to map Herrera to Fabregas.

5640~~~
what a shot <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

5641~~~
Our best player on the day I thought. Some nice touches and a great goal. Hopefully he can stay injury free and avoid jail from here on in.

5642~~~
i haven't claimed we should try to emulate Chelsea in all things football, simply that this idea that you must be either a dedicated DM to AM as something unique to our club/fans. I was excited when we bought Herrera because I saw him as a proper #8, a rounded, box to box, technical CM. I don't think we are seeing that from him thus far this season.

5643~~~
Who would have thought he would score that many goals, at least that is a quality we have been lacking from midfield. Needs to reduce his sloppy passes

5644~~~
Fantastic shot but didn't really play that well today. Though as usual, he steps it up when Mata's on the field <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5645~~~
I really like Herrera but he is too slack on the ball too often. He really needs to cut those lapse moments out of his game.

5646~~~
Excellent goal but aside from that he was atrocious.

5647~~~
Very good touches in the first half, very good goal in the second, then lost the ball a lot.

Still, think we need him playing as much as possible, he speeds up the tempo in midfield and links well with our best attackers.

5648~~~
Our play is a lot better with him in the team,he's excellent at finding spaces and then passing and moving. He also brings a goal threat from midfield. However I agree with some comments that he is sloppy at times, he needs to keep his concentration.

5649~~~
That goal should notch his self confidence a level or two.

5650~~~
He has the talent, needs to be stronger on the ball to play the box-to-box/creative role in English football.

5651~~~
I thought he was awful today, goal aside.

5652~~~
Like most the others today his passing wasn't up to scratch but thought he had more decent moments than others on the ball. I'd like to see him in the team going forward, think he just adds a lot with him comfort picking up the ball accross the pitch and movement. But I think it's hard to see where he'll fit in as looks like he needs to displace Rooney from the team, particularly with ADM back.

5653~~~
Hopefully this proves Rooney is not a midfielder and Fletcher should never start again.

5654~~~
Really nice goal but his passing and touch were pretty sloppy most of the time and he didn't win much in the 50/50 challenges.

5655~~~
Yeah we need him playing deeper but only if he cuts out the sloppiness that is prevailing in his game.

5656~~~
Yeah, I've found that a bit off too

5657~~~
Great goal, but I thought he was disappointing otherwise. He switched off a number of times, and played some very loose passes, the kind for which more clinical opponents would make us pay.

5658~~~
Indeed.

5659~~~
I thought he was one of our least shit players. 

Still a bit shit, just, not as shit as the others, so that's good, right?

5660~~~
Side note: how in the hell did he get a booking for that celebration? One of their players held one of ours in a bear-hug for like 3 seconds (can't remember which one of our players it was) and the ref didn't bother carding him (Owen made a point of saying that it was a shocking decision,) but Herrera gets a yellow for celebrating with the travelling support?

5661~~~
Average and then a brilliant goal is probably more then enough for MotM today, if you don't include the subs really.

5662~~~
He was in turns utter rubbish and pretty good but he scored an incredible goal so I'll give him a 7.

5663~~~
It was Herrera to add insult to injury.

5664~~~
Yeah, that does add to it. I mean, I cannot for the life of me see why he would get booked for that. He didn't remove his shirt nor did he swear into the camera.

5665~~~
His face after Fletcher told him about the card really says it all. When they showed him, his pure surprise and disappointment, I thought for a second that his goal was somehow disallowed and Fletcher just told him about it. Shocking, absolutely shocking decision.

5666~~~
Yeah me too. I thought it was a late offside call (not that it would have made sense given where he was when he scored, but still.)

5667~~~
It was a brilliant goal but I thought his overall performance was quite poor. He started brilliantly this season but appeared to fade the closer we got to Christmas, much like di Maria. It could be down to the fact he isn't used to playing through the winter period, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

5668~~~
Cracking goal, not much else

5669~~~
Delighted for him. Quickly becoming one of my favourite players.

5670~~~
Maybe more to do with the pace of the PL. He will get used to that. He looked rather flushed at the end of the game but it is 90 minutes under his belt.

5671~~~
It ended up enough, or it could have been embarassing.

5672~~~
Lovely goal. Not at his best by a distance but generally I do think we tick over much better passing wise when he is in the side.

Another who needs to stay fit to build up some form and consistency.

5673~~~
Fair summary. His midfield partners in the first half didn't cover themselves in glory either and at least in the second half, he got better.

I honestly have no idea what the instructions to Rooney and Herrera were though. Where were they supposed to be on the field? We hear that LvG stops training matches at regular intervals to order players back to the correct position because he takes precision seriously. I just wish it was more visible in matches.

5674~~~
great goal, a bit of a meh performance like many others.

5675~~~
This was our biggest problem today the huge gap  between those two and Fletcher was the reason we constantly had to hoof it in the first half. They became a little bit better in the second half and started dropping deeper to collect the ball but we need a proper central midfielder in there.

5676~~~

5679~~~
A few class touches and turns plus a fantastic goal, but played a few too many misplaced passes and lost possession more often than I'd like. Still he was our best player today - says how bad the rest were. I have no doubts though that we'd need him to start every game to inject some urgency into our game. Our best midfielder IMO.

5680~~~
What was he booked for? Celebrating with the fans? Is that against the rules now?

5681~~~
Yeah it was for the celebration, utterly ridiculous decision. Hopefully it doesn't screw us over in the future somehow.

5682~~~
Outside of the goal he was alright.  Could've made better decisions with the ball, certainly.  I also don't understand why he didn't pass to McNair late in the game when he had at least two open runs on the wing and could've shot or at least put in a cross.

5683~~~
He didn't jump into the fans or anything. Absolutely nuts.

5684~~~
I don't get what was wrong with the celebration. He didn't leave the field of play. He wasn't goading infront of the opposing fans. Daft decision.

5685~~~
Decent game from Herrera after another spell off the team, but he looked quite sloppy in possession. His passing was pretty good, and he made us play with pace and drive, but he's often unaware of his surrounding when on the ball. It's as if he's still adjusting to the pace and aggression of the English game. English teams will not give him the space in midfield that Spanish players give him. I'm sure he'll get used to it when he plays more regularly.

In the second half, his positioning improved quite a bit when we switched to a diamond formation. He was more involved and influential, and the whole team looked better as well with that change in the shape.

5686~~~

5687~~~
"Herrera is class."
You can tell he's developing his language skills, we'll make a Manc of LvG yet. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5688~~~
I just think more and more about us acquiring some defensive specialist to midfield. When we stop with this bullshit playing Rooney as b2b where he can do the job and push him forward to that 10 role where he had his best games this season and play again with Herrera - diMaría as two b2b, we have got tremendous power, energy and creativity in midfield and the only think we need is someone who will cover for these players someone who will disrupt other teams' attacks and who will be as physical presence to the team, who can actually close the gap between defense and midfield as Fletcher today couldn't do it and Carrick even a great passer and solid reader of the game is neither up to the top tempo of the top game no more... I don't think we need play maker. It will be difficult to get someone like Matic as I personally don't know any similar player to him who is very solid defensively and actually can play the ball really well.. but maybe someone like Wanyama type of player would make us a better team as we have got so many creative players. Look at Herrera - his best position is as 8 but the less he goes to help the defense the more he can score goals like today and he is creative in final third as well as great poacher imo as is for example mata who provides very little energy, tho. But even he could be used more often if we get this kind of player.. I think he is now used a lot because of injuries but with Mata and Herrera back he will be benched imo although he was quite decent last couple of games..

5689~~~
We've been crying out for someone to score the types of goals he's been scoring for us since he joined. We've been crying out for a chancer coming in from a midfield role.

Given the injuries, 'illness' and this investigation into match fixing, he's obviously not managed to get any rhythm in the team - but I do hope his return along with Di Maria can ignite a spark in the team and turn these draws into wins.

He's by no means a silky 95% pass rate Xavi sort of player, but he's a proper little bastard who gets stuck in, forces it without the need for major hollywoodness and he's proving to be quite effective when it comes to goals and chances created.

5690~~~
Fecking outrageous he got booked when the cnut who blatantly rugby tackled him got off scott free. Getting a pit pissed off with the refereeing this season.

Great comment from Van Gaal. Pleased to see he rates him.

5691~~~
Great comments from the manager, that should settle any concerns we have that he doesn't like Ander. Now lets just hope he puts him in the team more often to back it up

5692~~~
Try to brake your posts into paragraphs cause this is hard to read like this. Although I do agree with a lot of points. 
Didnt understand who is used a lot, Carrick?

5693~~~
As I mentioned before, I don't think he was great today, but it's certainly pleasing to see that LVG rates him. If Herrera starts performing consistently, it will be a huge benefit in the stretch run.

5694~~~
Aye, that was stupid outrageous that that fella never got booked <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Can't help but laugh at some of the refereeing decisions this season.

5695~~~
It was the look on the poor lads face when he realised he had been booked. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5696~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Feck, for a few seconds my hart went racing because I actually feared the goal was disallowed or something.

5697~~~
That's what I thought as well. I would have thrown something through the TV if it had. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5698~~~
Aye, it was one of those days when nothing would have surprised me tbh.

5699~~~
So much for the 'LVG will sell him to Bayern' bullshit I hope, great goal today.

5700~~~
Thought he did well and it was a brilliant goal. Loved his celebration he has so much passion so it's disappointing he got booked. It was a great moment for the fans and player and don't really understand it. We don't need football being such a sterile product it wasn't causing anyone any harm.

5701~~~
Seems like a great lad. Loved his celebration. You can see he loves life at Manchester United and the goals meant a lot to him.

5702~~~
Quality goal, did he really get booked for his celebration? Personally I don't think he did anything wrong.

5703~~~
I meant Mata but it will be actually tough call between Blind and Carrick once Daley is back. I would rather go for Blind tbh, he is fresh still young and quite more aggressive than Carras..

but as I said I do hope that we buy someone else to this position, someone quality who would start for example for Bayern or Real in champions league final..

5704~~~
I've never noticed your username before, m1y2, but you're absolutely spot on.  I've bolded the entire post to encourage fellow caftards to read it.

The one massive hole in the squad right now is a genuine ball-winning, cape-wearing, cock-wielding defensive midfielder with excellent ball skills.  Names?

5705~~~
Quality goal, basically from just a loose bouncing ball as well. I don't get why he was carded, fairly sure players do that every second goal.

Beyond the goal, I didn't think he played that well though. Got caught out and lost possession quite a few times. Saying that he was one of the few players that looked to turn towards goal when under pressure from another player. Everyone else simply turned away and played an overly safe pass. Where Herrera looked to move the ball forward still and keep things flowing, which is great to see as it is something that is badly lacking in this team.

5706~~~
Very good goal, his first touch is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Looses his concentration often though, simple passes goes to the opposition which you just cannott afford at highest level.

I don't think he is LvG's type of #8, he wants a box-to-box player with alot of aggression and physicality like Vidal/Strootman/Nainggolan/Fellaini/Khedira, Herrera has some of the aggression, but he isn't physical enough.

He is ideal as the the #10 in a midfield three, the issue there is we have alot of players in that position, so it's going to be interesting seeing what place he has in this team over the next year.

5707~~~
Didn't  have a good game but he's the closest of what people expecting from a ManUtd Midfielder right now. Possession football & English football don't really suit him but there is still room for improvement. I'd favour him over Rooney Mata Fellaini any day of the week.

5708~~~
From what I've seen of him I think Strootman is the answer although he recently got back from injury and hasnt been playing that much.

5709~~~
He did ok, certainly brought some urgency into our game and kept the ball on the floor. You could see that he ran out of gas in the last 15mins when he started to give away too many balls. In a perfect world, he would have been substituted I guess.

I orefer that he plays in midfield and behind the no.10 and hope this is where he will start next game

5710~~~
And Dunk from Brighton wasn't booked for the same goal celebration against Brentford on Saturday
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbemNPQ5Tis?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

5711~~~
Herrera had a rough game overall, but his goal was pure class.  Except for getting caught in possession at one point,  I thought he picked up his game after the goal.  As for the booking, I didn't see a single thing he did that was out of order.  Is it possible he yelled an obscenity at some point that none of us watching on TV could hear?

5712~~~
Even if he did yell an obscenity, there's no way a referee would book a player for that given the large amount of vile language they get from players every match.

5713~~~
Didn't Rooney get a red card or some kind of serious retrospective punishment for screaming obscenities after a goal a few seasons ago?

That said, it would be completely out character for Herrera to scream obscenities.  I'm just searching for something that we're all missing.

5714~~~
Usually "feck off!" gets a pass while "feck you!" gets a card. My guess is the ref thought he went over the advertising sign into the crowd and not just up to it

5715~~~
From what the commentator said, he kicked the advertising boards.

5716~~~
Not a red card, but he was punished for screaming obscene language at the camera after scoring against West Ham away from home in the 2010/11 season, which is different from what Herrera would have done.

And from what I've seen of the Brentford vs. Brighton highlights, a Brighton player kicked the ad board in that match as well when the ball was out of play and he didn't get a yellow.

This is my guess as well, but it's stupid to see how players aren't allowed to do that at all. I understand that referees want the players to be safe and not risk fans from suffocating each other to reach the player, but still, what's so bad about that?

5717~~~
I think the yellow was for kicking the ad board.
Anyway I think Herrera had a decent game. Lost the ball too many times but I liked how he tried to constantly create a speedy chance. The goal was superb.

I think Ander is close to what we have been missing in the midfield: creativity and attack minded style of play.
Just a pinch of aggressiveness and a few pounds of added muscle and he'll be great.

5718~~~

5719~~~
He's a squad player now.

5720~~~
Shocking isn't it? If he does really become one here, he should look to leave at the end of the season. He's too good a player to be a squad player here.

5721~~~
Don't say that! You're overrating him!!

5722~~~
A shame. One of the few players who looks to take risks with his passing, isn't afraid to get stuck in and has a goal in him from midfield and he's just a squad player. Should be starting.

5723~~~
I know you're being sarcastic but he is over rating him if he thinks he's too good to be a squad player.

5724~~~
Agreed.  Shocking management by Louis to drop the midfielder, play another midfielder out of position and play a striker out of position...all in the service of grim performances.

5725~~~
I wouldn't be too shocked if this guys returns to Spain in a year or two. It really wouldn't surprise me.

5726~~~
I'd like to see him get a start sometime soon, don't think he has a claim on being a starter though. Form is hugely exaggerated by many.

5727~~~
Our best central midfielder should be a squad player?

5728~~~
He isn't our best CM. To be honest in terms of form he has shown IMO he is about 4th.

5729~~~
He's our best CM. There's nothing overrating about him in saying he's better than the rest of our options. What could be overrating is saying he's one of the best in the league already.

5730~~~
He's not our best CM - that'd be Carrick, followed by Blind - at least based on this season's evidence. That being said, I'd rather have him in CM than Rooney

5731~~~
It's Manchester United, technically they are all squad players. He's better being here than some shit side.

5732~~~
Only Blind has been better this season, and even then, semantics but he's a holding midfielder. He's not his competition.

5733~~~
That's exactly how it can't be argued. Our current midfield state isn't what you often see or want to see at United. He should be starting more games than he is really. I'm pretty sure he'd rather be a starter in a "lesser" side than warm the bench here.

5734~~~
Whoever pushed/approved for his signing should be sacked. What a complete waste of money.

5735~~~
Really? I don't like Rooney in midfield but he's had a better season than Herrera so far and he's played midfield for the most part. Fellaini has probably been just as good too imo. Di Maria has been better than him when played in midfield too.

5736~~~
I took it more to mean that he thinks Ander Herrera should be a guaranteed starter for you regardless of competition.

I agree he should be first choice at the minute but long term he should really only be a squad player, that's all he'd be at every other top club.

5737~~~
As soon as LvG realises that you need to play midfielders in midfield to have a well-balance and well-oiled midfield, he'll be starting again. But Fellaini is ahead of him in the pecking order right now, and rightfully so. Having said that, was harsh to drop Herrera after the cup game. He wasn't at his best in that game but it warranted another start.

5738~~~
Based on few games you saw him at United?

5739~~~
No, based on the many games I watched him play for Athletic Club and Zaragoza.

5740~~~
if Herrera would play, Mata would be a squad player or Falcao. He is just not the player van Gaal wants in a midfield, Rooney fits better at the moment. At the latest when Strootman arrives, he will be on the bench for most games.

5741~~~
It's easy to say Rooney's been better than Herrera there on the whole, but that's mostly b/c of the mins he got there. Others, just no. Herrera has simply been a level above the rest in the limited time he got there.

5742~~~
And you missed those games when he was dominating against Barca's and Real Madrid's top midfields?

5743~~~
He actually doesn't.

5744~~~
I disagree, I don't think he's been a level above anyone tbh. I actually think he's been poor in as many games as he's been good.

5745~~~
not for us, but for van Gaal

5746~~~
Indeed, and I find that worrying tbh.

5747~~~
Interesting how people dismissed his absences earlier in the season as being down to injury. It seems pretty obvious to me that LVG doesn't rate him, or at least he wants something different in there.

5748~~~
No, I didn't miss them. I just don't think playing well against a few big sides (dominating is an exaggeration) should outweigh his patchy form for a few straight seasons, especially when he played further back in midfield. He was benched in spells at Athletic Club so I find it baffling to expect him to be more than a squad player at your club.

5749~~~
Please mod, change my tag to "hates Herrera on the bench".

5750~~~
Yeah I think that much is obvious now, but I still find it baffling, there seemed to be a lot of promise in his performances.

5751~~~
Then why did he buy him? We massively overpaid for him anyway - which is somewhat acceptable if he really wanted/needed him. But he's basically paid 30m for a squad player now. It's worse than the Fellaini signing.

5752~~~
Been obvious for a while. Only now that so many caftards are turning on Van Gaal is it being recognised. The cognitive dissonance was too much before Xmas.

5753~~~
Well, he was regulary playing good against top sides, so there is obviously very good midfielder there. Also, he is 25.

5754~~~
Ander Herrera is a much better midfielder than Wayne will ever be, just like Wayne is a striker that Ander will never be. No need to try fitting square pegs in round holes, especially when you have square and round ones of both.

5755~~~
In this team he'd be a better fit in midfield than Rooney. If LVG doesn't rate Rooney as the main striker, he needs to take him out the midfield because he's not very good there, and we have a box to box all rounder like Herrera missing out again.

5756~~~
No idea. Earlier in the season I made the point that I couldn't really understand the fact we seemed to be using the scouting of a manager we deemed to be not good enough.

5757~~~
He was a target prior to Moyes

5758~~~
Really surprised that Fellaini and Herrera havent been getting some more starts after our recent poor performances.

5759~~~
poor guy

5760~~~
Didn't give the ball away today, progress.

5761~~~
Did well today.

5762~~~
Herrera > Rooney in midfield. Pity the captain always plays

5763~~~
He'd get a game next week. Needs to take his chance.

But rather have him in midfield than Rooney.

5764~~~
I think he felt a bit like you do when the ugliest girl out of the group rejects you but you just keep flirting to save face.

5765~~~
Brilliant cameo, did nothing wrong.

In all seriousness, hope he starts the next match.

5766~~~
Why is he not getting game time? Does he still have a niggling injury or does LVG see him behind Fellaini/Carrick/Blind? I think he should take the place of one of Carrick/Blind. Too similar and slow.

5767~~~
First touch was fantastic.. Wait 


In a serios note he should start in midfield in front of Rooney

5768~~~
Could be the case that LVG just doesn't rate him and doesn't see a place for him in his current side, which would be a shame since he looks like an excellent talent.

5769~~~
If today's an example of how LvG wants the midfield to play, there's no point having Herrera, not even in the squad. Our midfield were useless in the first half, almost non-existent after we scored. If that's what LvG wants, Ander needs a new club. He's not passive enough for pointless possession, nor for over-anxious get-rid defending.

5770~~~
Maybe he does, but that sort of fee and those sort of wages, he might just have to play the lad and he might be surprised. He judges people far too quickly for my liking.

5771~~~
We need to go back to 433/4231 and play him as the creative mid besides Carrick or Blind with Rooney or Mata at 10. 

We are wasting him because of stupid formations and "philosophies".

5772~~~
For a side in desperate need of some forceful creativity, it's baffling how underused Herrera is.

He hasn't been outstandingly brilliant, but with enough time he's produced something more often than not. Right now end product is the biggest concern (because the football itself has been dry for a long time). 

Slowly becoming a waste of £30m if we wanted a patient and sensible midfielder. He was always meant to be the little bastard who did a lot of running, a lot of passing and moving and a lot of getting in faces. If LVG doesn't want that type of player, why sanction it?

5773~~~
Think he will get games anyway, because Rooney and Carrick will be shot well before the end of the season. It usually happens. I know he trusts them, but he is rotating the squad in the wrong places. They are important and we might just need them at their best towards the end.

5774~~~
If he could get the quality in defence he will probably play. The fact that we haven't done that is the crime here.

5775~~~
Can a Di Maria - Herrera midfield work?

LVG may think it might be too weak defensively, maybe he'll start using it more once United get some better defenders in.

5776~~~
Both take too many risks on the ball - i.e they want to pass the ball with some fluidity and not back pass three quarters of their passes.

5777~~~
As long as LVG remains our manager, I can't see things ending well for Hererra. Brought on in the last second today, feck me.

5778~~~
I think for all this 3-5-2 he is annoyed that the defence is so brittle and he knows he should be playing free flowing football. I actually think he is annoyed that he is having to play it and defend the fact every week. I bet he didn't realise he had inherited a defence made out of crystal. I think there will be big changes there next season. Another good DM and things should fall into place. Maybe another striker as well.

5779~~~
If we had good defenders that wouldn't be a problem. We have a dodgy defence, so at the moment it is a problem. You could then take risks at times. They don't take as many as people think. The defence take more risks, how is that good. I would rather we took risks round the opposition penalty area, than round our own.

5780~~~
Herrera has been like Mata since we signed him, has world class touches but is not emposing or strong enough to get involved enough. He looks way too lightweight. I just don't see a future here for Herrera unless he improves tenfold by next season

5781~~~
He might just have to hang in there then, cannot see LvG being long term, so Ander might just have to plod along. We have had plenty of those over the years.

5782~~~
I don't think the risks they take are necessarily in the passes themselves - they won't just try Hollywood balls for example, but the tempo, the speed, and the weighting they put on a pass to try and up the gear from a very slow possession based period we tend to play when on the ball can be risky as not many of the other players seem to be aware or able to play in such a way. I'm not his biggest fan, but Mata is probably the only other one who can - mainly because of his immaculate first touch. But normally RE: Mata, that's when Ander is on the field. Otherwise, he seems content to play safe for most of the game.

5783~~~
If Van Gaal wants balance then he should play Herrera and bench one of our superstars imo.

5784~~~
--------------Carrick

----Herrara-----------Fellaini/Blind----

--------------Di Maria

-----Rooney------------Falcao

5785~~~
The guy will make way for Strootman in the pecking order at least.

5786~~~
Yep.

Problem solved. Plus bonus points for using the Christmas tree formation.

5787~~~
Mata and Herrera play well together. Mata said that. Also saying Herrera can't look after himself. I seem to remember the second goal against West Ham came about from him going in and winning the ball. He can put himself about and can take a tackle. So that is rubbish. He does up the pace of the game, other teams don't like that. Play it slow and they just pack the defence and let you get on with it. Pass and move and the defence has to move about. We get into the CL and play like we are now, we won't get out of the group.

5788~~~
Agreed. I've always had a soft spot for LVG since he was manager for Barca when I first started watching the spanish footy on sky. The idea that he would willingly set out a team to be defensive is bizarre, particularly at a club like United who have such an attacking philosophy too. However I think he knows that more important than attractive football right now is getting into the top 4 and getting the team used to winning.

5789~~~
I think he'd be great in a 4-3-3 with Di Maria and Carrick/Blind. It's shame we have an overload of central attacking players and not enough quality wide players to make that formation feasible until next year. Unless we move to a 4-3-3 I don't see him getting much game time, which is unfortunate as I like him.

5790~~~
I think if he gets the players he wants, we will see better football next season and plenty of games for everyone. The only players going will be some of our defender, who I actually think he is losing patience with, I actually worry about Shaw there as well, and ones like Fletcher/Anderson and the guys out on loan. He will not want to change any more than that or it will create it's own problems.

5791~~~
I think we will move to that, but it might be next season. He has got to get us into the CL this season. The defence has let him down with their injuries which has made it a necessity to play 3-5-2 rather than wanting to play it.

5792~~~
I reckon he could be off at the end of season. Clear as a day that van Gaal doesn't really rate him and if we can receive a good offer from Valencia/Atletico for instance I am convinced we will offload him. Shame because I really like him but it's just not going to work, he has been frozen since Stoke game and it's not going to change by the look of it.

5793~~~
my thoughts too. He will probably be sold if we get a decent offer.

5794~~~
I think hes a perfect United player, attacking, combative, aggressive, and can pass and score 

Being criminally underused

5795~~~
If there were problems with him and the manager, we would have heard somehow. He looked overjoyed when Fellaini scored. Players who have the hump usually just sit there. Like Jonny Evans.

5796~~~
That would cause a logical outrage far more reasonable then after selling Welbeck.

Can't imagine aggressive and dynamic side of United without this lad, right now.

5797~~~
One of the reason why we look so poor is leaving him out and playing Rooney in midfield, Rooney isnt creative and not reallu sound in short spaces with an abysmal touch, we've sacrificed football for the immense work rate of Roo, but I just dont think it's worth it. Above that, he has goals in him, assists, works hard, can tackle and brings energy, would have him above Mata, who has been doing okay recently but needs to do a lot more, created one chance in 45 min, just not enough.

5798~~~
LvG might see it that way as well. Who knows the workings of his mind.

5799~~~
He's not going to be sold, that's just nonsense. He's not an automatic starter for Van Gaal because we have a lot of other class players, but he still gets plenty of appearances. He's a squad player who rotates in and around the team, sometimes starting, sometimes used as a sub. Just cause in recent years our quality of squad player was the likes of Cleverley and Fletcher, doesn't mean that's what it will always be. To be a better team we have to increase the quality of the whole squad to not feel the absence of players when they pick up injuries.

5800~~~
Bringing him on as a sub with 15 seconds to go was humiliating. I can't understand anything LVG does.

5801~~~
Exactly, we need a squad that you could all class as first teamers elsewhere. Two first teams. We have started the process this season and will continue in the summer. He will not sell any of the new players, but the players who were already here will be worried, which to be honest shows in some of their performances. I don't think we will sign Falcao either and RvP isn't a certainty to me. This is the first time we have had a quality midfielder and we ain't selling him. Fletcher will go I think and god help us Anderson, just buy him out.

5802~~~
To honest I'm not too fussed over him not starting, but rather him being left out because Rooney is taking up his spot in midfield. If it was Fellaini in there then I could understand it because he has played well when picked this season and is an actual midfielder but even he couldn't make it into the starting line up. Makes me think Van Gaal doesn't actually have that much of an issue with Herrera, he's just easier to drop than some of the other players.

5803~~~
It was an odd one. I doubt he did it to humiliate the boy. I don't think he would do that. Just lost his marble for a moment.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5804~~~
Ander didn't look happy.

5805~~~
He's in direct competition  with Rooney, Di Maria and Mata for 2 spots in the the starting eleven so you guys shouldn't be to harsh on him for not starting, those 3 are pretty descent players.

5806~~~
Really. I will look at it again. He will have to just show character and not let it bother him. If he plays against Cambridge, I would be amazed if he doesn't. Just go out and perform well.

5807~~~
He's in competition for Rooney in the wrong position that's the trouble.

5808~~~
People forget that players coming on for a 15 second cameo is a few thousand extra on their appearance fee bonuses.

5809~~~
I'd be hugging the manager then.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5810~~~
There is NO reason for Rooney to play instead of Herrera, no reason, as there is no reason for di Maria to play instead of Rooney. 

With for midfielders, they all have they place in the team, with five also mostly. Just this 3 man midfield sh*t is which is causing all the problems.

5811~~~
If you are talking about Rooney in the number 10 position I don't agree he is a very good 10 so I don't think that would be his wrong position. But I asume you mean Rooney in a central midfield role and I do agree that Rooney should play further up the pitch but neither do I think Herrera should play in central midfield in the 3-5-2 formation as his defensive work rate is not good enough. But if we play the diamond which we should in my opinion Herrera would be very well suited as a central midfielder if played next to a more defensive player like Fellaini.

5812~~~
I wonder if we should have two upfront as well. Not sure. If he wants Rooney slightly back, only have one striker. If he wants to be safer 4 at the back and pack the midfield with mainly midfielders.

5813~~~
I actually think Herrera believes he is a number 8. It is LvG again who is trying to put players into little boxes and getting them wrong. As you say all you need to do is put somebody a bit more robust next to him. It isn't as though he contributes nothing to the defensive side. Crikey, Scholes was a bloody liability in that department. It isn't everything.

5814~~~
He's already in prison, except it's in Manchester instead of Spain.

5815~~~
I would play with only one striker and Rooney as a SS, like against QPR the first game. There Rooney could help the midfield a bit, but still be dangerous enough.

If LVG is afraid becaus of our balance, then Blind a Carrick can play in midfield, with Herrera/Mata/Rooney and di Maria on the wing and proper FBs, and some people on the bench.

Are biggest problem is that LVG has to play Rooney, RVP and another striker and that doesn't work. He has to be ready to drop Rooney, RVP, di Maria on the bench to be able to have a balanced team.

5816~~~
So he is going to have to show these famous balls. He just seems to sail close to the wind sometimes. As though he loves doing it wrong to then try to put it right and make himself look like a genius.

5817~~~
What I don't understand. In first half of the season, 2, or 3 times he subbed Herrera ON and then said the we improved.

Then against Yeovil Herrera play badly, Mata comes in and we play better.

So why not start them together?

Our problems are the numbers in midfield and the player positions (where they play on wrong positions), sometimes both and both of these things are a problem because he wants some player to play no matter what.

I don't think that we would have been at all successful if our best CM was of Rooney's quality or strike of ADM's quality, so why force it now?

5818~~~
I wonder how long Rooney will be happy if his  non-goalscoring in the league goes on. He is a striker and likes the glory of scoring. It must be frustrating for him to see Mata/Falcao missing the chances they did.

5819~~~
You're doing your possible to bring that term into vogue on the Cafe, Pogue.

I hope you succeed. Think what would happen if pundits starting using it on TV. The image of the game would be transformed - no more cloth cap.

5820~~~
I think he may go back to Spain in the summer.....

5821~~~
van Gaal didn't target Herrera or Di Maria. Hence him not knowing how he wants to use them. Di Maria quite literally <i>has </i>to play though, whereas Herrera doesn't.
It's a shame. Herrera's not the type of guy (from what I've seen/read of him) who'll stick around for long just because we're United if he isn't being used properly.

I think he'll be back in Spain within a couple of seasons.

I Can understand the club giving van Gaal Di Maria to work with (we needed a marquee signing) but I'm not actually sure of the mechanics of the Herrera transfer. 

Obviously there's got be a balance between letting every manager sign their own targets and forcing players on them. But it looks like we've spent £30 million on a player the manager wouldn't have bought given £30 million to spend.

5822~~~
I agree. For me, it's inconceivable that LVG has not realized that Rooney's behind should be moved up front while Herrera has been bought on purpose to give that energy in midfield and those cutting-edge passes. It's not worth looking elsewhere for an explanation as to why we don't have a spark in midfield while Rooney is doing shit in that position.

5823~~~
Erm....he was injured! He had a broken rib. We tried to play him in the West Brom game with some protection in the rib area and he was awful.

5824~~~
Eh?

You're not seriously suggesting that both Di Maria and Herrera were bought by Woodward/The Club without Van Gaal assessing and confirming them before hand?

5825~~~
No. They consulted him, but he's not going to say <i>no </i>to quality being added, and I don't think he would have had much choice anyway.
The club needed a marquee signing, and he's not going to turn down Di Maria, even if he doesn't know what he wants to do with him. Or even if he doesn't fit his idea of a midfielder.

But give van Gaal £80 million and he's not buying Herrera and Di Maria, in my opinion.

I'm not saying that he was against signing them, but that he wasn't particularly pro-signing them. And it's bringing about a few issues now.

5826~~~
yes, but there was a period after that where he was in the squad, but didnt even get subbed on for 5 or 6 games. I dont know how long he didnt play after that west brom game, but it was a long time.

5827~~~
[QUOTE"Ole's_toe_poke, post: 16984518, member: 40797"]--------------Carrick

----Herrara-----------Fellaini/Blind----

--------------Di Maria

-----Rooney------------Falcao[/QUOTE]

I wouldn't mind that at all. This is more or less the same but I'd prefer this

Basically players in their best roles more or less.

Di Maria in his favoured LCM role where he has the freedom to drop deep, buzz around the pitch, drive down the left flank and contribute to the midfield with his industry.

Basically I would love to keep his starting position as further away from the forward line as much as possible in our current team. Don't get me wrong, he's versatile and can play in various forward positions successfully but only when he has players like Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema peeling off players, making decoy runs and dragging defenders away, making space for him.

It's never going to work for Di Maria now with our turgid build up and slower forwards. Mainly and obviously because he's never going to thrive with his back to goal and being heavily man marked, due to his physique.

Secondly and more importantly, his dribbling style. He's the type of dribbler who has outrageous pace and is brilliant with the ball at full pelt. He's not so much a great dribbler from a standstill, jinxing past players like Messi or Iniesta. In fact you'd see some players stop the ball in the middle of the run and jinx past the same player again because they don't have enough pace to carry on. Not Di Maria, he's got outrageous pace and exceptional ball control at top speed.

That's not to say he can't dribble from  a standstill, just that he's harder to contain when dribbling at top speed rather than from a standstill.

You need to exploit his drive and provide him with the space (not that much, he reaches top speed in a very short time) to gain that momentum which makes him a genuine threat. No surprise that he played best in the midfield role (where he operated in less congested areas and had a free license to roam) and not in the forward roles where he was easily stifled in crowded areas via man marking.

Fellaini to do his defensive box to box role and Carrick being the holding mid. Di Maria is brilliant out wide and Herrera is proficient in wider areas, as evidenced by his displays in the diamond earlier in the season. So no real problem about a lack of width or cover for FBs as both of them are very hardworking.

Might seem unbalanced and over attacking to some but this is where Rooney as a second striker, his best position, comes in. He can easily cover for the midfield runners by dropping back when necessary. Imo, he should always be used in a role which utilizes his goalscoring ability, hold up play and link up play first and foremost and then his industry and passing range. Never the other way around.

Herrera being underutilized so far has been dissapointing to say the least. I understand that LVG wants to build a possession based team and Herrera's passing has been iffy at times. Granted he's also been overrated by some here (including me) but LVG must surely know that even in such a system, you need players who can up the tempo with a quick one two, quick give and go football etc.

How many players in our team can do this? Di Maria (like he did early on in the season) but he's shackled in his forward/winger role nowadays and ..... Even uber possession based teams need someone like an Iniesta/Neeskens to quicken the tempo at the right time or else you are forever going to be stuck on the first gear, aimlessly passing the ball around for the sake of it, like we are at the moment.

Herrera has the capability to play this role with his high tempo game and typical Spanish give and go football combined with mobility. Admittedly, he hasn't set the world alight with some of his performances but we really haven't seen the best of him yet. IMO he hasn't got enough chances to show it as well. His type of football could quite possibly be the remedy to the turgid football which we are playing now, which is why many rate his importance to the team very highly (to the point that some might feel he's overrated).

5828~~~
If he is trying to force the boy to go by humiliating him, then it is despicable. As I said he would be great in our midfield if LvG would stop being so bloody stubborn. It will bite him on the bum in the end. In his mind he is convinced he will win the league with us. I don't think we will, we will compete, but his stubborness will prevent any more than that. He won't actively come out and say he is wrong. He chooses the wrong team, has to alter it and then want praise for getting it wrong in the first place, not saying actually I got it wrong, he will say that the players were doing it right, so I had to alter it. As it has been said before his record in the market isn't great. So if he then sells Herrera and bombs out Shaw, but then pursues two players who have had long term injuries I will be very suspicious of his buying abilities.

5829~~~
Yeah he should play more but some of the posts here are hilarious. 

LVG isnt humilating him and Herrera wont leave United after one season. And no, he isnt in a prison already. 

My god.

5830~~~
I was only saying that because someone else thought that. The prison thing astounded me rather. I don't think he will go, I hope not anyway. Just stick it out and see what happen next season as there will be more games, heres hoping. Everyone will get playing time. More games then maybe the formation can be changed more depending on what is needed.

5831~~~
Yeah, no need to go all paranoia just because he isnt a starter..

5832~~~
My tagline is summing me up at the moment. I will be glad when the season is over, we are in the Top 4 and everyone is happy and maybe an F.A. Cup win. Preferably preventing Stevie Gee getting a trophy on his birthday. Of course Herrera getting the winner.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5833~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Herrera is a good player and he should play more but this forum sometimes. Every time someone isnt starting or inst a regular it automatically means he's gone. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5834~~~
There are better than him out there, but I doubt he thinks he is the best. We will need that big squad next season, the Capital One Cup knockout has not helped giving players games either. We need to be able to make changes in games without it diminishing our threat. Up to this season it has. Now we have a really strong bench that can either change games or at least maintain the standard.

5835~~~
If we can find a midfielder of the stature of Felliani and the technical ability of Herrera, both will be redundant over night. Felliani has improved more in his ability than Herrera who imo is still coming to terms with the physicality and pace of the league.....and that's why he's playing more games

5836~~~
Of course. But then he spent, what, 6 games on the bench just about injured enough not to get a minute of football but not injured enough to be dropped from the bench in all that time? Right after the WBA game where LVG spoke about realising the need for a physical presence in midfield? Seems fanciful to me, given what we've seen since.

5837~~~
Feck it lets just get #FreeAnder going already.

<a class="username" data-user="60388, @DomesticTadpole" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/60388/">@DomesticTadpole</a> if you are going to be Ander's MadWinger you need to throw in a few more random stats and percentages. Good work so far though, I see the potential in you.

5838~~~
So many people with theories of LvG not rating Herrera or whatever. Maybe he just hasn't been that good? As tough as that is for a lot on here to take. He's not done enough to deserve starting.

5839~~~
Unless you throw Herrera into the fire again and again like any footballer should go through, we can't expect him to show that improvement at all. If anything, it's LVG's stupid obsession with pointless and gutless ball possession that is the main obstacle to any of our players who is willing to take risks.

That late change just to give him only 20 seconds was extremely humiliating.

5840~~~
I want to see some confidence being shown in this lad and for us to encourage him to dictate games.  Criminal use of him atm.

5841~~~
Another case of bad decision making on face value. There's no contests between him and rooney as central midfielders. But Rooney HAS to play of course because "the captain always plays". Which is fine because rooney should play but not OUT OF POSITION.

5842~~~
The diamond would work to a tee for us as it would allow our best attacking players to play in their preferred positions where they actually excel. How can LvG not see that. It also gives us better balance instead of the lopsided 352 which leaves us hopeless in the attacking sense.

5843~~~
What about the Falcao loan? You think LvG didn't want that either since that is also causing us immense issues since he is too big a player to bench regularly. What's happening right now is that I feel LvG is struggling to drop the big names and is not able to fit them all in the preferred positions they want to play in. Dropping someone like Herrera is the easier option.

5844~~~
Can agree to that, not Herrera though.

5845~~~
Nah, we should just put Anderson down. It would be best for all.

5846~~~
Sometimes players have to play out of position due to say injuries, or in tight matches in formation changes, but what we are seeing is LVG shunting out Rooney to midfiled permanently almost

I mean a player with such quality and attributes who is highly effective in the final third, and putting him in midfield where tbh hes pretty shit, makes no sense

Playing Rooney as striker is his best position, plus allowing herrera to play , which will no doubt increase our play by alot

Playing rooney in midfield makes no difference as hes not even good there, when you have a ready made player just wasting on the bench

5847~~~
I suspect part of LVG's issue is that he feels Herrera isn't physically strong enough to hold his own in the centre of an English PL midfield at the moment, which is something that will come with time. He's clearly a more than good enough player technically, but if we're up against it you'd rather the industriousness of Rooney or the presence of Fellaini to keep a bunch of sloggers like QPR under wraps.

5848~~~
First we didn't have good enough midfielders and now when we do we don't play them. What is with us and hating midfielders?

5849~~~
This play is funny at times. He's not being humilated by Van Gaal and he won't return to Spain after one fecking season.

5850~~~
Would you rather bareback Fellaini or Herrera?

5851~~~
Di maria and Herrera should play where di maria and mata are. And rooney where di maria is. Strikers playing as strikers as midfielders as midfielders.

5852~~~
Strikers should play EVERYWHERE*.

* <span style="font-size: 12px">except upfront where we can play midfielders. </span>

5853~~~
So we keep Herrera working things out in training where the intensity is nowhere near what is seen in a real match? I'm sorry, but I just don't believe in that approach. The best way a footballer can adapt and calibrate his play is by having those minutes against genuine opposition.

5854~~~
True, but look at the stick Mata gets on here for being too lightweight, and he's well proven in the PL. I'm certain Herrera will be working hard in the gym and we'll see him getting more minutes once the team learns to defend with a back 4. I'm all for giving him minutes as I'm a big fan of him, but i can see why LVG doesn't want to risk it.

5855~~~
Nice cameo. Is there a way to have a "not rated" option in the ratings in the match day forum if we feel that the player had no real role in the match?

5856~~~
It's a great phrase. One of my favourite.

5857~~~
We have eyes though and most realize that he has been a very useful player and has generally played quite well, bar 1 or 2 games. He's done more then rvp/falcao and some others to start, so that doesn't hold. I understand why he isn't starting every week, with him competing with quite a few others but he's right on the edge imo, or should be at least. 

He hasn't been poor when playing at all though.

5858~~~
Not poor, but certainly has been not as good as Carrick, Blind, Fellaini, Mata, or ADM (when played as a midfielder). And of course with Rooney playing CM he isn't going to get in the team over him.

5859~~~
That's true but they don't play in his position. 

Has he been better than Carrick, Blind and Mata in midfield? I'm not sure he has. Some nice moments and a couple of good performances against really poor opposition but his general level of play has been below other players that play the same position. Hence he's not playing. 

The Rooney in midfield conundrum is an issue, of course but so long as Van Gaal persists with this craziness he shouldn't be dropping Rooney to give Herrera a game.

5860~~~
He will get a game against Cambridge to blew the cobwebs off, then the next game is Leicester who I want us to stuff. Ander is learning to adapt to the physicality and pace of the PL. He has lovely ball control, but I think has been surprised how little time you get on the ball. That will come. After sleeeping on it, we are making far more of the substitution than it merits. If I hadn't had MUTV radio on I wouldn't have realised it had happened. Nobody else seems to be making an issue of it.

5861~~~
That's why I mentioned he isn't an automatic starter, he's done well, nothing amazing but personally I'd rather push Rooney up top, drop rvp/Falcao and play Herrera alongside Carrick, blind, Di maria and mata with fellaini rotating in. Just a normal 4-2-3-1 basically. All those players have shown a lot more then the strikers who don't really fit in at the moment. Never going to happen though. 

Anyways, its not like all the midfielders have been consistently brilliant or even fit. They've all been more or less at the same level so its not so easy to pinpoint the best performer. I definitely understand why he isn't starting all the time, I just don't agree when people say he's been poor or not good enough to start. He's done well, just so have others that he's competing with for the most part.

5862~~~
You and me both.

5863~~~
I think we have got that used to there being no competition in our midfield, the fact Scholes had to come out of retirement, that we are freaking out when someone isn't playing. It's actually a good thing, that we have real quality in there and lots of options with maybe more to come in the summer.

5864~~~
This is the problem with this place. It's not Fellaini or Herrera. Fellaini didn't start yesterday or againt Sotton, did he? They are different players that can play together. It's Rooney right now, and Matat keeping him out of the side, NOT BAREBACK FELLAINI and I hate this question to be honest.

5865~~~
I think it's simply Felliani statue and Herrera's lack of it that's created a problem for him. He's a lovely player but I fear like Kagawa will find himself out of favour.

5866~~~
He is the midfielder the 'Caf wanted, but not the one LVG needed.

5867~~~
I think it's as much the formation that gives him the biggest problem....

5868~~~
Very true.
But that's a crazy suggestion, according to some...
Perhaps, just perhaps, Herrera wouldn't have been a midfielder van Gaal would have chosen to spend £30 million on.

I have doubts over a few of these signings, and whether they actually came in because they truly fit into van Gaal's on-pitch vision...

5869~~~
I just wonder why LVG agreed for his arrival then.

5870~~~
Falcao was pretty much agent politics and a convenient chance to sign a 'Galactico', in my opinion. 
Some will disagree of course.

5871~~~
Well he's a good player. You simply have to 'okay' a deal to sign a good midfielder, and it's almost a no-brainer on the face of it.

I'm not suggesting that he knew he might not be suitable but said "eff it. Sign him anyway". I'm just not convinced that Herrera even enters the equation without him being a club target.

Basically this move was more the club's vision than the manager's, and for a manager as particular as van Gaal (or Mourinho) it's risky.

5872~~~
He has been mostly good when played. He can hardly impress when he is not being given the chance.

5873~~~
The theory that LVG isn't playing him because he might not be the one that signed doesn't hold water in my opinion.

5874~~~
What do you mean by "he might not be the one that signed"?

5875~~~
That he wasn't an LvG buy.

5876~~~
Oh right, thought so.
Well that's not the theory (I assume it's referring to me)

It's not that van Gaal only wants to play his own players out of ego or something, but Herrera doesn't appear to be the type of midfielder he prefers. I'm basing 'the type of midfielder he likes' on a few things.

5877~~~
Perhaps but I still don't think he has been as good as others.

5878~~~
Is he better than what we had last season? That is what matters. Yes he is. You have to have different options to change games, as we are finding with Fellaini. If you only have ones that fit into a certain system, other teams will soon suss you out.

5879~~~
A midfield of Carrick/Blind, Fellaini and Herrera would be better right now. Di Maria infront of them with 2 strikers.

5880~~~
I think this should be introduced if the player came on/went off too early/late. Smalling against somebody a couple weeks back, Di Maria vs Hull(?) Ander last night...

5881~~~
When I saw Rooney go to the left of the diamond yesterday part of me thought 'wherefore not Ander?'

Still, I'm sure he'll get his chance. He's been a bit inhibited since he broke his ribs, barring that game against Hull. However, even when he's at 6 outta 10 level his natural game quickens our pace. We need that.

5882~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/x_pFzevA9R/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

"Entrenamiento terminado , felices por la victoria de ayer // training finished, we are happy to get the 3 points yesterday"

At least he seems happy at United despite his limited appearances.

5883~~~
Let's agree to disagree, IMO he has the best passing range of all our midfielders and has been very good this season. Funnily all our best offensive performances coincide with him being on the pitch (QPR, first 60 minutes versus Leicester, Hull). Fellaini, Blind and Carrick have all been good this season but there is no issue playing two of them alongside Herrera who offers something different.

IMO the main issue with him is he is not Strootman. Van Gaal will try to get rid of him in the Summer and replace him with his favourite.

5884~~~
I know this is not United's problem but as someone who likes Herrera and Athletic Bilbao it's really frustrating that we got one of their best players from them who we are not playing while Athletic are really struggling this season.

5885~~~
We need both of them. The way we have injuries and that likely won't go away, we need as many players as we can get. Strootman has to get to the end of the season yet. He has been linked to us remember, that is the kiss of death.

5886~~~
Rooney looked knackered at one point yesterday and felt Herrera would inject much needed energy in midfield. Don't know what the deal with this guy is but I rate him, LvG doesn't.

5887~~~
Watched them last night, they seem to struggle manufacturing goals and once they go behind, you worry another goal will soon follow. Liked Laporte though.

5888~~~
Hopefully Ander will start the next couple of matches. In a diamond, I reckon the following has the best balance:

Herrera

Di Maria - Fellaini

Carrick

It's plain to see that our play lacks pace, so we should be doing everything possible to integrate Hererra.

5889~~~
Yeah, everyone seems to panic when a player isn't starting all the time and assume he'll be sold. Its useful having top class players to rotate in and out of your team, all other top teams have it.

5890~~~
In the case of Hererra though, there's not any rotation - he's barely featuring.

I don't buy this theory that LvG thinks he's lightweight, because Mata gets enough game time and he's weak as piss.

5891~~~
It's almost insulting to call that rotation. I haven't seen LVG pulling out his main players for some of those guys who are eager to make a difference off the bench. Someone mentioned Rooney looked tired yesterday after spending his time in an unfamiliar position and yet was not pulled out, so questions have to be asked.

5892~~~
The that is LvG's fault. Next season if he doesn't rotate with a lot more games he will players dead on their feet by Christmas. Rooney is now and that will be a problem down the line.

5893~~~
He isn't being rotated, he is frozen.

5894~~~
He has not started in the league since Stoke at home, has he? And that was November. feck all chance of him starting the next few games with Fellaini, Blind, Carrick and Rooney all fit.

5895~~~
I was talking about Cambridge (FA Cup) and then Leicester at home - no need to play conservatively or worry overly about balance in those two games.

5896~~~
He starts in the F.A. Cup though and that is the next game. Rooney and Carrick are not far away from a usual late season injury as well. It always happens. Especially as they are playing constantly. I am not sure he realises the strain on his players bodies in this league. It is a lot more frantic than he has been used to.

5897~~~
If the players are available, I would almost like the team that lost at Leicester to try and put it all right.

5898~~~
I wouldn't mind that team either. Think we'd fare far better this time.

5899~~~
The likes of Hazard and Terry must have played plenty more minutes than Rooney and seem fine. No idea how to find the actual stats on this, but I'd be very surprised if they (and quite a few others) haven't played plenty more minutes than Rooney and Carrick. I really think they should be able to cope with the number of minutes being expected from them. Especially a player like Rooney he seems to noticeably benefit from playing week in week out, and quickly loses match sharpness when he misses a game or 2.

5900~~~
From what people say, Chelsea don't do the intensive training that we do, probably why they don't tire and don't get the injuries we get.

5901~~~
somebody should rename the name of the thread to 
<span style="font-size: 15px"><a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/ander-herrera-2014-2015-performances.392782/unread">Ander Herrera | 2014/2015 benchformances</a></span>
van gaal talks a lot of bollocks about his so called balance in the squad, this guy should start every game

5902~~~
I probably should have used some examples outside of Chelsea. How about Sanchez, Cazorla, Pelle, Eriksen?

Back to the topic, Herrera doesn't have an obvious place in the 352. He's suffering because of the formation in the same way Januzaj is. He will play more when (if?!) we revert to a formation with 4 at the back.

5903~~~
I presume that is why he wants new defenders and lots of them. Problem is making this common knowledge is making the ones we have play like rabbits in headlights. Yes they are keeping clean sheets, but it is Big Dave that is securing that stat for them. Also other teams being even worse than us at scoring.

5904~~~
I agree. I simply just don't think LVG rates him that much to be honest rightly or wrongly. He will start in the FA cup this Friday though.

5905~~~
Herrera back in to central midfield with Rooney playing as a forward again. Please.

5906~~~
Should be playing ahead of Mata in my opinion. Has more presence and athleticism about him which should allow for the balance that LVG is desperately looking for. I know I'm preaching to the choir but a midfield of:

----Di Maria----
Blind ------Herrera
-----Carrick-----     

looks to have great balance. Di Maria can be swapped to the left with Herrera playing attacking mid if you wish. Likewise Blind and Carrick could also swap. Mata would be a great option off the bench.

5907~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  We might as well sell him in January while we are at it. Never going to start again.

5908~~~
I actually feel sorry for this lad

5909~~~
I don't know what to think, honestly.

If we play 4 at the back today than Fellaini over Herrera makes sense. If not, then he has found himself in quite a situation.

EDIT: Actually, there might be another reason. LvG mentioned that Cambridge play "long ball" football didn't he?

5910~~~
Ribs still bothering him, right?

5911~~~
I really don't know why either. LvG can be a nasty bastard that way.

5912~~~
If there was any kind of reasonable offer for him it'd be better to sell him now. Probably wouldn't get half what was paid for him, but at least it could go towards getting a player the manager does trust.

5913~~~
Oh Ander <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5914~~~
It was never the case. Van Gaal simply decided he doesn't like nor does he trust him to get the job done. The ship has sailed.

5915~~~
You have to wonder why we bothered signing him, especially with that sort of fee. I mean he should play, but it's really poor business from us once again if this carries on.

5916~~~
I concur. Even if Athletic offered to take him on loan or Valencia offered to pay €10m for him it would be reasonable to let him leave. He's serving no purpose here and it is clear as a day now that he will not feature much.

Extremely bad management from van Gaal to agree to spend £30m and then refuse to play him at all.

5917~~~
Reports now that Herrera has been pulled from the squad completely for "personal reasons"      Hopefully nothing, but not difficult to imagine that he is unhappy about not even being able to get a start v Cambridge.


EDIT: False alarm, The Guardian admitting now the source turned out to be a fake twitter account

5918~~~
What does his price have to do with anything? Conversely, Fellaini cost 27m so he has to play as well.

5919~~~
I hope it doesn't mean he's going to get banned for corruption. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

5920~~~
Fecking hope not

5921~~~
See my edit, turns out Guardian now saying it is a false alarm, that their source turned out to be a fake twitter account

5922~~~
Man, United really have a way of teasing me with these midfielders I really like.
Veron, Kagawa, and now it seems Herrera is going to bite the dust... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5923~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fecking Guardian and fecking twitter!

5924~~~
Talk of selling him is a bit melodramatic. He's just behind players who've been better than him this season.  The pecking order is understandable but might change in time.

5925~~~
Bit annoying. Hopefully he starts next game.

5926~~~
We'd probably get £14 million? You don't half spew some bollocks on this site.

5927~~~
That's a fair point but there have been plenty of times we've looked like we could do with him in the middle of the park, even as a substitution, where it just hasn't happened at all. That and the reports that van Gaal doesn't appear to rate him much, I think it's clearly more than just being a bit behind in the pecking order right now.

It's very disappointing to spend £30m on the best non top 3 midfielder in La Liga last season (Rakitic aside) and not see him play.

5928~~~
I'm not exactly sure Mata or Fellaini have been better tbh.

5929~~~
They have though. By quite a margin too.

5930~~~
Even as one of Herrera's biggest fans, things aren't looking promising. Its a massive shame, because personally, I've loved watching him play (when he has). He might not be the best player in the world, but his style is very easy on the eye.

5931~~~
At least Fellaini is rated and is playing, which is the point. Why bother paying the fees we are paying for players we either have no idea how to use or just don't work for us? We are wasting a lot of money, if this carries on and I really hope I'm wrong. I hope he plays or finds his place, because he's a very good player in my eyes and not because of his fee, but if he doesn't, we could have used the money we paid for him differently.

5932~~~
A much of a muchness, generally. All have contributed, all have had good games and all have had a couple of iffy ones. I'd throw in Di Maria alongside them, to be honest.

Only Blind has consistently impressed in midfield for us, I think.

5933~~~
Mata I think has had very good games and very poor games. Same with Fellani, and thats the same with Herrera too

5934~~~
Yeah I agree with that tbh

5935~~~
As much as I love him, Fellaini had to start today ahead of him.

5936~~~
VG didn't choose him though. Just because he consented to a purchase his new chairman wanted to make doesn't mean he feels any pressure to make the signing work.

5937~~~
Not everyone can be in the starting XI. Fellaini, Mata, Di Maria, and Rooney all cost as much or more than him so his cost is irrelevant. We want to be the best team in the world so we need top players throughout the squad and Ander offers that.

5938~~~
I think he just hasn't hit his stride yet, so Van Gaal is going with Fellaini, who, in my opinion and presumably Van Gaal's as well, has outperformed him. When he's in form, I love what Herrera brings to the side. However, he hasn't consistently performed well this season. I remember him having a somewhat quiet first few games, followed by a very good game or two, against QPR and Leicester, if I recall correctly. He then got hurt (was it in the Leicester game?), came back with an absolute howler in which he got subbed at half (can't remember the opposition,) and since then, it seems to have all been a bit stop-start (I recall one substitute appearance during which he played very well.) He scored a great goal against Yeovil, but I thought he was pretty dire in that game.

In all, I think we all want to see him play because when in form, he plays the kind of football we've been dying to see come back to United. However, he just hasn't performed well enough to be a pencilled in starter (in my opinion.)

I think all this talk of selling him is extremely premature. He'd hardly be the first import to struggle in his first season, would he?

5939~~~
Talk of sale is outrageously silly, too. There are better options than Herrera on the benches of Madrid, Bayern and Barcelona and if we've any ambition to compete with them again we should ensure that we keep the good players we do have at the club. 

If Herrera is to be a squad player then so be it. Lucky us.

5940~~~
Not sure how you can say Mata has, he's also had lots more games to impress in. Fellaini I'd agree with because his chances were limited and he definitely took them.

5941~~~
Hererra hasn't had good games though. Good moments but not good games. At a push, he's had one good 90. Against the worst QPR performance I've ever seen. He's generally been someoene who might look good in highlights but makes a lot of errors too. 

I still think he's got a chance but he's not adapted to the pace and physicality of the PL at all. Hopefully he'll step up in season two. Still quite young too.

5942~~~
He is behind a striker when it comes to picking the midfield. He's not even a part of rotation.

5943~~~
Mata will have impressed Van Gaal with his ball retention. Arguably Hererra's achilles heel.

5944~~~
Really? That's not what the average ratings say (just a loose barometer I know) . Mata has blown hot and cold and Fellaini has been a big improvement this season but is still rather average for a side like United. Herrera has been generally good when he has played, bar that game when he tried to play through a broken rib. I just don't get it I really don't. We sign a proper midfielder who can do a bit of everything and seems to have a good, intelligent head on his shoulders and then proceed to exclude him. He's even come up with some cracking goals which we didn't know he had in his arsenal when he arrived.

It could very well be the ball retention thing, but that would be a shame if so. I think we'd all like to see Mata try a few riskier through balls more often.

5945~~~
I'm not sure how that means he's been better than him though? Hasn't our constant need to try and keep the ball and bore the opposition to death been one of our biggest problems? At least Herrera's direct.

5946~~~
Not really. Early into the season Herrera was mostly very good. Fellaini has been good and had limited chances, Mata has played even when he was poor and still got plenty more opportunities than Herrera. I don't think Herrera has been given anywhere near enough of a chance.

Like with Di Maria though you are bound to prefer other players to him. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5947~~~
Caf ratings have always been a bad way to judge players. The love-in with players like Anderson, Hernandez and Kagawa continued long past the point it was obvious they had no future here (not that this applies to Hererra - the no future bit, that is)

5948~~~
Assuming he's only rated as an attacking midfielder, which it looks like, where is his place in the squad then? We've more than enough players for that position. I'm not saying we should sell, which would be silly, but I just don't see how he currently fits in in the squad and I'm not even talking about the starting XI.

5949~~~
Yes, of course. I'll stick up for Mata and slag Herrera off because... Spanish?

5950~~~
Yeah but he's been guilty of some shocking lapses in his passing, and not exactly made up for it by providing telling through ball/slide-rule passes. Mind you, I also think Mata has been guilty of playing the safe option a bit too much, but on balance, I think he has outperformed Herrera (although their roles haven't been identical.)

5951~~~
Really? I don't remember that run of good form at the beginning of the season, except for in the QPR match and the first half of the Leicester match.

5952~~~
He's probably outperformed him because he's played shitloads more than him. Mata, by his standards, has only really been satisfactory this season. I mean obviously he's a better player than Herrera and therefore it makes more sense to persist with him, I just don't think you can say he's been the better of the two if you include the fact that he's played twice as many games.

I don't think Mata should be dropped for him or anything, but surely we could give Herrera more chances in the team than we currently are. He's barely had a sniff.

5953~~~
He was good first half vs West Ham too, then he got injured and was out of the team. That is the point, he actually hasn't played a lot of football.

5954~~~
Nope, you were actually pretty harsh on Mata when he was very popular on here. You have actually started to like him more when people have begun to lose patience with his inconsistency. It's the thing with you, you mostly don't like players who are popular among fans here.

5955~~~
Who would you give him games instead of if not Mata though?

5956~~~
Funnily enough that is the only EPL game he has actually played 90 minutes.

5957~~~
I don't think he has any issues with the pace of the game. He's picked up some neat passes and been mostly good in possession. It's hard to expect him to make no mistakes when he's been in and out (mostly out) of the side all the time.

5958~~~
Well we've had chances to drop the 3-5-2 and put another midfielder in, we've had chances to give him 30 minutes in games we could have used him in. We've been using Rooney in midfield to accommodate under-performing Falcao/RvP upfront.

There have been plenty of chances to play him in games, it's not just about dropping one midfielder for another.

5959~~~
Fecking hell. We've gone over this before. You're talking out your hole. I "don't like" players I think aren't playing well. I end up pointing this out more often if they're gettting (undeserved) praise. No need for any psychoanalysis. Especially when Paddy Evra was one of my favourite ever players at a time when he was being called 'God'.

If there's any trend at all it's been me being critical of players slightly before that criticism got widespread and they ended up not making the grade. I don't think this will apply to Hererra fwiw. He's got a lot of good qualities. Just not yet put them all together.

5960~~~
Indeed. Not lasting 90 minutes is rarely a good sign, when judging performances. Managers tend to leave the players who are playing well on the pitch.

5961~~~
Problems with the speed of the game? He is the one central midfielder that actually is mobile, quick and direct. He make us much better (faster and more direct like under SAF) every time I see him play.

To save some guys a post, ADM is an attacking midfielder/winger/attacker.

5962~~~
This might be true but playing Januzaj instead of him is bit weird.

5963~~~
Game crying out for him, yet again. So many times during games this season I keep thinking that he's exactly the type of player we need on the pitch to up the tempo of the passing and bring some real creativity and tenacity in the middle.

5964~~~
Get this lad on!

5965~~~
Very good again in the first few minutes after coming on. Has to be relegated to the bench immediately, God forbid we have a midfielder capable of creating chances.

5966~~~
Has played well again today, so in Van Gaal logic he won't play next game.

5967~~~
Played well today. Good in tackle, passed well. Gonna be dropped next game.

5968~~~
Our best midfielder.

5969~~~
I want him in Mata's role for once. The guy is so much stronger on the ball.

5970~~~
Has to start for us. Even with his limited chances he's showing much more than many of our other players. Can't really understand why LvG seemingly doesn't rate him.

5971~~~
Was good when he came one, attacked and defended well.

5972~~~
Did well. Probably should start against Leicester.

5973~~~
The manager is an complete and utter idiot.

5974~~~
Did well, shame he wasn't on longer. Again showed he doesn't lack in the physical part of the game too

5975~~~
Was a lot better than Fellaini in this game...but passed to a useless Valencia too often. Was hoping he'd try them give and go passes more often.

5976~~~
MOTM, probably.

5977~~~
Did he run over Van Gaals cat? When he came on he's looked good.

5978~~~
He had nobody else to aim at - Januzaj was on the other side of the field, Falcao and RvP were both trying the same thing, Di Maria was nowhere to be seen, Carrick was so deep, Jones was probably his only other alternative. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5979~~~
He has to start more.

5980~~~
Should be starting. Good defensively, offered something going forward. Actually looked to take risks with passes, doubt he starts next week.

5981~~~
So uh, why doesn't he start again?

5982~~~
Very good 1 2 with Di Maria, thought we would have scored there. When those two are in the vicinity of each other things tend to happen.

5983~~~
I don't want to think about the reasons. I'd just rather watch a team that can use Herrera than one that can't.

5984~~~
See, I'm sure I'm not imagining things, but every time he plays he impresses me. Then we don't see him for months and I start doubting myself, then he plays again, and I'm impressed again. Rinse and repeat. 

Would be in my starting lineup every single time.

5985~~~
It's just bizarre.

5986~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20558, @charleysurf" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20558/">@charleysurf</a> you usually like to post in here after games, care to join or ... ?

5987~~~
He's got no place in this team, likes to pass it quickly and forwards.

5988~~~
My biggest criticism of Van Gaal is his inability to spot something as obvious as this. Surely any sentient creature should be able to see his quality.

5989~~~
Same

5990~~~
I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this guy needs to start more often. We almost always look better with him on the pitch.

5991~~~
He's literally the only player that passes and moves and actually links the team together.

So naturally, he's not allowed to play in a United team. That sort of shit isn't accepted here.

5992~~~
This lad looked bloody classy tonight. Put some of our other players (Fellaini) to shame.

5993~~~
The others do it when he is in the side, He has to play.

5994~~~
Great tackle and looked like making it happen in that pocket outside the goal. Di Maria was too quiet in there, but Herrera looked better.

5995~~~
Our games all seem to follow this pattern:

First half - we play shit, Herrera's twiddling his thumbs on the bench.
Second half - we bring on Herrera around 60 minutes and we immediately look much better and/or win.
Post match - people wonder why he doesn't start. Some people say he's not actually been that good.
Next game - Herrera's back on the bench.

Can't be a coincidence.

5996~~~
Looked our best player once he was on, hungry and trying to instill some tempo. 

So back to the bench for him next week then.

5997~~~
I'll wrote his post for him. 

Lol! If he's apparently better than Messi like all our so called "fans" hyped him to be, he'd be scoring 14 tonight!

5998~~~
Need to push Rooney back to the striker position and get Herrera back in midfield.. But somehow it feels like Fellaini is going to be LVG's preffered option before him..

Played well today,definitely deserves to start the next game..

5999~~~
Read that he has only started 2 games in 3 months, makes sense at all. We look so much better when he plays.

6000~~~
Clearly something is wrong in LVG's head if he doesn't wanna give more starts to Herrera. He makes our football so much better by applying the basics.

6001~~~
Shame he didn't start and that Valencia is so I effective going forward, involved in some good play today I have no idea why he isn't being given a run in the first eleven.

6002~~~
How can a manager as good as van Gaal supposedly is not see that the mere inclusion of Ander in our lineup makes us so much better. It's not even as if he is a liability defensively like Mata.

6003~~~
Oof.. Please start him, Januzaj and Rafael against Leicester. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6004~~~
Played well when he came on. Brilliant use of the ball.

6005~~~
He was very good when he came on. It puzzles me that he finds it so hard to get in the starting xi.

6006~~~
Needs to start, or LVG needs to go.

6007~~~
He should've started.

6008~~~
Starting to wonder what the issue is with Herrera. He is a lovely player to watch, so full of energy and industry.  Never static and always looking to make something happen.  Should be getting minutes.

6009~~~

6010~~~
He really knits our play together. He is an intelligent passer and has excellent appreciation for weight of pass. He can tackle and score goals. Probably best to keep him on the bench!

6011~~~
He should start every game for us, alongside Carrick in midfield.

6012~~~
He's not Kevin Strootman don't you know. The way it is going Kevin Strootman will never be here, because if Louis doesn't get that Top4 he will be gone. The board cannot be happy with what they are witnessing. Even they, especially SAF will be wondering why Ander doesn't start.

6013~~~
I like fellaini but today showed exactly why we need Herrera in midfield at times too. Today was about playing in tight areas and that's not fellainis bread and butter. 

He showed great heart and skill when he came on, and opened up there defence a few times. Should start against Leicester.

6014~~~
He just makes everyone around him look better. Must be why van Gaal puts him on the bench right next to him.

6015~~~
Can someone explain to me why he isn't starting games?

6016~~~

6017~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20558, @charleysurf" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20558/">@charleysurf</a> ?????

6018~~~
Put in some superb tackles today, not even just going in hard but timed to perfection. Absolutely fantastic, love a good tackle me. Was really good all around too, shame Valencia is rubbish and couldn't take advantage of it. Even play him as a RM or something as he puts in a good cross too. Hope van Gaal can find a spot for him in some more matches.

6019~~~
Played well again when he came on, probably wont see him again for another 3 weeks.

On a serious note a lot is made of foreign players adapting to the premier league and he couldn't have done much more in his first few months here, in the handful of games he's played more often than not he's done well, I'm sure at this point the match fixing allegation is the thing keeping him out of the team.

6020~~~
Yep. His style of play and constant movement just invite the rest of the team to keep it on the ground and play good football.

6021~~~
I actually agree with this, I hope LvG leaves before we even consider selling Herrera. If Herrera is too much a risk for LvG whose team is creating absolutely nothing without him, then there's not much hope for us with LvG. Herrera is our best midfielder but we aren't playing him and instead are served with horrible football.

6022~~~
he should start every game for us without carrick..

I loved how good defensively he works, he made three brilliant tackles, when he won the ball unlike Fellaini who was completely lost again and always late and almost got sent off as usual.. he is great defensively, maybe sometimes makes a bad pass but who doesn't. Mr consistency aka Mica Carrick today was horrible in his passing but he wil definitely start next game I am sure of it and Herrera will be benched again even a twice footballer like him.. I don't care about that balance its horse shit.. we need to build our team around him he is a key player.. no dimaria no carrick no rooney but herrera, if van Gaal can't get this then he needs to go

6023~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6024~~~
Yep, pretty much every game he's played, with the exception being when he broke his rib, he's been one of our best performing players on the pitch and we as a whole have looked much better whenever he's been on the pitch. Mind boggling why he isn't starting as he's our best midfielder IMO, our most dynamic and most all round one as well. If Fergie was manager he'd be an automatic starter IMO, a hard worker, a good tackler, very creative, a good passer, a good dribbler and has goals in him.

6025~~~
Great wee cameo. Thought Fellaini was crap so probably in with a shout of starting the next game. Hopefully he makes the most of it if he does.

6026~~~
Got ahead of Fellaini in the picking order with his cameo tonight, I think.

6027~~~
Put him next to Fellaini. Let the big man do the combative stuff, let Herrera play his natural game and Blind playing deep in a holding role. Blind can do everything Carrick does at a quicker tempo.

6028~~~
I think, Van Gaal thinks Fellainis physicality and the fact that he has been in this league for a bit makes him more useful. In reality though, Fellaini isnt much of a player...

6029~~~
Agree. It's strange really, the way people are defending him is like a lot of people defended at the start of last season, except with Herrera, he proves it every time he's on the pitch. He had one poor game - when he played with a broken rib and was subbed off at half. Pretty much every other time he's played, he's been excellent. Then he's out of the team for a while, people all complain how he isn't playing, Charleysurf or whoever else argue that he's shit or whatever they make up, and then he shows his class again and we look so much better overall. One of the weirdest things this season, him not playing despite performing really well almost every time he plays, even if he scores a beauty or makes a big difference in games.

6030~~~
Classy bit of interchanging between Herera and Di Maria in the box after he came on. When we're playing against teams who are parking two close ranks we need to forget two strikers and play our clever little passers and ball recyclers through the middle:

DDG
Rafael Jones Rojo Shaw
Blind Herera (Blind sitting more, Herera more box-to-box)
Mata Januzaj Di Maria (all three can interchange positions)
Rooney (upfront but allowed to roam an drop with runners going past)

I think this team has the intelligence, movement and firepower to break all these bus parking teams down.

6031~~~
In a different thread. Has he been thread banned or something? All the praise Herrera's getting here must be like ants under his skin.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's like the anti Mad Winger for Herrera.

6032~~~
I agree with Charleysurf...Nonsense to think that picking Herrera is just going to suddenly turn it all around. You look at Ozil and you see a player with a lot more ability than Herrera on the bench at Arsenal...Ozil can do anything and can see things no one else does...But he doesn't get involved enough and is perhaps not dynamic enough and that is why he is often on the bench at Arsenal despite earning more money than anyone else at the club apart from Sanchez

6033~~~
Özil just came back from an injury. No one said Herrera is the solution to all of our problems. Herrera does get involved and is dynamic, dont know what you want to say.

6034~~~
The last 20 mins after he came on were the only mins worth watching. Suddenly we had a midfielder who can pass and move and find teammates with good passes where they want the ball

6035~~~
I dont understand why this lad is not starting for us. He is probably our best proper CM next to Carrick. His primary weakness is his physic but I he more than makes up for it with his movement and passing ability. Unfortunately he is lost in the shuffle with LvG.

6036~~~
You haven't got a clue about anything have you. Ozil has been injured for ages and came back last week. 

And I don't think anyone has said he's going to change everything for the whole season, but he's quite literally changed 2-3 games with cameo appearances. He deserves a chance far more than any of the other fannies in midfield.

6037~~~
Herrera gets as involved as anyone and is as all round midfielder as we've had for the past 10 years probably. He's everywhere on the pitch, and has loads of class to boot while also being good actually defensively. He really should be starting, there's no logical reason that he isn't, and he impresses almost every sub appearance without complaining while others have so much shit written about them even if they don't deserve games.

6038~~~
Ozil is lazy that is the problem, you wouldn't get him tackling back and saving Valencia's skins like Ander did last night. That is a big difference. Also all the stuff in the Mata thread about him being rubbish, we could have done with a Mata last night.

6039~~~
It has to be Herrera linking with Rafael, no Valencia please. He is only in the side because he is big and fast. He can't beat a man, can't cross and we now know can't take a throwin.

6040~~~
He improves our play so much whenever he comes on. It's refreshing to see a midfielder who is tenacious, aggressive, can pass and make runs. No clue how he doesn't start.

6041~~~
Carrick deffo has a better range of passing than Blind even if Blind's is good too. I think the fact Carrick is comfortable on both feet is a huge advantage for deep lying midfield distributor. I can see the thinking in having Fellaini alongside Herrera, the only thing is it means Di Maria would have to play on the wing and most people want him CM.

6042~~~
Oh look.....A player who tries to make things happen......

Bench for you ye little rascal!

6043~~~
The only midfielder we have with any speed, dynamism or ability to find a decent pass can barely get a look in. I don't get it.

6044~~~
Di Maria did his prospects as a CM no good last night. Looked as though Van Gaal took him out of the engine room at half-time. He was decent further forwards but kind of crap as a CM.

To be fair to Van Gaal he has tended to reward subs who play well with a start. So Hererra has a good chance of making our next XI. Just needs to make more of the opportunity this time.

6045~~~
Now we are praising him but I remember many times when he started and could not even get on the ball and was subbed off after 60 min.

6046~~~
Yeah? Many times? Name them.

6047~~~
Yeah I don't really have an issue with Di Maria playing on the wing. Him and Herrera in midfield with only Carrick or Blind for cover is potentially a bit of a risk given those two aren't particularly mobile. Its still my preferred formation at the moment but I'd have no problem moving AdM to the wing if it didn't work. Herrera defends very well I'd just rather he didn't have to worry too much about it.

6048~~~
Hererra's great at tackling but a bit naive when it comes to his positioning and tracking runs. Still learning a deeper midfield role. Not really "great at defending". Feck it, though, we should always reward someone who has that impact off the bench with a start and pick a team that will work with him in it.

6049~~~
It's not like Fellaini is great at tracking runs either and Herrera hasn't had a good run of starts to bed in, just cameos for the last 3 months. I don't know why LvG won't just play Carrick and Blind behind him as a midfield 3 with Rooney up top. It's at least worth a try IMO.

6050~~~
Correct, usually he has had to come on, quite often to change games. The only games that come to mind are Swansea for Fellaini, after which LvG acknowledged he shouldn't have done it as we were getting on top. The WBA with that damn corset.

6051~~~
If Ander is naive, which he possibly is, god knows what our defenders are with regards to tracking runners and positioning.

6052~~~
Makes things happen, has a good engine on him. A willingness to always receive the ball and plays it direct sometimes or quick passing. Good movement off the ball too (a bit too much at times) but a definite starter for me. We are lacking in ideas, lacking in people being willing to play the final ball. Something tells me he's still not going to feature as a starter and the odd sub appearance is what he'll be restricted to due to some nonsense about balance. Hope that's not the case. Herrera's not been perfect but when he's on song he improves us significantly. With our struggle for attacking form, he has to be given a run as a starting player.

6053~~~
Fellaini is actually quite good at tracking runs. This season anyway. Looked clueless at times last season but has been really good, defensively, under Van Gaal (not something you can say about many of our squad!)

6054~~~
Then as someone said, get a good strong midfielder to play alongside him to cover for his deficiencies. His upside is far too good to not use.

6055~~~
West Brom come to mind as well. In the Leicester debacle he looked hopeless in midfield in the second half and even in the following games against West Ham and Everton, although we won, we looked to vulnerable with him in midfield. I am not blaming him for that he was a big part of it.

6056~~~
Yet against West Ham, it was him putting a tackle in a winning the ball that led to the 2nd goal. He broke his rib in that game remember. He was definitely invisible against Everton as he was out with aforementioned broken rib.

6057~~~
Add to that against West Brom he clearly wasn't fit. And was rushed back from his broken ribs.

6058~~~
I enjoyed this one <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

6059~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6060~~~
Until one of them becomes undroppable i'd start Mata for the Home games and Herrera for the Away games.

Having more than 1 striker is pointless if the team is not creating any chances for them.

6061~~~
I agree with that. It is just a waste of a team place.

6062~~~
The only reason I can think of for LVG not to play him is the fact he gives the ball away quite a bit. Apart from that, I can't think of any other faults.

6063~~~
Yep.

6064~~~
I really feel we need to start using Herrera in a 3 man midfield. I think that LVG sees him as too attacking minded to play as a CM in a 2 man midfield, hence why Herrera has got games at #10 for us.

I would love to see a proper 4-3-3 with Herrera and Fellaini in front of Carrick or Blint. We are just short on wingers but Januzaj and Di Maria are capable.


I had Herrera as MotM yesterday, we looked a different side after he came on though it could be argued that Cambridge were probably tiring at that point

6065~~~
This is the best point made so far.

6066~~~
He doesn't though. I don't know why people are thinking that. I would much rather have a risk taker than boring pragmatism. Manchester United is built on attacking risk taking football. His bloody Assistant Manager should know that.

6067~~~
Thus leaving RVP,Falcao and Mata on the bench.
(I actually think we can only play two of RVP,Falcao,Mata and Rooney so I am pretty close to agreeing with you).

6068~~~
I said in an earlier post that the team is afraid to take risks where as Herrera's game is mainly based on that. It's the only reason I can think of as to why he's not playing from the start.

6069~~~
So what, RVP and Falcao haven't done much anyway. Mata can play behind Rooney with Di Maria

6070~~~
Yep, we really should play with one striker. It's not like they have all been so good it'd be unfair to bench them, truth is none of our forwards deserve to start aside from Rooney.

6071~~~
I've been a critic of his but I thought he was good in his cameo and deserves a start.

6072~~~
Fellaini is even worse for this and offers less than Herrera so not sure if that is the reason.

6073~~~
Right, but like thegregster said the only reason, is that Falcao, Mata and RVP are bigger names and LVG don't want drop them for Herrera.

6074~~~
I'd agree, but it seems like Hoofball is actually one of our favoured tactics this season, especially in the second half of games so I can see why Fellaini gets played.

6075~~~
He actually has the same pass completion as Fellaini with 87% and better than Rooney with 84% and Di Maria with 80%

6076~~~
Exactly. It's just a criticism that must be made if it happened once to negate praise, e.g, Rafael's rashness, Smalling's ability on the ball (no worse than Evans or Jones) etc... His pass completion and accuracy rate is no worse than our other central midfielders.

6077~~~
Here's a set of gifs from yesterday about Herrera and what he did, there are too many so i will just copy this reddit link:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/2tgfbk/gifs_of_all_the_brilliant_work_done_by_herrera/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/2tgfbk/gifs_of_all_the_brilliant_work_done_by_herrera/</a>

6078~~~
I think Ander has most people on his side. I think the problem with LvG he sees the little negative Ander brings, taking risks, which aren't actually that bigger risks,yet will not see the positives in someone and how he can use them. Our defenders are far more risky than Ander Herrera will ever be.

6079~~~
He will have to at some stage. If we keep the diamond in the long run we could play Di Maria and Herrera in midfield with Carrick or Blind behind them. Then play Rooney in behind Falcao and RVP or else Mata behind Rooney and RVP. Mata or Falcao are the most likely to lose out. Some of the interplay from our midfield against the likes of QPR and Leicester (not big teams but much better than Cambridge) with Di Maria and Herrera in midfield was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>!

6080~~~
Decent midfield play? Why would we want that in our side, eh..? Back on the bench with you Ander!

6081~~~
He's our best central midfielder, imo.

6082~~~
I'll be absolutely fuming if he finds himself on the bench against Leicester.

He will though.

6083~~~
I think Fellaini started instead of him because he had a very good cameo in the QPR game and his height was needed in set pieces. Obvious decision by LVG. 

Herrera should be ahead in the picking order after last night, I think he will start if we will play diamond vs Leicester.

6084~~~
i agree , after DDG he'd be the first name on my team sheet. so actually the 2nd player on my team sheet.

6085~~~
GIF #3 just sums us up. Bereft of confidence, it won't be long before all action Ander is affected.

6086~~~
Don't give yourself false hope, of course Herrera's going to be on the bench for the next game (if he even makes the squad!) Rather than getting angry, start preparing yourself for the disappointment from now. 

I will be surprised if Ander plays again for awhile. Mata and Rooney are both clearly ahead of him in Van Gaal's mind, as seemingly is Fellaini. When you factor in Di Maria, Herrera is fifth choice centre midfielder competing for a maximum of three spots. Do not expect to see him play for United any time soon.

6087~~~
It's really puzzling as to why Herrera is being overlooked. You can't help but feel it must be something personal between him and Van Gaal. He was rumoured to have been enjoying off-field activities a bit, was he not? Rightly or wrongly, Van Gaal seems like the type of manager who is perfectly willing to make an example of a player if their attitude isn't upto scratch in his opinion. 

Last night on a tight pitch with Cambridge pressing our midfielders like rabid dogs, we really needed Herrera's close control and one-touch passing as opposed to Fellaini's lumbering elbow-wielding. It's concerning that Van Gaal apparently couldn't see that until the 70th minute...

6088~~~
LvG and George Best would have got on well then.

6089~~~
Same, I don't rate him half as much as others on here do but he should definitely start against Leicester.
I'd like to see that too, with Mata and Di Maria coming in from the wings. It'd probably be our best team in terms of technical ability.

6090~~~
You just know we'll try to shoehorn three strikers in as its a poor team we are playing and we are home. So frustrating.

6091~~~
If he mentions long balls and physicality again I will scream.

6092~~~
He is put under much more scrutiny than Fellaini and Mata this season in that his good performances are blown out of proportion but also any of his bad moments, be it half a game or 15 minutes or a single bad touch are always noted by top fans who show him no affection because everyone else likes him. It's hard to find the middle ground with Herrera, he is a divisive playerm

6093~~~
One thing that I find incredible is that there seems to be a direct correlation between us playing good football, and Herrera being on the pitch. Everytime he comes on, our football just seems to go up a level. The passing is quicker, the link up better, lots more movement, more quick incisive passing etc.

What I don't understand is how one player (who isn't exactly world class) can make such a difference? Its so frustrating as a fan, because its that kind of football which is great to watch.

6094~~~
I'm done, absolutely shocking management by LVG <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How he doesn't start games I'll never fecking know!

6095~~~
Agreed. It's no coincidence we play our best football when he's on the pitch such a clever player. He has great passing ability and is a decent tackler too. Not sure why he doesn't get played.

6096~~~
Play this man, he's a genius!

6097~~~
Him and Mata need to be in the team together. Our forward play will instantly improve.

6098~~~
Rafael as well. Nobody can link up with Valencia.

6099~~~
You are right, if only Rafael could stay fit, that's frustrating, he was good with Herrera. Well, everyone is good with Herrera

6100~~~
Mata/Herrera/Di Maria/Rooney

Surely a team with those 4 in it would play some great football?

6101~~~
He's the ghost of Kagawa. An agenda poster's wet dream.

6102~~~
I still think he lets people run off him way to easily, to me where Fellaini has given us something this season is as a physical target that can hold the ball and releive pressure in games when we are getting pressed.

This is where LvG needs to be the take no shit manager his reputation says he is, the team is bigger than the individual is his mantra and he's on about balance all the time, yet he keeps picking unbalanced line-ups.

6103~~~
Get the feeling that he may be shown the door if LvG gets who he wants in the summer.

6104~~~
Hoofball is a genuine tactic this season and Fellaini is the only one who can do it whereas Rooney and Mata can do the job of Herrera. Maybe that's the reason he's so low in the pecking order?

6105~~~
Yeah, I think he'll be back in Spain within a year or two.

6106~~~
Only we'd do something that stupid, so it does make sense.

6107~~~
#subsAnderPlusSix

6108~~~
IMO if he doesn't get any starts between now and March it will be clear he's not in van Gaal's plans. A part of me still hopes he eventually wins a place in the first team because I reckon he has great potential but that's just a dim hope.

6109~~~
I don't think LVG likes him.

Personally I always think we look a much better team when he's on the pitch.

He passes quickly, moves around and creates space all the time, can transition quickly both ways and ups the tempo in our game.

All elements that's sorely lacking if we're going to break teams down in LVG's preferred possession style - all elements none of our other midfielders really bring to the table. Fellaini's basically the polar opposite in terms of style.

6110~~~
I dont think it's as simple as van Gaal not liking him, I think he just doesn't trust him not to expose our shite defence and opts for players who hold on to the ball better or offer more protection. Hopefully when he upgrades the defence he will take the shackles off and Di Maria and Herrera will return to the midfield.

6111~~~
Fellaini doesn't excactly offer much more protection at the right hand side of the diamond. Neither Januzaj on the left.

Rooney/Mata offer less protection than Herrera yet they've both been picked ahead of him in midfield lately.

And if LVG's worried about the balance - why not Carrick/Blind deep, with Di Maria/Rooney/Herrera behind RvP or Falcao? Or Di Maria/Mata/Herrera in behind Rooney? A 4-2-3-1?

If balance is the problem I'd flog one of the strikers that isn't performing either way and play an extra midfielder - solving two problems with one stroke.

It's just baffling that he's so out of favour despite largely giving good/very good performances.

6112~~~
I'm not buying that for a second. Our defence is more than good enough for Cambridge and 90% of the teams in our league. Some are going OTT with their criticism of our defenders to explain away some of LVGs decisions.

6113~~~
If, as expected, van Gaal targets Strootman and we sign him, how exactly does Herrera fit in?

6114~~~
Herrera will only prosper in a 3 men midfield backed by a DM (Blind) and a tough tackling brute (Fellaini). Unfortunately that would mean LVG love child RVP or Rooney (the latter deserve to be in the team) out.

6115~~~
Fellaini isn't, by any stretch of the imagination, a tough tackling brute.

For the record I think a midfield three of Carrick/Di Maria/Herrera would work fine against most teams.

6116~~~
Too light weight. Fellaini gives us balance whether we like it or not.

And Jeez who would prefer a 34 year old Carrick to Blind?

6117~~~
I bought this seasons shirt with Herrera on the back, so I hope not<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

6118~~~
So Carrick/Di Maria/Herrera is too light weight - and you'd replace Carrick with Blind??

You see, I don't agree Fellaini gives us balance. Because despite his sheer size, he's not particularly tough in the tackle and he can't move his legs. It's too easy to overrun us when he's on the pitch.

Fellaini also drags our tempo down because he doesn't move into space well and takes too long on the ball.

6119~~~
I don't think he will. I think that ship has sailed. I think a beast of a defensive midfielder is likely with Carrick being phased out due to his age and Blind being the only other option.

6120~~~
Yeah, it may have sailed. That's true. 
But (and I may be wrong to assume this) I'd assume Strootman fits his profile for a box to box midfielder as well as anyone. It's that type of midfielder he's really after. 

Bearing in mind Rooney will almost certainly start and that van Gaal doesn't see him as a striker or wide man, I'd guess the plan is either 433 with Rooney, Blind plus one, or 3412 with Rooney in the hole and Blind plus one. My hunch is that he's after someone with a different skill set to Herrera. 

I see where you're coming from with the defence, but I'll be surprised if Herrera moves up the pecking order during the summer.

6121~~~
I'm sure a midfield duo of Carrick and Herrera would work in a 4-4-2, so there's no reason why he can't play in a trio. The problem was when Van Gaal was using the diamond, he needs width so he tells the central midfielders to play wide, and so we end up basically using 1 central midfielder.

6122~~~
I think he doesn't rate (or play) Herrera for the same reason he insists on playing 3 at the back instead of a standard 4-5-1 or 4-3-3. With Herrera, we're more open. More likely to create chances, yet also more likely to concede cheap possession or leave gaps at the back. Its probably the same reason Valencia is preferred to Rafael. 

I can disagree with Van Gaal's fecking philosophy all I want but the reality is this is what he wants. Its disappointing because I'd assumed "philosophy" would've meant pleasing passing and one touch football, but its looking more and more like "let's keep the ball aimlessly so our opponents can't score (despite there being loads of instances where a team with lesser possession win games, like our performances against Arsenal for the past few years for example.)

6123~~~
Agree with this, they could interchange positions and the quick passing game would suit them all.

6124~~~
I much doubt it. Carrick was never mobile and these things do not improve with age. Herrera is a little magician in CM but we can't ignore his lack of physicality. Id say we should go for 4-3-3. We play Carrick/Blind, Fellaini and Herrera, Valencia/Januzaj and Di Maria on the flanks and Rooney upfront. Its not perfect but its the best team we've got

How did it work with Scholes and Carrick then? Scholes wasn't stronger than Herrera, the better player obviously, but why shouldn't it work with Herrera and Blind against some teams? I'd rather see the midfield 3 as you suggest it as well. Still, a midfield of Herrera and Blind in a 4-4-1-1 with Rooney in his usual role, di Maria on the left and for now Januzaj, Valencia or Young on the right is something I'd rather see than the 3-5-2.

6126~~~
By playing the best central defensive partnership in Europe behind them. Arguably the best back four.

6127~~~
I've actually come around to LVG's way of thinking i.e Herrera should play as a #10 or part of a 3 man midfield. People bring up Carrick and Scholes but you have to remember both of them are fantastic passers over both long and short distances. Herrera isn't really that kind of player. He takes risks and when it's not his day he tends to misplace plenty of passes in dangerous areas. I'd say he's closer to Rooney as a midfielder than he is to Scholes.

That said, I'd have him ahead of Mata all day long as a #10. One thing I love about him is that he never hides. This can often result in him looking shite when things are not going his way (A trait he shares with the likes of Rooney, Di Maria, Nani and co) but for an attacking player I'd rather have that than someone playing it safe 90% of the time.

6128~~~
Why are people saying he's light weight? That's a strange observation.

6129~~~
Carrick was younger, Scholes was the most intelligent player we had in two decades, Valencia was at his prime, we could rely on Park and we often helped that midfield with Rooney-Tevez two of the most hardworking strikers I've ever seen. Ah and I forgot we had the best defense in the world and possibly the second best defense I've ever witnessed first hand in football (the best was AC Milan's defense of the Baresi-Maldini era)

That's what this team miss ie balance. These days we've got a pack of big names (some well past their expiry date) who fight one another for a bit of shine.

6130~~~
Also people are saying he will end up back in Spain, who could afford his wages now? He will be on a hell of lot more money than he was at Athletic. I love the way we all seem to know what LvG is thinking. I just think if he had told him he wasn't wanted we would have heard. Past players who have been told it has come out. Nothing has in this instance of social media and insider sources. Knowing us we are completely misreading the situation. People on here are as bigger philosophers as LvG.

6131~~~
Because he's Spanish. He's quite combative and not at all weak on the ball in my opinion.

6132~~~
To be honest the whole team is the problem. There's only the goalkeeper who is playing to his potential and we might lose him. Rvp and Falcao up front are terrible. They are the same player basically and far too slow. Carrick is slow, Mata is slow. Blind is slow, Fellaini is slow. Di Maria has lost his confidence and is played out of position. Rooney is being played out of position and isn't a midfielder so he can test drive Falcao up front. Wilson isn't ready for first team yet. The defence I could go on all day. Valencia god almighty. I think there are a lot more pressing problems that Ander Herrera and a lot of the problems are down to the manager. Looking at hat team and it is no wonder we are creating no chances and the strikers are both going for the same balls, so just get in each others way. I just hope he gets it right against Leicester or the pressure will start to tell. The teams behind us are playing with confidence and we aren't.

6133~~~
It baffles me, everyone keeps saying he is little as well, he is 6ft. You do get 6ft Spaniards you know. He gets stuck in. The fact he does takes risks to me makes him a Manchester United player. I like risk takers. When did Manchester United stop encouraging that?

6134~~~
That's my point. We lack balance ie the right mixture of workrate, technique, brilliance and heart. Also we've got a number of players who are pretty much here for the pay check or are showing clear signs of decline. Falcao would have preferred Real to Manchester. RVP has nothing to prove anymore and is quite settled with the amount of medals he won and the likes of Valencia, Rafael etc are on a free fall in terms of talent and form. Hence why people like me who normally cringe when players like Fellaini play with United want him to play on a regular basis. At least the bean pole play like a player who cares. 

We need to restore some balance in the team and that will mean making some painful decisions. Players who are injury prone must be shown the door. Had beens must follow them and also players whose genuinely good but can only play in systems which aren't really good for us (Im referring to Mata). Ideologies and philosophies must give way to what need to be done for the team to be effective. As said I don't like Fellaini very much however he brings balance so Id want to see him on the pitch on a weekly basis. I doubt that having wingers and fullbacks playing the Wingback role is very effective irrespective of whether LVG likes it or not.

6135~~~
Yeah. It's the same misconception like when people say that said full back is poor at defending only because they know he's good at attacking and cannot possibly understand that you can be good at both. Spanish = weak and lazy, British = strong and hard working.

6136~~~
The problem is that LvG also says a lot, but actually says nothing at all. So none of are any the wiser about what is going to happen.

6137~~~
It depends on how you interpret lightweight.

a- Is he perfectly capable to play in EPL football? The answer is an astounding YES.

b- Is he capable of playing in a 2 men CM partnered by an ageing Carrick, nearly zilc workrate from the flanks or upfront and backed by a weak defense? I'd say no. I can't think of many capable of doing that to be honest (apart from maybe Vidal)

6138~~~
He seems obsessed with this 3-5-2 crap which I don't completely blame him for it considering he's got just 1 functional fullback (Rafael is useless these days). Nevertheless if I was him I wouldn't have allowed the January sales to pass without adding at least another full back. This should allow him to revert to 4-3-3 which play at the strengths of this team.

6139~~~
I think the Leicester result has defined a lot of our tactics this season. I think the majority of posters on here felt that it was a freak anomaly initiated by a terrible refereeing decision, whereas I think Van Gaal saw it as proof that playing any deviation of 4-4-2 with the likes of Herrera, Mata and Di Maria together as midfielders was suicide.

Again I don't know why that doesn't mean we couldn't try something more conservative but still with the major attacking components, such as Herrera Blind & Carrick with Mata & Di Maria ahead with Rooney up front.

6140~~~
Quality player but the transfer strategy of lack of it has created some big issues. The teams disjointed and in order to find some balance, there must be further causalities. I suspect Herrera may be one of them.....

6141~~~
No because we need to play with 2 strikers.

If we could bench van Persie AND Falcao it'd solve many problems.

6142~~~
It shouldn't be this lad though, there are plenty of players who were already here who should be gone, also we should not be signing Falcao. It almost like Lvg is playing him to throw it back in the boards face. That he wasn't needed and that them bringing him in has forced him to play a team that is all wrong.

6143~~~
Genuinely have no clue why van Gaal doesn't start this lad. I've never seen him not improve us when he comes on as a sub.

6144~~~
I think the majority of people realise Falcao, RVP & Rooney can't all start in a cohesive team. How long it'll take Van Gaal is a different question.

6145~~~
I wonder why we need to do that to be honest. Would it be that tragic if Falcao decide not to sign with us and RVP ends up handling a transfer request? I mean if I was LVG I would be relieved of that.

6146~~~
That works both ways though. It's true that we aren't as good defensively, but Evra, Ferdinand, Vidic and whomever we had as right-back didn't do it on their own. I'd argue that Atletico's defence is only as good as it is, because they defend well as a team. Why can we not be better as a whole than its parts? I am almost certain if Godin would sign for us that he wouldn't be as good as he is in that team. Point is, Herrera is a more than decent defender for a creative player and his physicality as a problem defensively is a bit nonsense in my eyes.

I'm not arguing that we aren't as good as we were defensively. The point I'm trying to make is, Herrera would give us more defenensively and would be better for the balance. It should be Blind next to Herrera in a 4-4-1-1 and I don't think it would be that bad. I wouldn't play it against City or Chelsea, against those teams I would use the same midfield you suggested; Fellaini and Herrera with Carrick or Blind in the holding role, but against teams like Leicester it would work in my opinion.

6147~~~
Falcao and van Persie were actually running into eachother against Cambridge. It was a farce.

6148~~~
I think the board thought bring LvG in would solve everything, yes it would if they had addressed all the problems we had. They have bought two very good midfielders in Blind/Herrera, a not top class CB Rojo ( I like him but we needed better) and Luke Shaw at LB (who doesn't get injured until he steps over our doorstep). Then the board went and got ADM, because PSG couldn't have him and Falcao, who is a lovely guy, but wanted to go to RM. Because LvG wants to wait and wait for Strootman, the midfield was only partially sorted and we needed a higher class CB. He will hold on and hold on for Hummels and will have his heart broken. We have again tried to show faith in our CB's Jones, Smalling and Evans who are now proving to our detriment to either being injury prone or just not up to it. We have Valencia the utility player who is not great defensively, Herrera had to bail him our on Friday against the mighty Cambridge. He is no longer the winger we bought, his speed is there but he cannot beat a man or put a decent cross. Hells bells we have Phil Jones taking corners, where did that one come from? There will be a massive overhaul again in the summer, so I can see us improving a bit, but not win the league, because, knowing us these  players will get injured and of course they will all have to settle in.

6149~~~
Totally. Herrera offers plenty defensively and he should be paired up with Blind in CM. I don't see him as a problem defensively at all.

----- Herrera Blind
Januzaj Rooney DiMaria
----------- Falcao

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6150~~~
If van Gaal is going to spend the sort of money this Summer as he spent last season he'd better pray we improve more than a "bit". We need to be challenging for the league next year and van Gaal won't get nowhere near the easy ride he's had from the fans this season if it isn't much better next.

6151~~~
Let me rephrase it. Its not Herrera's fault but the team around him. Blind/Carrick are hardly the hardworking quality DM (Keane type) we need, we've got little cover from the flanks, the defense is in shambles and the forward line is slow and hardly hardworking.

It may work if we play something similar to this

Valencia-------Herrera---------Blind-------------Di Maria

-------------------------Mata-----------------------

--------------------------Rooney---------------------------

with Herrera/Di Maria moved as AM against tougher sides to allow more defensive minded players like Young, Fellaini or Carrick in. However that would mean leaving RVP/Falcao out in favor of someone more useful to have around

6152~~~
<a class="username" data-user="4448, @devilish" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4448/">@devilish</a> I agree with that. One of the reasons I want us to sign Schneiderlin or a similar midfielder is that we could use the 4-3-3 or 4-4-1-1. Both Herrera and Mata would be benefitting from that.

6153~~~
What worries me with this board now is that they want the Galatico signing each summer. They will sign a big name, no matter if he is what we went or need. Then LvG being the stubborn beggar that he is will play him out of position just to prove they shouldn't have bought him. It knowing if he wants to play with winger, in that case a Bale would be good, if that is where he plays now. We are all presuming of course that the Ashley Young of this season turns up next season. You just know Ed has the hots for Cavani and then we will be in the same damn boat again.

6154~~~
Never mind next season, he's not going to get an easy ride between now and the end of this one if the team doesn't start playing a lot better. In fact, I'm absolutely certain there will be a majority on here wanting rid if we don't finish in the top four.

6155~~~
I can say that I will. I've supported him from the beginning but I've been losing patience in the last month, he's been incredibly frustrating as a manager making inexplicable decisions that cost us points.

It's apparently a standard curve with him. You're impressed at first and then he becomes increasingly annoying to the point you want rid of him (and the board feel the same because he's supposed to be very difficult to work with). At least that's what Bayern fans told us in the Summer, I believe. Long term clubs benefit from his work but in the short term he's usually poisonous.

6156~~~
The thing that makes me mad is we have the material to play a more balanced side than the ones we've been putting out over the last few months if only the manager grew a pair. If Van Gaal had made the decision to play Rooney upfront ahead of a five men midfield consisting Carrick, Herrera, Fellaini, Januzaj and Di Maria, the players so left out will work hard to bring themselves back in the reckoning. This thing of fitting everyone in, guaranteeing people slots in the team regardless of form is killing us.
Herrera makes us a better attacking force, linking up play and forcing matters plus he is more defensively aware than Mata/RVP/Falcao, we should be trying harder to fit him in.

6157~~~
I think he has badly underestimated the quality of the PL. It isn't Spain/Germany where the top teams have no trouble in the end beating the lower teams. Here any team can beat another on a given day. I'd imagine what has happened in the F.A. Cup this weekend will have opened his eyes even more. Unfortunately it might just have made him think more defensively.

6158~~~
His stubborness will get him fired in the end. It has in some of his other jobs. It will then be up to the board to show some courage. I know they want to give managers time. SAF was a one off. For all his winning LvG has never been at a club for years and years. That was supposed to be one of the reasons we didn't get Jose. Jose would have got a winning mentality into this side.Yes Louis leaves clubs in good shape, but I am not sure if he has bitten off more than he can chew in our case.

6159~~~
I honestly don't think that is what is happening with Herrera or at least I hope it isn't. I also don't think that we force any signing on van Gaal, otherwise we would hear something sooner or later and the same thing that happened at Bayern would happen again.

6160~~~
Very true but I think there will still also be a large portion of fans, like me, willing to give him this season to settle and really begin to judge him next season.

More importantly, I think unless it starts going badly wrong, the matchgoing fans will be behind him for the remainder of the season. There may be the occasional jeer but I don't think we're in any danger of mass vocal unhappiness at Old Trafford.

EDIT: I didn't read that properly first time around. Top 4 is minimum expectation. Looking like we will finish out of the top 4 is what I mean by "going badly wrong".

6161~~~
I don't think Ander was forced on him, I think ADM and Falcao were to an extent, but who would say no to them. However the fact he seem determined to repackage ADM and is playing Falcao obviously until he scores a goal in the last game of the season. We all know the sort of players still needed to blend with the new ones bought this season. However, I can just see the board throwing a curve ball in there that will completely destabalise everything LvG wants to do. Ed Woodward wants us to be on a par with Real and that is what they do, buy the latest shiny object whether it is needed or not.

6162~~~
I'm not sure, Falcao has had a hard time getting into the team and his inability to find some form or score goals, for example against Cambridge, will see him probably soon enough on the bench again. With di Maria it really looks like he has no idea how to use him.

Di Maria was singled out by van Gaal before we signed him and he was explaining why he sold Welbeck and signed Falcao. One was simply not as prolific as the other to him. Van Gaal also went on the say after the transfer window, how great it is how the club and board supports him and how he could just sign the players he wants. Moyes seemed to get the players he wanted as well, he just took longer to decide who he wants. I really don't see from what we know, that the board sign players the managers don't want. Let's wait and see, the scenario you are describing doesn't have to come true, I think Herrera will improve and see more match practice this year.

6163~~~
I don't think Woodward or the Glazers would hesitate given how they treated the annointed David Moyes, I actually think his sacking would be swifter and more ruthless than David's. The fact is, a gifted manager like him shouldn't be having problems coaxing performances out of a squad like ours and it's his fault that he didn't look to do more to solve our defensive issues. His major problem is that he can't come to terms with the decline of his boy wonder and with a defence like ours we can not carry one let alone two underperforming, one paced strikers. We need pace, trickery and energy and usually when you surround Rooney with that he will score bucket loads.

6164~~~
LVG publically stated that "we have to play 352 because we dont have op qaulity wingers like di maria".  He actually said the prior to us getting Di Maria.  He then plays Di Maria every where but wide and says we play 352 due to "lack of balance".

He contradicts himself a lot in what he says in interviews.  I think alot of this is a.) the language issue and b.) he doesnt want to call out some of the centre backs as not been good enough to play in a 4, or that the likes of young and valencia cant play as a traditional full back.

So whist he's protecting the team he's providing some fickle fans and the media with a stick to beat him with.

As for Ander being forced on him.  Out of everyfootballer in the whole squad i would think that Herrera would be right up Van Gaals street.

Unfortunatley for herrera is role in the leicester collapse has maybe lead Van Gaal to think Herrera and a young inexpreianced back 3 is a recipe for disaster.  Now we have rojo, shaw and rafa back plus carrick and blind then i think we'll see more of Herrera - possibly starting on saturday. 

I think one of the main issues is finding a position for wayne rooney!

6165~~~
I think LvG is actually popular with the players and he cares about their welfare. If reports about this summer tour are anything to go by. He has asked and has supposedly got it vastly reduced. He wasn't happy about the number of games when he came in last summer. That is where there is a big clash with the money men at the club, the other commercial commitments the players have to carry out on a day today basis when maybe they should be resting.

6166~~~
I agree with this and think that in hindsight, He probably wouldnt have signed Falcao. But then again its only a loan and it allows him to use Wilson sparingly for now.

6167~~~
Again, qouting he said that "i dont like rooney as a numer 9"

I personally think Rooney has been well below the standard required.  His form in part has been overlooked and excused because in playing out of position or atleast in a new position he does have an excuse.

However, in making him captin, then saying he doesnt fancy him as a 9 its almost like we are creating a position for him to play in which is currently detrimental to the team.

Id like to see herrera start and id like to see rooney play off falcao with Di maria wide.  Mata would then have to miss out but so be it.

6168~~~
I do understand Van Gaal's problem. He has three potentially great centre forwards and nowhere near enough games for all of them to shine. I personally think he should take the hard line and rotate Van Persie, Rooney and Mata and just stick to a 4-3-2-1 and forget about Falcao. The latter was brought in to instantly make an impact and potentially be the difference between 4th and 5th, however he just isn't showing the form and fitness to be this player. He isn't a player we particularly need to worry about upsetting and if he earns us a few points from the bench that could potentially be the difference, he'll have been worth the fee.

That way you could find consistency with 3 of Blind, Fellaini, Carrick & Herrera behind 2 of Rooney, Mata & Di Maria behind 1 of Rooney & RVP. That's 8 player's fighting for 6 positions which to me would be a good balance between consistency and competition.

Obviously the likes of Wilson, Januzaj, Falcao used most often from the bench.

I do also agree with the above though, finding a position for Wayne Rooney has been a problem for our last 3 managers. He isn't a great number 9, isn't a great number 10 and isn't a great central midfielder (although he has had many exceptional games in all these positions, just without any consistency). He is above average in all these positions and works really hard but he really is position-less.

6169~~~
Doesn't matter who you have up front, the team isn't balanced and we're not creating a lot of chances for the strikers. I mean, if you've got 3 defenders and 2 wingbacks, all of which have the ball for large parts of the game then you're not going to create much in my opinion. 

I'll be honest, we look better defensively with a back 3 but I'd much rather watch entertaining football. Last 6 weeks or so its been like watching Utd from last season.

6170~~~
I think that is the fact that is getting to people most.

6171~~~
Hardly we were putting in cross after cross last season we are in no way having he ball on the flanks as much to even put in a cross!!

6172~~~
Valencia gets the ball quite a lot, but cannot decide what to do with it.

6173~~~
Replace the aimless crosses of last season with aimless possession of the football this season. Same net result. Boring football.

6174~~~
I'd rather take my chances with 30 crosses and Falcao and RVP in the box than our CBs seeing more of the ball.......

6175~~~
I still can't this Ander doesn't play more, in fact I would go as far as saying it is almost criminal.

6176~~~
He’s with Blind our best buy this summer, and for me, he solved more problems for us than Di Maria and Falcao, and LVG is an absolute j**k not playing him week in week out. He’s not worse than Mata and would do better for us than him or Rooney.

The fact is that LVG is afraid to choose between Roo and RVP upfront and decided to play them both in a system where he can play all his big ‘names’

LVG is seeking for balance for his team, but he has the material to do so. So yeah the team might be ‘worse’ individually, but far better as a unit.

I still think that he can be a tremendous player under LVG, but he prefers a striker in this position, a number 10, or even a player like Strootman injured for the last 12 months… At Arsenal he would be better than Ramsey, at Pool better than all this team, and he’s staying on the bench for us

I had a lot of doubt about how LVG will select his players as his recruitment seemed to be less balanced to needed, but I trusted him, but it’s fair to say that we’re still far from a top side and are struggling….

LVg, do your f***** job and play a decent team. You’ve got Di Maria and Herrera ready to explose midfields with pace and aggression and good player upfront… but no he still plays his philosophical players

6177~~~
I honestly don't see why we cant play Herrera/Fellaini/Di Maria and Carrick/Blind in the same midfield. 

While Mata is great on his day, he lacks the industry a diamond needs. Herrera can play the AMC position while adding creativity with work rate too.

6178~~~
I said this in another thread and had some right moaning come my way.  Fact is, we have not being any better of late compared to last season.  A blip, I hope.

6179~~~
I said something like this the other day, and was called mental.

I believe Di Maria was a 'marquee' signing. As much for Woodward's benefit as van Gaal's. He wouldn't say 'no' obviously, and I doubt 'force' was needed to persuade van Gaal, but he isn't treating him like a player he hand-picked and had a proper £60 million plan for.

Falcao, in my opinion, was 100% a PR exercise, and Herrera just seems like a long-term club target who effectively was part of the package for any united manager this summer (a bit like Shaw.)

6180~~~
i agree that the shaw and herrera deals where done prior to appointing Van Gaal and where finalised without even discussing it with him.

However, i dont for one minuted think Van Gaal would accept players being signed on his behalf.  I have already mentioned in this thread that prior to signing Di Maria, Van Gaal named him as one of his dream signings.  He also said that he doesnt fancy Rooney as a number 9, clealry had the same opinion on Welbeck and Hernandez and thats why Falcao was signed.

In his first press oncference he whinged about the rediculous summer tour and made comment that people at United are more interested in making money thatn they are about a winning team.  I am absolutley certain he will have total say in signing coming in and out.

6181~~~
LVGs decision to play Fellaini against Cambridge was the correct one, he was very good when he cam on vs QPR and also we needed his height and physique for set pieces. 

Herrera scored a nice goal with Yeovil, but he was generally poor in that game. Also for the people that say he didn't have any chances, last time he played 2-3 games in a row, he was also poor and didn't convince.

6182~~~
Herrera would excel at Chelsea.

He's an obviously good player. For me you have him, Carrick and Mata as a three, playing the roles Cesc, Matic and Oscar do for Chelsea.

Blind as the fourth choice rotation option. Ideally you'd have our best midfielder AdM in there but for the sake of balance we have to waste him out wide.

6183~~~
Herrera would add a bit of tempo to the side. I think we need him.

6186~~~
It seems like LVG had no say in this transfer. Baffling. Let him play. We paid 30 million. I'm actually pissed off about Herrera and di Maria. You can talk philosophy all you want and trying to learn the English game but LVG is having a complete mare handling these two.

6187~~~
Has his interview from the presser popped up anywhere yet?

6188~~~
I recorded the press conference on MUTV. It was a nice interview, he understands that at Manchester United you don't always get to play. That it is a big squad, so sometimes you have to wait. That you have to take your chances when they arrive. Also that he considers himself a good professional and will always be available to help his teammates when needed. Said nice things about Michael Carrick as well.Nice lad.

6189~~~
Thanks. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> That sounds promising, as opposed to all the negative stories about LvG not rating him or that we would sell him as soon as possible. I wonder if LvG has told him that he has a big place for him once he gets the all mighty balance right.

6190~~~
It was promising. He seemed very relaxed. He still only looks about 15 and that he should be at home doing his homework.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6191~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's hard to believe he's 25. Hopefully the fact he was part of the presser indicates that he'll start tomorrow.

6192~~~
Maybe thats the problem, van Gaal thinks he is just a young 16 year old from the academy that he is easing in.

6193~~~
Could be.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6194~~~
He has to leave.

6195~~~
We'll struggle, He'll come on and play well, then be back on the bench for the next game. Story of the season.

6196~~~
I'm just happy it's not Mata or Fellaini keeping him out. Less hate directed their way.

But it's an awful waste of money at this stage. If he doesn't trust him then sell him now. Bilbao having a poor season, maybe we'd get half our money back.

6197~~~
Oh, no doubt.

6198~~~
It was never going to work out was it? I mean, he's an actual proper midfielder who runs and passes.

That kind of nonsense isn't accepted at United.

6199~~~
Hasn't Fellaini been doing that for us?

6200~~~
If I was him, I would hang on. The way LvG is managing us, he might be going first.

6201~~~
I guess it wasn't just Fergie after all

6202~~~
I don't get this logic, Shaw is getting game time when fit. How are you convinced that it is 100% down to LVG and nothing to do with the player?

6203~~~
Even under the tactical genius Van Gaal?

6204~~~
Must be something else. Any stories about his life outside football? Because if you look at his games for us, he should play.

6205~~~
Really disappointed for him, our best "proper" CM and he never starts. Players have left after one season for that reason alone.

6206~~~
Strange stuff. I'm far from his biggest fan but I've no idea why van Gaal isn't playing him more often, especially with Carrick out.

6207~~~
They should both be starting today.

6208~~~
Weird. He's one midfielder I really like watching, just like Kagawa. Doesn't look good for him.

Yeah, he will score and set up two goals and van Gaal will demote him to reserves.

6210~~~
Mind blowing, I'm starting to get really annoyed with his absence to be honest.

6211~~~
I honestly don't know what to say. I've defended, and backed, LVG all season long. But his recent decisions are just baffling, and impossible to defend.

6212~~~
there were some rumours about him partying and enjoying nightlife in Manchester i think. Which totally surprises me, he seems like a top pro, never heard something bad about him before.

6213~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6214~~~
Apparently van Gaal got pissed off at a reporter for asking about why he hasn't played and van Gaal just said the same questions are asked every time about whoever is missing and didn't answer properly. 

Its something I'm sure everyone wants to know. Why isnt our most talented, energetic, creative and to be honest, best performing in the few games he's had midfielder not starting games?

6215~~~
Looking back at a few posts when we signed him, you'd swear he was going to be a player that's going to transform our midfield. Now he can't even make the starting 11. Depressing.

6216~~~
this - can't figure it out.

6217~~~
I agree. Yet for some reason Van Gaal see's Rooney as a midfielder, when he's arguably been our biggest goal threat.

6218~~~
To be fair, every time he gets subbed on he does completely change the game for our benefit and transforms our midfield so to speak, so we weren't wrong... Just his game time is so limited for whatever reason.

6219~~~
Isn't his girlfriend supposed to be over here now, so might be happy staying at home now, but tbh he doesn't seem that sort.

6220~~~
You should be prepared for not seeing him much until the end of season. I genuinely don't expect him to start a single game before the end of season.

6221~~~
Absolutely criminal the way LVG has handled him.

6222~~~
Squad player, Which is a tragedy in that it means he misses out and we miss Rooney up front.

6223~~~
In his interview yesterday on MUTV he seemed to understand what was happening and was happy to get any game time. He will as likely come on today and either make the team better or at least make sure we win. That is of course the defence doesn't all get injured or some pillock gets sent off for something.

6224~~~
I can only assume it has something to do with the match fixing thing,no other logical explanation.

6225~~~
Yeah it's becoming really annoying that he's put on the bench so often. He's one of the very few players in this team that has a creative, forward-thinking knack in his game, yet he's consistently being shunted to the bench. You said you wanted to create more scoring opportunities, Louis, so why the hell do you not use a creative midfield player?

6226~~~
Its plain weird.

6227~~~
Carrick out, Rooney in midfield, Herrera on the bench. Does anybody on here really believes that Wayne is a better midfielder than Ander?

6228~~~
If he can't get near the side with almost no midfield, how will he do after the summer when we (presumably) buy a midfielder or two? At this point I'd be quite surprised if he's either not a low level rotation player or gone altogether by this time next season.

6229~~~
Van Gaal is trying his best to be sacked, that's the only logical reason. Our only striker who can score goals plays in midfield while the midfielders twitch their arses on the bench.

6230~~~
Rooney in midfield so LVG can shoehorn in the star names up top who stink the place out every week. The sooner he's sacked the better.

6231~~~
I think very few think that on here. The prevailing opinion is that Rooney should be our lone no. 9 and have Herrera in midfield. Rooney is a striker, end of.

6232~~~
But shouldn't he be excluded from the team if that's the case? Why would LvG care if he performs on the pitch?

6233~~~
Why though, isn't the guy at Athletico involved and he plays. James Ducker said he didn't think that sort of thing would influence LvG. I am beginning to think that he has to get those strikers scoring and will pick two strikers for it to happen. One of those strikers is taking a good midfielders place. He will play on Tuesday. Also after what has happened to Carrick, the same better not happen to Rooney from playing in midfield. He is having to put a lot of effort playing there.

6234~~~
Rooney has done very well coming from midfield and provides the strength that Blind lacks. I dont see the problem with that selection.

Its the Falcao and RVP up front selection that seems strange

6235~~~
Van Gaal should leave for not playing our best midfielder out of pure idiocy.

6236~~~
Rooney has been awful, he keep trying the Stevie G hollywood passes and doesn't have the talent in that position to do it. We now have two strikers who cannot score and someone who actually might isolated in midfield.

6237~~~
I thought he'd get a start today, very strange that seemingly everyone is preferred to him.

6238~~~
His passing certainly hasnt been great, but his runs and support of the attack has been very useful. And more importantly LVG seems to want power in midfield especially when Blind plays there, and I'd take Rooney next to him in a 2 over Fellaini any day of the week

6239~~~
I am even more surprised that Mata hasn't started, at home, after bring rested against Cambridge away. I think we can now guess who will be playing on Tuesday.

6240~~~
We have scored 5 goals in 6 games I think, so it isn't working. Wayne loves scoring goals, that is the glory part of the game, not disappearing into the midfield. He will get fed up before long, especially if the strikers aren't scoring. Of course they will now go and score a bucketload today.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6241~~~
He could be our Fabregas..

6242~~~
He could, but he won't. I'd rather he was Wayne Rooney our record chasing striker.

6243~~~
Good point about Mata, hopefully Herrera is a lock for a start on Tuesday at least. It's this need to play both Falcao and RvP that is hampering things.

6244~~~
A shame he isn't getting in the side. For the next match against Cambridge he should definitely play.

We should also drop one of our strikers for the away match against west ham and put Herrera in midfield to give us the numerical advantage.

6245~~~
So it seems like he isn't competing with Fellaini. Who'd have thought?

6246~~~
I feel sorry for him

6247~~~
Bit annoyed with him being called the new Kagawa when he's shown a lot more than Kagawa so far.

6248~~~
Same here. The most bafling fact is that the team plays better with him on the pitch.

6249~~~
It's really annoying. You have to wonder whether these "United fans" have even watched him play.

6250~~~
He will get his chance. Hopefully a strong showing against Cambridge will see him showcase against west ham is some shape or form.

6251~~~
We're spoiling his career really. LvG for me is as bad as any bad manager I've had at work.

6252~~~
Maybe Ander is the easy going type that doesn't make a fuss, easier to drop then the big egos of Rooney and RvP. He will play against Cambridge and as you say a good showing will help him.

6253~~~
I liked Kagawa a lot but Herrera is considerably better. As you say, he's shown a lot more so far.

6254~~~
Yep. I loved Kagawa but he was pretty useless defensively, didn't get many assists, didn't score, and didn't try enough through passes. He had a lot of great touches that ultimately produced nothing though, if I'm being harsh. Pretty much the complete opposite of Herrera who is productive with goals and assists, works really hard, gets stuck in, and probably has the best eye for a through pass in the team

6255~~~
I just hope LVG has the balls to drop either Falcao or RVP so that we play a 3 man midfield away from home. We clearly need the protection for our back four and Herrera has been excellent in his workrate/tackling ever since joining. It really does baffle me as to why he doesn't get to play. Rooney in midfield is just not the long term answer.

6256~~~
Herrera should have partnered blind in the cm.

6257~~~
I think LVG' decision not to play him today has well been vindicated. We played really good today after we scored the first goal, albeit against the weakest team in the league. I thought Rooney made outstanding passes today. Herrera will start Tuesday for sure and his time will come but I don't feel he has done enough to merit a place in the first XI yet

6258~~~
I don't think he is like Kagawa, he is much better but the whole melodramatic and over the top reaction by some on here is similar. You have to wonder at times if people support United or Ander/Kagawa.

I'd love to see him in the side though for van Persie or Falcao with Rooney being pushed forward.

6259~~~
He should be starting over Rooney in midfield.

6260~~~
Kagawa comparisons are annoying. This guy actually does well whenever he plays. He would add so much to our side.. I hope like Januzaj, he is slowly reintroduced back into the first XI.

6261~~~
I presume the manager has been talking to him and he is happy with the situation. If yes, then he must be happy getting his playing time.

6262~~~
It's obviously United, it's just people feel we would be so much better if that individual played actually. We look better as a team going forward whenever he's on the pitch and that's why everyone complains when he's not starting.

6263~~~
I agree with wanting him to play more, I do too. It is people saying if we aren't going to play him all the time then we should sell him that have me confused. I sure as hell would rather have him as a squad option than not have him at all. Why would you want to sell him just because he doesn't always play? What is that going to solve? That for me is clearly wanting the best for Ander, not United.

6264~~~
No way in hell they should sell him. He knows he is now a squad player, he has said as much. It is us I think has the problem, not him.

6265~~~
Oh, well yeah I agree with that. Never understood people saying stuff like that about herrera, mata or whoever else. Great having them in the squad if we aren't using them as starters, it's just annoying they aren't starting. Selling them would be stupidity.

6266~~~
How much longer are we going to persist with a world class striker in MF and a capable MF on the bench?  I don't think I'm exaggerating in saying that Rooney's performance today was worthy of tears (okay maybe I am).  He can offer so much more up front and here he is trying to play like Fabregas.

I mentioned in the match thread that as long as RVP and Falcao are scoring, LVG (if this is the lineup he prefers) feels justified in playing Rooney as a MF instead of sitting 1 or 2 of the 3 down and giving him a spot up top.  So as long as there are goals going in, Herrera is kept out of the picture.

Very strange, because LVG called Herrera's goal against Yeovil 'class.'  It was only one word in an interview, but it was a word he didn't have to use.  Is LVG really not keen on Herrera or is the match fixing issue compromising his future prospects with the team?

6267~~~
Who is actually comparing him to Kagawa apart from on here? Stupid comparison IMO.

Anyways, back to Herrera. Felt bad for him not even getting on the pitch today, should be starting in midfield ahead of Rooney in reality.

6268~~~
Play him over Rooney, it's just so simple. Play Rooney as a striker or in the hole only.

6269~~~
The match fixing stuff shouldn't be coming into it. He should be playing him and worrying about that later. I think it is more as you say the playing two up front, now if one of RvP or Falcao aren't here next season, it might all change again.

6270~~~
That's more like exploiting a guy because of his personality rather than being fair if I look from that angle. I always hated seeing that in any club in any discipline. If a guy can provide something the other just can't, then let him play.

I hope he plays against Cambridge as well. Anyway, it's obvious that he's adding that "natural" bit of a modern midfielder that Rooney will never provide as a whole package in 20 years, and LVG will have to realize that soon enough for a more regular basis.

6271~~~
Rooney won't be chuffed if when he get called up for England they decide to play him in midfield. Not when that is another goal scoring record he is after.

6272~~~
It reflects in his play, he's always a little more reserved in midfield and less daring than he is as a striker. Whereas Herrera presses forward and moves quickly, which is exactly what we need. Saw it today with Blind playing that way

6273~~~
I like Blind. Moves the ball and is quicker than Carrick.

6274~~~
Agreed, just posted in the Blind thread that he should be starting most of our matches. Think he and Herrera could pair nicely. It might be a little light against the better midfields but you can add Carrick in for those matches. A player like Pogba with those 2 would be amazing

6275~~~
He didn't get on but his tweet made MOTD.

6276~~~
I personally haven't been all that impressed by him. Looked good at times and frustrating at other times. His lack of minutes though, I find it really confusing.

6277~~~
I see the Kagawa and Welbeck fanbois found their new favorite. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6278~~~
Whats this about an interview?
He said his attitude hasn't been the best and that he needs to improve it.

I read it on FB and dunno if it's true.....If it is, top marks to the lad for being so open and honest

Reading fanzines, there were stories about him being late and not impressing in training. Just didn't believe it much until I this interview thing. 

Anyone know if it's true?

6279~~~
I read on twitter that he has missed some team meetings and physio appointments etc. Dunno if it has been posted in here already though. Could all be complete lies too.

6280~~~
It was in fanzines for the last two months...I didn't believe it but, I don't know if this interview is true.

Apologies btw to anyone who reads this. I'm not trying to stir

6281~~~
what herrera needs to do is to commit himself into the team play, instead of pushing for his own game.   i like the herrera in preseason but do not like the herrera after the 1st qpr game.  this is already mid-season gone through and time could run out easily.   he should have to learn from fellaini & januzaj, and not from mata.

6282~~~
What does any of this even mean<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

6283~~~
just make it easier, he needs to commit himself as a team player and he deoesn't, yet at least

6284~~~
Can you clear it up further by also explaining what this means?

And to save time, whatever you are about to write to explain yourself, also write another post explaining what that is supposed to be saying.

6285~~~
And you have first hand evidence to prove this I imagine? Since your post makes me feel that you are convinced of your opinion.

6286~~~
It's not a case of comparing Herrera's playing style to Kagawa, it's the fan reaction. Last year when Kagawa was being left out the team people wanted blood. It's similar with Herrera, we win 3-1 with a decent performance and people are still crying about Herrera not being in the team. 

I have nothing against him, I think he's a very neat and tidy player. He does well in his cameo appearances at the end of the game. But I still don't think he has done enough to warrant a first team place. It might be a reputation thing, it would be very hard to drop Rooney, RVP, Falcao or Di Maria. Especially when they're not performibg particularly bad. 

He should be challenging for the role that Januzaj played yesterday. Although he has Mata and probably Fellaini ahead of him. 

I'm assuming he will play on Tuesday, let's hope he puts in a good shift and can move up the pecking order.

6287~~~
With Januzaj getting into form, we could try sth like this but Herrera will probably play only in fa cups. He could be the first name on team sheet in every team in the world. Does Herrera know Van Gaal's daughters?

     Blind
diMAria-Herrera
   Januzaj(Mata)
Rooney- Falcao(Wilson)

6288~~~
So the Barcas and the Chelseas are desperate to get their hands on Herrera?  And he'd be first name on their teamsheets? He was struggling to get starts for Bilbao at the start of last season.

I'm confused why we're not using him more after paying so much for him, but the hyperbole is just getting crazier and crazier. We didn't need to fight off the giants of Europe to get him.

6289~~~
Come on now.

6290~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6291~~~
No he couldn't, he wouldn't be in most elite sides first 11 (Chelsea, City, Arsenal, Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus, Bayern). That's not downplaying his ability, he's a very good player who is exactly what we need long term and has potential to improve. I wouldn't say he's as essential to the side as what people make out though.

6292~~~
I think that was more to do with getting hassle from the fans for wanting to move. I think he then got in the side and all that settled down. Although I do agree that saying he would be the first name on every team in the worlds teamsheet is over the top. He should be on ours or at least coming on as a sub.

6293~~~
In less than 800 minutes he has three goals and three assist. All open play, I think. Considering our form its weird that a contribution like that is not rewarded.

If Herrera continued with a contribution like that, with regular gametime, Van Gaal would struggle to defend a purchase of his friend, Strootman.

6294~~~
He shouldn't even be looking at Strootman now. If he does it's to keep a promise to him and not thinking about Manchester United's needs.

6295~~~
Beating the bottom side 3-1 doesn't make the team perfect, so it's only fair to discuss improvements - it's a forum after all.

The way I see it, what LvG seems to be doing would suit Herrera perfectly. Possession football and high pressing. He's done well almost every time when given the chance, so it's puzzling why he's continuously being left out. Almost feels like LvG decided from the beginning that he didn't fancy him and sticks with it, much like his 5-3-2. Seems like he's now accepting that 5-3-2 might be the perfect formation - wonder how long it'll take before he gives Herrera a proper chance in the team.

6296~~~
For what it's worth, barca were interested I him for a while. The Bilbao thing is also completely due to the transfer thing and the manager being a bit resentful towards him, but he quickly found his way back in the team and played really well again.
Thought obviously he wouldn't start at any team in the world. He would get games and be a squad player at even the best teams though, as he is pretty unique in his style and can help any team.

6297~~~
Herrera seems to be getting rated higher and higher in here with every game he misses!

I don't think LVG rates the defensive side of his game. Plus he loves a risky pass which regularly loses possession. Di Maria seems to be the only player in the current system afforded the right to take such risks.

6298~~~
I never said the team was perfect... But out of interest who would you drop from yesterday's team to play Herrera? 

The way I see it: Rooney won't get dropped because LVG has stated this. Di Maria is our best player, when he is fit he should always play, RVP and Falcao both played well together for the first time in a while, and Januzaj was our brightest spark in the second half. 

I would be surprised if LVG plays him against West Ham next week. There has been a lot of talk that he wasn't a LVG signing which makes sense why he has to prove himself more than others. Plus I've seen people on here mention that some fanzines have stated that he has missed some sessions and his attitude isn't up to scratch.

6299~~~
Is it not at all possible that maybe van Gaals plans stretch further than this season, and he'll infact become an important player in a different system once we have a settled squad?

Who could he have possibly played instead of yesterday? Januzaj? So when Januzaj doesn't play we get worried van Gaals wasting his potential. Di Maria? Why would we spend so much on a world class player if we aren't going to play him? Falcao? Then we moan that Falcao isn't playing. 

Contrary to popular belief, we can only field 11 players a game, and games are something we are also short of this season.

6300~~~
I was just wondering how he is late for sessions? He always seems to be driven to thetraining ground by either Mata or De Gea, in fact he has said De Gea is his chauffer. It is just strange how he would be late.

6301~~~
Honestly have no idea, he seems to be a complete pro so I'm surprised these rumours are coming out. I've seen it mentioned on here a few times, also on the United Rant podcast.

6302~~~
Problem is, it only takes one comment, even if untrue and it will fly round Manchester like the plague. From recent interviews I think he might be realising he has to knuckle down, but he just doesn't come across as someone who wouldn't put the work in. Probably just someone shit stirring.

6303~~~
He should be one of the 5-6 names on the team sheet every week. We miss his passing, vision, and pressing when he's not on the pitch. He's the type of players that makes everyone around him better. 

For whatever reason it seems lvg has lost confidence in him. i think it will take rooney falling on his face in midfield against the likes of city or chelsea for lvg to see the light and ditch the Rooney in midfield expirement.

6304~~~
I think the teams mentioned would use him certainly more than us so far. He will be the essential part of our team in years coming no matter what. He is actually much better than I thought he could be. Player with his work ethic and ability both defensively and attacking wise would start, okay, for ALMOST every side and would certainly have more starts.. Just because the insane manager needs to have his balance and have his fav players he doesn't play. He is everything what we need to start with when we setting up the midfield... and it is frustrating to see manager thinking otherwise.. but he will be back in the side soon..

6305~~~
Your new £30m midfielder, and one whose acquisition addressed a lack in the squad at that, should not be contenting himself with a meagre six league starts come the start of February. No unit of players is ever perfectly settled; if Louis can't learn to juggle he shall be Woodward's human canon before he knows it.  


It's quite simple really, employ Rooney as a striker and start Herrera in his stead in CM. 

I have very little patience for Van Gaal's complaints about imbalance, what with his proclivity to exacerbate the problem.

6306~~~
We might have to get the manager sectioned instead.

6307~~~
Yesterday made me really angry, not that he didn't start, but Leicester were there for the taking and he messed about with the substitutions instead of putting Ander on to crank up the pressure on Leicester. Arsenal's result today has not helped my mood. Only Anderson flying to Brazil has cheered me up.

6308~~~
So players should get games based on their price tag now, should they? Well if it's all about the money, you're now asking him to drop one of our 3 biggest earners, so that's a no go. I suppose in your suggested philosophy, Januzaj won't be getting any game time whatsoever.

We currently have 2 full backs and 2 natural wingers in our side, and the 2 wingers are shite wingers. We have an imbalance, it's clear, and that is why we persist with this formation. It allows us to fit Rooney, van Persie, Falcao and Di Maria in the same side without being completely exposed defensively. In the current situation, it's hard to fit Herrera in, but during the summer when we can recruit wide players and change formation, Herrera's chances to play will increase, he fits the long term philosophy and will be a good player for years to come. We pay money for years of service, not months.

6309~~~
I think in this case the price tag should be ignored. That buy out clauses for you. If we were buying from elsewhere we would be saying we had a bargain. Bilbao overprice their players as they really don't want to sell them.

6310~~~
No one says he's the new Robson, but he is certainly better in midfield than Rooney and offers more than most of our other midfielders. So to see him more often would certainly be beneficial for our team in many fans' views

6311~~~
<a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a>,

see this:

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/ander-herrera-2014-2015-performances.392782/page-130#post-16820179">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/ander-herrera-2014-2015-performances.392782/page-130#post-16820179</a>

6312~~~
He messed with the substitutions to switch to 442/4231 for the last half an hour, which would suggest that playing with wingers is in his plans. Id much, much rather see that, than see Herrera get a few pointless minutes. Leicester weren't there for the taking, they'd already been taken. We were 3-0 up.

6313~~~
and now i'm really convinced publicity firms are active in caf to act on their client(s) behalf

6314~~~
I just hate the "we won, so don't cry for a different team"-argument.. It's the same as "we lost, stop knee-jerking". Basically there's no time to consider changes if you ask some people.

About who to drop, I'd play Herrera in midfield instead of Rooney. I have no idea what Rooney is doing there. Who'd then play in attack is for a different thread, but as I see it Herrera is a far better midfielder than Rooney. At times we desperate lack pace in our attacks and I think Herrera is one of our best (if not the best) players when it comes to pass-and-move football. He always seem to think a couple of passes ahead and be on the move before the ball has even left his feet.

6315~~~
One of Falcao or Van Persie. Or both. They were both ok, neither were great, both are relatively old, been shite for the vast majority of the season, offer pretty much the same thing going forward in that if they don't score then they are relatively useless. We would be much better as a team if we just pushed Rooney up to his normal position as a striker, and put in Herrera in midfield, or both Herrera and mata in for RvP and Falcao. Neither have impressed at all.

6316~~~
I truly am baffled by some of the comments in this thread. Not once has anyone said he's world class or that he's the answer to all our problems. He's being treated really unfairly and he's a much better player than some of you give him credit for.

What he is, and what no one can deny, is arguably one of our best midfielders. Is Fellaini and Blind better than him in central midfield? No. Is Di Maria better? Probably but we've yet to see the best of him.

He's certainly better than Rooney though, which I'm sure even the biggest Herrera-basher has to admit.

6317~~~
Does he add height on corners? Is he a physical presence in midfield? Is he able to bring balls down on his chest and keep possession from kicks from the goalkeeper? In this current side, he's not automatically a better fit for Fellaini all the time. As for Blind, they perform different roles so aren't particularly battling out for the same position. He's not better than Rooney either, but then again we just seem to ignore all the qualities Rooney possesses to fit our own agendas so that's a moot point in the grand scheme of things.

6318~~~
Tbf, someone on this page said he'd be the first name on the team sheet for every team in the world.

6319~~~
You are right, some people have gone overboard, but I just think the lad is a lot better than what we have had recently. Our game seems to pick up when he is on the pitch. If LvG doesn't like risk takers then I am not sure he is a good fit as a manager of Manchester United. A lot of our play in the past has been based on willing to take a risk. We have never been pragmatic.

6320~~~
Never heard this - always struck me as a guy with a great attitude. Any links?

6321~~~
That just doesn't seem like him at all. Sounds more like a case of chinese whispers.

6322~~~
He isn't. Other than one mental comment that one of the usual suspects has quite rightly picked up on there isn't a great deal said about Herrera that is at all hyperbolic. The last time he started a game he helped us win it so there isn't a lot more he can do on the field.

He's a good player that should be playing more football than he is. This feeling is compounded by the awful reality of watching one of the world's best strikers frustrate in a position we seemingly brought Herrera here to play. Manchester United logic since about 2010.

6323~~~
I think Fellaini is a good player but he can barely do any of these except for the latter which I'm not sure why you're even mentioning as a skill. It's like a juggling act. If you're saying he's right for the hoof ball style of play, then fair enough, he is.

He is better than Rooney. What does Rooney offer as a midfielder that Herrera doesn't? Hollywood balls and goals from midfield (which you'd expect as he is a striker) is all I can think of. He's bang average in midfield. I really can't fathom the idea that there are people who think Rooney is a viable option in midfield. He does a job but that's all it is. Herrera is an actual midfielder and if you think Rooney is better there, then you're either deluded about Rooney or you don't rate Herrera.

Rooney has been poor in midfield. How can anyone not see that? I agree that he may not be a better fit than Fellaini in certain games but then we should play Fellaini in midfield and push Rooney up top where is actually brilliant and was at the start of the season before VG decided he needed to fit all the three big name strikers in the starting 11. Play Herrera/Fellaini in Rooney's position (personally I would go for Herrera because he brings that dynamism in our midfield which we will lack with a Blind-Fellaini combo) and then play two up top between Falcao/RvP and Rooney. That will give us so much better balance than what we are seeing right now.

6325~~~
Yes but that's hyperbole and I don't think anyone, even the poster himself, seriously believes that. It does cancel out some of the shite spouted by the opposing Herrera bashers though.

Can't say I disagree with any of that.

6326~~~
There isn't a way to shuffle the team around without another thread getting bumped by posters bewildered by why their favourite player isn't getting picked. 

The reality of the situation is that we have such a strong squad that Herrera is struggling to get game time. If Rooney gets bumped up to #10 or striker, the Mata or Falcao thread will be bumped with posters demanding their return instead. Whichever thread it may be, the same posts get more vocal with every passing week that said player isn't getting picked.

6327~~~
I don't know where you saw people complaining about Falcao not playing. He has been a regular fixture in the starting 11 whenever fit. In fact most on here would prefer to see one of RvP/Falcao dropped with Rooney taking their place and Herrera in Rooney's position. Would add much better bite to our attack and give much needed balance to our team.

6328~~~
I don't think so, if we moved Rooney up top and benched RvP or Falcao and played Herrera, an actual CM, in midfield I think most would be happy.

6329~~~
That is the problem with lack of games in a season. Next season there will be lots of games to go round, even if they are Europa League games.

6330~~~
But the problem here is one of our best attackers is being played out of position and we are nullifying a lot of his threat when he plays up front. So we are wasting two good players by either playing them in a completely wrong position or not playing them at all.

6331~~~
Hmm, Rooney has done well in midfield for us IMO. Okay, he's not been Fabregas but that is not his role, he provides some power from midfield. Also his two goals against Newcastle show how effective he can be when he is running from deep. I agree, Herrera is good link up player, his first thought is usually to go forward and then receive the ball again. But we also have to take into account what match we are playing. Yesterday against Leicester at home, I would be pretty pissed off if we had played with one striker, for some unknown reason LVG doesn't want to play Rooney up front, so it made sense why Herrera didn't play. 

He should play against Cambridge but I can't see him playing against West Ham next week. No doubt Fellaini will be in there for his height- which again makes perfect sense why he should play over Herrera. 

Disagree with you on that. RVP is our top scorer it wouldn't make sense to drop him. Falcao is starting to find some form and showing glimpses of what we first expected, I can't see him getting dropped for the sake of Herrera either. I think both RVP and Falcao had good games yesterday it was one of the few times this season we have managed to create chances for them and they both scored. Hardly a coincidence. Wouldn't make sense to drop either now that they are finding some form.  

I'm not sure to be honest, like I said I have seen it mentioned on here a few times and in the United Rant podcast. No idea if there is any truth in the rumours, I agree he seems like a top guy with a good attitude.

6332~~~
Agree with that, which is why it makes no sense when people suggest we sell him. He will get plenty of games next season.

6333~~~
Perhaps I'm referring to a vocal minority when I say this, but we've already been through the same thing with Falcao, di Maria, Januzaj, Carrick, and even Shaw and Rafael to a lesser extent (although admittedly that was mostly in the hope that their return would bring back the back 4). I remember reading posts in all of these players threads from posters either bemused why they weren't playing, or assuming we'll suddenly drastically improve with their return from injury. When they finally were picked it made very little difference to our performances.

Rooney being played as a striker and Herrera returning to the center is just the latest of these caf fads imo. Just like the return of all these other players, it's not going to suddenly have us playing superb football unfortunately.

6334~~~
Exactly, we are building a squad and he is a component. Just we need more of them and to get rid of others. He will be a vital squad member and he knows he is a member of a squad.

6335~~~
Barely do any of them? He's physical and he's big, they are things that he is, not things he can do. In the first half of the season, we played with inexperienced CBs in an unfamiliar system. It meant that teams would press high, especially away from home, which would lead to going back to De Gea a lot. Having Fellaini on the pitch helps a lot because he's able to bring the ball down and allow us to keep possession in the opponents half. We are also shit on corners, so having Fellaini there helps defensively. Since we've got defenders back he's not played, he hasn't started a league game since Liverpool 14th December.

With regards to Rooney, bar the odd sloppy pass he does well in midfield. Switching the play allows us to attack with space in the final third and use the width effectively, something that's hard to create otherwise in wingback formations. He's a big goal threat from midfield obviously, but also teams will plan to nullify Rooney which is likely to present opportunities for our other talented players. I don't think opponents would focus on Herrera the same way. He's been better than Di Maria anyway for example, who loses the ball an incredible amount of times from "Hollywood" decisions to shoot or pass, plus he's better defensively. Of course though, Di Maria is our new £60million signing so we couldn't suggest dropping him. To which people will then inform me about all Di Maria's qualities and I'll agree because I'm a big fan of his, but of course if I talk about Rooneys qualities it'd get downplayed.

Herrera is our best midfielder I'd say in terms of keeping the ball and making correct decisions, wonderfully tidy player. In our current system though, we need players that are going to making things happen spontaneously because, as we can see, we never look like creating a lot. Herrera can pick a pass and can finish, but is he more likely to win a game than Rooney or Di Maria? I wouldn't say so.

6336~~~
Really? If one of Van Persie or Falcao are dropped and we start to look for some balance instead of fielding all of our superstars I think the general consensus will be positive. I think our football would improve, too. I'm not just talking about Herrera here, Fellaini was also sat on the bench yesterday. He's another player that would benefit the team more so than the Van Persie, Falcao and Rooney vanity exhibition.

6337~~~
When was the last time Rooney scored? Boxing Day I think, not exactly prolific. Herrera scored that beauty against Yeovil, he was lucky the pass came through to him, but everything after that was sheer ingenuity.

6338~~~
In fairness, I'm basing that on the United fans I know rather than the ones on here, I only returned to the caf against a day or two ago. Nevertheless, I'm a firm believer that our lack of creativity is due to the limitations of the formation, and Herrera still would make too much of a difference at this point in time.

6339~~~
I am glad it is no longer Fellaini against Herrera, I actually agree that they both bring something to the team. I thought after Carrick being injured they would both start yesterday.

6340~~~
He's still a goal threat though nonetheless, at the end of the day he is playing in midfield so he's not going to be scoring every game. He went on droughts when he was a striker but you'd still play him because he was likely to score. And yes, it was a delightful goal from Herrera and as I've acknowledged, he is capable of that. More so than Rooney? Not for me.

6341~~~
I'd play them together on Tuesday, personally. Blind just in behind them.

6342~~~
He should start ahead of a Januszaj

6343~~~
I think this sort of opinion is driven by a 'the grass is always greener' attitude. As I said above, fans were desperate for Falcao to return but when he did it actually made little difference. There were plenty of people happy to see Rooney get a 3 game ban so that Mata could have his chance. Again, it made next to no difference with our overall performances.

Our problems won't simply be solved by moving Rooney up top and bringing Herrera in. They are more deep seated than that. We'll see improvements as the players continue to gel, adapt to the 'philosophy', and/or when LVG brings in a player who proves to be the missing piece.

6344~~~
Totally agree.

6345~~~
It's driven by having watched Rooney and Van Persie fail to deliver in the same team for almost three seasons, to be honest. Now we've simply added Falcao to confuse things further.

Something has to change. I'm going off on a tangent somewhat with my focus on Rooney, but if we continue to persist with him in central midfield and the aforementioned one-paced strikers then nothing will change. I think things will get worse, and I fear for our top four chances and Van Gaal's job. 

I'm not explicitly arguing that Herrera is the catalyst for all that change, but the simple act of playing our players in the correct positions will benefit the team enormously. 

We can be a better side than what we see now, and dropping a striker and playing Herrera, or even Fellaini, in midfield is something I think will help that happen. If you think that is a grass is greener complex then I respect your stance but I'm inclined to disagree.

6346~~~
I don't really see how Rooney provides "power", but I guess that's one of the phrases that has been used for him before and it seems to stick. He doesn't really provide any more "power" than most other midfielder. He doesn't do crunching tackles like Keane and without looking at stats I don't think he runs further than most other midfielders. And apart from a few good long ranged passes his passing isn't great either. We've played a lot of games since the Newcastle game and in most of them he's been plain average. Let's not forget that Herrera has gotten a few goals from midfield as well. Basically, I don't think Rooney offers anything extra in midfield compared to Herrera. Rooney's long passing might be better, but he's no Scholes and quite often it doesn't actually reach his target.

I generally don't get this whole "Rooney in midfield". He has a good game there once in a while and that apparently means he's good there and should play there because he's capable of a great game once in a while. The fact that you mention the Newcastle game, which happened more than a month ago, rather than one of his recent games in midfield says a lot.
Completely disagree. We shouldn't have to adapt our tactics for a team like West Ham, and apart from actually looking like a footballer for a week or two a while ago Fellaini has been useless. He'll probably start because LVG sees it the same way as you do though, but then again LVG's approach seems to be safety first.

6347~~~
Even John O'Shea had a good game in midfield now and again, but you wouldn't have played him there all the time.

6348~~~
I didn't mean it in the terms of tackling that he provides power from midfield... I meant that his ability to run from deep brings power to the midfield, he is one of our strongest players. Rooney offers leadership from midfield as well, let's not forget he is our captain. Okay since the Newcastle game we have played 5 Premier League games. According to Squawka he had the highest performance score of all our players in that 5 game period (the stats it focuses on: Appearances; Goals; Shot Accuracy; Squawka Awards; Chances Created; Pass Accuracy; Pass Length; Duels won; Defensive Actions; Defensive Errors and Cards). 

Stats can sometimes be misleading but okay, the team has suffered a decrease in performance level in that 5 game period- however the stats show that Rooney has been our best player in that period. So tell me how Rooney has been average in midfield? His performances have not been outstanding but that is a result of the whole team playing poorly not just him. I don't see how putting Herrera in the team would have helped that. 

Your last point is ridiculous. If you adapt the team how do you expect to win games? We know West Ham are strong in the air, we lack height makes perfect sense to play Fellaini. The useless Fellaini who has the same pass accuracy as Herrera and one more goal? (Fellaini has had one more appearance). I criticised Fellaini a lot last year, but give credit where its due- he has performed well this season and is becoming an important squad member.

6349~~~
I can understand you saying Fellaini should play against West Ham, I don't have a problem with it. Ander is good when you have a team who are happy to just let us have the ball, because until yesterday, Carrick's injury might actually have helped, we have been far too slow in our buildup. LvG has even commented on it. These teams were quite happy for us to pass the ball to death because they knew we would just pass it backwards. There was nobody to speed the passing up once we got to the edge of the area, Ander is that man. That is why I would have been happy for him to come on later yesterday, once we had taken the sting out of the game to just provide Leicester with something to worry about. Yet he made the changes and they actually managed to score.

6350~~~
Yep, been banging on about it for a while, its not the formation we play it is the playing style. We have been too slow and too safe in recent weeks, yesterday was the first time we took the shackles (for the first half). I would have liked to see Herrera come on but I'm not sure the subs LVG made cost us a goal. For the whole second half we invited them onto us and tried to use Di Maria's pace for a counter attack.

6351~~~
That 2nd half might work against Leicester, I know it didn't at their place, but I would worry about us inviting a top side to attack like that.

6352~~~
Exactly, it was frustrating yesterday because we could have easily put another goal or two past them.

6353~~~
It would have been a joy to put another goal or two past them, they deserve it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6354~~~
A big part of our problems is the pace in our attacks and the link-up play with our strikers. This is obviously not entirely Rooney's fault, but our team in general has been unbalanced in a lot of games, and I just don't see how playing a striker in midfield helps that when we have actual midfielders on the bench. Furthermore I think Herrera has generally helped put pace in our attacks whenever he's come on. Since you bring up stats, Rooney's passing accuracy in PL games since Newcastle is 80%. As far as I can see from the "performance score" on Squawka he's 4th, behind Jones, Blind and Valencia and actually getting negative points in possession. I have no idea how the performance score is actually determined and I don't really care about it, but since you brought it up. So no, not even stats seem to show that he's been our best player.

If you look at caf ratings though, you'll see average ratings in every game since the Newcastle one. I honestly value that higher than some random formula Squawka put together, particularly since that formula puts Valencia as one of our best players.

I'm assuming you're missing a "don't" here, right? I'm all for adapting when it's needed, but as United we shouldn't have to adapt against West Ham. Even if we do concede a goal or even two from set-pieces we should set out to outscore them. The way Fergie played for large parts of his time. He adapted his tactics for Europe and big games in the league, but not against the likes of West Ham. I don't think "height" is a proper reason to pick one midfielder over another. As for your passing stats - it's stats. Fellaini has 0 assists and less than a third of Herrera's key passes, despite playing more games. But then again, LVG seems content with moving the ball sideways in midfield and Fellaini is, usually, capable of doing that.

To be honest, I wouldn't really have an issue if this was a one-time thing - playing Fellaini against West Ham <i>does</i> make sense, and if he's not going to play in that sort of game I don't see when he should. I'm just getting sick of this safety-first approach. LVG getting a twitchy ass from the 4-4-2 because we're giving chances away etc. Moyes got ridiculed for "trying to make it hard" for Newcastle, but playing Fellaini against West Ham is basically the same thing - try to make it hard for them. Fellaini is a United player, and because of that I obviously want him to do well, but I don't see how we can play attractive football while playing to his strengths. Herrera on the other hand fits perfectly as I see it, which is why I'm desperate for him to get a proper run in the team.

6355~~~
Ah I got the stats wrong, they showed Rooney as being the best player for the past 23 games, not the 5 we was talking about, my bad. 

Yeah the don't was missing. The issue with your logic is we are not scoring enough goals away from home for us to have a 'gung ho' approach. We are not the same team we used to be when we had Sir Alex the quicker we accept that, the easier the transition will be. 

Ah so you want Herrera in the team because his playing style is easy on the eye? That's a fair comment, I'm all for us playing an attractive style of play. 

But for this season, I couldn't care less how we played as long as we keep winning. The priority is to get into the top four this season, the attractive football can come after that.

6356~~~
I don't think Herrera will get as much time until he gets the defence sorted. The defence needs sorting no matter what, but it will benefit Herrera and maybe allow him and ADM to play without worrying about the defensive side as well.

6357~~~
I know it's not the same team, but that doesn't mean it always has to be safety first. I'm not exactly suggesting gung ho either - I'm suggesting that we use a player I think would fit well in the team and is actually a midfielder. LVG talks a lot about balance and so on, but he's not making it easier for himself by using square pegs for round holes over and over - Rooney in midfield and Di Maria as striker etc.

Yes, my main reason for wanting Herrera on the pitch is that I love his style and I'd like to see more of it. Quick passes, lots of movement - can't get enough of it. Winning is obviously important but it's not like the two things are mutually exclusive. We have a big problem actually creating chances at the moment (putting three past the bottom side doesn't really change that alone) which inevitably makes winning a lot harder, and from what I've seen having Herrera on the pitch helps us create more. The way <b>I</b> see it is that the attractive football Herrera offers will also make it easier to win, which is why I simply don't understand why he's not getting a proper chance.

6358~~~
Because LvG has ended up under more pressure than he thought he would be, due to injuries, not strengthening the defence when he should have, instead having ADM and Falcao handed to him and also down to decisions he has chosen to make. A lot of this is his own doing. He knows his job might be in jeopardy if we don't get Top 4 so good football has gone out of the window and it is safety first.

6359~~~
Yeah, I think you're right, and as you say in another post Herrera might well get more chances once we get the defence sorted properly. I can easily see us playing much better football next season and I hope Herrera will be a part of that.

6360~~~
I think he will be. There will be players going, but we cannot go through yet another major overhaul, or it will be even more players that have to learn how LvG wants to operate.

6361~~~
I don't think anyone here is suggesting that Herrera is the next Zidane, but FFS we have a proper midfielder on the squad and we're playing Rooney as a midfielder instead.

What's causing this mess is the perceived need to play Falcao with RvP, which then requires we play Roo out of position and Herrera rots on the bench while we create few scoring chances.

Roo has done a job, but he's being wasted in midfield.  Herrera is being wasted on the bench.

6362~~~
It is the formation. When a wing back receives the ball outwide, we have to pass backwards, there's no other alternative. It also only stretches one line of an opponents defence so it's harder to break down and easier to compact the middle. Easy to say we need to be quicker, but it's hard to be quick and fluid in possession when we have very few options available. The diamond is better because we always have a man free in the centre so it's harder to defend and organise, but I don't think we'll see scintillating football regularly until we have the players to play with proper wingers.

6363~~~
Great to see someone who can see this, so many people just say same stereotype about players, sometimes I wonder if they even watch matches, or just watch forums, for example nani is frustrating and inconsistent

31 - Since August 2009, Nani has made more assists than any other Premier League player. Consistent.(was from february 2013)

Rafael has too many brainfarts, herrera, mata are too weak, all I`ve noticed is english/academy players get defended alot, where our better foreign players get labels and it just sticks with them

6364~~~
All these. Making runs from deep is only a fraction of what's required from midfield. His position and movement is nowhere near as good as Ander's. You could add close control to that too. For me, he's the elephant in the room. We suffer because we somehow must play him, to the overall detriment of the team. Ander's put on good displays and has improved our play every time he's been on. I don't understand why we have more than 30m worth of midfielders sitting on the bench who could do no worse than Rooney. 

Also, the Newcastle game point is valid. It was more than a month ago.

6365~~~

6366~~~
As long as we play a striker in midfield I'll be calling for Herrera to play. It actually fecking mental that we've used Rooney in midfield this much.

Another manager who hasn't got the balls to drop star names for the sake of the team.

6367~~~
You what? Nani wasn't frustrating and inconsistent now? That's not a fecking stereotype. It's the truth.

6368~~~
That's just amazing stuff. What planet is this coming from?  The likes of McNair and Wilson get all kinds of crap on here which whey wouldn't if they we'd bought them from Valencia say. And being British or Irish is the worst thing a player can be according to this forum. The hipsters like players to be a bit more exotic.

6369~~~
That's complete bollocks - a Redcafe myth perpetuated by sanctimonious posters on here. If anything most fans here are desperate for a local hero, just look at the Welbeck thread.

6370~~~
Nonsense, foreign players get far more stick than local players, especially from British-based fans. If Blackette were Spanish and bought for €5m there'd not be a single person keeping faith in him.

6371~~~
His end product was consistently good, which is also the truth.

6372~~~
Everybody is desperate for players coming through our academy to succeed. Their nationality is irrelevant. Januzaj is no less popular than Wilson because he's Belgian.

Definitely a trend for people to be more forgiving of expensive new signings than they would be with someone coming up through the ranks though.

6373~~~
No idea how you can distinguish end product from performances. All I can say for a fact is that he was a frustrating and inconsistent player for most of his United career. All the more so because of the really great 18 months or so when he <b><i>wasn't</i></b> frustrating and inconsistent.

6374~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Love it how you state your independent observation that might have nothing to do with the real state of facts and place it under 'definitely true' label.

6375~~~
Hilarious, right?

6376~~~
Perhaps I should have added from what I've seen to make it clear then. Just an observation though, not something that happens 'definitely'.

What you're talking about has basically happened with Anderson so far. The hype with Kagawa was to an extent justified and there's nothing wrong with having a good opinion on Herrera. Some expensive signings were quickly written off - people never had a hope with Bebe, Veron was quickly deemed unsuccessful and even someone like Berbatov got a lot of stick despite playing reasonably well and being a multimillion signing.

6377~~~
His decision making was never consistent. He is very talented, but really frustrating to watch and play with if the players faces can be used as proof. He upset the rhythm of of performances more often than not. The shame is he really is a player with the ability to win a gam on his own when he's in the right mood.

6378~~~
It is like we have to crush every new signings confidence and make them forget how to play football before we decide to put them back into the team. They can only rejoin when they forget to 1 touch pass and move, be creative, or actually have their own brain on the football field. 'What...you know how to execute a through ball??? Dropped - Not in my philosophy'

6379~~~
Fair points. I do think that inconsistency throughout performances can be fairly common in wingers, though. Di Maria is playing that same kind of way so far and I'm willing to give him patience in the knowledge that he does, and probably will, produce the numbers in spite of the errors. It's why Nani never pissed me off as much as he did others.

6380~~~
What? Blackett gets dogs abuse here for being shit. Rooney gets loads of abuse comapred to someone like Mata. Less said the better about the Tom Cleverley thread. The Anderson thread is positively pleasant when compared to the Cleverley one.

6381~~~
Blackett isn't rated because he's been awful for us, not because he's English. There are still people who believe he could be a useful player for us. Rooney is polarizing views, there are people who will never criticize him and there are people who consider him a little crap - likewise Mata.

6382~~~
Then why bring Blackett up at all?

6383~~~
To be fair you did say in earlier post it wouldn't matter if West Ham scored a goal or two from set pieces, because we will outscore them... Not sure why you think we would be capable of that, seen as though we struggle to score away from home. The balance thing is a difficult one, because some of the problems he has created himself, I'm not even entirely sure what he meant by it. 

He has had some bright moments in games, has he had a full game where he has played well? lI don't think it is easy as saying put Herrera in the team and we will create more. I would much rather see a team which had Falcao, RVP, Rooney and Di Maria in, than sacrifice one of them for Herrera.

Disagree with you on that. I think LVG is playing it safe at the moment, and wants us to control games to make up for the defence. It's a logical approach, but i feel as though recently we have taken this to an extreme and it is stifling our creative players. Saturday was the first time in a while where we played with some freedom I don't think that's entirely the formation, I think it is also the style of play. 

When was Herrera's last good game? You said Herrera can do no worse than Rooney, but can he do any better? I wouldn't drop Rooney because Herrera wouldnt do 'any worse' than him. Just doesn't make sense.

6384~~~
You have to wonder why LVG sanctioned a £30m (or whatever - don't bother correcting me pedants) transfer for Herrera as he doesn't seem to rate him.  Did he just think "can't be any worse than Cleverley and Anderson - why not"

6385~~~
You've completely misunderstood me. I said whenever Ander's played he's improved us. I can't be bothered explaining how because if you go through this thread it will have been stated many times. 

When I said he can do no worse than Rooney, it wasn't a compliment paid to Ander, it was a reference to how mediocre Rooney is in midfield. We have midfielders who can do a better job than Rooney in midfield. Play them. It's that simple.

6386~~~

6387~~~
Agree, yes we might be a bit more forgiving to a academy player but it's got nothing to do with the nationality! We take pride in our youth system, a commentator the other day said we have played a youth in every game since 1937 which I for 1 am very proud of!

6388~~~
Wayne in midfield vs. Ander in midfield is as comparable as Ander no9 vs Wayne no 9.

6389~~~
It's time for one of us to self-immolate on the steps of Old Trafford in a Herrera jersey. 

There's no good reason he shouldn't have played in Rooney's spot with Rooney up top and one of RVP or Falcao coming off the bench.

6390~~~
You said in your post that you agreed me mentioning Rooney playing well against Newcastle wasn't valid cos it was a while ago... So out of interest when was Herrera's last good game? 

He's clearly not mediocre in midfield. Id happily sacrifice Herrera's place in the team if it means we get to see Rooney, RVP, Falcao and Di Maria play together.

6391~~~
That's a silly approach. Packing your side with forwards doesn't make it exciting, it makes it unbalanced. Falcao and van Persie haven't exactly been brilliant this season.

As for Herrera's last good game it was a week ago when he got 20 minutes. Aside from 2 or 3 games he has been good in his very limited time on the pitch here.

6392~~~
Good grief you're thick aren't you. I already said Ander's looked good whenever he's played and his last time out was against Cambridge. The quality of our play improved, obviously so. 

And you must be a fanboy to not see how mediocre Rooney is in midfield. Either play him up top or bench him. Re: the Newcastle game, if all you can do is cite it, it was more than a month ago as someone else said and we've not been great since.

6393~~~
Agree. Thought the one who has to be dropped isn't Rooney. Falcao, Mata, van Persie...

6394~~~
Not sure about Mata he's been improving lately. If it were up to me I'd drop Falcao and play Rooney and Persie up top.

6395~~~
You're right on the ball mate.

6396~~~
I get your point, but I don't blame LVG for trying it. I think Falcao and RVP have looked sharper and better recently. 

This is my point. People are justifying playing Herrera due to a few cameo appearances. He's done ok in them, nothing special. 

A 20 minute cameo against a league 2 side justifys his place in the team? And I'm the thick one? Yeah ok mate. 

I'm far from a rooney fan boy I'm just looking at objectively. So basically the newcastle game just doesn't count because it goes against the argument that Rooney is poor in midfield?

I like rooney as a 10, think its his best position now. I think hes a square peg in a round hole when played deeper in midfield and theres no real future in that position for him (or the team).
He hasn't been getting many goals since hes been pulled back too and its something hes very good at and it seems a bit counterproductive to take away from the team.
Hes a decent square peg as far as these things go. I think i'd probably fellaini ahead of him in midfield though.
I can see the reasoning behind not picking hererra in midfield but i think its pretty disappointing. Maybe next summer when van gaal has had a chance to shuffle things around he'll get more games.
Think we've consistently looked much better with him in the team than without. We just seem much more mobile and the ball moves at a vaguely decent pace (and not always out wide!).

6398~~~
Can't be too arsed reading through the whole conversation so it might be out of context, but Herrera has played really well and been amongst our best players on the pitch every time he's played, apart from the couple of times he played with a broken rib. Apart from that, he's always made a very positive impact on games.

6399~~~
The guy has an agenda for some reason, I have given up arguing with him.

6400~~~
I think it's just a difference in opinions. I don't think he has done well enough in his appearances to say that he justifys a place in the starting line up. 


I don't have an agenda against him. I've said many times, I think he is a good player. My issue is people seem to think he is the saviour to our problems, with the issues are not as simple as move Rooney out of midfield put Herrera in. If was that simple do you not think LVG would have done it? 
Also a few people on here overrate him when he comes on and plays a few one touch passes. 

As I have said many times I don't see what he has done to merit a first team place.

6401~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6402~~~
It is funny, but I hope it doesn't cause Ander any trouble. You wonder what he thinks of something like that. He might laugh at it. He might not.

6403~~~
By trouble you mean it bothering him? he seems mentally strong to me, I imagine if he reads stuff online about himself he'd see how many United fans want him to play anyway.

6404~~~
You are right of course. As long as LvG isn't the sort who sees fans right behind a player, then won't play him to be an awkward bastard.

6405~~~
Why doesn't he not merit a place in the team though? He has shown much more then most of the players who start above him. His stats are also among the best in our team if you consider per 90 minute stats. If you use squawka's comparison thing, Herrera has the highest total score, as all his "scores" are in the top few, compared to some players being good in attack or good in defence. He's an all rounder, something we don't have. He completes more passes then any of our midfielders per game apart from Carrick and Blind, though he is only 1 behind both with 57 passes (87% completion). He has 3 league assists and 2 league goals (and one in the cup) and apart from that makes far more chances per 90 minutes then anyone else apart from Di Maria. Defensively he also has good stats, only Fellaini completing more tackles per 90 minutes (he has more then Carrick and the same as Blind). He dribbles past opponents more and more successfully then anyone else in our squad (di maria tries more but has a much lower success rate), he has more interceptions then both Fellaini and Carrick with only Blind beating him there, he has more blocks per 90 minutes then Blind but less then Carrick and Fellaini, etc...

That's just looking at how he's one of our most effective players stats wise. If you watch him on the pitch, he adds creativity which the stats back up clearly, he increases the pace of our game, he gets stuck in, he provides excellent link up play and helps out defensively as much as anyone else pretty much. He provides such unique characteristics and exactly the ones we lack. Our biggest problem the last few months has been the pace of our game, a lack of creativity and a lack of forward thinking passes. Exactly the thing Herrera offers better then anyone (along with Di maria of course). A part of our problem is also having slow forwards who offer very similar things like Falcao and Van Persie. Falcao this season literally offers nothing an average striker couldn't do, and if you put Rooney up top, he would offer so much more then him and if you put Herrera in midfield, again, we would get so much more out of the team.

6406~~~
I'd imagine LvG has too much self belief to be affected one way or the other by fans opinions.

6407~~~
There's an interview on MUTV news with Ander today, talking about the cup replay, it is on the main website. Of course the damn thing won't play for me, that's him not playing. MUTV are always interviewing players before games and then they don't play. It's not LvG's fault, it's MUTV. They are a jinx.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6408~~~
Oh no, he was at the presser as well and couldn't even get on as a sub, it's like we are being trolled. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6409~~~
We are dammit.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6410~~~
I expect it's just a communication problem. Woodward probably told LvG the fans want to see more of Herrera, so LvG sent Ander off to do an interview with MUTV. Sorted.

6411~~~
You could be right.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6412~~~
We should have signed this lad from Bilbao.

6413~~~
That's a great idea.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6414~~~
Imagine him on our midfield all season. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6415~~~
Rooney would not have to play in midfield then <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6416~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Believe he does nice interviews as well.

6417~~~
Bilbao are short of goals, maybe we can do a swap deal.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6418~~~
Can he play CB?

6419~~~
Probably if it means he gets a game.

6420~~~
Better than Evans, surely...

6421~~~
That was his last game, just a passing mention. What you've failed to account is what I said "<b>every time</b> he's played he's improved us", key words being <b>every time</b>.  

And the Newcastle game is only one example that many people use to prop Rooney as a midfield player. It's only one game, and one that was played long ago.

6422~~~
I've just about given up too.

6423~~~
Kind of missed my point but I can't be bothered to argue this anymore so let's jus agree to disagree <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>. 

I hope Herrera can prove me wrong and work his way into the first team and do well.

6424~~~
Anyone thinking he will start tonight? Cant see it myself...

6425~~~
Not starting again <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6426~~~
Christ, just sell him.

6427~~~
Did herrera sleep with van gaal's daughter? won't even start him against fecking cambridge at OT? 

Why did we buy him then?

6428~~~
This manager is a pillock and Rooney must have something on him.

6429~~~
Free this man, to good to be sitting on the fecking bench in place of a striker.

6430~~~
I don't get the outrage to be honest, Fellaini has been better than him this season in all honesty. Although I understand he offers something different.

For all we know his trial (is it still going on?) is the reason he's not playing.

6431~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Strangest part of this season is his exclusion from teams

6432~~~
He hasn't, in all honesty.

6433~~~
There's no way he'll be here beyond the Summer.

6434~~~
He has, yeah.

6435~~~
Don't really understand what LVG's problem is... is it because the captain has to play in midfield at all costs? Ridiculous really, considering Herrera has been decent in pretty much all of his games so far. Obviously something going on behind the scenes.

6436~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You'd think we have Zidane on the bench, going by the reactions.

I don't think he will be here next season at this rate <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> He's a very talented player.

6437~~~
Instead of playing Herrera in midfield, we've used Rooney there, put Di Maria up top, used a 3-5-2 to use less midfielders, tried to shaft 3 strikers into our team, etc, etc. It's not a direct "but this player has been better than him" (even though I don't really think Fellaini has, overall). There have been loads of opportunities to give him a game in midfield where LvG has completely ignored him. It's actually quite unbelievable, really, especially for someone who has watched him in La Liga for the last two years and knows how good he is and what we can bring to the team if he's given a proper run of games.

6438~~~
Opinions eh. I disagree with you though, Herrera has shown plenty in his performances to deserve more playing time. Rooney starting in midfield at home to Cambridge is a little embarrassing when it's clear others should be playing there over him.

6439~~~
Fellaini has in his hairy hole been better than Herrera.

Rooney is getting a free pass too.

6440~~~
He's like zidane compared the the static shit midfielders we've seen at united the last 5 years (bar Carrick)

6441~~~
He's not playing for the exact same reason as the time we last played this team.

Or is a 10 days too long to remember that they're all 6ft+ and will be playing for corners and free kicks?

6442~~~
He was useless in the first game. He got taken off before he got sent off.

6443~~~
It's strange when Rooney plays midfield and di Maria up top, yeah. But I do think we're overrating him a little bit more with every game he doesn't start. He started the season brilliantly then faded a bit, also we have to remember van Gaal watches them everyday in training.

6444~~~
Or, you know, a good young Spanish midfielder whilst we instead play strikers in midfield and idiotic formations.

But sure, Zidane, whatever you think works.

6445~~~
T
That's all I can think, then if they tire 2nd half, he will bring him on like last time.

6446~~~
Gobsmaked he's not starting today.

6447~~~
The same van Gaal who constantly bemuses me with his decision making, yes.

I don't overrate him, I don't think he's a Fabregas or an undroppable player or anything, I do think he at least deserves to start a game against a league two side at home, though. He's a very good player who primarily faded in form because of a bad injury and then just not playing games.

6448~~~
We're at OT against a fecking league 2 side. If we can't beat them tonight LVG may aswell throw in the towel and resign, regardless of what team he picked.

6449~~~
Speaks about inbalance yet insists on playing a striker in midfield whilst a perfectly good box to box midfielder sits on the bench..

6450~~~
You really do wonder why he never gets a start.

6451~~~
Utter nonsense isn't it. Getting more frustrating now, and Fergie was one of the worst for playing players out of position.

6452~~~
It's just the Rooney in midfield part that irks me. He's been very poor in the role since the turn of the year.

Just play them in their positions. I can see why Herrera hasn't started...but Mata has which I didn't expect.

6453~~~
Should be starting ahead of Van Persie, with Rooney going up top.

6454~~~
He's way past Zidane at this stage. He'd be first name on the teamsheet for any team in the world supposedly.

But anyway, I'd rather he was starting a game like this. It's a hell of a lot of money to pay for a player that you won't even make use of him in a game versus Cambridge. I hate the financial waste of it.

6455~~~
I think Fellaini is in ahead of him most games for his height, that and the fact he's impressed this season. I'm frustrated we haven't seen more of Herrera, but it's not as if he's set the world alight.

6456~~~
If you keep making up bollocks I'll just thread ban you from anything Herrera related. It's fine that you don't rate him or whatever, but don't make up nonsense to troll people, thanks.

6457~~~
God don't we need that height to beat the mighty cambridge at home.

6458~~~
You laugh, but City and Chelsea paid the price already in this round.

6459~~~
He's 6ft tall, it's not like he's tiny or anything.

6460~~~
He's not had much of a chance to be fair.

6461~~~
Jesus, don't tell me I'm going to have to dig up that post...

6462~~~
Of course I laugh, the Chelsea one was a freak occurrence and we ohad ours (drawing away). Fellaini will make all the difference (one of our worst players in the 1st game)

6463~~~
No, he's not tiny, but he's also not dominant in the air or strong from set pieces. Which is an important factor of the English game.

6464~~~
I know, people have this stupid idea he is about 5ft 6 or something.

6465~~~
I could understand if other people were coming in and playing well...but our midfield has been atrocious all season. In fact, the only games where we've looked like we've even had a midfield, are the ones Herrera has been playing in.

The only player I can understand being selected ahead of him is Blind (or Carrick), because you need someone more disciplined than Herrera in the holding role. Everyone else who's played in midfield has basically not played there, either due to being unbelievably crap, or not actually being a midfielder, or both.

Although on the plus side I reckon from that line up that Rooney might actually be up front.

6466~~~
This getting beyond belief. Is this the infamous Van Gaal obduracy in action?

Increasingly getting the impression that our Dutch philosopher doesn't have a clue.

6467~~~
if it's one post by some idiot it hardly counts, you're speaking as if it's general consensus that he's as good as Fabregas or would make it into any team in the world, it's not, you know it's not. Stop trolling, simple.
You're acting as if it's the be all and end all to the English game. If that's the reason he's not getting picked and Fellaini is then I sure as hell have some big concerns about old Louis' "philosophy".

6468~~~
He wins a fair amount of challenges too, so he isn't just this cute-looking Spanish midfielder who doesn't want to get gritty.

6469~~~
van Gaal is always quick to point out if a side is direct, full of height, or strong with the long ball, don't forget...

He also mentions the importance of balance on a weekly basis.

I'm not arguing the decision to not play Herrera is right, I'm just arguing I can see why van Gaal decides to do it.

6470~~~
I am beginning to think that the more we and the press want Herrera in, the more he won't play him. He is the sort who will not be told who to play, even when he is getting it wrong.

6471~~~
And if shunting Fellaini into our team is his way of combating that, then god help us.

6472~~~
The current 'Not Allowed'.

Fellaini will also start against West Ham because they're big and physical (less so than previously but still...), so we better get used to this.

6473~~~
We all make it out that this is a nonsensical decision, I just like to add some of van Gaal's much loved balance to the debate.

6474~~~
Does naybody else think he might not be a Van Gaal signing? He was wanted by both Fergie and Moyes, maybe the board just felt that this meant he was a good player and worth buying.

6475~~~
Van Gaal wouldn't know what balance is if it smashed him up the back doors.

6476~~~
Well here's your idiot post from this thread. You can ban me or change my slogan again or whatever. Doesn't bother me. But you can't deny the hyperbole of some of the opinions on here, which is exactly what the post I was replying to was about. If I said, or the post I was replying to said, that it was the opinion of every poster that was over the top, then you'll need to point that out to me. I even said I thought Herrera should be playing tonight!

6477~~~
LvG said himself ages ago that both Herrera and Shaw weren't bought by him, he just gave the go ahead, before he even took over I think.

6478~~~
So Mr. Bighead is saying he knows better than SAF, who does rate him highly.

6479~~~
I'm sure all his medals would argue otherwise.

6480~~~
A bit worrying he isn't getting game time in games such as this. Must be something else at play. He's a good player, don't understand his exclusion.

6481~~~
Well he better win something this season then, because he usually goes downhill in his 2nd season.

6482~~~
Have you read the other posts from that guy? He regularly gets taken the piss out of on here by just about everyone else. If someone like that making a post like that is your excuse to try and rile people up with such claims then it's a really, really poor one. You keep saying these statements as if it's common amongst fans of Herrera that he would get into any team in the world, or he is as good as Fabregas, in reality it's just one person saying it and then getting laughed at for saying it, just look at the other reactions to his post!

Anyone with half a brain can see you're on an agenda in here to rile up people who like Herrera, if you need to use posts like that to do so, then, well ... you know.

6483~~~
We should dominate Cambridge and have them sitting back on the edge of their own box. Who do you want in midfield to unlock that? Fellaini or Herrera? feck me.

6484~~~
I've thought this for a while. I think he had much less say in the signing than people think/thought.
Edit:  He'll probably play half tonight anyway.

6485~~~
I get you but we're playing 4 CBs and Fellaini. IMO 3 strikers on the pitch are the problem, not the rest.

6486~~~
His whole career argues otherwise. But as manager at this club so far you wouldn't be blamed for believing that he's just as cowardly as his wretched predecessor and uses Van Persie as his mount in the same way the last one did Rooney. Two or three strikers no matter what, strikers in midfield and painfully one-paced midfield's is all about balance, though, so great.

Off topic, this, I just had to comment on balance, or lack of. As for Herrera, the exclusion is getting silly now. He's done well when on the pitch recently. The whole thing stinks of an up yours to those calling for him to get on the field. Arguably the opposite of cowardice, but generally moronic.

6487~~~
So I'm alone in seeing the reasoning for playing Fellaini ahead of him and generally not being outraged he's not being selected tonight? I can't be...

6488~~~
Fellaini was picked ahead of him because of his height. People need to calm the feck down.

6489~~~
Fellaini was shocking against Cambridge last week and tbf to Herrera, he came on and made a positive impact. Old Trafford is a massive pitch, Herrera is one of those players that can help us stretch the feck out of teams like Cambridge.

6490~~~
Maybe he was, but Cambridge's only threat comes form their height and we must take measures against it.

6491~~~
you're not

6492~~~
And it's not even the omission of Ander for Fellaini. We're probably playing Rooney in CM again, or we could replace him with RvP who has been poor recently.

6493~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20558, @charleysurf" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20558/">@charleysurf</a> shame you deleted that. I like Fellaini, if anyone in his thread looks like they're trying to rile people up like you're doing in here, I'll happily do that.

6494~~~
The problem is that Fellaini is always seen as the player keeping him out. It's really Mata and Rooney he's competing with ( in LVGs view anyway at least).

6495~~~
Yeh i don't understand the over exaggeration of not playing him. If the media had not hounded him so much past few weeks about him not starting then i reckon he would have started him tonight.. My only guess is that he's not impressing in training. Maybe another £30m wasted <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6496~~~
He's 25 already, hardly a youngster...

Agree with the overall point though.

6497~~~
Yeah that's what I think too. I'm okay with Fellaini. But IMO we should play Herrera instead of RVP. Rooney hasn't played up top for a long time though, that says something about LvG's view on him.

6498~~~
Ah, I had a brief flash of maturity and thought it better to let the issue go. But too late <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6499~~~
Am I the only one disgusted that we're selecting players based on height, rather than ability to play football, and against Cambridge United? If that is his rationale, it's as bad as anything Moyes ever did.

6500~~~
It certainly seems that way now.

6501~~~
Fellaini isn't playing because of his height. People should stop doing him a disservice.

6502~~~
Lvg is a tool. I'm starting to dislike him more with each passing day.

6503~~~
We've got 4 centre halves on the pitch

6504~~~
Wasn't really shocking and Herrera did so much positive impact that we still failed to score against the lot (that, on top of that, was losing their stamina as the game went on).

I actually thought that people would drop the idea of him being dropped in favour of Fellaini when both of them were benched last match but obviously not, how about he's dropped in favour of Rooney who'll, inevitably, play in the middle again?

There's no reason why Herrera would be frozen so often. Maybe he's a shit trainer and he's being a lazy git during training sessions? Doesn't look like one, he's always full of energy on field but he must be doing something really wrong the same way some players that looked horribly shit during matches must've been doing something really, really well during training.

6505~~~
I think 25 is pretty young for a midfielder, no? I think of 'young' differently to 'youngster' though.

6506~~~
It shouldn't be wasted, he is a good player. Anderson has been a waste, tbh Shaw has been as big a waste, he hardly ever plays.

6507~~~
If Herrera was all Woodwards thing, as appears likely, then LVG must feel in a strong position to basically piss all over that 30m. It can't be pleasing his bosses.

6508~~~
I wouldn't call someone 25 a young player, but it doesn't really matter, I was nitpicking.

6509~~~
I never even said he got dropped for Fellaini. The person I was replying to implied that.

6510~~~
Being tall doesn't equal to being shit at football, you know...

6511~~~
In fairness I think this makes sense if we are playing a 442 diamond. 

Fellaini offers the bite and physical presence that we lack with Herrera and Di Maria on the edges of the diamond. 

People sometimes think the team needs to be simmetrical but in reality, with Di Maria bombing forward and drifting wide, Fellaini is probably a pretty good option to drop back with Blind.

6512~~~
Wasn't directed at you obviously, sorry if you felt other way around.

6513~~~
LvG might be dicing with death if he is trying to take the board on.

6514~~~
Yep, if he can't get a start against fecking Cambridge then obviously something is wrong between van Gaal and Herrera, not Herrera himself. We are starting youngsters in premierleague in important games yet we don't trust Herrera to play against Cambridge, midfielder who was paid over 30m pounds, I just don't buy it that he is not good enough or whatever the bullshit excuse is.

6515~~~
In that case why Mata? I would argue Herrera is slightly more physical than Mata.

I can understand Fellani, because of height, but I would of expected us to be camped in their half so that shouldn't really be a reason to introduce him.

Saying that Fellani will now score a hatrick.

6516~~~
Well,it certainly won't help his case if we don't make top 4. If Woodward was the one who pushed for Herrera, then there's got to be an undercurrent of embarrassment if it doesn't work, or rather VG does not allow it to work.

6517~~~
Fellaini isn't ideal for the diamond because he lacks the mobility for wide midfield role, but Herrera should be playing instead of Mata in this set up.

6518~~~
Not really about that I imagine, more like they'll have their chances, one or two, corner, free kick, whatever and then we'll simply need the height but that's not the sole reason, mind.

I can see Herrera being a great impact sub when they're tired again by the way but yea, it's a bit mind-boggling that he can't get game time but then again, most of LVG's decisions are mind-boggling.

6519~~~
I think Mata will play LCM in the diamond and it looks like LVG always wants a left footed player there(and right footed at RCM).

6520~~~
LVG probably has a specific role for Herrera, and Herrera isn't exactly reproducing it on the field, therefore he is not a first choice.

6521~~~
This is a big pitch, if we can get them running around it would make sense to bring Ander on when they tire. Knowing us he will change to goalie, bring bloody Young and Valencia on and go to 5 at the back.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6522~~~
van Gaal doesn't blindly throw darts at a board displaying our players just to select his sides, I hope we all know this.

6523~~~
Maybe he had a go at Rooney's wig?

6524~~~
Fellaini deserves to play, sad about Herrera not getting in though.

6525~~~
Ridiculous again from Van Gaal as far as I'm concerned 

Herrera has been one of our more talented players this season and he's shown a real threat with passing and shooting 

he helped turn the game for us Vrs Yeovil with a super shot but since then he's barely played with Rooney, Fellaini and Januzaj preferred 

I really don't get it

6526~~~
What point are you trying to make here exactly? I think it's abundantly obvious LvG is very meticulous when picking his teams, the problem is that he often makes utterly ridiculous selections. People have every right to question his selections given his decisions thus far.

6527~~~
Some can't understand why Herrera isn't playing tonight, but I can think of a few reasons just off the top of my head. People can question van Gaal of course, but he's no fool.

6528~~~
First thing van Gaal mentions in his interview is the height of the Cambridge players. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6529~~~
I think everyone knows the reasons behind it, or most do, it doesn't mean they're not fecking daft.

6530~~~
Doesn't he realise just because they are big, doesn't always mean a threat.

6531~~~
I don't think they are daft though. For all we know he's affected by his trial, we just don't know everything and we certainly don't know more than van Gaal.

6532~~~
should have played Jones in midfield with Fellaini <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

6533~~~
But you're acting as if the only reason Herrera isn't playing is due to Fellaini and his height. What's to stop him playing ahead of Mata, or resting RvP, or Rooney? And clearly it's not just today. Today is a culmination of many months now of him being overlooked for no apparent reason.

Also if you're basing everything you say off the last comment there we may as well just not bother debating on here anymore. "Ah well sure Louis knows more than us, be grand, move on".

6534~~~
The problem is when nobody explains their decisions. Although I don't suppose that would be good for morale. Say is he came out and said I won't play him until I get some decent defenders.

6535~~~
It's getting absolutely ridiculous now. What a waste of his talents. Can't even get a game against fourth tier opposition.

6536~~~
Did he really? 

If Moyes said that I'd say he was a useless twatbag.

6537~~~
I'm just saying van Gaal works with these players everyday, he knows a lot more about them and how they fit into his system than we do. I don't get the outrage in all honesty, Herrera has been good and I think he does have a future with us once our squad is sorted and we can play the way van Gaal wants to play.

6538~~~
If it was Moyes then he'd be accused of concentrating and playing to opposition strengths.

6539~~~
I can't see it being the trial. But there's got to be something else behind this. Whatever footballing doubts VG could have, a home game against Cambridge is surely a game he could at least have played in. And if Herrera was a Woodward signing then surely there would be some pressure from above to play him and justify the 30m. 
Maybe he has been late for training or something. But he really doesn't seem the type for that.

6540~~~
Is he that anal about the right foot and left foot thing even in midfield?

6541~~~
van Gaal has made plenty of questionable selection and tactical decisions in his tenure thus far and people have every right to question what the feck he's doing.

Especially when his 'system' has been, largely, a bit shit.

6542~~~
Of course they do, I agree.

But is it really time for meltdown like we've seen in this thread? No.

6543~~~
Can't imagine he is the sort to be late, he seems the meticulous type. I think it is more personel reasons, that could change for him next season, he might have had this explained to him and understands the problems.

6544~~~
He is actually a pain in the arse about that.

6545~~~
The Basque Kagawa. 

But surely he's far better suited for the midfield role Rooney is currently occupying.

6546~~~
That's concerning since a lot of the best attacker play on the opposite side to their strong foot so they can cut in and attack more efficiently, leaving the fullbacks to cross.

6547~~~
Fellaini up top, Rooney in midfield, Herrera on the bench. Makes sense.

6548~~~
I can't think of a reason why Fellaini should start in this game ahead of Herrea.. He got bullied by fecking Cambridge players last time and Herrera was the one who actually did something meaningful in that match.
I don't know what going behind the scene but LvG seems to give up on Herrera fairly quick. Mâta and Fellaini both been arguably average as Herrera but they're playing. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

6549~~~
He'll probably come on at half time. Chill out people.

6550~~~
You sure? Rooney on the right, Fellaini as the second striker today.

6551~~~
Why?

6552~~~
I just imagined that he's like Cornelius from this cartoon that Nils posts in 500K Thread. LVG got to be that frog.

6553~~~
Rafael plays for the U21 and Herrera gets 20 min vs Cambridge..  The writing must be firmly on the wall for these guys...

6554~~~
Assist already. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6555~~~
3 mins on, gets an assist. LvG clearly pissed off.

6556~~~
What?

6557~~~
Give it two weeks, he might get another 20 minutes if he's lucky.

6558~~~
This lad should be playing more minutes. No question.

6559~~~
I think he is learning to blend in the side better. I still love the way he makes himself available for a pass. The assist for Wilson's goal was good as well. The lad got on and Falcao was probably stewing there wondering why he wasn't getting on.

6560~~~
He's a better midfielder then Rooney, thats for sure.

6561~~~
I think it's genuinely ridiculous that he's not playing any more than he is, and if it's purely from a performance/tactical point of view then it's one of the most idiotic things van Gaal has done so far. I reckon it has something more to do with the fact Herrera isn't <i>his</i> player, and he's making some kind of point to the board.

6562~~~
Terrific player; he plays like Carrick would if he had those quick feet. Simple passes, movement, head up, make the pass, move into space, look up, receive the ball and pass it on. He is least twice the midfielder Rooney is and a better central midfielder than Mata as well. He has the dynamism that our team is begging for. I think he, Di Maria and Blind would work very well together.

6563~~~
He brings so much more to the team than Fellaini.

6564~~~
I'm beginning to wonder what his done to get the treatment (unfair) his getting...?

6565~~~
Maybe he is making a point, but I think he is trying to curb his risk taking. He created a goal nearly straight away. He is a useful squad member. If we get in Europe next season, there will have to be far more rotation, this season there just isn't enough games. Although remember we play West Ham and then there is a midweek game against Burnley on Wednesday.

6566~~~
He is a different player to Fellaini, Rooney is the problem. The lad created a goal as soon as he came on. So difficult to say what he would have done for a whole game. Fellaini was up front anyway today.

6567~~~
Looked pretty good, one thing I love about him is that he's ALWAYS trying to make himself available for a pass. Really don't see why he hasn't been given more of a chance.

Wouldn't be surprised to see Fellaini benched ahead of him against West Ham, we'll need Fellaini's height.

6568~~~
Surely he's done something to piss off LVG? There really is no other explanation. He didn't exactly do anything amazing in his cameo today but still made it very clear to see what he offers the side when he plays. I don't get it.

6569~~~
Agreed. It's not like Herrera is being rotated, he is just frozen - van Gaal wouldn't play him under any circumstances at all.

This is over for him anyway. He has to leave in the Summer.

6570~~~
I think the squad are looking more confident all round the last couple of game. He might actually get a start against Burnley next week.

6571~~~
Creating a goal for Wilson was pretty good. After that we were basically killing the game off.

6572~~~
No he doesn't at all. He will get plenty of time. More games next season and the way we are more chance of injuries. You are reading too much into things.

6573~~~
He won't get a start even if all our midfielders disappear off the Earth tomorrow. Van Gall will name a 10-man first team rather than he play him.

6574~~~
Hold on a second. I like Hererra and he deserves more playing time but I'd love to know what some of you guys were watching. He came on, ran around a bit whilst mostly doing feck all and gave the ball away, a lot.

6575~~~
Got an assist again.. Obviously the game was already done and it was easy so there's not much to write about here, but I still can't believe that he isn't getting more then the odd sub appearance here. Completely idiotic from Van Gaal. Here we finally have a quick, creative and energetic central midfielder, the type we have been crying out for for the last 7-8 years, a player who has impressed every time he has played and has 3 goals and 4 assists in very limited playing time, yet he can't get a start despite being better then just about any other midfielder we have. It's ridiculous. Blind or Carrick always have to play understandably as they are the deeper, holding players. Whether it is the 3-5-2, the diamond or a normal 4-4-2, Herrera should be an automatic starter. He brings everything we need in that midfield role but that nobody else can offer, yet he's not playing.

6576~~~
I would play both of them tbf. Blind DM, Mata and Di Maria in a free role and Rooney upfront. On other match rest Mata and play two strikers etc but i would never ever break up such a potentially good midfield like the one we have. Such a waste.

No complaints regardless, LvG knows what he is doing.

6577~~~
Herrera - 1.8m
Fellaini - 1.92m with impeccable chest control

Fellaini is the only player in the team who can do a good job when we use the long-ball/early crossing tactics whereas Mata/Rooney/Di Maria can all do a similar job the Herrera. That's the only reason I can think of, that Fellaini adds another dimension to our attack.

6578~~~
The only answer I can come up with is the match fixing allegations. Maybe we're reluctant to make him a key component because there's a good chance he can be suspended. Other than that, there's no valid reason why he shouldn't be playing more often.

I don't think the not LvG's player is the reason. According to Van Gaal he was asked about him and gave his approval. I'm sure if Van Gaal had said he didn't rate him, Woodward and the Glazers would've been more than happy to save 30 Million.

6579~~~
He had 94% pass accuracy with 34 passes in 20 minutes, along with an assist? He didn't do anything special, but he had like 1 or 2 misplaced passes.

6580~~~
Herrera is a brilliant player. 

I have no idea why he isn't starting week in week out for us.

6581~~~
Herrera deserved a run in the side after that goal against Yeovil, but it never came.

Hopefully he doesn't go sour here... lots of patience needed, evidently. But that's part of a larger problem of having no champions league play and essentially no capital one cup either. so few games to go round, it generally means fewer injuries and less need for rotation. of course, injuries have somehow been a problem for us this year despite the lack of games, but that's a different issue altogether.

6582~~~
Sorry, what? 94% pass accuracy. I think you were watching the wrong game, somehow.

6583~~~
Why would he stay? He doesn't start games AT ALL.  He hasn't started a game since Stoke which was December 2nd, since then he has started 1 game for us (Yeovil in the FA Cup).

6584~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/6uHPNssX7N4/hqdefault.jpg" src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/6uHPNssX7N4/hqdefault.jpg"/>

Statistics!

6585~~~
No he didn't.

Why so people keep saying this kind of stuff? Its like his 'thing' thats just stuck.

6586~~~
I genuinely don't have a clue what he's doing with him. He's always good off the bench as well which you'd think would at least stand him in good stead for the following games. He actually got less minutes tonight than the 1st leg!

Maybe LvG likes Herrera on the bench because the rest of his subs are usually complete turd?

6587~~~
That Capital One Cup debacle has not helped. Although Ander was injured after the Swansea game, he came back for the QPR game. He is having to learn to be a less riskier. He is getting there and is a good squad member. I was pleased that he got on and made a good contribution.

6588~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Was that the game we had more of the ball than them and he said "well I know what I saw!"

6589~~~
As an aside, where do you get your stats from? I always see people posting stats after the game but never know where to find them myself.

6590~~~
I have an idea with this possession football we are playing, he wants him to come off the bench when teams are tired and he can zip the ball about.

6591~~~
This guys professionalism is brilliant. He deserves a lot more game time than he is getting at the moment. Not a peep about the little game time he gets, just pure smiles.

6592~~~
Whoscored is pretty good and updates during the game

6593~~~
Cheers mate! I'll bookmark that.

6594~~~
His lack of playing time is really starting to annoy me, not getting games in the FA Cup is crazy.

6595~~~
Yea he was blathering on about them dominating possession and then Sky put the stats up and we'd had something like 60%.

6596~~~
Because he could win things here. I would want to show my kids and grandkids what medals I have won, not that I had played loads of games for some nothing team. As they say Show Me Your Medals. That is what matters to top players in the end.

6597~~~
He is, never moans, just comes on and tries to help his team. A good professional. You need those types in your squad.

6598~~~
Win things while not playing at all? That makes no sense.

6599~~~
He will play enough to have earned whatever we win. Christ even Luke Bloody Chadwick has a medal. He will play plenty.

6600~~~
I think you're being overly optimistic here. Herrera knows he's too good to sit on the bench, why would a 25 year old coming into their prime want to do that when they can go somewhere else? Maybe not quite Man Utd, but probably not far off, and be a guaranteed starter. Not to mention the fact that he himself knows he's not getting games there because we're using a striker in midfield and a giant afroman instead.

6601~~~
Because he actually said the other day in an interview that yes he would like to play all the time, all players do, but he understands that it is different at a club like this. I also think if he left he would feel he had failed.

6602~~~
That's the trouble though - I want to see a team play the kind of football Herrera is good at, not the kind that needs a long ball to Fellaini. It bothers me that we'd buy a player of Ander's type if we didn't want one.

I do wonder if Herrera is struggling with the court case though. Even if you're convinced you're innocent, legal proceedings can be a huge emotional strain. That can have all kinds of negative knock-on impacts in terms of frustration, loss of concentration and depression. Of course a fractured rib and a manager who doesn't trust/need you might put the top hat on that.

6603~~~
Has he shagged Van Gaal's daughter?

6604~~~
What else is he going to say? 

"Nah, I'm pissed, I want out" ?

6605~~~
I hate that LVG doesnt seem to rate him.

6606~~~
Some would. We don't know what he is being told. If he is happy that is all that matters. It is nobody elses business. If he isn't than he has to take it up with the manager. He might have already and has been given reassurances. We don't know and are all just jumping to conclusions as people do.

6607~~~
I think every United fan would want to see us play the kind of football that Herrera excels at and it's weird because if you substitute Herrera for Fellaini tonight, you have a group of players that are certainly capable of playing that type of football. I guess LVG feels as though we're not currently at the level where we can play like that so he needs to employ a crude, direct approach which can lead to scrappy goals.

I'd be tempted to agree that the court case and not playing regularly is taking its toll on him, but the fact is he puts in solid performances whenever he does play :/.

6608~~~
He didn't though, did he?

6609~~~
It says something that all the stuff going on and he still contributes when he comes on. I just think LvG has been caught out by some of the styles of play employed by teams over here. He seems to have a real problem with teams with big men in them and adjusts his teams accordingly, instead of letting them worry about us. Next season he might just say What the hell.

6610~~~
It's immensely frustrating to watch a player who you were delighted to see the club sign, who you (and many on here, I assume) watched for years in La Liga and thought would be great for us, especially given how awful our midfield has been in recent years, not get any games, even against league two opposition.

Whatever the circumstances are, or aren't, I don't for a second believe there's any fundamental reason he should possibly be playing this little other than the manager simply doesn't really seem to rate him much or see him as a good fit for our current team, which is left all the more baffling when you consider some of his other selections and decisions.

6611~~~
He kind of did actually. Not a LOT but a noticeable amount. Seems to be what you get with him. He's that little bit more progressive and exciting but also more likely to lose the ball. With Van Gaal's twitchy ass it's the latter quality that must have him so far down the pecking order.

6612~~~
I don't think he is happy that the squad isn't at the level he wants yet. Next summer signings will show what system he wants to play. I think a lot of the systems we have seen this season are down to injuries, players in certain positions not being good enough and him insisting on worrying about teams with tall players and who supposedly play the long ball.

6613~~~
94% pass completion.

6614~~~
2 or 3 passes in 34 with a 94% accuracy is pretty damn good, certainly not "a lot", I'd say it's maybe ... a little.
I think the chances of Herrera being here alongside next summer's signings are quite slim, at this rate.

6615~~~
You can also lose the ball with heavy touch, turning into an opposition player or just getting muscled off the ball. More to retaining the football than not passing it to the wrong shirt.  A noticeable amount of moves broke down with him today. 

Anyway, it's definitely an aspect of his game and by far the most plausible explanation for him not getting many games. What else? Van Gaal is pissed off because he lost a load of money betting on Spanish football?

6616~~~
Hes always in space and constantly on the move, dynamic as feck.

6617~~~
If twice is a lot then so be it. I recall you referring to his ball retention as a criticism back in the summer and it's something people seem to have jumped on albeit there is little evidence to suggest it is any kind of problem. Attempting a through ball while surrounded by multiple players outside the opposition box is hardly indicative of a problem if it doesn't reach its target.

I'd also suggest that the reason it appears noticeable is because we <i>do </i>seem to have a Kagawa-like situation building whereby unnecessary focus is being placed on his performances, for better or worse.

I know that I was watching him more closely than I was Blind, for example, and I'd hazard a guess that, you, many others and most definitely (chomping at the bit) charley, were too.

Until he gets regular game time it's difficult to assess him with any genuine authority.

6618~~~
Don't think that was me. I watch very little Spanish football. You're right about watching him very closely though. I guess we're all doing that. We all desperately want him to win the gaffer round. I mean, I do think he's been up and down and can be a bit sloppy but there's so much positive about him too. Shame Van Gaal is evidently still very unconvinced.

6619~~~
We might as well just play Blind, Carrick and Mata in midfield and be done with it. 

Di Maria is another one who's naturally progressive and risky with his passes which explains why he barely features in midfield. He did have a good game today in the LCM position though, his best position imo.

Fellaini, whilst being decent with his short passes has the tendency to mess up the most basic of passes. Had some absolute mares against Pool first half and Southampton etc in this regard.

It's just mind boggling how Herrera doesn't get the opportunities. We've been crying out for an injection of high tempo passing and a more incisive passer in some absolutely mind numbing games. Rooney and Fellaini aren't capable of doing that and we shackle Di Maria by pushing him further forward where he can't do it whilst leaving Herrera on the bench...

6620~~~
Blind and Rojo were undeniably Van Gaal signings. Herrera, Shaw and Falcao, none seem to be completely in favour and the two former were definitely not Van Gaal signings. I think that Falcao was a Woody prestige signing. Of course there is Di Maria but his level is too high to be ignored.

6621~~~
I'm just got back from the game and by the sounds of thing, I clearly missed the second coming of Christ walking onto the pitch in the second half.

Don't get me wrong - I want Herrera to play as much as the next guy - but come on, he was about as fine as everyone else was tonight. He wasn't any more progressive or sharp on the ball than anyone else - it was basically just more of the same as what we were doing before he came on the pitch, which you know... is nice.

6622~~~
He looked a bit shy to play forward pass because I think the one think Van doesn't like on him is giving away the ball by sloppy passing. Not that he is any bad at passing he has almost everytime over 90% accuracy but he makes mistake here and there BUT other players doing mistakes too. When you see Rooney making some terrible mistakes by passing or losing the ball in crucial moments setting up the counterattack you must be thinking that it is insane to bench this player who is apart that brilliant in every aspect of his game. Can win the ball, play a through ball and always available doing things while moving. This player should start every game for us.

6623~~~
But you don't actually know any of that. You're just guessing based on vague paper-reported timings. Just like I'm guessing when I say that I reckon we only bought players that the new manager, who after all was confirmed long before we signed anyone, was happy for us to buy.

6624~~~
And what do you want from him, he played for about 15 minutes and the game was over. As I mentioned above I think van Gaal doesn't like risky passing which sometimes he does that is why he kept the ball on the ground and passed around the pitch rather than doing anything special. The guy must be also mentally down that everything he does doesn't make him to start even against fecking league two side..

6625~~~
I don't believe that at all, especially in the case of Shaw. That deal was reported as done in January.

6626~~~
It was a few games into pre season, I reckon. Ball retention was a talking point. If it wasn't you then fair enough, but there was an early sceptic amongst us, definitely. Unless Louis frequents this side of the Internet..

6627~~~
Not by anyone half reliable. The general narrative seems to be that we basically had the groundwork for a deal in place by the time the World Cup started, but Shaw didn't want to be distracted by negotiations, so we couldn't conclude the deal until after the tournament. But even that is mostly just from various papers, which is entirely my point. You can 'believe' what you want, but you don't actually know shit.

6628~~~
yes it's an aspect of his game, no doubt, always has been, which makes me wonder, why fecking buy him then? His success average in Spain was around 82%, surely LvG knew what he was getting with him? He knew he was getting someone who is going to misplace passes and lose the ball a bit due to their style of play, right? Surely the club we support and the manager at its helm aren't fecking thick enough to spend £30m on a player without first knowing all this, are they? Or am I being too optimistic?

6629~~~
Bit strong isn't when you are in the same shitless boat. 

Don't stop believing pal.

6630~~~
Mate, that's exactly what I said in my original post. No-one knows anything, so on what basis are you talking about players being 'Van Gaal signings' or 'Woody signings'?

6631~~~
Can't believe people are saying he'll leave in the summer. CL football next season, we'll have more games and he will play more.

We need as many quality players as possible.

6632~~~
But he isn't really in team's rotation, that's the point. If he were playing every other game you could say he'd play more with CL football in our schedule, as it stands it'd just add more games where he could be put on the bench while other players are rotated.

He hasn't started a league game in 2 months. He's played a total of around 150 minutes apart from Yeovil FA Cup game that he started.

I'd be livid if I were him. Rooney starts in midfield ahead of him even though he clearly cannot play there.

6633~~~
Rooney gives the ball away in dangerous situations leading to a counter attack at least once or twice per game(unlike Herrera who at least loses it quite high on the pitch when trying something creative) yet van Gaal insists on playing Rooney <i>in midfield. </i>Fellaini isn't much better either when played in midfield, and Mata has his poor games when he is struggling with phyisically stronger opponents marking him. It's just a lazy excuse, no way I am buying it.

edit: And yeah, I almost forgot to add di Maria too. So pretty much neither of our midfielders is much better at not giving the ball away than him.

6634~~~
Well maybe not a lot but he did a few times. Considering he was only on the pitch for 20 mins around 90% pass completion is the very least you'd expect from any competent midfielder, especially against a team that was 2-0 down and only managed about 30% possession throughout the whole match.
Also, as has been said, pass completion is a very, very different stat to losing the ball.

He did nothing wrong. He did okay, actually but some people on here were acting like he came on and walked on water.

6635~~~
He links very well with the fullbacks when they get forward. You would think if we are playing without wingers that that should count for more. Too many times this season have our fullbacks lacked support and a player to properly link with.

6636~~~
I really think LVG doesn't think Herrera and di Maria can play together.

6637~~~
I think Rooney is far more adept at losing the ball but as LVG had said repeatedly, he views him as undroppable. I'd rather have Herrara in the middle than Rooney personally.

6638~~~
I get the feeling LvG doesn't feel he can play him and Di Maria in the same line-up. Good assist today when he came on and he seems to be keeping his head down and trying to ride out this difficult period.

6639~~~
Wot... are we talking about Rooney or Herrera?!?

Ander had zero instances of bad control and wasn't dispossesed once in his 24 minute cameo. His passing accuracy implies tha the made little bad passes either. Ae you Van Gaal in disguise?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/921658/LiveStatistics/England-FA-Cup-2014-2015-Manchester-United-Cambridge-U" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/92...A-Cup-2014-2015-Manchester-United-Cambridge-U</a>

6640~~~
People will see what they want to see. Ander's movement and the timing of his movements are so underrated.

6641~~~
Lvg should get his twitchy ass checked out. This guy needs to play more.

6642~~~
For all the talk of him being risky and sloppy the guy who we play every week in midfield probably messes things up due to poor touches/passes more than anyone else given he's not even a midfielder.

6643~~~
If you add Rooney to that equation, then I'd agree.  In the math of putting all these puzzle pieces together, Herrera seems to get the lowest coefficient of those three from LVG.

Fellaini's form doesn't help either, but I think the last-minute deal for Falcao is what really fowled up Herrera.  As that meant Rooney would inevitably be moved further back into what are Herrera's natural postion(s).

6644~~~
Moved the ball well. Should play a lot more. 

Rooney---RVP-------
----------Mata--------
--DiMaria------Herrera
---------Blind---------

Would seem to be worth a shot as our lineup at home.

6645~~~

6646~~~
The lad is not having a great time at the moment. It is a shame but I only hope he comes out the other end smiling.

6647~~~
We don't know what has been going on, if this has affected him. Hope it goes well for him.

6648~~~
True.

I fear playing for Manchester United might not help his cause during the court case.

6649~~~
Well he is going to miss the Newcastle game and then it is the F.A. Cup Q/F a few days later. It all depends how it is going for him. What a mess.

6650~~~
He brings so much more positives to the team than many other players that play regulary like Rooney in midfield or Fellaini. He's always available, plays the ball forward (on the ground, not hoofing) while bringing energy and urgency to our play. Exactly what we need. LVG really should play him

6651~~~
Yep, and if we want to play Fellaini I'd rather see Mata replaced than Herrera to be honest.

6652~~~
Can pretty much guarantee that it'll have affected him on some level. Credit to him for putting in some good performances in spite of what's been happening, when he's been on the pitch you wouldn't notice that there's anything wrong. Hopefully it'll all be ok.

6653~~~
I completely agree with this. I would love to see a midfield four of Blind, Fellaini, Herrera and Di Maria. It would be very balanced.

6654~~~
He's ok when he plays, doesn't do much wrong in fairness but I don't think it's a huge travesty he is missing out at the moment. To me it does seem a bit like the Kagawa situation still in that their stock rises when they're on the bench and we struggle, if they come on and do little people just ignore that fact completely and scrape the barrel for compliments of the performance.

Comparing kagawa and herrera makes no sense, kagawa was just never good enough at united, people would fawn over his " movement" or his " 1 touch passing"

Whereas Herrera in limited minutes already has 3 goals and 4 assists from midfield, hes a damn productive player if you ask me

6656~~~
I really love the guy but i believe some of you are exaggerating here. It's not like we have Iniesta or Schweinsteiger in our squad and we're leaving him to rot on the bench. Our midfield has two major problems at the moment. The first one is the absence of a ball carrier/box to box midfielder with the ability to operate in deeper positions, receive the first pass from Carrick/Blind or/and collect the second balls near our box and connect the lines. The second problem is the lack of players who beat defenders and make things happen on their own in the final third.

I'll start with the latter because it's easier to analyse. It's obvious that Ander isn't a winger and he can not play as a forward in our current formations. The only option for him is to play in the hole instead of Mata. I have watched him at Athletic in that role, he served Valverde's high pressing game well but he wasn't the player the Basques relied on to get goals and assists. In a season we struggle to create anything from the wings and our forwards seem to be cut off from the rest of the team Mata comes second in the "chances created" category (28), behind only Di Maria (35) and ahead of Rooney (26) and van Persie (20). Now, if our forwards can gain some decent form and manage to beat defenders to a ball more often, Herrera could really prove useful in that role. He would also definitely improve our pressing game. Some suggest that he can be better than Mata in the creative area too and while this may be true, you can not blame the manager for rotating our most creative players (Mata, Rooney, AdM) in that role. This isn't the position we need strengthening.

As for the ball carrier/box to box midfielder, we don't have one in our squad and the fact that Rooney isn't doing a great job doesn't mean that Herrera can play the role better, right now. It is a "special" role in the diamond since we're not using two all around box to box midfielders. It seems that LvG has decided to use AdM (with Januzaj next in the pecking order) as the more attacking minded CM, the one who will push up, run at defenders and try to make things happen in the final third. The other box to box midfielder must have a more organizing role in our midfield. Rooney, who is currently playing there, is not a ready-made solution and Herrera isn't either. Both of them are learning the position. Why does LvG prefer Rooney? Imo it's not the defensive contribution, the physicality or the concentration. Rooney is great at doing two things on the pitch, the first one is collecting second balls and the other is that he's very quick in developing a good understanding with his teammates. Maybe van Gaal believes he can do the first near our box as well as he does it in the final third. The second is pretty obvious, yesterday it took him 10-15 minutes to start clicking with McNair on the right.

So, is Herrera doomed at United? I'd say we're not even close to that. After all, the manager has said that we are more than full in the #10 position and that Rooney is the best option we have there. We must also keep in mind that LvG is a manager who strongly believes that a player can improve through training. Herrera's job is not to come on and be slightly better than Rooney as a CM, he must adopt to the role and own it. I strongly believe that he can make it here.

6657~~~
I'm not comparing them in terms of being players but rather in terms of the fact their stock rises when they don't play. I'm not suggesting either are bad footballers but at the same time they're not the saviour to all our problems.

People are writing him off way to early as well, it's possible he's just taking a while to settle it happens to plenty of players. Ivanovic at Chelsea barely played in his first few seasons and now he's probably one of the first names on the team sheet. Herrera has been here a little over 6 months.

6658~~~
I dont think herrera has shown signs he needs to settle in, everytime hes played hes a character in the Rafael type of mode, likes to grab the game by the scruff of the neck, is a real little fighter, very combative, and direct

6659~~~
He's not taking a while to settle. He's been good when played, he's just been put away from the side by van Gaal with seemingly no chance of return.

6660~~~
I think he has settled in as a person, his style of play maybe needs to be tweaked by LvG. Just wants him to be a bit more disciplined. Although there are plenty of others who are still taking risks and are getting gametime.

6661~~~
can't even get a start against a league 2 opposition..<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6662~~~
Maybe not for what we expect. For what LVG expects though it seems clear he has, hence he's not playing. There's also other aspects, he might not be settling in off the pitch etc. Never really know.

I don't actually dislike the guy and think he's decent enough when he plays, just don't see it as this big mistake when he doesn't really. Whilst we're not brilliant to watch we have won a lot of games recently without him.

6663~~~
Most of our recent wins, have been against pretty lowly teams, and a win should be expected, its just the play wasnt so good, and alot of that is due to playing Rooney in midfield, and people think by playing an actual midfielder with the composure, vision and skills needed to play there, herrera is a much better fit than Rooney

6664~~~
I am actually starting to feel sorry for Wayne as I can't imagine he wants to be playing there. He won't admit it publically though.

6665~~~
LvG is finding a spot for Rooney in the team regardless of the formation he plays and the other players out there, he shouldn't be too frustrated. The manager is basically saying he's completely undroppable, unlike certain others.

6666~~~
Nobody should be undroppable. tbh.

6667~~~
That's Wayne, always shy to publicly admit when he isn't happy.

6668~~~
He only does it when there's money involved. I still haven't forgiven him for those episodes.

6669~~~
He's a greedy, selfish cnut and he does it whenever he wants something. Never feel sorry for Wayne Rooney.

6670~~~
He would soon talk if he wasn't undroppable.

6671~~~
That's the problem LvG has created for himself. He should never have said that. Now if he does need to anytime, the shit will seriously hit the fan with Rooney.

6672~~~
Yep, it's really frustrating to see him playing again and again in that position especially when it seems like he's moving Di Maria back into midfield. I'm scared he actually believes Rooney's doing a good job there, or if it's just what others think about getting all the names on the pitch at the same time. I'd be concerned about him leading the line now too. He done it very well in 2009/10 but that was 5 years ago. RVP has shown since then he's the superior front man, and leads the line better without dropping deep all the time. I'd probably prefer Rooney playing off him, but then I like Mata in there too.

6673~~~
Vicious circle.
Lvg is obsessed about playing 2 strikers. Rooney isn’t one of them according to Louis, but he’s captain and he’s undroppable. So there are 3 positions left for him. One is for holding midfielder, second is for Di Maria for obvious reasons. So he’s basically competing with Fellaini and Mata-and he’s losing the battle.

Now I can totally understand why Fellaini is playing <span style="text-decoration: underline">in some games</span>. Mata is class but there is a huge difference between him and Herrera- Juan gets his goals because he has great instinct and he finds himself in the box all the time (I’ve been saying this for a long time now, he’s a second striker). Ander always stays at the edge of the box to play some quick short passes and link with teammates.

I think we would be great if we played something like that:

IMO it’s our most balanced team. But yeah, LvG talks about balance a lot but there’s no way he will drop RvP, Falcao and Mata. One can dream though.
*Wilson is no better than RvP/Falcao, but it’s not like any other strikers variant worked for us, and Wilson at least adds pace to our team. We could play Herrera instead of Fellaini with Rooney behind two strikers too.  

You would expect Mata to create many chances, considering how much he has played this season (1605 mins). He got 3 assists and 6 goals in all competitions. Herrera has 4 assists and 3 goals in 785mins. Mata gets an assist every <b>535’</b> and goal every <b>267’</b>. Herrera gets an assist every <b>196’</b> and goal every <b>261’</b>. This is just stats on relatively small sample of course, so I wouldn’t rely on that but you can clearly see the difference between their style of play. Not saying Mata is a bad player, but for the team that lacks creativity Herrera should be playing much, much more often than he is now.

I’m comparing the Spaniards because I think they are in direct competition for a spot in the team, Fellaini is a different story.

So is Herrera. I don’t get this idea that Rooney is a better midfielder than him. Rooney has good skillset for a midfielder and maybe he could develop into a very good one but IMO he’s not really interested in this new role van Gaal has designated to him- which is the complete opposite for Ander. Either way, both of them should start for us on regular basis. 

I am actually amazed that Herrera looks quite sharp every time he gets a few minutes, despite not starting any game for 2 months.

6674~~~
Do you really believe that it would have made such a significant difference if Herrera had started in the #10 role instead of Mata, Rooney and AdM thus far this season? Because that's the real question here... i pretty much doubt it. I've watched Ander several times at Athletic and i know what he can offer there. There are several things he can do better than Mata on the pitch but both of them feed off the movement their teammates provide. Our forwards are usually in poor form and can't offer much while all our opponents choose to defend in a very narrow shape because they are not afraid of our (F)WBs' crosses. This leaves very little space in the final third for Mata to work with and i believe it would be the same for Herrera. Only Rooney, with his ability to create pockets of space near the opponent's box, has offered more in that position this season.

Now, i never suggested that Rooney is a better midfielder in my post. I mentioned that LvG sees Herrera as a candidate for the position of the CM who will play closer to Carrick/Blind in our midfield. It would suit him better to have a more advanced role but the manager prefers Di Maria there (with Januzaj as his substitute). I don't like Rooney as a CM but i don't believe Herrera is marginally better in that role either, right now. If Rooney was playing there instead of Fabregas or Modric, i would understand what the fuzz is all about. They both don't know the position well, they have very little experience in it. I fully agree with you that Herrera has much more potential to reach that level than anyone else in our squad and i think LvG sees that potential and wants to work with him. Fergie did something similar with Fletcher in the beginning of his career.

What i do know is that LvG is usually quite direct with the players he doesn't rate. A couple of weeks ago we had similar discussions regarding Januzaj's future at the club. Since late December van Gaal has been mentioning that he's not going anywhere and now we see him getting more playing time. I'm quite sure that is the case with Herrera too. I believe we will end the season playing with Blind(Carrick)-Herrera, AdM-Rooney in our midfield but we will look much more composed and faster with the ball.

6675~~~
By that logic, it's not like we are Bayern or Barca to have Iniesta or Schweinsteiger, let alone bench them. The point is, he is a fantastic player that when plays, makes the whole team look a lot easier on the eye. Not to mention the fact he's comfortably better than any player he's fighting with for the position he wants to play in. Like it or not, we are wasting a talent by leaving him to rot on the bench. I'm not sure how anyone can dispute that.

6676~~~
In his last couple of appearances, I've noticed that Herrera has been safer and more cautious in his game than he was in the past. His passing choices aren't as adventurous as they used to be. However, whilst he's made himself less cavalier, he still contributes to the high tempo and good rhythm of our passing. His movement is disciplined yet fluid. He still looks for passes through though not as frequently as he used to. van Gaal's already transforming him for that more disciplined box-to-box role, and I think, in the end, we may be able to accommodate di Maria, Herrera, and an attacking midfielder together with Blind as the holding midfielder.

6677~~~
I have my opinion which one of Herrera and Mata is better- it depends on the setup, but IMO we don’t play formation that suits Mata the most, so I guess you already know who I prefer. But that doesn’t matter that much, what annoys me that there is clear evidence that Herrera brings (in worst case) the same productivity- yet he doesn’t get even half the minutes Mata does. He started 2 games in last 2 months- vs Yeovil (scored a goal) and vs Stoke ( grabbed an assist).  I am of the opinion that players should be treated fair- and I don’t think that’s the case right now. Imagine the reaction here if Mata was kept out of the team.

And I don’t think that Mata and Herrera are that similar at all, as I stated before. Neither is a number 10 in my book- Mata is closer to striker, Herrera is closer to a midfielder. Semantics <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Yeah that wasn’t directed at you, I just pointed out why Herrera is kept out of the team and why I disagree with LvG decisions. Glad you mentioned Fabregas and Modric- I suspect the reason that Ander isn’t playing much is because he doesn’t fall into the category of superstars who will always play when fit- Rooney, Di Maria, RvP, Mata, Falcao. So basically we’re dealing with something I hoped will not be an issue under van Gaal, and he can talk about the balance as much as he wants. Things are getting better recently, but I am not sure if that’s not a coincidence (Carrick injury forced us to change the setup).

6678~~~
Couldn't agree more. We are all frustrated with the poor quality of our football but we often forget that we are still a work in progress.

<a class="username" data-user="77194, @Borys" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77194/">@Borys</a> The quote above is what i think of the LvG-Herrera relationship. I believe you're a bit unfair towards LvG with your last comment. His history suggests otherwise. What i meant was we need a player who can play this specific role as good as Fabregas and Modric do at their clubs, not buy the next superstar who becomes available. Herrera has the potential to become such a player and imo he needs good training more than playing 90 minutes week in week out. But to say that he is not quite there yet isn't a hypothesis, it is a fact.

6679~~~
I’m not sure if you understood my point. I never implied Herrera is close to Modric or Fabregas, just that he does a lot of good things for us but isn’t in the “undroppable” names bracket, so he finds himself on the bench more often than he should- in my opinion of course.

Yet that doesn’t stop LvG from playing Rooney in midfield. And call me old-fashioned but it’s easier to mould a natural 24 year old attacking midfielder into a slightly different type of midfielder than a 29 year old striker.

Well that’s why I was happy when we signed him, but it’s pretty clear he is trying to shoehorn star players at the expense of balance, wouldn’t you agree?

6680~~~
I get your point, the only thing we really disagree about Herrera is the impact he can have in the first team right here, right now. I agree more with what mazhar wrote just above. Imo Herrera can become a catalyst in our pressing game and our build up plays but it will take some more time. If we had CL football (and had played a couple more matches in the League Cup) we would have probably seen much more of Ander this season.

The way LvG has treated Wilson and Falcao still makes me hesitant to buy into the "always play the big names" theory. I hope i'm right and you are wrong about this <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>.

Imo Rooney will return to one of his preferred positions (#10 or forward) as soon as Herrera is ready enough to offer exactly what LvG wants from him in that role. It's not uncommon for a manager to "protect" a player (the Januzaj example i mentioned) or "mistreat" him (limited playing time or played out of position) like Sir Alex did with many players. If that's not the case i will be very disappointed. I've watched all the teams LvG has managed during his career and i can't even think that he doesn't rate a player with Herrera's abilities.

As i said in my previous post, i believe we'll end up playing a diamond of Blind(holding CM), AdM & Herrera(box to box) and Rooney with RvP and Mata up front but the team as a whole will look much better on the pitch.

6681~~~
as a footballer herrera has pretty much been in his prime time.  this allows him to look sharp within our current squad which in general are not much in form hence are in lack of pace.  i believe that's the main reason why there are so many fellow cafs to moan his missing in plays.

the biggest problem of his game is, so far he played for united, he keeps running out of his position too often.  the position he plays is supposed to be a very key position, if not the most single important one, to provide balance for the team play.  he is there to fill holes whenever pop up everywhere, so the balance of team play restores.

since the 1st qpr game herrera has only focused in involving himself into the goal scoring process.  he has just positioned himself at the edge of the opponent box to force himself into the no 10 role.  in the fa cup game against yeovil herrera and rooney played togather in midfield.  a natural way perceived would be rooney to take a higher row with herrera to marshal the midfield.   turned out it was rooney to keep dropping back to pick up the ball from fletcher and herrera was always found at the edge of the opponent box.  and this is not occasional.  he doesn't help maintain the balance of team play, on the other hand, his running do amplify our imbalances.  i well believe this is the reason why he has been benched for so much games up to now.

everyone here including me want to see him plays more, as he is one of those few lads who are in their would-be prime time under our current squad.  but herrera needs to commit himself as a team player.  otherwise,  he is only ruining his career in united.  none of us want to see to concede 5 goals within 30 mins to leicester aka teams again.

flying dutchmen.   part of the crew, part of the ship.

6682~~~
Is playing matches more useful than good training in any instance? Food for thought.

6683~~~
Good post. I believe he has a big impact on our game (in a positive sense) and like I said, it would be a good idea to play him at the tip but I really hope that your theory turns out to be right anyway.

6684~~~

6685~~~
LvG has said that he must improve to get a place in the side and he has tough competition for a place at number 10. He clearly views him in that role only it seems.

6686~~~
good luck to him, he wont get past Rooney.

6687~~~
Dear LVG,

Herrera >>>> Midfield Rooney.

Best regards

6688~~~
Like i thought, LvG doesn't view him as a box-to-box midfielder. It is going to be difficult for him here, and that is a shame.

6689~~~
Then he's an idiot for approving his purchase, quite frankly.

6690~~~
So LVG considers him a no.10? Quite frankly, he's a moron for splashing £30m on him. I'm not as big a fan of Herrera as many others on him, but this whole situation is a bit of a joke.

6691~~~
Nothing new really. The club will go for another midfielder, and Herrera wont be any closer to the first team next season.

6692~~~
He didn't splash the money on him though...

6693~~~
Why only as number ten? He mentioned Rooney, who is not playing as number ten, also di Maria who is also playing as number ten.

6694~~~
He sanctioned the purchase, he said so himself.

6695~~~
This will prove to be yet another dropped bollock in the transfer market.

6696~~~
He said Herrera is now on the way back so we'll see if he'll use him more.

6697~~~
If he only sees him as a #10 then Herrera will struggle to get any starts at all. He seems more than capable to play deeper though, so it is odd. An odd decision to buy him if that was the case too.

6698~~~
Sometimes signings don't go the way you want them to.

When Herrera was signed I'm sure LVG envisaged using Rooney as a striker and Herrera as a midfielder. For whatever reason he hasn't done that.

6699~~~
So this is how Van Gaal sees it...

<b>Di Maria</b>---Blind/Carrick----<b>Rooney</b>
---------<b>Mata</b>--------
RVP-----------Falcao

Herrera has to compete with Di Maria, Rooney and Mata for a spot as LVG said. Really though, I believe Di Maria and Rooney are both 10s whereas Herrera can be a proper central midfielder. If LVG really wanted this so called 'balance', he'd go with Blind/Carrick holding, an actual centre midfielder (Herrera) next to the them and then two number 10s out of Rooney/Di Maria and Mata.

Instead he goes for three number 10s but plays one of them (Rooney) as a defensive midfielder when surely a proper midfielder like Herrera would be more suited to the role. Van Gaal is fitting in all the big names rather than looking for balance, quite hypocritical of him. Bottom line - he should pick two of his three number 10s to start rather than play all three and shoehorn one as a defensive midfielder.

Edit:

That's assuming we have to stick to two out and out number nines... I don't see why that always has to be the case, dropping one of the strikers instead of the 10s and playing Herrera would also balance things just as much.

I'm disappointed LVG views Herrera as a 10 and not a centre midfielder. I thought Herrera use to be a 10 but he developed his game to become a more rounded midfielder and he seems a perfect fit for us. It's a real shame.

6700~~~
He wants a Vidal/Strootman type in midfield, i can see why Herrera doesn't fit this, but as said it is shocking why we splashed 30m on him if he wasn't supposed to be a starter.

6701~~~
Interesting that he compares him against Mata and Rooney. I'd pull out the 'he knows best, because he sees him in training and we don't', but this is a man that has played Di Maria in every position but his best and now has Rooney consistently playing in midfield. What a confusing manager he's proving to be so far.

6702~~~
Yeah, sure, but the issue is that everyone else sees him as a midfielder and Rooney as a striker still. He's the one making the ridiculous decision here. It's also shocking if he didn't do enough research to figure out if he's a midfielder or a 10. He's played in both positions previously, after all.

6703~~~
AdM is in the first XI-LvG sees Hererra as a poor complement as he's an attacking MF.  Rooney, in LvG's opinion is a better MF partner to AdM-who we all want to have a pretty free role.  Mata is first choice #10.  

Will be interesting to see what happens over the summer.  Not sure Rooney is best suited for the #6, and is a stopgap this season.  But, we'll see if LvG wants to play Rooney in that position based on the summer's business.

6704~~~
He was always at his best as a number 10 at Athletic Club so it shouldn't really be a surprise...

6705~~~
He offers a lot more than Mata in the #10 role in terms of mobility, defensive cover and tactical flexibility. Mata is of course the superior passer, Ander has the vision but his technique is sometimes lacking. And despite being fairly goal shy at Bilbao, his minutes per goal contribution have been pretty impressive... 

A very prudent signing, though. Really, should we expect anything else?

6706~~~
Firstly, I'd like to say I'd definitely play Herrera but this is my attempt to understand LVG's thinking.

The nuts and bolts is, I think he doesn't think Herrera is disciplined enough in defensive work. My take is that he's equated our helter skelter defending at the start of the season (specifically the Leicester game, which seems to have left a huge mark on him) to having Di Maria and Herrera in midfield and has decided he needs someone who'll do more defensively. That's why initially he dropped Herrera for Fellaini who did OK and then proceeded to get injured. Even so, I think he then decided that while Fellaini adds some defensive sturdiness his forward passing is a bit shit. While Rooney's is also suspect, I'd say Rooney is far more likely to unlock a defense with a good ball or a good run from deep than Fellaini.

I think this is the "balance" that he's been banging on about since the start of the season and he's reached an answer which isn't perfect but is in his head adequate for now. He'll probably rectify the situation by signing a better allround midfielder in the summer (hopefully).

As for signing him in the first place, it isn't a huge deal. He couldn't have known everything about our squad from the outset. He probably liked the way Herrera played from what he'd seen and when the option came to sign him he agreed. Also, the Di Maria signing was very unlikely when the Herrera deal was done. The smart money was him going to PSG.

6707~~~
As I said, he is done here. Van Gaal is very stubborn and if he has decided that he won't use him then he won't use him. He has very little chance of displacing Rooney, Di Maria or even Mata.

He probably cannot wait to get rid of him and sign beloved Strootman.

6708~~~
I think you're probably spot on, or close to, with your reasons as to why LvG isn't picking him. The problem is that I just don't really agree with those reasons. 

I don't believe Herrera isn't defensively disciplined, certainly no less so than Rooney and certainly more so than Di Maria or Mata. As for Fellaini, that's highly debatable, I think it's abundantly obvious the main reason he's in the team is for his physical and aerial prowess from an offensive perspective, as opposed to his defensive abilities, hence why he's usually further forward with Carrick/Blind/both behind him. Then there's the fact that we use Di Maria up front, Rooney in midfield, play three strikers at once, use three at the back instead of an extra midfielder, etc etc. So many reasons I just don't agree with that ultimately culminate in Herrera not getting any games for us at the moment. it's difficult for me to list all those decisions he makes and not be utterly baffled by them and the fact that Herrera doesn't play, because him playing would negate the bleedin' need for them, in my opinion.

I would also say spunking £30m on a player he clearly wasn't sure of in terms of where he'd play or his suitability to the team is definitely more than "not a huge deal", although probably less of a big deal than spending £60m on one of the best players in the world and using him everywhere except his best position for the most part, but that's a different discussion I guess.

6709~~~
Would be nice to know how much of a Van Gaal signing Herrera really is. What helps is to have some details of the transfer. Luckily there is a man called Andy Mitten who wrote something on it.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/sport-opinion/andy-mitten-ander-herrera-sexy-7358093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/sport-opinion/andy-mitten-ander-herrera-sexy-7358093</a>

So he speaks of the deal being done before June was out. Van Gaal was announced as our coach 20th of May. So when he was negotiating the final stages of his contract I suspect Woody was in advanced stages of bringing Herrera in. Woody tried to sign him for Moyes, Fergie was already scouting him.

Don't think Van Gaal knew much of him actually, he was very occupied with his Holland job, and when Ander had a great last season for Bilbao there weren't many Dutch players in the Spanish liga he was scouting. So sure whilst negotiating his contract with United, he could've said no to a talented young midfielder who was having an excellent season for a club that finished 4th in Spain.

But that doesn't make sense given the effort and interest we've had in Herrera over the years, the lack of other good midfielders fit/for sale, our failure deliver in the previous summer. He also talked openly in interviews this summer how he would've liked to sign Vidal but that wasn't possible. He said he approved of the transfers, in a context of explaining United was already busy signing them, he saw two young and talented players so he said Ok, something like that. So in the end he definitely 'approved' of it

As for Herrera, I hope and also expect he's going to be here next year, he's definitely a talented player and he plays football in the right way. Seems to have a great mentality and looks like an ideal player to have in your squad. But I also think it's going to be tough for him given the competition.

The real question is: Could we challenge for the league with a midfield of
----- Blind -----
Herrera - Di Maria
or
------- Blind -------    ---------- Blind#6------------
Herrera Di Maria------  --- Herrera#8--------------
------- Mata   -------  ------------ Rooney #10 (Di Maria as a winger?)

And how about the Champions League?

6710~~~
He's made a total mess of the Summer transfer window. At the minute it looks like the only two transfers that made sense were the cheap ones - Rojo for £15m might have been worth the money and Blind has definitely proven himself a capable footballer. Shaw for £30m I don't know about but as time goes it seems that Di Maria was cut from the same cloth as Mata i.e. panic buy intended to be a marquee signing with no real plan as how to use him. Falcao hasn't settled very well either and Herrera looks like a provocation of a transfer, 'look at me, I can spend £30m on a player and then not use him AT ALL'. An experienced manager ought to have known better.

6711~~~
He said before June was even out. We signed him at the end of June, it took about 10 days to get the transfer pushed through.

6712~~~
Yep, and it's funny that possibly our best spell of the season so far (around late November/December time I think) was when we had none of the new signings in the team (starting with the Hull game where Di Maria went off injured)

6713~~~
Damn again you correct me again Pexbo. You're absolutely right, I misread it.

6714~~~
It's annoying because I really feel that there is plenty of potential in all of them.

6715~~~
I find Van Gaal strange on this 

In terms of their midfield performances could anyone argue that Rooney or Mata have been better than Herrera?

6716~~~
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> if that's the case.

Feck Strootman, I say.

Strootman is fecked I say

Hmm...I think from what Herrera said earlier about wanting to play as a #10 with us, I get the feeling that van Gaal also got that idea about Herrera and is treating him as a #10 rather than as a #8. It's not that the Leceister game was the catalyst in any way; Herrera did start against West Ham and did very well as a #8 before going off injured. Herrera's defensive game isn't the issue here.

After having watched Herrera carefully ever since he came here and comparing that to a few of his Bilbao performances that I vaguely remember (<a class="username" data-user="28685, @Cina" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28685/">@Cina</a> and <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> can help me with this), I have come to the conclusion that Herrera is starting to play as a more attacking player than he ever did at Bilbao. At Bilbao, since Bielsa came in, Herrera hasn't really played as a #10, and if he ever did, he'd be more conservative than an actual #10. Much of Bilbao's work in the final third was done by the wingers and striker with one of the box-to-box midfielders making late runs into the box (Herrera less often than his partner, Mikel Rico or de Marcos/Javi Martinez before). Herrera would be the main playmaker in midfield as a #8 under Bielsa, whilst Valverde initially made him a #6 before giving him more freedom as a #8 again.

Ever since he came here, Herrera's frequently looked to go forward. This explains the higher rate of goals scored/minute in comparison to his Bilbao seasons, so he looks to score more goals than before. This means that he looks to take up more advanced positions in order to score more goals.

Even after all of this, there are still several things that contradict van Gaal's view and possible train of thought. In the majority of his matches, Herrera's touches have been almost everywhere, mainly on the right channel, but still, almost everywhere, and not just concentrated in the final third. Plus, he makes more clearances than any other #10 that I can recall, indicating his involvement in the defense. Finally, he has made more interceptions per 90 minutes than every #10 with this figure more comparable to those of box-to-box midfielders than #10's. His clearances per game are also better than several #10's as well as his shots blocked per game. His passing accuracy has been the highest it's ever been in his career, and his possession loss stats are the best they've been for him, indicating that he's been less cavalier than during his spell at Bilbao. (All stats have been observed at WhoScored.com, who obtain and interpret data from Opta.)

My observations, and these stats, of Herrera are not indicative of him being a #10 in any way, yet I believe that van Gaal's focusing more on his increased goalscoring tendencies, which makes him interpret Herrera as a #10.

6720~~~
I've seen lots of people put Herrera out on the right attacking midfield role, but I don't think he has the dribbling ability to play there that Silva, Cazorla, Nasri, Hazard, Willian, Tadic, etc., have. Yes, he does spend quite a bit of time out in the right channel, and he has put in a decent number of crosses from the right during his Bilbao days, but he'd only be effective there if we have a good dribbler playing through the middle. If it was Januzaj instead of Rooney in the middle, Herrera would be more useful out wide. Otherwise, we'll need a right full back who's very good at dribbling, and for that, we'd have to hope that Rafael's fit for every match or buy a right back who's a good dribbler like Coleman or Clyne.

6721~~~
this is herrera himself claimed he would have wanted to play in the no 10 role, and acted like this whenever he was given game time.  lvg just let him competes according to his wish

6722~~~
Rooney hasn't been great in midfield and it's pretty poor that Herrera hasn't been given a proper go there.
His hands might be tied re rooney; he's on a massive wage and he's our captain, but if he doesnt see him as a striker and he isn't performing in midfield then he should be benched and Herrera should be stuck in. He clearly quickens our tempo and he's had a positive impact in the games he's played. It clearly isn't going to change though.

6723~~~
Yeah to be completely honest it's pointless us moaning about it. Nothing will change.

6724~~~
You wanna see a player like Herrera, watch something else
LVG has his own mindset and for the time being, Herrera ain't starting sadly <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> .....As much as I want him

6725~~~
I think it all comes around to balance again with Van Gaal. It's not so much about the Number 10 role as we think of it positionally in terms of formations with the player behind the striker/s. I don't think he thinks as linerally as that.

I think the way he is looking at it is like this:

With 4 midfielders:

One is the holding midfielder- he can't play this at least not like Blind or Carrick can. 

That leaves three positions - one is Rooney and one is Di Maria his captain and his best player. 

Which leaves one position and with Rooney and Di Maria being attacking players he needs to address the balance with someone who offers more defensively. Fellaini being a great asset for defending set pieces and a physical presence in midfield. 

Or if he shackles Rooney in the deeper more defensive role which he can play it means Herrera is fighting with Di Maria or Mata for the position behind the strikers. 


What he needs to do is work his ass off on the defensive side of his game, fill out a bit and then be trusted to offer more of a rounded game. 


Simply - if Van Gaal plays Herrera he has to adjust too much in his eyes and would have to sacrifice a better attacking midfielder.

6726~~~
LVG did not "plan" to bench him all along. Stop this nonsense now. He was always in the starting XI until he got injured, then things changed. I don't understand how we are 3rd in the league table, and making progress in the FA cup and all Manchester United fans can do is bitch about ONE player being benched. The last time it was Mata, then Falcao, then Januzaj, now it's Herrera....I'm sure Mitten wrote an article on all of them. There's only a place for 11 players to start, LVG prefers 2 strikers for now, thinks Rooney doesn't cut it as a striker but still too valuable to drop, so moves him to CM [whether that's right or wrong is another matter]. There's two sides to a coin and ignoring the other side and focusing on one side couldn't be more myopic. If Herrera works hard enough, he'll get into the team, like Mata, Januzaj and Falcao did over time, then another player will be dropped and his fanboys will start another uproar. It's funny. Herrera still has it all to prove, he's a good player but many of you are starting to overrate him impact. If at the end of the season, LVG finishes 2nd or 3rd in the PL and wins the FA cup, I'll be satisfied with that, whether or not he used Herrera, it's his job to make big decisions, and this is one, you lot have to deal with it.

6727~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78241, @legball" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78241/">@legball</a> 

Excuse people for debating. Hardly fanboyism. People are not jumping of high buildings due to Herrera not playing.

6728~~~
How do you know Rooney does not cut it as a striker? I can't recall LvG ever saying or hinting such nonsense.

6729~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11114032/Manchester-United-manager-Louis-van-Gaal-casts-doubt-over-Wayne-Rooneys-future-as-a-striker.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...t-over-Wayne-Rooneys-future-as-a-striker.html</a>

6730~~~
It was a simple opinion on a specific performance. He also said he wasn't satisfied with Mata too but he has played him in midfield and the 10 since.

6731~~~
It's true that usually 2 of the 3 in behind the striker in that formation have dribbling ability, but I recall Oscar playing well from the right for Chelsea and I think Herrera's sharpness could link well with Rooney and create plenty of openings in that formation.

6732~~~
So Herrera is being dropped because of Rooney? We cried for a creative CM for ages, and when we finally get one, we drop him for an overpaid, greedy player.

6733~~~
When did Oscar play on the right? IIRC, it was Mata who would play on the right side with Oscar in the middle and Hazard on the left, unless he played right at certain, specific matches.

The reason I believe people play 2 dribblers behind a forward(s) is because both of them can attract opposition players, creating significant gaps for other players to exploit. Herrera isn't as good as Oscar is at dribbling, anyways, and any sort of sharpness, quickness in the mind, etc., is pointless if the opposition close down the dangerous spaces. That's why I believe Herrera won't work out in the channels.

<a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> 

I feel the same way as well. I think van Gaal's referring to Herrera's more adventurous approach with us, but even then, there are other aspects of his game that indicate that he's also become more conservative than his Bilbao days. I think van Gaal's focusing quite hard on Herrera's willingness to score more goals as well as his lack of strength to hold the ball against physically strong opponents.

6734~~~
Really! Come on to feck what's that got to do with anything? Is Falcao not the same or Di Maria? The players get the best deal for themselves as it is as short career. DDG for example is he not holding us to ransom just now? You can bet your bottom bollock that he will do what suits him and won't consider the fans feelings for more than a minute. Rooney played it poorly regarding his contract (Stretford or Mendes who's better) but he has given us great service and deserves better than that. Will DDG get abuse from you if he goes to Madrid? Because United showed faith in the lad when he struggled now he's doing well he might jump ship straight away?

6735~~~
Well, at least they aren't taking other players' positions and screwing things up. DDG is one of the best at what he does, Falcao, after a mad injury and aftermath, is slowly building things back up. Di Maria is still finding his feet, been in and out of the team and has shown what he can do. Rooney, on the other hand... Can't play as a striker, can't play as an AM, can't play as a CM but still enjoying the privileges.

6736~~~
I have now read what LvG said and I am not too worried. I have said recently that Ander is the back up for a number of players and from LvG is saying he seems to be happier with it. The only bit of the statement that bothers me is that Wayne Rooney, the greedy git that held our club to ransom twice, has privileges. Now that bothers me and that he thinks Rooney is this fabulous midfielder. That makes me doubt the managers judgement on some matters. It is nice to know that he is happy with Herrera as a person and a professional with all these stupid rumours coming out about his training. He has obviously had a word with him and if both parties are happy that LvG has a above average squad player and the player will get enough game time next season. The manager seems happy that he is working hard and improving. That is the sort of thing he likes. The more I write the more I am getting pissed about Wayne Rooney. Also the ADM signing actually put a spanner in the works for Ander. We will have to see how that one pans out. If PsG come sniffing round again, will his head get turned.

6737~~~
So Rooney is taking someone else's place and screwing things up? Sheesh, utter rubbish.

6738~~~
Rooney in midfield is not great tbh, it is more that it appears that even if he was absolutely terrible he will get picked no matter what because he is the captain. The ADM signing has not helped Herrera. We had already signed Ander and then the board were offered ADM, they were because nobody else could afford him. LvG would not turn that down, but even then he has messed him about as well. If you sign a £60m player you have to play him.

6739~~~
Rooney is our best striker actually,its not his fault LvG refuses to play him there.

6740~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80898, @mazhar13" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80898/">@mazhar13</a> Oscar played out on the right, the season before Jose came in iirc. Only when Jose went to Chelsea, Oscar became the first choice no.10. I don't really remember how Oscar played, I think it was only for a season thoug,  and he wasn't as effective as he can be.

6741~~~
Rooney is nearing United's all-time goal scoring record at United and according to some can't play or is not good enough as a good striker? Surely there's other reasons why LvG is playing him in the middle.

6742~~~
The debate is frankly welcome and that's the point of a forum. But people are really going over the top with their comments as regards Herrera's situation now.

6743~~~
I was clearly  referring to what LVG said.

6744~~~
Christ.

6745~~~
I don't know why you are surprised at the comment. Yes Rooney has been a good striker for us, but I still don't like him for the turmoil he put the club through and the fact he keeps getting rewarded for it.

Has Rooney been played instead of Herrera? I would say yes, but not in LvG's eyes. He sees him as the backup for Di Maria, he quite often comes on for him and Mata. It is the what is Herrera's and Rooney best positon that is causing debate. As I have said before the lack of europe this season has made it impossible to rotate the squad as he would like. Now it is up to LvG and the players to make sure the games are there next season. If we don't get CL then ADM might want to move anyway. If we do, there will be plenty of games.

6746~~~
The fact that he rates our best striker Rooney in midfield is more worrying than not playing Herrera.

6747~~~
Who made you judge and jury to determine their opinion is over the top?

6748~~~
Physicality and captaincy. I just don't see anything else. He has been bang average since over a month now.

As for him playing as a striker, he might have the goal record, but that's purely because of the time he has spent here. Given all things equal, would you say he is a better striker than Falcao/van Persie?

6749~~~

6750~~~
Majority of posters debating on here do so by watching football matches on streams or TV. You really need to be watching football at the ground to appreciate the efforts of Rooney in both defensive and striking third. I personally believe his work ethics is probably one of the main reasons he is chosen ahead of Herrera.

Rooney has not played many games as a striker this season to be compared to either RvP or Falcao. Historically, I believe them both to be better strikers. Rooney's best role being as a second striker. This season both have underperformed considering their status as strikers in the game for various reasons. You can also point to the fact the team has been creating very few chances and it's been a difficult time for strikers this season.

6751~~~
Under Fergie i think Herrera would have shrived. He seems very Scholes like to me, apart from maybe being a better tackler but a worse passer.

I would actually play him as the 10 in our team, and make Mata either a striker or bench him.

6752~~~
LvG is talking rubbish when he says Rooney has to be in the team due to being captain. You're only entitled to be in the team if you perform.

6753~~~
Ross Wallace in sixth though?

6754~~~
Obviously we need to get Ross Wallace signed up. Going to be a mad dash to get his signature come the summer.

6755~~~
Ah yes Squawka, that bastion of Football knowledge and excellence. It's pretty clear Van Gaal wants Herrera to play a certain role in midfield. My understanding of this is - Ander being a natural midfielder will try to integrate during practice sessions before finally becoming an integral player while Rooney needs game time to be properly pigmounted into his new role.

6756~~~
Loses credibility having Toure at #2, Jovetic on the list, Sanchez below Herrera. Wallace?

6757~~~
Oh the irony, and who gave you the authority to question my opinion?

6758~~~
Ferguson didn't sign a single central midfielder for God knows how long.

6759~~~
Have volume turned up

6760~~~
Then why the hell don't we play Rooney as CAM if he needs to be on the pitch at all? Van Gaal stated earlier in the season it's his best position and he played well there, then suddenly after we lose Fellaini and need some muscles in midfield. Rooney is getting worse every season so why don't we at least use him right. He is another player living form his reputation. Herrera can't do cross field passing but defensively really is underrated, you don't need to be that strong to play there especially when you've got someone like Blind covering for you. He would have added so much more drive, creativity and legs to the team. He makes people around him look better. Rooney is no more that kind of player..

Don't understand this, where the hell is Dutchman's balls? That's what I hate on him, experimenting with players on various positions and playing the ones he likes even they are just inferior than others. Rooney could play as Striker with someone pacy like Wilson but that would mean benching woeful Van Persie. Would you bench your "best friend"? I doubt it. He is well past it more than Rooney. 

Watching someone as old as Harry Kane makes you think how things in football change quickly he is so much better than any of our strikers in almost every department of football skills. And apart that he scores so many goals and crucial ones he is intelligent and creates chances for his teammates and works hard, can actually run every game and give his 150% It really really makes you think how well past it someone like RVP is.. And it doesn't necessarily need to be Kane in this instance... there are so many better players up there playing up front..

6761~~~
Phew. We almost ran out of things to hate Rooney for...

6762~~~
Questioning an opinion is fine. Is that not the whole point of a debate?

6763~~~
I think he will start tomorrow after that comment

6764~~~
What comment?

6765~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-uniteds-ander-herrera-must-5119174" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-uniteds-ander-herrera-must-5119174</a>

6766~~~
Missed those, cheers for that.

I guess that clarifies things though, LVG just rate him as highly as Rooney, Mata and Di Maria.

6767~~~
Yep and consistently our best player season in season out.

6768~~~
When is the last time Rooney was our best player of the season?

6769~~~
The thing about Rooney is he kind of symbolizes the United of recent years, for better or worse.

The first thought that will come into most people's minds when they think of Rooney would be hard work rather than sheer brilliance, the sort we got less and less from United since 2009. He'll give you the odd brilliant moment, when you think he's unplayable, but there will also be moments in which you think he's a pub player, like some people say - which isn't that different to how United have been in the last few years. He's always going to get good numbers in goals and assists, just like we end up winning most games, aside from Moyes's season.

We really have been Wayne Rooney's team. Question is, can we move away from that with him?

6770~~~
The guy is among the best goal scoring charts and assists since he arrived. We won't miss him till he's gone imho.

6771~~~
Well he was our best outfield player last season, and then in 11/12. So 2 of the last 3 years (outfield players)

6772~~~
What baffles me about LvG's comments is that he sees Herrera as a number 10 who has to compete with Rooney and Mata for a place in the team. I know he played behind the striker a lot at Athletic Bilbao but if LvG didn't plan on converting him and using him in central midfield, then why did we buy them? We had several great players competing for one spot, surely we didn't need extra cover in that position? Besides, I still don't get why LvG won't use Herrera as a central midfielder - in my position he has all the tackling ability, drive, passing range and intelligence needed in that position.

6773~~~
If he does see him as only a No. 10 is there any way he will play regularly? I can't see it happening.

6774~~~
We should have a separete thread for LVG weirdest decisions. Putting Herrera in no 10 role is defo one of them.

6775~~~
i dont think he sees him as a No 10 only, otherwise he wouldnt make that comparision with Rooney. He then says there is also the No 10 spot with Mata and Di Maria...

6776~~~
I honestly don't think he knew <i>that </i>much about him. I mean why would he? He's been the Dutch national manager for the past few years, so a doubt he's focused that much on non Dutch players. Especially players from teams like Bilbao (no disrespect to them). 

Same goes with Shaw. He probably knew the basics, watched some video analysis and read all the scout reports, but I'd imagine that's about it.

6777~~~
Yeah so weird. So he is competing with Rooney, Mata and Di Maria who have all played out of position a lot. So is he competing as a striker with the latter and as a midfielder with the former two? 
Before we'll know LvG will have him competing with Jones and DDG!

6778~~~
i think he competes with Rooney and Di Maria for the CM spot, and with Rooney and Mata for the No 10 spot. But then he says Di Maria too, but did he play there once for us? Weird, but well i can see him beating Mata, but not Rooney or Di Maria. Move Rooney to the striker spot, problem solved. If it would be that easy <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

6779~~~
He's obviously a wonderful talent but there has been a few games this season where like Mata I had absolutely no idea that Herrera was even on the pitch such was his lack of impact despite him getting close to a full game. Herrera definitely has the talent to make the grade here but the 'Herrera must play' campaign is reminiscent of the 'Nani must play' campaign last season despite Nani not playing well in 2 consecutive matches for 7 previous years

6780~~~
Yep, 100% agree. 
People are linking van Gaal to the whole transfer too much, in my opinion.

6781~~~
But it's not that easy is it. Because that team has no balance. 


Mata and Di Maria provide very little defensive protection while Herrera doesn't provide enough defensive work to help Blind make up for playing two strikers and two attacking midfielders. 

That's why Fellaini tends to get the nod, for his physical presence in midfield, it helps break up their play (even if it's with stupid fouls) and sees that we don't get physically dominated and overrun. 

It's a sad fact in the EPL that the most technical side doesn't always win. Sometimes teams like Stoke or Leicester are allowed to get away with too much and dominate the game by bullying the opposition with crunching tackles, shoulder barges, elbows and long balls that bypass the midfield.

6782~~~
replace Herrera with Mata and put Fellaini in CM or vice versa thats what i meant.

6783~~~
Fair enough, but that's the real discussion. Does Herrera deserve to start over Mata? LVG is of the opinion that he doesn't and to be honest that's a fair enough opinion. You could argue a case for Herrera, sure, but you couldn't argue that LvG is being crazy or stubborn for choosing Mata over him.

6784~~~
I think if you're Ed Woodward your confidence in the manager's transfer dealings begins to suffer as a result of this. He will have been under the impression that he singed an adaptable coach, not a runner-up on Supermarket Sweep. 


A theory which was quite brutally exposed by Victor Wanyama; I doubt that Herrera could have done any worse at St Mary's.


There's nothing wrong with a good crunching tackle indeed a few teeth rattling challenges from Quinton Fortune would go a miss this season. And United is hardly in a position to condescend about long balls.

6785~~~
Why's that sad? If you don't like a good crunching tackle you've no soul.

6786~~~
Wanayama is a beast and Fellaini had a bad game, it's easy to say Herrera would have done better but who knows? He might have been bullied out of the game conpletely and his stock go down lower with LVG. 

As for crunching tackles, I've no problem with them, it's whn its the sole tactic I think it's a shame. I like a team that can go toe to toe and outplay, not just kick lumps and score a set peice. 

We might play a lot of long balls too but that stat on is unfair, were also second for short passes and have the highest possession so of course we're going to have a load of long passes too. We don't spend every game lumping it into the box though, there's a lot of diagonal passes which buff that stat. It's actually a completely bollocks stat.

6787~~~
Yes it wasn't regular but the times he has played on the right he did well and I think Herrera is a similar type of AM to Oscar.

If that is the case then I really can't see how we fit Herrera in as a regular starter in either 4-2-3-1 or -4-3-3, which is a shame as he's an excellent talent.

6788~~~
I think Herrera has turned into the new Kagawa. The less he plays, the higher his previous performances are rated. He had a few very decent performances, but he had a few very invisible performances also. The best team isn't always made up of the best players. Do people remember Ossie Ardiles and his Famous Five? Awful stuff. Herrera will get chances, he'll work his way back in. Priceless that Rooney is being blamed by some on here in the same way he was blamed for Kagawa. Lather, rinse, repeat.

6789~~~
But you can't just simply ignore the fact that Rooney has been relatively poor in a deeper midfield role whilst Herrera has been out of the picture. It's factual. 

It's not quite the Kagawa situation for me, largely because Rooney is being shoehorned into this position when we're struggling to score goals. Taking place as the number 10 over Kagawa and having people complain...that was nonsense. He might be a better player than Herrera, but he's not a midfielder. That's the gripe.

6790~~~
Hate when people say this, its not true at all. People talk as if he has made a similar non impact as Kagawa had, which couldn't be further from the truth. Every game he plays, he makes a big impact to our speed of the game, he's one of our only genuinely creative players, he increases the pace of our passing which we so desperately need, but when it comes to the defensive side of things he has some of the best stats when you compare him to our other midfielders. Not to mention that he's always a goal threat and makes more chances then anyone bar di maria and has a very good amount of goals and assist considering his lack of playing time. Its not a case of the less he plays the better he gets. We genuinely look miles better with him on the pitch. What games was he invisible in by the way? I'm pretty sure if you look at stats per 90 minutes he has one of the most touches and passes per 90 in our team and is never afraid to get stuck in to win the ball, and his pressing is on another level to our other midfielders. He had a few poor games, yes, but those came when he broke his ribs and was working his way back to full fitness basically. Been impressive apart from that.

And I agree completely that the best team isn't made up of the best players, and I wish van Gaal would start going by that and stop forcing falcao and van Persie in the team when for the most part they've been shite and force other (better) players to play out of position to our detriment.

6791~~~
first of all, i like herrera.  who doesn't? he has such an innocent face

however, even those vocal for herrera should start are basically divided into 2 groups at all:  herrera is an no 10, herrera is not a no 10.

such kind of split opinions among the herrera should start camp already best tells where the problem lies.  if herrera is a no 10, a role that he thinks he is interested in playing, then there is not so much choice left that he has to compete with rooney, mata, diMaria, januzaj, jones, ddg, kagawa et al to gain a starting place.  if he opts to become a strootman or alcantara aka player, probably he can easily put himself top in the pecking order

bascially the herrera phenomenon is still part of the "we have six no 10s" issue remaining unresolved

6792~~~
I don't agree that it is factual. Rooney hasn't been setting the world alight, I'll grant you that, but he's done a hell of a lot of good work, and an incredible amount of hard work. He's also a driving force of the team in my opinion. Personally, I would rather him up front than in midfield, but I don't agree that he's been poor. I think he has been OK, some very good moments, some very bad. Overall, I think he currently helps the balance of the team.

Don't get me wrong though, I like Herrera and hope, and think that he will come good. I just feel that for some reason a number on the caf here have it in for Louis on the basis he's not picking Herrara. That just seems OTT to me.

6793~~~
I'm not saying the same non impact as Kagawa at all. I do like Herrara, I think he's a good little player and will become an important player with time.

However, I think all the stress people have with him not being picked is over blowing the importance that he has shown to the team as of now. He is a creative player, absolutely. And he plays the game at a higher pace alright. But he hasn't been this phenomenon that you'd think he has been with all the panic about him not starting every week.

I'm also not saying I don't want to see him in the team, I'd love to see him start against West Ham for example (even though I don't think it's necessarily the best game to bring him back in for). But I really think it's over blown the way people are going on about it, making out like Rooney has been dreadful where Herrera has been amazing etc.

He's been fine.

6794~~~
What has to happen in order for LVG to give this lad a chance?

6795~~~
getting the sack

6796~~~
Did he sleep with LVG's daughter or wife ? What is going on there ?

6797~~~
Probably a threesome with both of them. Only possible explanation.

6798~~~
He's just trying to prove a point with him, not sure what this point is though.

6799~~~
The way LvG is going it will happen. Just hang in there Ander.

6800~~~
I've just Googled them. Definitely not worth it, Ander!

6801~~~
Sometimes, it's hard to fathom the mind of a genius. It's too abstract for us peasant.

6802~~~
Given LvG's explanation in the press conference was that the team has better midfielders than Herrera, so Ander would have to wait, and that we have better forwards than Rooney, so Wayne would have to play in midfield, I think his point was: there is no point trying to understand it.

6803~~~
sigh..

6804~~~
This.

6805~~~
Simply put, this lad needs to be starting for us.

People need to stop making lazy comparisons between him and Kagawa, as they both bring something different to the table.

Hererra had some great games for us at the start of the season, and he is capable of being a ball-winner yet a creative player at the same time. 

Today against West Ham he would have been perfect as we had no real creative flair to unlock their tight defence.

6806~~~
Yet another game where we are crying out for a proper midfielder like him and he doesn't get a look in. Also, I love how some people say things like he's not quite shown enough to deserve starts (when he definitely has, but anyways), yet those who are constantly starting have been giving 5 or 6/10 performances at the very best. People who aren't huge fans of his clutch at straws for reasons that he isn't starting when those same points should be used as to why the players who are starting, shouldn't be starting at all. 

As a midfielder, Herrera has shown far more then pretty much anyone else in that position. Why he doesn't play is just baffling. He creates more chances then anyone bar Di Maria, so that solves one problem. He gets stuck in defensively and ups the speed of our play considerably, so that solves another one right away. He adds a goal threat from midfield and that's just a big bonus. There's no logical reason at all as to why he isn't starting, because with the way our current midfielders are playing, he should be one of the first names on the team sheet with everything he brings to the team.

6807~~~
So now even Januzaj is considered a better midfield option then Herrera? Even though he's, you know, a winger.

6808~~~
Sorry but the manager is clueless. Nuff said.

6809~~~
Why spend 30 million on a 3/4 choice option then?...seriously the decision to buy Herrera becomes stranger the longer the season goes on.

Add to that LVG has no clear idea where he wants Di Maria to play and you are looking at nearly 100 million pounds on 2 players that are having very little impact on the team.

6810~~~
Pissing me off how he's just completely ignored. Probably wont start against Burnley again which will inevitably lead to another brutal performance by the "midfield"

6811~~~
Ah just what i suspected.. and feared. He see's Herrera as a no.10 playmaker. The position he played for Bilbao last season but surely he's more than capable of playing in the midfield as he's done the majority of his career. His defensive game is also better than any of our offensive players and the stats shows that. If LVG see's him as purely an attacking playmaker then might as well say goodbye to him. He's never going to make it.

6812~~~
This. Frustrating as hell.

6813~~~
Then he hasn't done enough research into the lad. He also plays 8. I hope LvG is gone before him. There I've said it. I wasn't bothered as such that the boy didn't start, but when it was obvious that yet again his team selection wasn't working, I expected like most fans he would make changes either at half time or just after. The manager hasn't got a clue what he is doing. He is bluffing his way through the job.

6814~~~
I'm going to be seriously worried about his future if he doesn't start against Burnley.

Then again I said the same thing about Cambridge. Why he doesn't even get a chance is beyond me.

6815~~~
The fans need to start singing his name all the time.

6816~~~
Would love to see the lad along side Blind with Mata as the number 10. One striker and two fast wingers.

6817~~~
Of course he won't start against Burnley. Or against anyone else this season. I genuinely think he won't start again for United.

6818~~~
Then we are going to lose a lot more points and it won't be Herrera's fault.

6819~~~
Nah he'll get a start soon, and he'll score a goal and assist another 2. Then he'll never play again because he's too attacking which is against the philosophy.

6820~~~
He played as a no.10 last season more out of necessity than it being his natural position. Its something the manager tried once and then stuck with it since it worked well for the team. Im surprised LVG doesn't see that. Im sure some people here remember that when we were first linked with him his videos were being posted about and it was all highlights of his tackles and defensive play.

6821~~~
Those games for Bilbao against us were great and people say he always played well against the big teams in Spain, Barcelona etc. Yet isn't good enough to play Cambridge. I am beginning to hate LvG for his pigheaded ways.

6822~~~
LVG must have a very low opinion of the rest of the world if he expects anyone to genuinely believe that Herrera is worse than the horror midfield show we were subjected to tonight. Whilst I do agree that Herrera- Blind is too lightweight for this league I don't think reverting to Blind- Rooney - Di Maria is the brightest idea because the latter two are so careless in possession that they make Herrera look like Xavi. I don't see why we can't try a trio of Herrera, Fellaini and Blind.

6823~~~
Don't be, because at this rate he will survive this madman's circus, LVG is a goner imo. He will not survive that big spending, the press won't let him.

6824~~~
The way he is using this squad and the digs that it is so unbalanced all the time, not sure the board will trust him with any more money. Especially if the name of Strootman crops up.

6825~~~
I don't think LVG is being candid when he says Herrera is a no.10 and will be competing with the attacking players. Why isn't he being considered for the midfield role? Fellaini played as a no.10 at Everton too. Rooney is a forward yet he's fine with playing him in the midfield. Just doesn't make sense.

6826~~~
Basically sums up LvG's tenure with us so far to be fair.

6827~~~
Is he being sidelined because LVG thinks he is the player to make way for Strootman?

6828~~~
I thought Strootman had re-injured his knee?

6829~~~
If that is his mad logic, then if we keep dropping points he won't be here to buy Strootman. Although we shouldn't be touching him with a ten foot barge pole.

6830~~~
Cannot believe LVG thinks Falcao is a better striker than Rooney, especially considering Rooney was on fire at the start of the season.

6831~~~
Then why does Herrera twiddle his thumbs on the bench while Rooney blunders his way through midfield and Falcao misses sitters and is generally useless?

6832~~~
I think because the captain must always play, and...I don't know about the Falcao thing. There must be some agreement about him getting first team appearances.

6833~~~
Drop Falcao and play 4-3-3:

So much more balance and stability. Mata and Fellaini can rotate in for Januzaj/Herrera.

6834~~~
I didn't rate Welbeck as much as some on here did but the decision to let him go was really stupid, considering he was the only first team striker who actually had the pace to get behind an opposition defense. Baffling we would be stuck with Falcao (and I really think LVG will buy him) and we will keep on struggling.

Edit: Think that LVG has a huge man-crush on Falcao. I still remember how he praised Falcao for putting away just the one chance he had in training and saying this is the level of striker we want and United. Guess what, he has had those chances during matches and he hardly makes use of them.

6835~~~
If LvG buys Falcao then that would be his most stupid decision. And there has been some stupid ones.

6836~~~
Rooney
Di Maria Mata Januzaj (Di Maria playing more centrally than a winger)
Herrera Blind
Shaw Smalling Rojo Valencia
De Gea

If you insist on van Persie:

van Persie
Di Maria Mata Rooney
Herrera Blind
Shaw Smalling Rojo Valencia
De Gea

Against tougher opposition:

Rooney
Di Maria Herrera Mata
Blind Fellaini
Shaw Smalling Rojo Valencia
De Gea 

But obviously it won't ever happen.

6837~~~
We have a shit midfield and this lad just doesnt get a chance. Rooney is so poor and Januzaj is a winger while ADM needs to class midfielders behind him to fully florish. It's so obvious to see except for our own manager

6838~~~
Just putting in the weekly <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Hope he gets subbed on at least.

6839~~~
Van Gaal really is on drugs regarding Herrera.

Just sheer stupidity. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

6840~~~
<b>: </b>Ander Herrera's last Premier League start for Man Utd was on 2nd December vs. Stoke. He got an assist on that day.

6841~~~
Whether I agreed or not I could see the arguments for Fellaini and even Rooney or Mata, but I don't see what Adnan does on the left side that Herrera can't do better and quicker.

6842~~~
Lad must be wondering why the hell he left Spain.

6843~~~
Tis a joke.

6844~~~
LVG has lost his marbles playing Rooney in midfield consistently over Herrera.  He's better as a midfielder than Mata, Fellaini, Rooney, and Januzaj.

6845~~~
He got an assist in his last sub appearance and the last start in all comps was the start of January and he scored a great volley that day too.

6846~~~
Baffling signing.

6847~~~
I've heard rumours that Herrera has some off field attitude (not going to repeat here as not very flattering) and likes to drink a bit too much? I stress I don't know the truth of it. Just wondering has anyone heard anything remotely similar?

6848~~~
The signing made a lot of sense actually, was exactly the type of player we've been crying out for for years. The lack of use of him has been baffling though.

6849~~~
I've not heard anything negative about him whatsoever personally

6850~~~
Got problems with creating things from midfield? 

Keep your creative players on the bench. 

Got no balance in the squad? 

Play two wingers and a striker in midfield. 

Funny though how we looked more dangerous and played better football when we had a ridiculous injury crisis and LvG HAD to play a certain team and bunch of players. 

Now he's got the full pick he picks a team that makes little sense

6851~~~
That's what I meant. Baffling that LVG would give the green light to a 30m midfilder he was going to play his best striker over.

6852~~~
That's why I'm wondering about the rumours of his 'antics'.

6853~~~
He'll probably leave in the summer if things continue like this.

6854~~~
Just be patient guys, you did the same with Shaw, Januzaj and Falcao.

6855~~~
We're apparently selling all our new signings if you listen to this board.

6856~~~
The problem with Herrera is that he doesn't offer enough cover to play in central midfield currently which has resulted in our central midfield getting walked all over in a couple of games he played in many months ago. He's decent as an attacking midfielder but we need wingers right now. Falcao has been gash overall but so has Herrera in any meaningful game we've played in the last few months. So maybe Van Gaal still believes Falcao can ignite into life. I am sure Herrera will get the final 30 minutes tonight any ways if either of our strikers are not having a great game which is very likely. I have no doubt that Herrera was a Moyes signing that Van Gaal took a punt on seem as he couldn't think of anyone else available that could play box to box central midfield in the short time he had to prepare last summer

6857~~~
I'm not drawing any parallels here.

6858~~~
That's the message board equivalent of a tit flash drive by. <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

6859~~~
But Di Maria, Januzaj, and Rooney do?

6860~~~
Yes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Summer 2015= Anti summer 2014.

For me whether it's defensively or offensively, there isn't a single thing Rooney is better than Herrera in that particular role. Surely LVG uses criteria we don't have knowledge of to make his decisions.

6861~~~
Seems like dropping him altogether would be the way to send a message if that were the case.

6862~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Exactly, you can't say that and then not say what the rumours are. <a class="username" data-user="85303, @Jazz" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85303/">@Jazz</a>

6863~~~
If anything the word is exactly the opposite

6864~~~
I guess. Just don't know what the hell is going on… ah well irrespective of this, let's just win tonight.

6865~~~
Glad I didn't elaborate because everyone whose answered my question is saying the exact opposite of what I've been hearing<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6866~~~
It's just bizarre.

6867~~~
There are secrets within secrets, maybe Ander is only here as a cover for his CIA work. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

6868~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6869~~~
With Euro 2016 next summer he certainly won't want to be faffing about on the bench at United. Even should we secure fourth place, it is neither a guarantee of CL football nor a sign that Herrera's circumstances shall change significantly.

6870~~~
This would explain the Falcao deal happening out the blue, clearly a joint operation to bring down the Colombian Cartels. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

6871~~~
feck off Lvg.

6872~~~
The signing was one of the most sensible we've made in the last 5 years.

The treatment of the player thus far under Van Gaal, however, has been utterly baffling - especially as it coincides with the treatment of Wayne Rooney (i.e playing him as a midfielder) which is equally baffling.

I imagine if it continues throughout the whole season one or both players will likely put in transfer requests at the end of the season.

6873~~~
I'm having a hard time believing that. He was praised for his attitude and down-to-earth character upon his arrival so REALLY doubt he has changed since. Seems like one of the most polite and nice guys out there.

6874~~~
See my previous reply to this post.

6875~~~
Yep, my first impression of him was polite and intelligent. But who knows what goes on behind the scenes? In any case, if he's being a model professional, someone needs to tell LVG to play him because it doesn't make any sense.

6876~~~
I think he's played reasonably well in CM, and I can't remember many 'gash performances' to be fair; and I also can't recall a 'meaningful game' ,of late, where the manager has had the minerals to play him. 
I hope he does get his chance as the thought of Wayne gifting endless passages of possession to the opposition is starting to irritate; and the Spaniard's ability to look after himself seems much underappreciated as from what I've witnessed he appears perfectly happy to put his proverbial size 10 in.
I think, like many, the square-peg complex, where Rooney is concerned, is beginning to look increasingly bizarre and to allow a dedicated midfielder, like Herrera, to sit passively by, while his talents could be better employed, or even examined, in the role he was trained to play seems fatuous at best.

6877~~~
Come on lad, now's your chance to show him what you can do <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

6878~~~
Erm.... He is on the pitch, right?

6879~~~
Hope he puts in a good second half because he needs to be on the pitch ahead of the likes of Falcao.

Our only recognized central midfielder at this moment. Quite sad how after 5 years we still haven't sorted out our midfield.

6880~~~
He shouldn't have come on. Should have been Fellaini. Van Gaal is utterly clueless.

6881~~~
Oops. There he is. Christ.

6882~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6883~~~
Sweet pass to release Di Maria for the penalty.

6884~~~
Has done well in a proper midfield role in a 4-4-2...  Class pass right there as well. Rooney next to him do poor though

6885~~~
He's done alright actually. Neat and tidy.

6886~~~
Weird that, once Herrera came on our passing was a little more crisp.

6887~~~
The fact that he doesn't absolutely shit himself when put under the slightest bit of pressure makes him a must for our midfield.

6888~~~
Well played, Ander, now take a seat on the bench for three weeks.

6889~~~
Obviously a better option there than the others.

6890~~~
Thought he changed our flow of play after coming on. Though I think it helps that Burnley were getting tired and Falcao off for Wilson gave us more speed/space further up the field. 

Baffling that van Gaal doesn't start him every game.

6891~~~
It's an absolute joke that Rooney is starting in front of him. That's not a sleight on Rooney, he's simply not a midfielder - a case of wage packet/name over ability, whether it's a case of Rooney/van Persie/Falcao forcing him out for "balance".

6892~~~
I know right! Its almost like the two things are related. Do you think Louis Van Gaal will notice? My money's on Ander being on the bench for our next game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6893~~~
''Football is a simple game, made complicated by idiots''

Just play Herrera in midfield and Rooney upfront ffs.

6894~~~
Done well today, especially when having to be thrown into a team with no DM. 

Of course, Van Gaal won't play him for another month.

6895~~~
Came on and showed calmness when we needed it. Needs to be a starter for me, no point in trying to set up the way we do if we cant make the necessary passes.

6896~~~
He is so much better with his pal Juan around but still it was a decent game for him. Nothing spectacular that he usually does but no one was that good today.

6897~~~
Tell that to LVG please

6898~~~
Needs to start in midfield, with Rooney playing ahead of Falcao.

6899~~~
Did more than enough to suggest he should be starting. Then again, I'm not exactly sure what our 'deserves to start' policy is.

I was worried he might be shite in training or something, explaining his absences, but can't fault his contribution on the pitch.

Kept it neat and tidy, created a couple of good breaks, and only had one poor pass.

6900~~~
I liked what I saw. But will he play next time? I know Mata will but Ander never starts.

6901~~~
Said this in the match thread. He was the only proper midfielder we had out there and it showed. Without being spectacular he released Di Maria twice, one of which led to the penalty. None of our other players had this vision from the midfield because they are primarily programmed to be a forward/winger/defender. He's also very comfortable when put under pressure.

6902~~~
I think he did very good considering the circumstances. He just had to play it simple and safe. I want to see his stats from this game.

6903~~~
Felt a bit for him when he was thrown into deep ocean of shit in the first half as he couldn't find himself some place but done well in the second half.

6904~~~
Did well. Quite clearly our best midfielder.

6905~~~
Midfielder in midfield. What are the chances?

6906~~~
Decent/solid performance. He's an actual midfield player, why on earth does Van Gaal insist on continuously starting wingers and strikers in midfield ahead of him. Baffling.

6907~~~
Yep I think it would make sense to do this

6908~~~
Nothing special today but tonnes better than Rooney in midfield.

6909~~~
In fact I think this was the kind of performance that LvG wants from him. Little risk, simple passing, I bet his defensive stats will be very good too. This should keep him in the team.

6910~~~
Earnt his spot on the bench for FA cup game, well done Ander!

6911~~~
Classy player, had a great performance. Hope it will be awarded with another start.

6912~~~
He gave the ball away badly once for a Burnley counter attack. I reckon that's enough for van Gaal to bench him again.

6913~~~
Midfielders gonna midfield, imagine that

6914~~~
Again made the difference in midfield, much better passing, simple, effective...

6915~~~
Along with Di Maria was probably our best player in that second half. Just plays so much more intelligently then the others, keeps calm under pressure and definitely has an eye for a through pass to relieve pressure. Should be Herrera + Carrick/Blind in a midfield duo, easily. None of the others come close to those 3 when it comes to playing in defensive or center midfield. 

I have hope that Van Gaal will have took notice to that performance from him though, as he played with real maturity and picked out the right pass almost every time, and played some lovely balls in to Di maria for counter attacks.

6916~~~
Many Blind's have died to bring us this Herrera......

Played it cautious and sensible, staying in line with Rooney to keep midfield tight and it worked.

6917~~~
Poor old Ander....always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

Anyone think that performance made<i> any</i> impression on Louis?

6918~~~
I didn't think he was anything special, but he should still start in midfield over Rooney, in the current setup.

6919~~~
Surely this performance will show Van Gaal that he's capable of being a proper CM and not just a 10?

6920~~~
This is all that really matters. He wasn't great today by any means but he was still better than anything Rooney has done in midfield. Herrera should be starting next to Blind, Rooney can fight it out with RvP and Falcao for striker or Mata and Fellaini for attacking mid/third midfield place.

6921~~~
Agreed

6922~~~
I don't think that he was anything amazing as some as saying on here, but it was a solid performance and he should be playing over Rooney.

6923~~~
Rooney's doing his best in proving that he's not a midfielder for what, 10 games now? LVG doesn't seem to give a feck.

6924~~~
Tempo wise he was solid today not to mention he got a real ball control which by the way is a must have in any Premier League club.

6925~~~
We play better with him on the pitch. Simple as that.

6926~~~
LVG seemed to point out his performance today as impressive in his post match interview on MUTV. 

Let's hope that he can nail down a spot now.

6927~~~
I want to hope this means Herrera will play next game...

...but then I recall Van Gaal used the word 'class' when speaking about Herrera after Yeovil (A), and after that game Ander vanished into the black hole of substitute land.

6928~~~
I don't think he did anything special but he has to start ahead of Falcao and Mata from now on. Both Mata and Falcao have failed to perform in tough games even though Mata has played well against weaker sides and Falcao ahead of Herrera just doesn't make sense right now

6929~~~
Maybe it was because he was next to Rooney so stood out more but I thought he was great in the second half. Played some lovely balls forward to Di Maria, kept it tidy, covered well defensively, played it forward at a quicker pace when we needed too... Did everything right basically. He should be an automatic starter based on everything he offers, he's just so much better then our other midfielders. He doesn't even have to do anything amazing really, just the way he plays and what he brings naturally is a big improvement on anyone else we put there.

6930~~~
LvG: "Herrera played well." 
LvG: "We have to forget this match."

Herrera on the bench forever then

6931~~~
He didn't do anything special but it was good to see him get some minutes today. I really want to see him in the number 10 role with RVP and Rooney up top.

6932~~~
Actually he should be playing with Mata, not instead of him.

But that makes too much sense.

If only...

6933~~~
Solid performance for someone whose been stuck on the bench for quite a while… so hoping he starts the next game…..

6934~~~
i think that was a  misinterpretation. He said his goal was class, but also a bit lucky. Henry Winter got it wrong and said he is class. I watched the press conf to see if he really said that, but i think he meant the goal.

6935~~~
The fact that he is keeping it neat and tidy might be helping him with the manager. The fact that Ringo 07 said he didn't do anything special, the things we actually like him doing, was getting him dropped for taking risks. He's becoming a good steady player who can thread balls through, is always on the move and creates chances for others is just what we have been needing.

6936~~~
That is another thing good about him, he can get involved in a game straight away and doesn't seem to suffer for not playing.

6937~~~
Has to start in every game. Rooney in his place is diabolical. Looks good/solid every time he gets a chance.

6938~~~
Just listening to LvG press conference, praising Rooney to the sky for taking over Blinds position.

6939~~~
if only indeed. We looked like Manchester United of old when we switched to winger system. Adnan and di maria bursting down the wings taking on ppl in the box. Its what gave us our first penalty finally

6940~~~
I see that kind of posts every week, but I don't see anyone calling him amazing. I think most here just see that he's effective in what he does, and he’s much much better than Rooney there. Today he kept it simple and if you believe some on here, that’s what van Gaal wants from him so I bet there’s a big chance he will start next game.

6941~~~
It's such an easy to go to lineup yet we haven't seen it once, I really don't get what LVG sees.

6942~~~
I'm not sure what Rooney makes of all this. He was throwing strops at Fergie for playing him outside striker position now seems content in playing even as CDM. 
Personally, given his performances recently, he's absolute waste there.

6943~~~
he needs to get proper run of games, then he will be amazing.. today he was solid and I was happy to see him on the pitch but could have been something else which forced Van Gaal to send him on than Blind's injury. Still I think he should be the first name on the team sheet.

Will be interesting to see who will play in that deeper role or will we play 4-4-2 again? 
Shame we let Pearson go on loan..

6944~~~
Thought Fellaini should have been the one who came on but Herrera was solid. He and Fellaini should both be in our midfield IMO but oh well. Herrera outshone Rooney (not that that means a whole lot but he should be starting ahead of him).

6945~~~
"Wayne, this is how you avoid getting dicked over in possession"

It was nice seeing someone quickly release the ball to our players in space.  We have missed that this season.

6946~~~
Maybe Rooney has matured as a player and as a man and is accepting things he wouldn't have before ? The salary increase doesn't hurt either.

6947~~~
I just don't see why LvG said earlier he needs to improve. I mean, obviously he should always seek to be better, but he's easily one of our best midfielders every time he plays. He should be one of the first names in the starting 11.

6948~~~

6949~~~
What does that say, I'm at work and can't see it?

6950~~~

6951~~~
Stats. 87% pass completion, Chances created 1.64 - Highest, 68 passes, 1.90 tackles won 2.28 interceptions. And carries the highest total score. All per game.

6952~~~
Cheers guys.

6953~~~
I understand why LvG is reluctant to play the Blind/Herrera midfield but I think Herrera has given himself a chance to get a couple of starts, hopefully he does well.

6954~~~
Start him against Preston and let him run the show.

6955~~~
I'm not sure how content he is but he deserves credit for sticking at it and not having a moan to the press. He's watching his chance to make Manchester United history as one our most prolific goal-scorers ever get further away with each  game he plays, while tweedle dum and tweedle dumber lumber around up top, missing sitters. Not many strikers in world football who would tolerate a situation like that and still run themselves into the ground for the team.

6956~~~
I don't. It's well balanced.

He'll be back on the bench for the next game, we shouldn't fool ourselves, should we?

6957~~~
Yeah, the hyperbole over every game he plays is crazy. Our improvement had much more to do with the change in formation than his individual contribution. Did well though. A very competent display.

Januzaj and DiMaria really aren't working as CMs and Hererra deserves a crack instead of one or other of them.

6958~~~
That is the line up that we should be going with Imo.

6959~~~
It's too weak physically for the PL in my view.

Blind and Carrick are injured and LvG chose Herrera over Fellaini tonight after naming Fellaini as a striker option in his last presser. I think Ander has a very good chance of starting the enxt couple of games.

6960~~~
If Van Gaal insists on playing RvP he could play Rooney instead of Mata. That's still a good team/formation.

Re <a class="username" data-user="36088, @Kraftwerker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/36088/">@Kraftwerker</a> post.

6961~~~
I have not always been the biggest fan of Rooney but despite his woeful passing you can't criticize his workrate and desire to compete for the team that's for sure. I can only imagine LvG has promised him a more advanced role next season once he's gotten in the CM's he wants.

6962~~~
Don't believe it for a minute, English clubs have been overrun by much weaker midfields in Europe in the past (us included, Barcelona midfield wasn't full of tall physical players when they hammered us twice).

6963~~~
In the case of Barca you are talking about one of the best midfield's ever, one that played like a machine that was tuned to perfection from youth. As for it happening in one off European games, that's exactly what it is, a one off cup game, week in and week out in the league is very different, it's no coincidence that most of the top 7 carry a physically strong athlete in their midfield, from Matic to Yaya to Henderson to the duo of Schneiderlin and Wanyama.
Arsenal don't but they have several speedsters up top which takes pressure off their midfield as teams don't want their CM's to press to o high and leave space in behind.

6964~~~
I think you can play a central midfield without physical presence or without pace. Definitely a risk to play one lacking both qualities.

6965~~~
After seeing the game, the defence is making it impossible for us to be too attacking which hasn't helped Ander. People are going on about this midfielder and that midfielder. The defence is going to need a fortune spent on it. No Rafael, No Jones and No Evans. A backup for Shaw is needed as well as Rojo is awful there. Then a striker as well. Get the defence sorted and the rest will click into place.

6966~~~
I think a mobile and skillful midfield with technical players will cause more difficulties to a strong midfield full of powerful players than the other way around. Herrera isn't weak anyway, he's actually pretty strong - the fact that he's Spanish prevents people from seeing that I feel. Even Blind isn't weak IMO.

6967~~~
It doesn't seem to be the case very often in our league, and you have to factor in that we aren't talking about great big lumps, the powerful CM's in these other teams are mobile and technically good. I don't think either of them are weak per se, but to play them together is asking for trouble as they both need a player that compliments what they lack IMO.

6968~~~
I agree that the defense is completely shot, Shaw and Rojo are the only two when played in their correct back 4 positions that don't wet themselves when in possession or tracking a runner. However as I said in the summer transfer thread, I feel all areas of the team need attention, including midfield, we haven't got nearly enough quality options and not enough variety in what we do have. Herrera and Blind in a midfield 3 with Schneiderlin for instance would offer a proper balance, but we'd need at least one more and hopefully the promotion of Pereira to round things out and avoid using Rooney or Fellaini as CM's.

6969~~~
No matter how good, bad, average, brilliant or anything else he was last night, I think most agree he should be playing football more often than he is given injuries to the actual central midfielders over the season. 

He's slim, he's not overly powerful but that's never stopped him shutting out other teams in the past and being part of a unit that presses the shit out of teams and tires them out. But I'm guessing Rooney Mata and Fellaini at Preston.

6970~~~
Neither Carrick nor Scholes were particularly effective physically unless you consider the opposition being afraid of Scholes breaking their legs with an ill-timed challenge. Neither one is fast either. That said, they were the last real central midfield pairing that worked.

Van Gaal just needs to grow a pair and drop Falcao and Van Persie, put Rooney back up top with Wilson and it'll free a spot in midfield for Ander. It shouldn't be surprising we aren't playing well when some of our best players are on the bench while we try to play two over the hill forwards into form.

6971~~~
I agree, I can see it working as long as we outplay the opposite team who will try to physically dominate. If we move the ball quick enough, Blind and Herrera (the the support of ADM in midfield or Rooney as a no.10 or even Fellaini as a 3man midfield), it could work very well.
The physical presence get's overrated in England. Just look at the "weak" Spanish midfiels, yet the mostly dominate through clever, quick play

6972~~~
Carrick actually was (is?) deceptively quick. He also wins a lot of headers in midfield. He's not going to run around kicking people but he's definitely got presence.

Moving back to Hererra, the gaffer was impressed:

6973~~~
Indeed, people go on about the awesomeness of Premier League and its incredible difficulty yet when you look at lower placed English teams they're mostly dross. We shouldn't build our team around that foundation.

6974~~~
We should build our teams to excel in the league they play in. Nobody is saying the Premier League is uniquely difficult but it is more physical than most other leagues, with referees who tend to be much more lenient. Take any technical, physically slight Spanish team and make them play a whole season with PL referees against PL opposition and they'd struggle. Any PL manager who wants to win domestic trophies needs to bear this in mind. Just ask Arsene Wenger.

6975~~~
I actually don't think they would. I think the opposite - put a mid-table English side in La Liga along with their technical skillful players who operate very well in tight spaces and they'd probably be around the bottom.

6976~~~
If Fabregas can play as a midfield 2 in the Premier league then so can Herrera. Admittedly he certainly needs to work on his body strength and add muscle but he's gifted in a technical sense and does not always need to use his body to get through midfield. He is also an excellent tackler and interceptor of the ball. Start him Van Gaal!

6977~~~
Got a great reception when he came on, definitely a fan favourite even outside of the forum. Played very well and helped us actually play some football which was nice. The switch to a wide 4-4-2 definitely helped too, it gave us better outlet's and stopped their fullbacks pushing us up the pitch. He offered a good outlet to Rooney too who only had eyes backwards. 

Overall he should be starting the next game, but I imagine Fellaini will be chosen for his "physical presence" against Preston.

6978~~~
Fabregas plays alongside Matic though, who's pretty much best in class when it comes to DMs.

6979~~~
Fabregas has Matic next to him, if we paired Ander with Schneiderlin for example it may also work, but Herrera and Blind? Personally I just don't think so.

6980~~~
At times Herrera was running with Arfield on his back without losing the ball. Why are we behaving as if Herrera's a midget? He is nearly 6ft tall. I think he can manage in a midfield two.

6981~~~
Plus he's classes above Herrera, let's not get ahead of ourselves. He'll make up for his lack of strength with other attributes.

6982~~~
Not bad hey. Leads in chances created, passes completed. Second in tackles and interceptions.


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i62.tinypic.com/1zv4zk4.jpg" src="http://i62.tinypic.com/1zv4zk4.jpg"/>

6983~~~
They probably would. You've completely missed my point though. It's not about the opposition, it's about how the game is referee'd.

6984~~~
Oh, there you do have a point.

6985~~~
There would be some adjustment but I don't think they would stuggle as badly as you think tbh. Technical skills will eventually over come brute force and physicallity all the time, even in the EPL. They would just take time to get used to it.

6986~~~
Clear to see Herrera and Blind would make a great combination in midfield. When's the last time we started Herrera and Blind?

6987~~~
Exactly. In the same way that most Spanish players take time to get used to playing for a PL team. 

Obviously, some members of that hypothetical Spanish team would adjust quicker than others, some may not adapt at all. There are clear differences between playing football in the two leagues, which it's silly to ignore by claiming that technique is all that matters.

6988~~~
Agree. I would say though I think Herrera is one that would adpat quickly, if given the time on the pitch too.

6989~~~
He'll be adapting in training too but yeah, he does seem like the type of player who should flourish in the PL. Especially the way he likes a full-blooded tackle. Just needs to work on his upper body strength a little, so he can bounce off challenges a bit better. Doubt we'll see the best of him until his second season. Which is fairly standard for a young player adapting to a different league.

6990~~~
So I went and checked, the last time we started them together was the 2-2 against West Brom when Herrera didn't recover from his rib injury. The last time they completed a game together was the 5-3 loss against Leicester.

In fact they've only started together 4 times this season. West Brom away, West Ham home, Leicester away and QPR home. QPR and Leicester being the only one's they completed (Herrera went off injured against West Ham and came off at half time against West Brom).

6991~~~
I do not really get it. We have bought a DM in Blind and a CM in Herrera. Both have the potential to be one of the best in their position but they hardly play together. Beside that our main strikers RvP and Falcao struggle and Rooney is not really convincing in midfield.

6992~~~
LVG logic, I'm sure there is a good reason for what he is trying to accomplish with it all, I just hope it either works or he gives up and moves on to something else very soon.

6993~~~
The annoying thing for me is, Fellaini might be this big tall guy but he is not a physical monster. When I watch him, I don't think he looks that powerful. His goal output is similar to Anders's isnt it? So its not like he is in the team for that too. 

I just dont get it.

6994~~~
I don't get it either as according to LVG he's competing with Rooney, ADM, Mata and not Fellaini, how many times does it have to be brought up.

6995~~~
He may say that but that's not reality.

6996~~~
'Yet he still seems to have some way to go to win the trust of Van Gaal and his coaching staff. There is a feeling around the club that he has not bought into the manager’s strict ‘philosophy’ quite as well as some of his teammates' 

Seriously...? #philosophy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6997~~~
As I predicted, he plays today. I think he played much more reserved role in Wednesday, just as van Gaal wanted according to reports. Seems fair decision to give him a chance.

6998~~~
Plays well off the bench. Gets picked next game. As it should be. Plays well tonight and he'll start our next game. Good stuff.

6999~~~
Been a little disappointed with him. I'm looking for his quality on the ball and not seen it yet.

7000~~~
Doesn't inspire confidence in anything he does.

7001~~~
Wow thats a little harsh...

7002~~~
I don't mean it in <i>that </i>negatively, he just doesn't have a calming influence. Even when he does something well it always looks rushed and a bit scrappy. 

Except his first touch, actually, that is absolutely elegant.

7003~~~
Hasn't done anything wrong, just a bit quiet for the most part. Playing it safe with a few good incisive passes going forward. Think when we use the diamond he can play the right midfield role, but he's better as a proper central player like he was in the 4-4-2 the last game.

7004~~~
Playing without confidence. Come on Ander, step it up.

7005~~~
Definitely been a little invisible. I'm starting to feel he plays well in a team playing good football, but isn't a player who'll drag the team up.

7006~~~
I love you man!

7007~~~
Take that van Gaal! Get in.

7008~~~
Scores a goal....doesn't play again for 6 weeks.

7009~~~
4 goals and 4 assists for him already, imagine if we played him frequently.

7010~~~
His goal should not count.

7011~~~
Scoring a goal and saving your manager's arse?

Oh you better believe that's a benching for the next few games!

7012~~~
I thought that to but, you've got Keown on the BBC saying it's legit <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

7013~~~
Bailed us out but his all-round game has been poor today so far - hopefully that'll give him some confidence and he can finish the game strongly.

7014~~~
Definitely looks like a player thats trying to change his game, and keep it a lot safer. 

I don't like it, but hey, its the philosophy.

7015~~~
I wouldn't say poor, he's not been good but poor is stretching it - just an average game, the goal clearly helps.

7016~~~
Yeah I'll admit poor was harsh. He's not done anything wrong as such, it's just for a player who people are saying is one of our most creative I tend to judge his performances by how much he, well, creates, which in this game has been very little aside from the goal. Like I say I'm stoked for him, hope to see more from him now he's made an impact on the game.

7017~~~
I don't know if he didn't do anything wrong; he didn't follow his player when Preston scored

7018~~~
Yeah, I've been disappointed with him today, it just wasn't a bad performance IMO. A typical 6 out of 10 performance where he does little wrong but doesn't do much right either, I think he's been playing it safe because he fears that a few bad passes here and there will write him off completely in van Gaal's eyes.

7019~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Are you keown, are you keown, are you keown in disguise

7020~~~
True, but for me he's an AM so I don't tend to judge him too harshly on his lack of defensive acumen. People on here like to think that LvG is too cautious to play him but realistically he's not got the right skillset to play in a position where he's expected to do a lot of defending and I'd say that's the main reason we've not seen all that much of him this season.

7021~~~
He tries to change and adapt. He is not the same player as at the beginning of the season.

7022~~~
Your membership in this forum should not count.

7023~~~
Incredible stuff. I am very offended <a class="username" data-user="28685, @Cina" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28685/">@Cina</a>

7024~~~
Exactly what I thought. Credit has to go to him for trying to adapt his game, but personally I think its a waste.

7025~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7026~~~
Need to add control to his game. Still too sloppy in possession overall.

Miss the more attacking player he was at the start of the season. But, I suppose that's why he wasn't in the team initially. LvG wanted a more rounded player maybe?

7027~~~
I would have liked him under Fergie, would have been terrific. He has no choice, either he adapts or he has to go probably. It is a waste, but lets hope he changes for the better.

7028~~~
I thought that was a decent enough performance, particularly when he was playing next to Blind and Fellaini who were shocking until we went to 4-4-2.

Echoing others, obvious changes in his game. Not ideal, but he's doing what he needs to do to play.

7029~~~
I'm pleased for him that he scored. As I said in the match day thread he deserves to start every game now.

7030~~~
I didn't think he was very good at all to be honest. Certainly not worth 20% of the motm vote. Popped up with an important goal again however and I would like to see him get a run in the side for a while.

7031~~~
I thought he did pretty well, got through a lot of work for the team and was certainly a help to Blind who had one of his poorest games. Took his goal nicely too, really hope Van Gaal gives him a run now.

7032~~~
He doesn't need to "control" games, as he was criticised for by Keown. Blind's job is to control the midfield and to keep it ticking over, the point of playing a player like Herrera is to allow him to take chances and try and create an opening. To ask him to limit that and "control" the game would be unfair to his natural game and would be detrimental to our play overall. He's a risk-taking player, so he may not have the highest pass completion and may infuriate at times with passing, but that's part and parcel of his game.

7033~~~
1st Half I would agree, 2nd half he got through a lot of hard work.

7034~~~
Your wumming should not count as wumming, but still.

7035~~~
Nonsense. You can't have one defensive midfielder and 5 attacking players. You need a second midfielder that takes so,e responsibility. Especially when you have a defence that doesn't instill confidence.

7036~~~
Not a good game from him, but not bad either. I don’t think that playing him on the right is the best idea, I would rather him and Fellaini swapped*. Looks much better centrally, always making things happen. Although he tends to lose the ball every now and then.

Sometimes I feel he is surprised that players around him don’t make obvious moves. Still adapting I would say, but definitely should play next game.

<span style="font-size: 12px">*or maybe they did play like that, couldn’t see the ball most of the time due to my shit river </span>

7037~~~
If I bother you ignore me or report me to the mods. It's hardly wumming when neutral journalists share my PoV.

7038~~~
A bit rusty understandably, but I think he can take a lot of positives from that. Plays in spells though, like he gets the ball a few times, gets incredibly excited and tires himself out for a few minutes.

7039~~~
Not the best of games but important goal

7040~~~
If you see players as simply being defensive or attacking then I think it's you who's talking nonsense.

Tell me where I've said that he shouldn't take "some responsibility" - I'm not suggesting for one minute that he abandon all defensive duties and just focus purely on attacking. What I'm saying is that when he is possession and is looking to make things happen that the occasional misplaced pass or incomplete through ball has to be accepted, else we'll go back to playing totally bland uninventive football.

7041~~~
You aren't bothering me at all, just pointing it out.-

7042~~~
Are you moving from thread to thread hoping nobody will catch you?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7043~~~
Too late for that.

7044~~~
He's not a winger. He needs to be able to roam in order to fully utilize his positioning and ability to find space bth on and off the ball.

7045~~~
Semantics. I'm saying he doesn't do enough to help take the game by the scruff of the neck. I'm all for his direct passing and risk taking, I just don't think he gets a big enough grip on the game like other Premiership midfielders do. You can accomodate a player like him, for sure, but a player like him doesn't help accomodate player like Di Maria or Mata and that is what Van Gaal takes into consideration. 

Di Maria doesn't relish the physical battle and takes risk with his passing too, it's understandable that he doesn't want two of those players at EPL level.

7046~~~
App: 17
Goals: 4
Asst: 4

Pretty decent return for a player who spends most of his time on the bench

7047~~~
Just hope he gets a good run now. Needs to beef up a bit I think. But so happy to see him out there tonight.

7048~~~
It is which makes him extremely useful.

7049~~~
Most of those appearances are surely has a substitute as well, should be starting more games he's not even had a proper run in the team I'd bet he can improve even further.

7050~~~
Grew into the game once we went behind and had to start attacking. Did better as did everyone when it was Rooney and Fellaini up top. Please don't drop him for RVP

7051~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7052~~~
imagine if he played centrally - he's smart put him in next to blind.

7053~~~
LvG will have to keep his word now that if someone plays well they keep their place. Rooney and Fellaini up top and Herrera in CM. If not he is a hypocrite.

7054~~~
Numbers don't lie.

Unspectacular and efficient for the most part, once he moved inside to a proper #8 position he had more influence on the game. First, scored a very cute goal to get us back in the game. Then, spotted and found the run of Valencia in the build up to Fellaini's goal. Not looking the same adventurous player he was early in the season, but having sat on the bench for so long his confidence can't be that high. If Van Gaal continues to give him a go in the side he'll continue to improve and be productive.

7055~~~
He looked much better once he moved central, him and Blind moved pretty smoothly in midfield I felt, I think we have to factor in how hard it is to get form and build confidence when you play so rarely, he's warranted another start IMO.

7056~~~
He is one of those players who as soon as the Ball left his feet makes himself available again. His movement is a bit like scholesy. 

Opened up their defence with one through ball to Valencia on the right, some passing stuff we are missing without him.

Of course he still has to improve but he certainly brings quality to the team and deserves to start more regularly!

7057~~~
Was class in that second half. First was alright, a 6/10 performance, nothing wrong but just quiet. Second half was a lot better in the middle of the park. He'd be top class for us if we still had Fergie, exactly the player we needed for so long. Hopefully Van Gaal starts using him in a similar way as well.

7058~~~
Exactly my feeling as well. Everytime I see him I think of him as someone bought by Fergie - even though that's not the case! He just seems like Fergie's type of player.

But yes, he must start from now on. Don't care who needs to be sacrificed to make that happen.

7059~~~

7060~~~
He's a strange player. Doesn't have the consistency or range of passing you want from a CM but makes things happen all the same. If we can find a blend of players in midfield which accentuates his best qualities and covers for his deficiencies then he could be a really good player for us. We desperately need a conductor in central midfield and I don't think he will ever be that player. Could be a decent lead guitarist though!

Really tidy finish too. Which is getting glossed over by the offside controversy.

7061~~~
Yeah, I thought he was going to be that guy too. He's not. Still vaguely disappointed tonight. Would still have him in for a run now. He's another one we seem to have beaten the spark out of a bit. It's a start, no more.

7062~~~
Ferguson had scouted him for some time and passed on the knowledge to Moyes who then took two months to realize, by then it was too late. I wonder how our season would have panned out last year if we had him in the team. He wouldn't have made that much of a difference because he clearly isn't that good to fully transform a team but given how much of a weakness our midfield and lack of creativity was we might have at least got an Europa League spot with him in the team.

7063~~~
He has a slight touch of the Andersons about him in that he gives the ball away inexplicably at times. I like him, though. Might be being generous but I think he'll improve a lot when the players around him start playing. He involves himself in so much.

7064~~~
He needs to start in a midfield 3 or alongside Blind/Carrick to get the best from him, can't be playing him on the edge of a diamond and expecting him to run the channels and still have an effect on the game. 

4 goals and 4 assists despite only having 7 starts, says a lot.

7065~~~
he does run around like a headless chicken when we don't have the ball, and just seems to not read the game very well when having to defend. Going forward and especially when both Rooney and Fellaini pushed up, he looked much more comfortable and is much more of an instinctive player. I get why LVG don't trust him.

7066~~~
Get a prime Carrick in next to him in a midfield duo and I think he'd be the perfect partner. Blind I'm not sure if he's quite the right player to partner him in a midfield 2, though he's a very good player too.

7067~~~
agreed he needs either Blind and\or Carrick.

7068~~~
Only a slight touch, thank feck. Got a proper engine on him, which is nice to see. Still haring round in the closing minutes.

7069~~~
He reminds me of Frank Lampard.

Herrera surely will start against Swansea now. Him and Blind as a two makes sense.

7070~~~
Lets not go nuts.

QPR, Yeovil, Preston, Leicester.

I like him, but he doesn't get in my starting lineup. i'd have Mata in behing Rooney over him every time.

7071~~~
Would love to see us play with one striker up front in a 4-3-3 with Blind/Herrera/Di Maria in CM.

7072~~~
His first touch is also brilliant by the way. Seems to instantly control whatever is pegged into him. If people are disappointed in him, I think it's only due to expecting him to be a Xavi style player instead of what he is, an energetic, quick thinking player who makes things happen. He's a good passer, but I agree with others in that it's not like a controlled type of passing. He picks out the right option most of the time though and is class in tight areas unlike the others, and it helps a lot having the first touch he does. Put Carrick next to him for the control, defensive positioning and passing range, and Herrera provides the movement, increase in tempo, creativity and goal threat.

7073~~~
If you judged him on tonight I don't think him in a two makes sense at all.

7074~~~
I take your point but has he played vs anyone good?

I think he offers a lot more industry than Mata and more defensively. He's also more versatile. Don't see why they can't both play as long as the oppo aren't giants.

7075~~~
I like that he's constantly attempting to create something, it's refreshing to have in our midfield but I do think van Gaal considers player position and these lines to be more important than any individual. This is why I believe di Maria is the only player with complete creative freedom.

7076~~~
They also tell us feck all. Those numbers anyway.

7077~~~
Why? One of the only proper midfielders we have who constantly wants to try to make things happen.

It's Swansea ffs, we need to stop being negative. Put out an attacking side, and go attack them.

7078~~~
Thought he played well. He needs someone with real composure next to him though, and Blind definitely wasn't that tonight.

7079~~~
He tries so hard to move the ball quickly and raise the tempo but its a waste of time when he's the only one doing it and the likes of Falcao and Fellaini are killing every move with bad touches and fouls. Atleast when we went a goal down others were atleast trying to up the tempo too.

7080~~~
Have you watched Swansea much? They'll pass rings round anything other than an extremely strong midfield two. BlInd is off form and Hererra a work in progress. They'll need help.

7081~~~
agreed, I think LVG prefers midfielders who retain possession at the expense of creativity.

7082~~~
Makes so much sense. Unfortunately, sense isn't something that comes hand-in-hand with Louis' selection policy this season. Hopefully that'll change this weekend!

7083~~~
He does offer more defensively but as a number 10 i want creativity.

7084~~~
The biggest compliment I can pay Herrera is that I don't think he was anywhere near his best tonight but he still managed to give a decent display and contribute a goal. We've settled for far less from our midfielders at times in the last 6-7 years.

7085~~~
Swansea have been a good passing side for years.

I'm sorry but in no way should Manchester United adapt their style to play Swansea. No other top side (Bayern, Madrid, Barca, Juve, PSG etc) would change how they play and go in cautiously against them, and neither should we.

Perhaps it's a bit of pent up frustration on my part, but I'm fed up of this slow negative style of play we have adopted. I miss the old days where Ferguson would send a side out to batter teams 3 or 4 nil.

7086~~~
Thought he was average at best tonight. Can't say I'm surprised so many people here picked him as MOTM, tho...

7087~~~
Really wish we'd parked Herrera in central midfield from the start of the season and just let him learn how to play the role, adjust to the physicality. Such a waste to have him on the bench so much of the time.

7088~~~
Always seems to contribute in some way to a game whether it's a key pass or goal. Just play him in a midfield two and let him have a run of games. I think he can be a very good player for us.

7089~~~
To be fair we did do that initially and it coincided with some very poor results against weak opposition, largely due to a lack of cover provided by the Blind, Herrera, Di Maria midfield. I get that people are frustrated at seeing a new £30m signing on the bench but if we'd kept lining up with Herrera in central midfield through November and December he <i>might</i> have slowly gotten used to the position but we'd have dropped a fair few points in the process, and probably taken a couple of heavy beatings off of Chelsea and City to boot.

7090~~~
I thought he was nothing spectacular, agreed, and I don't think he could have too many complaints if he was dropped to the bench again on Saturday but the uproar in here would be something else...

He's a good player anyway, and still believe we'll see the best of him next season, when our midfield is sorted.

7091~~~
This is exactly what I was saying when we were initially linked to him. Carrick-Herrera would be a better midfield two than any we attempted since Scholes had any legs left.

7092~~~
Only one in the first half who managed better than a 6/10 and faded in the second half but still contributed.

Overall 6.5/10... still enough for MoM though, which says a lot about how shite we were.

7093~~~
He is the most discussed player here and that's IMO doing him wrong as there are some people obsessed with discrediting him to balance out the ratings and perception of him here. 

Was he outstanding today? Not at all. Were we pleased to see him play? I guess so. Did he had a good game? Surely. I gave him my MOTM vote as he was our most consistent performer through the game and scored the vital goal which helped us to dominate the game.

His passing and movement was getting better with every pass. Surely you can't blame the player that he was that cautious in the first half he didn't want to do a mistake but he picked two nice through balls in contrary we have dimaria who plays every game and his confidence is on a different level, plays big amount of passes and is often really not successful anyway however once Herrera gets in this playing rhytm he will be our vital player. Just give him run of games and it will boost his confidence and he will show us how creative he is and how good he links up things. 

The pitch was awful btw

7094~~~
Different opinions. I thought both he and Daley Blind were very good. Apparently Blind is off form. Perhaps I just haven't noticed.

7095~~~
He was ok, but that goal will certainly do him good.

I thought he was anonymous in the first half, as was everyone. Still nice to see him get game time.

7096~~~
I think that's because other players, like RvP and Falcao, have been given the luxury of 'playing themselves into form', whereas Herrera seems to be being asked to come into the team and give a flawless performance or face being dropped again.

It's the inconsistency that will annoy people (if that's what happens).

Tonight he quickened up our passing and scored a goal. He can't get used to the PL if he isn't given time to settle into his role, it isn't a fair demand to make.

7097~~~
Average rating: 6.3
Your rating: 6.4

I guess I hate him. I have de Gea as 6.2, it's definitely like I hate Herrera.

7098~~~
Honestly don't remember what you said, think you were just overly critical about him in his first couple of games or something. 
I have him on 7.4 though so I'm obviously a bit of a Herrera fanboy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7099~~~
Genuine question. If Rooney had put in that performance tonight would he be getting praise or criticism on here?

I

7100~~~
Why not? Cheap comment. Maybe it's because he stands out as a player who can make things happen and did so. Technically, he has the skills and his movement is excellent. Our midfield without him is pedestrian and devoid of ideas (mostly).

7101~~~
Criticized, but Rooney seems to get criticized for everything by some. There was that one pass today by Ander where he just spun and kicked it out the left despite there being no one out the left and it going straight to a Preston player. I've seen no mention of it on here but if that was Rooney you can bet people would be going on about that and saying he is shit because of it. 

Average today for me, was surprised to hear he made something like 35 passes in the first half as I hardly noticed him. Very important goal though and looked a bit better in the second half. I don't know about this diamond, he is basically being asked to play as a CM and a RM and I don't think he (or anyone really) can do that effectively. There is simply to much space for him to try and cover. Play with wingers and let him just stay inside as a proper CM and I think he'll look better. Good player, wasn't his best day today but I hope to see more of him.

7102~~~
Which midfielder deserves to play over him? He's better than Rooney has been there, he's better than Fellaini when he's played as a midfielder. Only Blind has been consistently better than him this season, possibly Carrick as well but he's been injured a lot.

He does appear to be playing it safe now, or at least today, which is a shame.

7103~~~
That's the role he is assigned though, it's pretty obvious di Maria is the only player with creative freedom in the system. Fellaini, Blind, di Maria and Mata have all been better than Herrera this season, in my opinion. We've seen flashes of brilliance from Herrera, but he's had his ups and downs this season. He'll be fine though, once the midfield is sorted.

7104~~~
What games are you talking about? Leicester and West Brom? What else? There have only been three games that Herrera has started that we didn't win.

7105~~~
Was pretty pedestrian with him aswell, to be honest. Think it's the system and tactics, though, more than anything.

7106~~~
You really think Fellaini has been better in midfield? I think he's been a bit shit. All his good performances from my memory haven't come from midfield.

7107~~~
Fellaini has had some good games in midfield this season, without doubt.

7108~~~
West Brom, Palace, Chelsea, City, Arsenal, Liverpool (second half)

7109~~~
I only remember him being good in the West Brom game, where he came on as a sub. The other game was meh. Liverpool performance wasn't good at all. I don't think he's good enough of a passer or good at positioning himself to play in midfield but at the moment he's a better option that what's been played recently. That's for sure.
To be fair to him, he's been played all over the place. Against Palace he was on the right and he basically played there as well in all the games you mentioned bar Chelsea.

7110~~~
I can assure you he wasn't only good in just the West Brom game. 

Liverpool he was good in the second half

Against Palace he wasn't on the right, neither was he against Arsenal and City. He played in a midfield three with Januzaj and Di Maria on the wings.

7111~~~
Are you sure you're not thinking about the diamond where he was on the right? I remember him being a lot on the right and his heat map backs that up (heat map only shows each time he was involved in the game). He's frequently been on the right or in front of the midfield. Played deep against Liverpool. Only rarely has he been properly in midfield like Carrick, Blind or Rooney have.

7112~~~
nice performance from ander, especially in the second half.

7113~~~
I'm positive. Against West Brom, Palace, Chelsea and City, we played with wingers, so they'd be no reason for Fellaini to go out wide.

7114~~~
Right, so we played Rooney upfront and we played Herrera in midfield. Can we now stop pretending that he possesses this magical ability that will enhance our style of play? Generally, we looked as frustrating as ever and were losing with the personnel in that system until van Gaal changed it. 

Now don't get me wrong, Rooney had a good game. Herrera was alright, grabbed himself a goal and grew into the game as it went on. But there's this word we keep using regarding the two changes I mentioned; "need". We don't <i>need</i> To play Herrera in midfield and we don't <i>need</i> to play Rooney upfront. They system isn't designed to play attractive football, so it won't make a blind bit of difference in that regard. Did Herrera contribute more than Rooney has been doing in midfield? Not for me. Rooney did well upfront don't get me wrong and made good runs in behind, but apart from that there was no vast improvement.

The change came when we started playing 4411 and playing with actual wingers and width, then we started to look threatening on a regular basis. It bodes well for the future, but do I want to see us start off with wingers every game from now on? Not necessarily, because I personally don't think it'll improve the results we get using the diamond, and this season that's all I'm bothered about, even though on the contrary, I despise the diamond.

7115~~~
Well I do recall you saying he's been complete shit in a match day thread 3 minutes after he came on....

7116~~~
Not his best performance, still better than Rooney in the midfield. Needs to play there regularly. 

Rooney and him can interchange positions depending on the situation like Fab and Oscar do for Chelsea. We'll need to play the right formation for it to become a feature though.

7117~~~
For the diamond to be effective you need men that can run or take men on in the front 3 we severly lack this on both accounts!

7118~~~
I've only read a few comments on this thread since I last visited a few weeks ago.

My take?  Herrera looked he really belonged in the starting XI.  Not brilliant, but he played a key role v Preston and I'd have him start again v Swansea.  

Roo was a bit rusty up top in the first half but came alive in the second.  Herrera is a man with whom Roo can do business.

7119~~~
He is such a lovely little player. <3

7120~~~
We've lost once in 19 games, how more effective do you want it to be?! The diamond isn't a great formation, it lacks width, it lacks penetration and it'll never be the one of a title challenging side. That isn't what we are currently though, we are a side challenging for top 4 with a defence that needs improving. This formation allows us to keep possession which not only limits the opposition attacks, it means that with the quality on the field, we are likely to score at least one goal and that's why we are difficult to beat.

You're right, that we do need players with pace and dynamism going forward, but I think that's a need of a team rather than the need of the system. I honestly believe that no matter what order we play our attacking players, within reason, it won't make a massive amount of difference.

7121~~~
That's just wrong though, isn't it? Fact is, the ENTIRE team was borderline average/shit last night, right up until the point we went behind/the introduction of Young. 

Then Herrera and Fellaini were arguably the 2 most impressive performers (add in AdM and Young - but he wasn't on for long enough) - both scoring as well. So I can actually see why the 2 of them are getting the highest votes.

7122~~~
He got taken off against Swansea for Fellaini, just as we were taking control of the game, LvG admitted he made a mistake. He then got injured and didn't play against Burnley or Sunderland. Came back for QPR and had a really good game. Then the Leicester debacle. Played against West Ham helped laid on the 2nd goal with a good tackle. Rooney was sent off in that game and then Ander broke his rib. So he actually wasn't to blame apart from the Leicester game to blame for our early season woes.

7123~~~
And that Leicester game was full of some erratic defending, especially by Blackett and Rojo, not THAT much to do with our midfield.

7124~~~
I don't see him as a 10, but drop alongside Blind and he could be a vital player for us. He has more impact on the game in a central role than when he is marooned on the right with Valencia. I'd like to see a magic square of sorts, one where Januzaj and Di Maria have licence to roam inside, go outside.. interchange with each other, drop deep into midfield. It can easily move into a 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, you can drop Fellaini into midfield and push Rooney up top. Either way, in terms of personnel.. these are the players which need to be playing out of the current crop of players at our disposal.

7125~~~
He needs to play centrally with either Carrick or Blind. When Blind is alone in midfield, it's just too easy to pick up the other players. As we lack movement as well, we have no one to play to in midfield.

Put ADM just in front of them with the licence to roam and go to the left and we have a good ball playing midfield

7126~~~
The media would be proud of the pre-determind narrative the Caf has played out over the last 24 hours. 

Herrera had a poor first half and wasn't bad in the second half, the goal was well taken. 

Rooney was straight up average. 


Yet after weeks of bleating on about Herrera starting and Rooney up front people are desperate to be proven right. Have a sense of perspective, please.

7127~~~
I'd play him as the "8". I don't see why Blind / Herrera / Di Maria can't be a 3 or he can play in a 2 against lesser oppo. 

There was no point in us buying him if we're going to use him as a 10, since as you say, Mata offers more guile.

7128~~~
"Straight up average" yet created a goal out of nothing. When was the last time either of our other strikers did that?

Penalty aside, having a striker who could actually threaten in behind made a huge difference. Forced PNE to defend a little deeper and more compact, which created the space out wide that two of our goals came from.

7129~~~
Yeah, I thought Rooney was decent upfront. Played with paced and had good movement, something we have lacked lately. Would like to see him given a run upfront tbh.

7130~~~
He was decent but nothing more. Still a level above anything we've seen from Falcao and all but a handful of performances from RvP. Which speaks volumes about how poor we've been up front this season that a 5 or 6 out of 10 performance from Rooney stands out as being way more threatening than most of our games this season.

7131~~~
Herrera wasn't spectacular last night but he does seem to be on the pitch when we play our best football. His passing is loose at times but I like that he tries things. He's also never stood still, he gets the ball and looks to move it on quickly and he's off again looking for space. He has a really good appreciation for the game.

He'd be in my team week in, week out.

7132~~~
Me too, even though I don't think he's been that great since we signed him. Watching Blind hopelessly press the ball at times only to look back and see he's 30 yards beyond everyone and they've barely even noticed he's gone is heartbreaking. We need genuine energy and desire in there.

7133~~~
Straight up average perhaps a bit harsh but everyone is trying to peddle this narrative that everything is solved now that he is playing up front. The truth is that it was far from a vintage performance (against PNE) and doesn't in any way justify the "I told you so" posts that have been made. 

For what it's worth, I want to see him played there for the rest of the season as much as anyone does, I just think the posts declaring Rooney as being some sort of saviour after a brilliant performance are daft.

7134~~~
Yeah, we've seen glimpses of Herrera but I don't think he's been given a fair crack of the whip just yet. Hopefully he can force is way into Van Gaal plans more consistently.

7135~~~
Rooney was average, as till his goal (where he did really good, but got lucky with the dive) he had 2 good chances, but couldn't control the ball where he should have done it, especially the first time. He is still slowing things down, but his movement was better, I have to agree with that. Again, it's his first game after long time up front, so I wouldn't blame him to much, but it doesn't change the fact that he was average.

7136~~~
And that is overlooking the fact that this was Rooney's first start uptop in a few months. People are being too judgemental on this one outing when Falcao and RVP have had a considerably longer leash, for the grand total of fifteen goals between them. My point is that we need a few more matches to pass an accurate judgement on Rooney's performances as a striker as there is likely to be a period of adjustment mentally to reverting to his role, he is not a robot that one can change at the flick of a switch.

7137~~~
Pretty balanced view. I thought Herrera had a good second half after a medciore-poor first and along with a great finish for the goal bumped his performance from a 6 to a 7 in my view.

He wasn't brilliant and certainly hasn't done enough to cement his place in the first team, however he was one of the better 2-3 player's in a poor team performance.

Rooney was the same out of form Rooney we've seen in midfield for the last month or two... Just 30 yards further forward.

7138~~~
Swansea as well, there are also games where we got points but looked very shakey in the process, despite playing against weaker opposition, but I'm not saying that every loss of points is directly down to Herrera, more that with him in a midfield role we're generally more vulnerable because he's a more offensively minded player.

 The post I was replying to was claiming that we should have just stuck Herrera in midfield in every game so he could adapt to the league, mine was that if trying to shoehorn an offensive player into a more balanced role made us vulnerable against the likes of Leicester and West Brom, it would have been a disaster against some of the better teams we've faced (especially City and Chelsea). Surely that's not a particularly contentious point to make?

7139~~~
To be fair, Herrera hasnt had a decent run recently and needs a couple of games to find his form. The same goes for Januzaj or any other player that didnt feature on a regular basis

7140~~~
My thoughts exactly. A player who is capable of excelling. There's a tenacity about him too, again not dissimilar to the ginger one.

7141~~~
I'd agree with you as far as to say it's hard to play RVP Rooney and Falcao in the same team but I don't agree with you regarding saying how more effective do you want it to be. As we haven't used the diamond for all these games plus we have struggled in many a game. Plus if you have the correct players the diamond can be as good as any formation. (We haven't as you have alluded too)

7142~~~
yes - when he moved to , wait for it with shock and awe ,  central midf from the wing.

7143~~~
I love the little body feint's he does when he's about to receive the ball. There was 1 moment where he pretended to turn back, then just moved forward with the ball and took out 2 players. So simple yet really effective, I don't remember any of our other midfielders doing this to the extreme he does. Really helps him shake his marker.

7144~~~
that was ace. i'd hate to have to play against him. always moving unlike most of the other 9 outfield players. TC23 hides , this guy wants the ball. with blind they make a smart pair of midfs.

7145~~~
I agree. The only reservation I have is that a  Blind souped up on steroids would be the perfect partner for Hererra in midfield. However, not forgetting morals, maybe we should just buy a powerful, yet skilful box to box player ( a la Pogba, etc) to compliment them in a midfield trio?

7146~~~
He wasn't playing on the wing though. In the diamond, sure he needs to go wide more often when playing RCM, but I don't think that excuses him at all from his first half performance.

7147~~~
He wasn't THAT bad, just wasn't involved very much and so had a very mediocre half. Most of our play was through Di Maria and the opposite wing. When he moved central he got involved more and thus had a little more influence on the game.

7148~~~
Oh no, I agree he wasn't all that bad. I just felt the other fella was giving him a bit of a free ride by saying he was on the wing.

7149~~~
I remember that it was waddle esk

7150~~~
Aargh, that touch and feint was mint. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7151~~~
I find it interesting, although not surprising that people haven't mentioned his role in the Preston goal yesterday (though if someone has, bear in mind I skimmed the last few pages really, so might have missed it). Completely went to sleep. 
He is the forum's latest golden boy though, through each phase of the season, the phrase "Why isn't X playing? X has to start, Louis is nuts" or such like has been showing up. It's Herrera at the minute.

7152~~~
Yeah, I sometimes feel I've to underrate him to balance out the praise he receives for the most part. He wasn't particularly good yesterday, but he scored though so that'll do for me.

7153~~~
I rate him enough that I'm not sure we shouldn't just sign 2 wide players and go 4-3-3/4-5-1 with Herrera as the 8. 

He might not have a ton of power or defensive solidity, but when you look at the best teams in the world, their 2nd most defensive midfielder is a mobile, creative midfielder who has played some of his career as a 10 and is out there to link play like Modric, Rakitic, Thiago (when healthy, and if not him, they've done well with an offensive player there), Cesc and even Gabi.

7154~~~
It was definitely his fault, he let his fullback get a run on him who had the shot. Saying that though he made it up by scoring and playing well after. I think if we lost more people would be moaning though.

7155~~~
In fairness I thought he was our best player yesterday and I'm not yet convinced by him. Still room for improvement but defensively he did fairly well and he scored a goal at the other end so no complaints from me. Deserves to keep his place.

7156~~~

7157~~~
Ugh. I hate stupid stats like this that in no way tell a full story. No noting the strength of opposition, nor the line up each time he played etc. Utterly pointless stat.

7158~~~
Most stats don't tell the whole story, but one thing is for sure we play better with Herrera in the team than without.

7159~~~
I don't think it can to be honest, I think you need a formation that is going to stretch both lines of an opponents defence and the diamond doesn't do that. It's a slight upgrade offensively to 352 because we push a body up field and have a man over in the centre, but organised defences will stay compact and render it obsolete. In terms of effectiveness, I'm going on a results basis and with the squad we have and our aim for the season, I think one loss in nineteen is actually quite remarkable.

7160~~~
Yeb, and I specifically talked about 1 and a half of those 3 minutes. But that was a match day thread. A "speak what you think about what just happened" thread.

7161~~~
Di Maria hasn't always been on the wing. If there was no reason for him to be on the wing then you might want to explain what he was doing there then.

It's similar vs West Brom. He's more central and on the left vs Chelsea. Possibly because he won't help much vs Hazard as Hazard is so much quicker.

Basically, United played with a diamond midfield in most of those games and he's usually on the right side of the diamond. Against Arsenal he was supposed to be one of three central midfielder in a 3 CB formation but a lot of the time he was way out right, pretty much where Valencia was.

7162~~~
Didn't count Swansea for obvious reasons. First game of the season, first time using this formation in a competitive game. Lingard and Blackett both started. Hernandez was up front. The team was a mess.

The point would have been fine if you had argued it better. Two games isn't a base to make your point on. Especially when the alternative is Wayne Rooney in midfield who is in no way better at playing a midfielder than Herrera is.

7163~~~
Agreed. 

I thought Rooney was very poor in the first half, yet his fanboys were going crazy over how there was movement. He was so slow it was unbelievable. When he did come out of his position (my pet hate) his passing was dreadful. 

I love Herrera, but I didn't even know he was on the park in the first half. In fairness, every time United got the ball it was obvious they were told to give it to Di Maria, which was good, so not much happened on his side of the park.

Overall, I would be happy with playing the team that finished against Swansea. Maybe bring on Mata for Fellani if the goals don't come.

7164~~~
Rooney was good compared to the shite RvP and Falcao deliver every week. Herrera was good too. Now suddenly they had both average games. Let them play a few games like yesterday, i am sure they will improve. Rooney forgot how to play up top. Van Gaal castrated Herrera to fit him in his CM role. They cant suddenly be world beaters.

7165~~~
Think you are wrong about the 433 buddy but I'll respect your opinion. But a 433 with two attacking full backs can be awesome to watch.

7166~~~
or some variation of it , but 4 at the back with the fbs attacking . 4-4-2 , 4-2-3-1 . 4-3-3. get this guy on the field with blind v swansea.

7167~~~
Read the comments after the report. It seems that Van Gaal himself is joining in the debate.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7168~~~

7169~~~
Fair enough in terms of the positioning. Maybe that's more to do with him doubling up with the winger, and when we kicked the ball out wide to him, though, but we did not play a diamond in the games I mentioned, which was my initial point. We played a 4141.

7170~~~
Herrera vs PNE

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UwIZ6-BOL3M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

7171~~~
2nd game in a row he is starting. No coincidence with his change of playing style. Seems to adapt to LvG's instructions, even if he loses some of his qualities.

7172~~~
Van Gaal has seen the light

7173~~~
Delighted to see him start today, hope he has a good game. A great lineup by Louis, which worries me... whenever I'm happy with it we seem to play shite.

7174~~~
Now the media will start asking why Mata isn't playing. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

7175~~~
I'm far more confident about this game just because he's playing.

7176~~~
Are you convinced now Louis? He's the difference since the first minute.

7177~~~
Christ, I love him.

7178~~~
Goal Machine

7179~~~
best player so far

7180~~~
Playing with purpose. Could do with someone better playing on the right (McNair is struggling).

7181~~~
Ander Herrera at Manchester United: 6 starts 6 goals 5 assists

7182~~~
Just begs the question; why the feck was he not playing? fecking hell.

7183~~~
Thing I like about him is that he actually passes the ball forward.

7184~~~
He's been very good, and I didn't subscribe to the hype we had in here during his period on the bench.

7185~~~
Joe Allen, and all that.

7186~~~
A lot of the time he'll do it with a single touch and make it look easy

7187~~~
Neat goal and great goal-line clearance, very happy for him.

7188~~~
I loved how he repeatedly passed the ball out of play and gave Shelvey all the space in the world to cross it. 

Something special this lad.

7189~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7190~~~
You mean how he passed it to the right back who just stood still instead of moving towards it?

7191~~~
He passed the ball out of play when his team-mates weren't showing the same urgency to get forward and actually do something positive, and it's not his fault he was tasked with marking two men...Shelvey should've been van Persie's.

7192~~~
Tbf, the passes were played for McNair to run onto, but McNair was back on his heels. Especially the second pass, McNair wasn't concentrating.

7193~~~
93.8% pass accuracy, typical stupidity

7194~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Numbers mean feck all. Every time he passed it five yards away from a player who got there purely on the grounds that Swansea are shite counts as an accurate pass. Having eyes tells you otherwise.

7195~~~
Your next job to secure a brain

7196~~~
Do you actually think he's been shit? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

7197~~~
There's always one every week with an agenda.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7198~~~
It's been one of his best performances for us. That's not saying much though. 

I'd say the agendas are with those praising him today or midweek. The ultimate passenger player.

7199~~~
Give it a rest.

7200~~~
Clueless pal.

7201~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7202~~~
Take off the fecking blinkers pal. Our best player today by a distance. Scored a goal, consistently played the right pass, works hard defensively and always looks to get involved in everything. You should look up the definition of a passenger if you think he's one.

7203~~~
Just how clueless are some people? The ultimate passenger player? Lolz.

7204~~~
Good game, he can do much better than this but even this is more than enough to keep his place in the midfield. Much better than Rooney there, plus he is actually proving he is very consistent scorer from midfield too. I don't think he'll always keep this goal record, but he is definitely a goal threat, so I really don't see any reason to not start him, especially because he was great defensively today too. 

I think you really need to be daft to start the likes of Falcao or van Persie over him(I know they aren't playing in same position, but playing them up front usually means playing Rooney in midfield, which means Herrere on the bench).

7205~~~
Fantastic player and possibly our best midfielder - bit worrying its taken our manager 7 months to recognise.

7206~~~
he is our best player in the team I always said that, two MOTM performances in a row, two goals, 3 goals in three starts, what more do you want and the creativity, availability with goals and assists is not the main thing about this fella, he is very humble intelligent guy who works hard for the team and plays for the badge.

 Absolutely love him, he was different class to anyone on the pitch today, shame we didn't win so he would have stood out much more. Even Van Gaal who doesn't rate him that much had to sub off di maria who played below par and not really impressed in last couple of games. I hope today Ander opened Van Gaal's eyes and he will start to pick him and this ignorance has ended..

7207~~~
He is our 17th players by minutes played in the premierleague. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7208~~~
The worst part is that he will bear the brunt of this match in the next one.

7209~~~
He is a good player, as you say, I think he really understand what playing for Manchester United means. Not sure ADM and Falcao do. If he doesn't pick him LvG will get all the stick he deserves and rightly so.

7210~~~
Very good player which makes it even more ludicrous how long it's taken LVG to realize that.

7211~~~
Hehe its Van Gaal we are talikng about, im sure had Carrick been fit Berrera wouldnt have played.

7212~~~
Then decision like that will get LvG the sack among a few other baffling ones.

7213~~~
One of our brighter sparks today, always looking for the chance to open things up but also played with the discipline that LvG wants.

7214~~~
Faded a little bit in the second half, he seems to perform better when we try to transition quickly from defence to attack rather than slowly build up play. 

Still my MOTM though, easily. If he doesn't keep his place vs. Sunderland I will give up hope on LVG ever ceasing to be an idiot.

7215~~~
Our best player today IMO. One of few players who can actually beat a man and took his goal well. If only we attacked with more fluidity to better suit him.

7216~~~
LVG is an idiot. Can't believe he's left this guy out for most of the season. Baffling.

7217~~~
Yeah fans really love him and rightly so. I liked his two little "mistakes" today. It was actually two almost perfectly timed balls, he payed it wide to McNair who was unable to get to the ball in time as he was on his heels and didn't expect to start the attack so soon.. 

It's our philosophy these days. Be patient and don't hurry anything up. I watched some of Bilbao games last couple of years since their win at OT, and they don't stop. It's different intensity and different joy to watch. I believe with some right additions we could play the same sort of football, but not with three most forward players as fast and mobile as Rooney-VP-Fellaini..

7218~~~
Has been said a million times before but needs reiterating - Ander must start every game hence forth. His ingenuity, movement and tenacity just adds another dimension to our midfield play, not to mention the surprising level of productivity he's displaying as a starter. Cyclic possession be damned, sometimes risk-takers who can be your creative sparks are just as important if not more so. Plus, in terms of intangibles he just gets it. An almost prototypical United player in terms of his confidence, approach and determination for the cause.

7219~~~
Agreed.
But also we should remember that when Carrick plays, we normally win. So, there's that.

7220~~~
Good again today, hopefully he's done enough to start consistently now.

7221~~~
--------Carrick ---Blind-------
Herrera-----Rooney-----Di Maria
------------Wilson-------------

Mata, Januzaj interchangeable for any of the three behind the striker when someone is injured/needs a rest. 

I really feel that's how we can get the best out of the players we have. Obviously I'm just a fan and not LVG, but I'd love to see us try this.

7222~~~
He's been great in the first half but I don't understand why he backed off so much in the second half, could rarelly see him involved as much as in the first half and often saw him close to the half-line for some reason.

7223~~~
Is this correct.
Can someone verify this?
If so, these are outstanding stats.

7224~~~
The guy is easily one of the 11 best players we have.

7225~~~
yes correct

Edit: not sure if they are true, i am counting 5 goals amd 4 assists

7226~~~
I can't imagine he did that of his own accord. You wonder if they are told to keep it tight, then concede then panic.

7227~~~
Yea that's what I was thinking too but then you've had Blind charging forward from time to time <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Seriously, hardly anything this season makes any fecking sense.

7228~~~
Going by LvG's logic so far this season he'll identify him as the reason we lost because it's the first time he started him in ages, and bench him again for ages.

Who hasn't he played in ages who the fans have been moaning about him not playing? Mata maybe? That'll do, straight swap.

7229~~~
He also has more than 6 starts so every one of those stats were wrong. Still impressive stats though. Although just stating the number of starts has no real meaning.

7230~~~
Mata should have started in this game with Herrera. ADM looks a lot happier with both of them in the side. Why was Fellaini there? LvG's logic? I just find the man baffling. I am beginning to think the players do as well.

7231~~~
Didn't check it up, found it on facebook and no one objected in the comments below so thought there might be some truth to it.

EDIT: 6-5-4 I'm getting so I'm guessing the rest is including pre-season.

7232~~~
I love his approach but in almost every game he's played for us he's practically disappeared in the last 30 minutes and it leaves us a little vulnerable in the middle. Not sure whether it's mental or physical but it does give van Gaal a reason to put him back on the bench.

They're not but his stats are still impressive. He's started 9 games, scored 5 goals and gotten 3 assists.

7233~~~
It's 6 starts in the league.

In all competitions it's 8 starts (subbed on 9 times) with 5 goals and 4 assists in 1022 minutes.

7234~~~
what are you talking about? it's not true. He is working hard through the whole game so there are maybe more fresh players but he is still always available even at the end of games. It's not like Van Persie has stamina for 50minutes maximum per game.. looks like pub player to someone like Herrera.

I think today he was one trying to do something in the end but we were constantly pushing our center backs up front so he was waiting back ofte with Blind covering the space.. He is not hiding at all.. but it is sometimes like that the focus of the game is at one side of the pitch and the ball passes by you... everybody who ever played football on some level knows this..

7235~~~
We have posted numerous formations and sides but it will eventually count for feck all when the man in charge has to be nudged in the right direction rather than see sense on his own. The side you have posted is a good side but basing on what we have seen so far I'd exile Rooney on the wing before Herrera, I think Herrera is the guy we would want running our attack and he is good and brave enough to find Wilson with a through ball or two.

7236~~~
Could be in part because we tend to start hoofing it in the latter parts of games. Though I don't think he disappears that much, has less of an influence yes but still plays a part and works hard. Just when the game is a bit crazy he's probably not the best option to use to calm things.

7237~~~
I'll doubt his sanity if he benches Herrera in the next game.

And he probably will.

7238~~~
I doubt any of our Spaniards will be here come September 2017.

7239~~~
I wasn't talking about today I was talking about his United career so far. Don't let that get in the way of you being condescending for no apparent reason though.

7240~~~
To be fair, it's not exiling anyone to the wing. That front three would be interchangable and should be fluid. You'd be hoping for Shaw and Valencia/McNair (for some reason not Rafael) to provide the width. There's pace there which is what we're really lacking going forward at the moment. I know it's all just chat here and means nothing, but it's a formation I'd love to see us try.

7241~~~
I, too, would like to see us try it but I no longer trust Rooney with creative responsibilities anymore because of his infuriating tendency of playing his favourite out ball to the right, too many hollywood balls and too many loose touches when his game is completely off. I think Herrera is more daring and has got more variation in his play. Maybe I'm being too harsh on Wayne but it's either we play him upfront/wide or not at all. Rooney in front of Di Maria - Herrera - Young could be deadly and with Carrick and Blind pulling the strings we could be formidable.

7242~~~
He's like Frank Lampard.

7243~~~
That is not a bad thing at all.

7244~~~
Agreed.

7245~~~
He'll have to practice deflecting shots off defenders a bit more though.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7246~~~
He looks good in our current squad because while most of the team passes sideways or backwards, he tends to move things forward. Perhaps that why LvG doesn't like him? Herrera's urgency doesn't fit into the slow, plodding philosophy.

7247~~~
Then maybe we should make Herrera the manager as I would rather watch the football he likes to play.

7248~~~
And to make people believe he's fat.

7249~~~
That would be the difficult part, although I do think he has bulked up slightly.

7250~~~
okay but I meant it the same way like judging his career here, I used an example of today's game but I meant it as a whole.He is hardly hiding and saying he is often invisible in last 30mins is harsh especially for a player like him who is trying to be opposite. He had maybe one or two games where he was say "too tidy" it was rather in games where others stood out or they all didn't well. But it is acceptable. 

So I guess you are wrong it's like saying Van Persie did good job up front this season, he is only slightly off form recently. No he's not it's opposite, his overal performance level dropped and he had glimpses of form in three games and I am generous.

Never mind man I guess it doesn't matter, and if you were pointing out with those "last thirty mins" as one of the reasons why Van Gaal struggle to be convinced with his overall performance, I was always of the opinion that it was the incautious and at times rush risky passing. That it was always one of those two passes which he screws and let the other team to threat with counter but when you've seen Rooney playing there and even Blind making loads of mistakes you must think it must be something else.. I guess it is the overall more adventurous approach to the game which he drilled at Athletic club and which is IMO much closer to the natural and surely closer to United style of play. 

But you are right in one thing and that the last thirty minutes can really turn the look of your whole performance of your game.. It's almost like sometimes it doesn't matter how shite you are in the first half but it's tha last half of our which matters..

7251~~~
Good performance and pleased for him with his goal, he can certainly strike a ball.

7252~~~
He is one of the few who came out of today with real credit. Now everyone is worried he will now get dropped.

7253~~~
I know it was going wide and all, but he does have a habit of popping up in those positions and when laid off to him, striking a nice ball hard and low. Not gonna draw comparisons with you-know-who* but it's something we haven't seen for a while.

*No, not voldemort...

7254~~~
Obviously it's pretty irrelevant but I didn't see any deflection on it? Thought it just went straight in.

7255~~~
I think that's why a lot of fans really resonate with him. We haven't had an all action midfielder like him since, Scholes, really.

7256~~~
It was slight, however much there was on it. It may well have been on target, only seen it twice. But he's done it a few times, always controls the shot well.

7257~~~
What foot was the shot with today? He hit the one against Preston with his left.

7258~~~
Right

7259~~~
The two footed little devil.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Even better.

7260~~~
QPR - right
Leicester - left
Yeovil - right
Preston - left
Swansea - right

Bit of a pattern going on!

7261~~~
He's marching.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7262~~~
Didn't manage to catch the game today but glad to hear he's done well despite the result. How was he deployed and how was his general play aside from the goal?

7263~~~
No headers.

'kin useless. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">Such white text. </span>

7264~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Like it that he can score with either foot though.

7265~~~
It's great that he's comfy on either side, that's for sure!

7266~~~
Did well. The  team wasn't set up properly though and he's ended up on the losing side - ours.

7267~~~
I was really disappointed for him having to lose.

7268~~~
He is a great midfield player, positive, forward thinking, comfortable in tight situations and he has an eye for goal, he is a bit slight but he does not shirk away from the battle, he puts himself about aswell, glad we signed him, pity he is under used.

7269~~~
fixed it <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7270~~~
I wasn't one who was praising him when he was on the bench but he has impressed me since coming back into the team. He won't get dropped. If he does then that would just be a moronic decision. Our MOTM by some distance I thought.

7271~~~
Cleared 1 off the line too don't forget, that's like scoring 2... right? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7272~~~
5 goals and 4 assists in 18 games is very good. The thing that's even more annoying than the fact we don't seem keen on using him is the fact we haven't seen those numbers from a central midfielder for years.

7273~~~
Did miss the game but pleased to hear how he done. Hopefully he has cemented his place in the team and gets a run of games. Like him a-lot, quite frustrating that he hasn't featured as much as he should.

7274~~~
Good performance today, was one of the few players to leave with their head held high. 

I must say I didn't buy into all the hype when he was on the bench. But he has proved me wrong! He has had a positive impact on our attacking play, and puts in a shift defensively.

7275~~~
He's perfect isn't he

7276~~~

7277~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Can you blame him? After a loss you don't think straight. He's a great midfielder for us.

7278~~~
I'd love to see him play for us in a properly set up 3 man midfield, I think a Blind/Schneiderlin/Herrera trio would be pretty damn good.

7279~~~
Well one of them was after the first half, a half in which he was by far our best player, scored a goal and had a clearance off the line. Yet the guy criticized him for a pass that went out of bounds because McNair was sleeping.

7280~~~
If you add Mata into the mix, you'll see that our 2 most productive creators have been bafflingly dropped for large periods so that we can play with 2 clowns upfront and a striker in midfield.

7281~~~
Terrible result, but Ander played quite well. Hopefully he gets more game time.

7282~~~
He's comfortably our best midfielder, and it is absolutely astounding that he isn't in the team every week, never mind the bit-part player he has seemed to become.

7283~~~
The only player that can come out of this game with any credit. Five goals this season, it's a joke that he's been left out the team as many times as he has.

7284~~~
He's everything Cleverley was supposed to be but wasn't. The fact that his ability was so apparent from day one and the fact that his qualities were exactly what this team needed yet the philosopher somehow had other ideas just makes me angry. Can't stand Van Gaal he must go.

7285~~~
It is troubling from a talent evaluation standpoint, for sure. The club wanted Herrera the summer before, Di Maria was a star and possibly just Woodward and with Shaw playing for a mid-table Prem side it seems more likely than not that only Blind (almost definitely) and then perhaps Rojo and Falcao were LVG's signings.

7286~~~
Well if Falcao was his signing, he isn't a good judge. He has enough players to get Top 4, if he doesn't it's because he is trying to cram too much in the players head. Footballers like simple systems, he is bloody stat mad. Keep it simple.

7287~~~
We could do with another decent midfielder so that Herrera could play at the tip. I would swap Fellaini and Ander for now.

7288~~~
When Carrick is back fit, that's what I am hoping to see.Blind and Carrick next to each other and Herrera as the 10.

7289~~~
I'm happy we got him, he's an excellent player to be fair. Exactly the type of midfielder we have been craving for, for many years now. He just needs the right balance around him and he will flourish.

7290~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing Blind/Carrick as DM, Herrera as CM and Rooney as a 10 in a 4231 with Di Maria and Young? on the wings.

7291~~~

Nice highlights, not very easy to watch though, like they were filmed through a keyhole.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7293~~~
That is being polite, shit music and badly edited but its the only one on youtube!

7294~~~
I like how noticeably vocal he is. Not afraid to tell players what to do and where to be. The more of that the better.

7295~~~
Ander and Blind are two parts of a midfield 3, we just need the final piece to move to 4-3-3.

7296~~~
An on form ADM would certainly be a huge plus. The problem is with Blind though, he's very limited

7297~~~
Daley blind is the kind of player you want in a holding midfielder, reads the game well, good tackling and keeps it simple perfect in a 4-3-3
4-3-3
you have Blind holding, keeping it simple and the team ticking along
Herrera, box to box
Di Maria, the one to "attack the space" and drive the team forward

7298~~~
I think his best qualities are perfect for a #6 role though, it's just we isolate him way too much with the diamond formation.

Personally I think that is too weak for the PL. Ideally for me Ander is the AM in a 3 man midfield, he'll do plenty of work and has the superior discipline to Di Maria, but you wont want him to restrcited. That is where a box to box like Schneiderlin or Allan or Naingolaan comes into to complete the midfield.

7299~~~
I like him, but I do think he is a better #10 than he is a CM.
I think his defensive qualities could be better

7300~~~
Yet Ander just started 2 games, we conceded 3 and dropped 5 points. 

You've definitely proven your point, he's made all the difference. Damn Van Gaal and his philosophy

7301~~~
You're not seriously putting that down to Herrera, are you?

7302~~~
Im just saying I don't expect that outcome with a more pragmatic approach we were playing before.

Although you have to ask why Herrera wasn't on Shelvy for the cross to Ki. When he moves into that channel he's his responsibility.

7303~~~
how did we drop 5 points when he started his first game this year in the PL?

Well he attacked Taylor, nobody covered Shelvey after that. Van Persie arrived too late. It was basically 3 against 2.

7304~~~
1. Eh?

2. Shelvy is his responsibility there 100%. He ran to the thrower instead of the man that was free in a very dangerous area and gave Shelvy plenty of time to whip a dangerous cross in. He can take a lot of blame for that. If he had closed down Shelvy they would have had to do a lot still to work an opportunity. As it was he gave him a free cross and they scored from it.

7305~~~
1. i dont understand what you mean with 5 points in 2 starts? It is his first start since December i think in the league. The other games he started were FA cup games.

2. He went to the thrower after the ball was back to him. He was initially with Shelvey, then Taylor received the ball back after the throw in and he ran to him to close him down. He would be free to cross it too. He is mostly to blame for that leaving Shelvey that open, however our organisation from set pieces in general is pathetic and it could have been prevented if other players helped out and showed some awareness insetad of standing somewhere in no mans land.

7306~~~
Has he got a chant yet?

I propose something with the tune from Abracadabra.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QyoRzZrF00?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Ander, Ander Herrera...

7307~~~
I am with Pexbo with this one and mentioned it a few posts above, and so that I don't come across as saying this suddenly on the back of this Swansea game, I also said the exact same thing about his defensive qualities in the Mata thread a few days ago.

Going forward he does look comfortable, and with the ball at the feet, he does look composed, but when defending, he doesn't seem to mark, or follow a runner, and it keeps giving teams space to play with. He is also rash with his challenges.

I think he is a better #10 than he is a CM. In the summer, that was banded about a lot, especially with the Spanish based English reporters, but I think we was so happy to see a midfielder come in, we ignored their opinions on that part of his game.

7308~~~
I think the fact he covers a lot of ground and will fly into a tackle means people think he is better at defending then he really is too.

7309~~~
He's not good enough. He does some flashy things but defensively he's a nightmare.

I don't think any of our Spaniards will still be at the club come September 2016.

7310~~~
Explain how he's a nightmare defensively.

7311~~~
He vanishes in midfield? He didn't close down Shelvey, he has little to no positional awareness, he chases the ball like a dog in the park rather than marking his man. He's fun to watch in attack, but he's criminally bad at controlling the midfield. He'd probably be fine as the advanced member of a midfield three with two people who understand defending behind him, but we're not playing that system and he's not good enough to force us to change our whole tactical setup to accomodate him.

7312~~~
I'll agree with those who are saying he looks more like a #10 than an #8. I'd probably prefer him and Fellaini swap positions to be honest.

7313~~~
Makes too much sense to play players in their correct positions.

7314~~~
He's scored 5 and assisted 4 in 18 appearances, and people are worrying about his defensive contribution.

With numbers like that Van Gaal should be looking to play him in a role where his defensive work is minimised anyway.

7315~~~
Good job he took his defensive responsibilities early on or we would have been 1-0 down straight away. Pity the defence don't do their job properly.

7316~~~
Some people think he's better as CM, some as AM, so what is his correct position exactly?

7317~~~
He's played both I presume at Bilbao, LvG thinks he's a No. 10. He has said he has been a No. 8. If he keep scoring goals we could put him at No. 9. Couldn't be worse than what's been there.

7318~~~
If he'll be played as a nr. 10 we need a new CM I think. Well we need it nevertheless.

7319~~~
We definitely need someone in that midfield, either to compliment Herrera or as you say he moves to No. 10, to replace him. It's who they chose is the question.

7320~~~
At Bilbao he played as an attacking midfielder, the most advanced one. In the Spanish system, it’s an hybrid between 10 and 8… He was really the creator of the game, and didn’t control the tempo. I watched a lot of Bilbao last year, and when he was playing there, he was quick and aggressive when they lost the ball. I think that it’s maybe his best skill. He was so good at that. Bilbao played really good football last year and he was the first, always, to do the pressing and an effective one.

I would think that he’s more Iniesta than Xavi in his style. But nevertheless, he’s our best midfielder.

7321~~~
I agree with all that, but if he's better in more forward position we need a new CM as I said. Esp given his defensive work. I wouldnt say he's a disaster defensively but he tends to go forward so we need another player with blind to watch his back.

7322~~~
I think in some time and some starts he may be as important to us as Silva is for City. Not saying he's a similar style of player but the contribution he's making to our under performing team is excellent. I'd be tempted to build to team around him next year. He should be starting every game at this point.

7323~~~
Totally agree with that. He his chasing opposition very high on the pitch and that’s why he’s not a deep lying midfielder, and maybe why he needs two player behind him, but I won’t make him my number 10 because he’s not a Mata type neither. He’s made to play high in a 4-3-3, but the creativity should not come essentially from him. He would thrive with Guardiola in his system when the creativity comes from the perpetual movements and the talent of wide men (including full backs)

To be honest, I would love to see him in a classic 4-3-3 with Carrick and another midfielder behind him (Whether it’s Pogba Strootman etc…a pure 8) and moving Di Maria out wide.

I think that’s an issue like Di Maria, to be in full potential, he has to be covered from every side to be in top condition,.

7324~~~
Carrick and not Blind? 

Yeah, people were talking a lot LVG's preferred formation is 4-3-3. Blind or Carrick with Herrera and another pure 8 and with ADM and another winger ( nani or a new one ) on the wings sounds nice tbh.

7325~~~
It's actually really confusing for me to be honest. On the one hand I really like him. He's technical, he scored a goal, and he always looks and plays like he cares.

One of the few decent performers last match, but on the other hand I felt he wasn't exactly brilliant. Obviously because we lost, but I could see a Swansea fan making a good case for Shelvey having a better game than Herrera, which is quite telling I think.

And then if you look at Rooney's best game in midfield, he scored two against Newcastle + an assist and also added much better defensive work than Herrera. Could almost understand why Van Gaal preferred Rooney there.

Switching to a classic 4-3-3 with Blind as #6, Herrera as an #8, that's a Tottenham level midfield core imo, don't see us competing for a league or CL title with those two in the centre next year. Herrera with his creativity and energy would make a very good #10 in a classic 4-3-3. But then again, Rooney has offered even more goals, assists and again defensive help when he played as a #10 over the years.

Maybe Rooney as a striker with Herrera behind him, Herrera deserves the #10 spot over Mata I think, he contributed just as much in terms of goals and assist in less games, and offers a bit more allround than Mata too.

7326~~~
Yeah but you're extremely biased towards Rooney. You've been coming up with that Newcastle game for a month, even though he's had a few terrible performances in midfield since. One game against opposition in shocking state doesn't make him a midfielder.

7327~~~
Well sure, and maybe that;s not justified since Rooney hasn't actually scored from open play since that Newcastle game. Maybe Herrera is in better form and therefore a better option. But still, if you look at Herrera's best three games in midfield this season compared to Rooney's best three games in midfield, I would probably say Rooney performed better.

7328~~~
What you have to remember with Rooney is that he could hit a brick wall physically pretty quickly. He has been playing since he was 16, that is a long time. We are seeing it with RvP, when it happens it can happen almost overnight.

7329~~~
Rooney has had far more 5/10 performances in midfield than 8/10 performances, Herrera is more consistent as in he won't really be 9/10 or even 8/10 most of the time but he won't be 5/10 either. He needs to be better defensively and more aware but that should come with games, Spanish midfielders are well known for this and at Athletic he was good at controlling the midfield.

Rooney isn't a midfielder.

7330~~~
Caving in and giving him a 4.5-year contract last year was a blunder IMO, there's no way he'll be worth his wage 2 years down the line. Still a good player but nowhere near the world class level he's supposed to be.

7331~~~
That was Moyes keeping him onside. If SAF was still there he might have been out of the door. I don't even consider Wayne a captain in this team. We need someone who talks and guides players through games, we have an inexperienced defence and a lot of new players who have never played in this country before. The all need guidance, a cool head, not someone who just runs about a lot.

7332~~~
Not a fan of Rooney?

7333~~~
lol

7334~~~
Not entirely, more to do with his hissy fits over money.

7335~~~
Everybody was praising him on Saturday, today it's appears to be give Ander a kicking day. Poor lad. He was our best player on Saturday, so why not pick on the forwards who couldn't hit an elephants arse with a banjo.

7336~~~
The strange thing is that LvG's preferred formation is supposed to be 433 with that lined up as something like 42121. I think Herrera would do fine defensively is he was paired with Carrick or Blind in that midfield 2 or played ahead of another pairing as the 1. He's played in both those positions with Athletic, particularly under Bielsa.

The way we're setup at the moment we're expecting him to cover the fullback, cover Blind and push upfield. If he looks like he's chasing around it's probably because he's the only one in roughly the right area to do it - too much width and too much depth.

7337~~~
Saturday was the first Premier League game he's started since December.

7338~~~
Top post. Been banging this drum for years.

SAF had him halfway out the door, and what do we do? Give him a contract renewal, an even larger wage, the captaincy, and let him start every game.

Herrera had a good game on Saturday. Not great, but good. And something we haven't had in our midfield for a while- penetration and tenacity.

7339~~~
I may not have the best memory for these sort of things but in which 3 games has Rooney outperformed Herrera?

7340~~~
And we lost as soon as we dropped Falcao to the bench. Definitely must be him who was helping us gain all those wins and draws. Surely you must be wanting him back in the line up now.

7341~~~
Well that depends on what you think are Herrera's best matches. Maybe QPR at the start of the season - he scored a goa. Saturday's Swansea match.

For Rooney in CM I would say scoring against Liverpool, two goals+ assist vs. Newcastle. Against Tottenham we played a very good first half with him in midfield, strikers should've finished that game. All pretty big teams too.

7342~~~
The main criticism for Herrera is that he does not control games enough for us. And in none of the games you mentioned, Rooney helped us to control the games from midfield. We were regularly over ran by Liverpool and that 3-0 scoreline flattered us in the end. Tottenham was one game where we should have it wrapped up in the first half itself but we did not control the game as such, we created a couple of very good chances which RvP fluffed. Again, there is not a single game which Rooney has helped us control from midfield. If we are wanting goals and assists from our midfielders I think Herrera's stats are pretty good and I guess better than Rooney's from midfield positions.

7343~~~
this is a point- a half decent perfomonace from Herrera was still better than what have seen all season.

7344~~~
Also Rojo was very slow closing down Shelvey for his shot. If he had been quicker he might have actually blocked it.

7345~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7346~~~
Blind for me is very limited and if the game doesnt go as he prefers it, he seems lost and disappears. As he did in the last few games. He keeps it neat and tidy, sure, but he could be more dictating, forcing play, inject speed, have a physical presence. In general, he could be more present, too often he's like a passenger

7347~~~
While that may be true, centre backs are usually taught to keep shape and not leave any holes. The shot wouldn't have been a problem apart from the freak deflection!.

7348~~~
Wish we'd had a deflection at the other end. It happens as you say.

7349~~~
It's just our luck isn't it? After basically dominating the game I just knew something would happen like that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Then again we don't ever shoot from long range, so those types of goals won't happen.

7350~~~
I'd like to see a midfield of

Carrick---Blind
----Herrera----

With one striker up top. I think that'd work quite well. AdM and one of Januzaj/Young/Mata on the other flank.

7351~~~
Suprised it hasn't happened this season tbh, seems quite obv

7352~~~
What's odd is that if you look through LVG's discussions on tactics over the years, that kind of 433 with two wide players flanking a striker is his preferred formation. There haven't actually been that many occasions when those three have all been fit at once (any?) but its still odd that he hasn't tried it more with other players. We did play that formation vs Palace, and looked garbage, so maybe that put him off with the current team.

7353~~~
They have, Blind played left back, Carrick CM and Herrera on the bench vs Southampton.
Also I believe they were all fit for QPR too.

7354~~~
It isn’t really odd, if we play that trio in midfield then 2 wingers is a must, so there’s place for one striker only. We play with two, that’s the basic rule this season.  That is also our problem.

7355~~~
I've been hoping for this midfield all season, but as soon as Carrick got fit last time, Blind went to playing in the back 5.

7356~~~
This, plus I think their have been very few opportunities when both Carrick and Blind were fit. And a lack of fit defenders for some of those games meant Blind went into defence.

Would love us to only play one up top and put some actual width on the pitch.

7357~~~
Also no room for Mata in a 4-3-3. Big call leaving out Mata, Falcao and RVP. Not now, but three months ago it would have been.

7358~~~
I actually think Blind's knee injury took him out pretty much as soon as Carrick got fit again.

7359~~~
It's still odd (since our defensive issues) which even makes the insistence on 2 stikers even more odd.

7360~~~
I know you're just joking but there's actually some truth in your first two sentences.

7361~~~
Please explain. Genuinely interested.

7362~~~
Yeah. I said that because if you take a look at our line-ups this season you will see that LvG has tried <i>almost </i>everything. One thing he didn't try though is to play one striker formation. I know it's hard decision on probably 3 of our star players, but either that or we're out of top 4 (and he's out too, probably).

7363~~~
He played it vs Chelsea no? I'm sure he did and it worked quite well.

7364~~~
Yeah that was close, also because Fellaini wasn't a striker back then. Anyway, I hope to see it now that he has decided Falcao failed here and van Persie is injured.

7365~~~
Hopefully he has, I'm not convinced just yet, but we'll find out soon enough.

7366~~~
my thoughts on Herrera are does he really fit in a title winning team? If we play 4231 he can only play as a number 10. He's not strong enough to play in the two with the players we have. Is he good enough to play as a ten? Probably not for a team who wants to win the league.

If we play 433 can he really play effectively in the middle 3? Probably not as a deeper lying midfielder so he again would have to play higher up, as our main source of creativity. Not sure he is good enough for that.

If he plays deeper in a two then he needs someone stronger than him, more mobile than him, who can really boss a game. So not Blind basically. Are we going to replace Blind over Herrera? Probably not.

I honestly don't see where or how he fits into our team if we want to win the league.

I like him but i just don't think he fits at a club this size. If we stick with him i think we'll be accepting less than the best.

7367~~~
Bizarre logic.  Could he fit in your team if you weren't trying to win the league then?  Would you somehow manage to squeeze him in then?

He is a great player - you guys should be playing him every week - but instead you play fellaini...  Hoof ball united.  Such a shame

Herrera played great earlier in the season - what formation were you in then and were you trying to win the league then??

7368~~~
you've missed my point. I don't think he is good enough to play for a team who wants to win the league. hes not a "great" player. Hes probably a good one who doesn't really excel at anything. He wouldn't get in Chelsea or Man Citys teams, not even close, so hes not good enough to play for a team who are serious about winning the league. He wouldn't get in Arsenals or Liverpools either probably.

7369~~~
Quite bizzare tbh. Out of our CMs he is the one that needs to be kept IMO. Him not being strong enough to play in the 2 I also don't buy. What makes him not strong enough but Blind strong enough?

7370~~~
He will be fine in midfield three, as long as we manage to play front three capable of creating something on their own. Right now our midfield has to both create and score it seems.

7371~~~
Not sure where you're getting this from, neither of them have been starting that much recently, though both have had a big impact on the games they have played. By my reckoning in the 11 games we've played in 2015 Fellaini's started 4 and Herrera 3. In our 2 latest games they've both started.

Anyway it's clear as day that they're very different players with different strengths who play in different positions and that's why they've gotten different amounts of game time. This season Fellaini has been the only real box-to-box midfielder we've had whereas Herrera has been behind the likes of Mata and AdM to play in his preferred AM role. I think most would agree that Mata is a better pure #10, and Di Maria a better attacking midfielder so whilst it's disappointing to see Herrera being a marginal figure this season, I can understand why its happened.

7372~~~
so only great players win the league then? silly notion

I'm not a great authority on Herrera from his days at Bilbao but in his time at United he has been very impressive and who knows what he can achieve

It's a wonder players like Butt, Anderson, Cleverley, Fletcher won PL medals

7373~~~
I like Herrera and I think he's got a great future here but he's a strange player and I can sort of see where <a class="username" data-user="81303, @nokillingmoths" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81303/">@nokillingmoths</a> is coming from. He defends more than your average #10 but isn't as productive and he's more creative than your average CM but not as defensively capable. Normally I'd say give him an attacking role in a 3-man midfield but we have Di Maria there and Herrera isn't at that level. He's not comfortable enough defensively to be a staple as a box-to-box midfielder (except against weaker teams) and, coming from someone who's watched him at Athletic, he's not really shown anything thusfar in his career to suggest that he's capable of contributing as a #10 to anywhere near the extent Mata has in the past.

Having said that I definitely think he's good enough for a top team, but perhaps not as a nailed-on starter. I can see him filling in as needed in various midfield roles whilst never quite making any one position his own. Obviously I'd loved to be proven wrong though, if he keeps contributing like he is now he'll easily break his career best combined assists/goals tally (5 each) this season despite hardly playing. Maybe the confidence of coming to a huge club is going to see him take a step up.

7374~~~
I can't buy into your thinking here, nokillingmoths.

If you're trying to build the all world XI, you can go ahead and scoot past Ander Herrera.  

But the truth is that most prem clubs will sit and counter on us, and having Herrera set up with Blind or Carrick in front of the back four makes perfect sense.  Herrera can also play in the 10 position, although I really do like Rooney there, provided we someday have a proper striker.

Herrera is a shoe-in for almost formation we set up in, as he's actually pretty decent defensively.  The more difficult question for this discussion is Mata, whom I rate highly but it may just not work out for him here -- unless Rooney somehow finds his pace and power again as a 9.  I don't think that's going to happen but if it does we're suddenly a more intriguing side that's only a massive central defender and a RB (seems Louis has given up Rafael) away from competing for the prem trophy.  And if today's renewed rumors of Bale to United have any truth in them, we're suddenly a favorite for the prem trophy.

De Gea
RB Hummels Rojo Shaw
Herrera Blind/Carrick
Bale Mata Di Maria
Rooney

Again, I don't think Rooney has it anymore to be a 20+ goal scorer but I could be wrong.  I also don't see a Bale signing in the cards either.  But the point is that Mata is a bigger question mark for us than Herrera.  

Were we on the cusp of winning the CL trophy but were a player short, I could see the argument for an upgrade on Herrera.  But it's pretty safe to say that we're not going to be on the cusp on winning the CL trophy next season.  We have to improve on the greatest areas of need first before trying to upgrade on players who've actually been pretty productive for us this season.  Those areas are:

Striker
Central Defender
Right Back
A second box to box midfielder.

I'd love to see us bring in a proven, all world midfielder like Pogba or Vidal, but I just don't see it happening.  If Pogba or Vidal were possibilities but it would mean saying adios to Herrera or Mata, it would have to get done.  But between the two Herrera would be the one I would keep.

7375~~~
I would love for our tactics to play to his strengths.. 

                                 Ddg

Rafael       Rojo       Smalling     Shaw 

                           Carrick

           Herrera                       Blind 

Di Maria                                    Young
                          Rooney         

But this will never happen..

7376~~~
This is basically my point. I don't want a worlds best 11 like someone implied but we are Manchester United, we should be aiming higher than him in my opinion. Hope to be proven wrong though.

7377~~~
He has what? 6 goals and 5 assists this season? He's definitely productive enough from the #10 role. He isn't a natural attacking midfield nor a central midfielder but he's sort of inbetween - akin to Oscar.

7378~~~
You must be joking, right? This is the same team which plays Jordan Henderson and Joe fkng Allen in midfield.

7379~~~
Oscar! Chelsea are in the driving seat of a title challenge and he is been their No.10 for most of their games, what are his numbers? Ander can obviously be our No.10 and he would aid us in intangibles such as pressing, great link up play etc.

7380~~~
I'd say we already have 'aimed higher', in the sense that we've signed Di Maria who is probably the best in the world in the role Herrera is most suited to (a dynamic and creative offensive midfielder). I actually think Herrera is perfect for our squad. At the very least he's a very good player who can fill in across the midfield, quality midfield depth is something we were desperately lacking until this season.

I get where you're coming from but the kind of productivity Herrera's shown this season is far from the norm for him - prior to moving to United he'd assisted something like 20 goals in his last 170 league starts.Like I said above, I hope his improved productivity this season is a sign that the move to a bigger club is pushing him up to a higher level than he was at previously, but I'm not as convinced as the majority of the caf. 

I've seen a lot of Athletic over the last few years and it's a little strange to see people saying he's more creative than the likes of Mata. Put it this way - many on here gave Mata stick last season for not being creative enough, but in 15 games for us he created exactly the same number of goals as Herrera did in the entire season as a #10 for Athletic.

7381~~~
MOTM by a country mile. Set the tempo from which we got the result.

7382~~~
Really impressive in a fairly average performance (until the penalty) and it is good to see him proving that he was not overhyped whilst not in the team (a la Kagawa).

I hope to see him being a mainstay in the team now.

7383~~~
The only person more adventurous with their passing than Herrera is di Maria. He's like a breath of fresh air in a team of players permanently playing safe sideways balls. 

That said, I think some on here overrate him just because he is the only player who passes forwards in the final third.

7384~~~
He's not the best cm in the league, but I really believe he could turn out to be one of the best if he keeps on progressing in a stable team in a consistent position. My fear for him is that LvG might find him too adventurous and "wasteful"

7385~~~
Not MOTM for me, but played really well. Again he seems like the only player who's passing and moving. 

I think it was Herrera who made that run where he passed it back and forth between 2 other players, I'm not too sure though.

7386~~~
I think he's absolutely class. Feisty and adventurous.

7387~~~
Excellent again, always looking to move the ball and mostly forwards to. He has a bit of steal about him too, he's not the biggest but you're not going to brush him off the ball. I think he's key from now on if we're going to push on a get the champions league spot, great to watch.

7388~~~
We're a better team for having him in the side. A good albeit rather reserved performance. He can do the whole 'ball retention' thing if he wants, although I think that limits him somewhat.

7389~~~
I think he was great today, in that deeper role, much better than Blind, simply because he's better footballer. He's faster, and his defensive abilities are really underrated. So many good little interceptions and tackles won as well as fantastic passing accuracy. No doubt by far our best midfielder.

 I like his poaching as well, I guess if given full season he will get himself some good numbers in terms of goals and assists..

7390~~~
He's exactly what we love of a midfielder and he keeps on improving. Keep up the good work.

7391~~~
Looked great today, total control in the 2nd half. Nice cross for the penalty. Kept it simple most of the time, i guess that is what Louis wants.

7392~~~
Cementing his place in the team. Needs a dynamic player like Di Maria to play next to him centrally
.

7393~~~
His balance is superb, which is typical for a Spanish midfielder. The way he takes the ball in motion without breaking stride is excellent. He can keep the ball moving without slowing down play. He never seems to need to stop and take a touch, and he can take his first touch in almost any circumstance. Class. He did the role Rooney has been playing in midfield much, much better, and as a result our play was much quicker.

Seeemed to drop deeper than usual today, and looked very comfortable alternating with Blind considering how Sunderland's midfield often get at their opponents, they coped well and bossed the game.

7394~~~
Well done my sweet prince. We look so much better with him on the pitch. He gets involved in attack and defense and is not afraid to take risks either.

7395~~~
Class. Best midfielder at the club by a mile. Arguably our best signing this summer as well, in terms the consistent high level he puts out when on the pitch actually. Close to scoring for the third match in a row!

7396~~~
Another good game from him. Hopefully LVG keeps him in the team for the upcoming games.

7397~~~
Good performance, looks like he'll be starting for the foreseeable future... Until he has a bad game or Mata has a brilliant substitute performance anyway. That's the trend this season with van Gaal's selection policy.

7398~~~
He's definitely adapting his game to suit what Van Gaal wants.

7399~~~
Great player and a great performance today. I love him.

7400~~~
I love the guy. Another good performance from him and he brings a great deal of balance to our midfield with his forward passing and pressing.

7401~~~
He was my MOTM pick, he played a very composed and measured game today and picked the right moments to go for the attacking pass. He and Blind set the tempo and we are clearly a better football team with him in the side.

7402~~~
I think the same, I also think we have so many passengers in the team who can play good but with Herrera we finally have some player who raises our game.

Agree with the latter statement too, he showed he can retain the ball really well, better than Blind IMO if he wants but sometimes it's shame we stick to this possession tactics too much so he can't express himself thoroughly

7403~~~
Had a very good game once again, and looks to pass the ball forward rather than pick the safe pass backwards or sideways.  Also his movement on the ball seems quite impressive.  At last a midfielder that can actually move and dribble.  However, he still needs to improve to reach the level we aspire to play at.  I'm sure playing like this is good enough for Bilbao but if we are to challenge we need him to improve. He has all the potential to reach a very high level, he just needs to work hard.  Also shows commitment to the club.

7404~~~
He's fantastic, not that there was any doubt. Valencia could do a lot worse than take tips from Herrera on how to improve his left foot.

7405~~~
Very tidy, should start every match.

7406~~~
A true CM and he needs to be our first choice there. I felt the players actually had confidence with Blind and Herrera in the middle which has been missing for a long time.

Why did you not do this months ago LvG?

7407~~~
Herrera has to be one of the first names on the squad sheet from here on out, although we'll see what Louis does once Carrick is fully fit.

7408~~~
This is why Herrera shouldn't have been repeatedly left out of the starting XI in the first place. His all purpose dynamism and creative threat evidenced from the Zaragoza and Athletic Club days is invaluable, especially since the rest of our midfield-attack progression looks rather static and bereft of ideas at times.

Now that he's been reinstated, it's time to drum up the Mata and Rafael agenda. Both of those players should ideally be part of the starting XI when fit. Seems a bit discriminatory that certain players have a carte blance to step into the team and soon as they regain match fitness but Rafael is being completely frozen out.

7409~~~
Should have pulled the trigger quicker at the edge of the box a few times. Had opportunities to have a shot but took a touch or took an extra touch that weren't needed. I think having the winger out there helps him a lot too as he doesn't have to worry as much about to trying to cover all that ground and can focus more centrally. Glad he is getting played more.

7410~~~
Is he left or right footed?

7411~~~
right footed.

7412~~~
Once again showed how ridiculous it has been to not start him regularly. It's like Van Gaal was purposely sabotaging his own team's results for some sort of petty personal problem, whatever it may have been. Not that Van Gaal would ever let petty personal differences or his ego get in the way of a team's best interests...

Herrera is by far our classiest and most adaptable midfielder. He's clearly playing more contained and within himself at the moment, as is Van Gaal's wont, but you still see glimpses of his eye for a pass - something which few of our other players possess.

7413~~~
He was very good today even though it was clear that he was a bit restrained. I think he has the potential to grow into a great little player if he continues to improve steadily. 
I also liked his partnership with Blind and even though they look like they can be carved open with ease, they also have the ability to open up teams and pass them off the pitch. I would like us to try a trio of him, Blind and Carrick for tougher matches as a combination of the Blind-Herrera duo pressing higher up the pitch should tally with Carrick's positioning, sweeping and passing.

7414~~~
There is also the possibility that he has worked on making Herrera a bit more diciplined so he can fullfill the requirements of the #8 role. I think he was much more involved in Building up from deep today than i have seen from him this season, hope he keeps this up.

7415~~~
Gave us a solid base along with blind, i can see van gaal sticking with them two for the forseeable future
Kind of limited him going forward and i still think hes probably more suited to a #10 position but the team as a whole looks better with him as a #8.

7416~~~
The acquisitions of him and Blind are the best thing to happen to our midfield, the past 15 years

7417~~~
His movement, ability to hold the ball in tight spaces, and quick passing really helps Blind out in midfield.  We were able to recycle possession much faster than we usually do and it actually wore Sunderland down, which is what LVG's tactics are designed to do.  

They need a third player who is more defensive that can play at that pace to make us solid, but this should do for the rest of the season.

7418~~~
For games where we're going to dominate possession a Blind - Herrera midfield will work really well, moreso now than that the start of the season where Herrera was taking a few too many risks with his passing and positioning. I'd still be slightly more concerned playing him in a midfield 2 against better teams who'll get more of the ball and attack more often but he's a great option for the majority of our games.

7419~~~
Like him a lot. Wouldn't look at of place in any top team in the world. We are only missing a player to compliment him and Blind.....

7420~~~
Yeah, though hes one played who I would definitely want in bigger games as well. Excelled in them for Bilbao and his energy and general quality would help, though I would have him in a midfield 3 with Carrick and blind or as the attacking midfielder for those games, rather then just being a central midfielder.

7421~~~
Definitely. It's not for lack of effort but he's not a player who you want to rely on too much defensively, better to give him a bit more cover and let him play his game. I can see him being very useful in a kind of Park-esque role in big games when we want a #10 who will also put in a shift or do a job on a deep-lying playmaker, with the bonus that he's better on the ball than Park was (not that he was shabby either at his best)

7422~~~
Yeah, he's not bad defensively or anything, for a creative midfielder he's pretty much as good as you can expect and is an excellent tackler. Just in big games, we need someone more like Carrick to hold his position and keep the defensive shape and organization, but herrera's pressing and eye for a through pass is also very important so he'd still be in. Our defence is very fragile of course, so we need the extra man in midfield like Carrick for when we don't expect to dominate possession. If we had Rio and Vidic at their prime, then we'd be okay with Herrera-Carrick or herrera Blind I think

I honestly can't believe he's spent most of the season on the bench, with Rooney playing ahead of him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Its incredibly frustrating on so many levels.

7425~~~
The bolded statement is a big reason Chelsea suffers with Fabregas and Matic in the middle. We cannot make the same mistake as they do. Blind and Herrera are quite aggressive off the ball, and both will get themselves dragged out with their aggressive style. For this reason, we can't go with Blind and Herrera unless Blind plays a much more disciplined defensive game (which he definitely can).

Still, though, I am happy to see Herrera prove that he isn't some defensive liability from midfield. When playing in central midfield, Herrera showed a great amount of discipline and provided good defensive support for Blind. He wasn't gung ho in his defensive approach, and he did a good job in recovering the ball as well as slowing down Sunderland. He does show some defensive awareness and a decent reading of the game ahead of him, but I don't think it's enough for him to play in a midfield 2 base against top teams. However, he can improve on this like Modric, Pjanic, Fernandinho, Rakitic, and Gundogan did. If he cannot do this, then he doesn't have the physical qualities to make up for that, which players like Nainggolan, Ramires, Fernando, etc., have.

7426~~~
More than capable of being the player who makes the team tick.

Hope to God now van Gaal keeps him in the side.

7427~~~
Him and Blind together might just be THE perfect pairing in midfield

7428~~~
I think they are good but I guess Blind is not on the same level as Herrera. I can see some strong pacy agile defensive beast midfielder next to Herrera who with his teammates upfront are creative enough to score tons of goals, some defensive midfielder who will shield the defense. Blind showed not for the first time lack of pace and strength today, not that he wasn't good overall but I really feel we must buy another better midfielder to complement Herrera. We don't need playmaker and Blind is not even a brilliant playmaker. 

I guess someone like Matic would make sense but I wouldn't mind even Wanyama type of player. That would make our defense much more solid. That KOdogbia guy looked good against Arsenal in CL pacy, strong, not bad on the ball either..

7429~~~
Sublime

7430~~~
Another very good performance, just what you want.

7431~~~
That was beautiful.

He constantly does little things like that, clever little touches or flicks, that largely go unnoticed. Such a clever player.

7432~~~
Another good performance, which hopefully means he's a regular starter for us now. 

Fan favourite.

7433~~~
I'd also like to see a Carrick, Blind & Herrera MF trio. Think it would make us very solid in MF and we would control a lot of the games.

7434~~~
Tough to find someone with mobility and passing skills at the 6, though. But I agree. The big Sunderland chance Wickham had would have been prevented by a pacier DM.

We're in a good position here. You need 2 DM's in the squad, preferably that can play together when you want to sit with a double pivot deep in big games away or start 3 and win the midfield battle. Blind starts this year and the next with Carrick backing him up and then we buy another DM and let Carrick leave in the summer of 2016. Whether that's a younger player with potential or a proven starter depends on how Blind progresses over the next year and a half.

7435~~~
I have the same vision as you in terms of the 'agile, all action type midfielder' complementing Hererra in a 2 man midfield base. I do like Blind though who can play in a number of positions for us. I don't want to think of him as a mere 'squad player' but if we do get this B2B player then Blind may just become that.

7436~~~
I agree. Blind is good but I don't quite rate him as highly as I do Herrera. That's not a slight on Blind as I think they're both great acquisitions and it's not either/or between the two.

I still feel Blind at left back with that creative/combative/beast midfielder alongside Herrera could work wonders for our team.

7437~~~
This is what i want against Liverpool and Chelsea away and maybe against City at home. Solid midfield of Carrick, Blind and Herrera with two quick wingers and Rooney uptop. Mind you i think against lesser sides it's too defensive.

7438~~~
Yeah would be great to see in the big games, especially away from home. 

Naturally you can be more adventourous when playing against a side in the bottom half.

7439~~~
I think this will be addressed in the summer rather waiting on Blind's progress. I hope so!<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7440~~~
He has shown he can adapt. I reckon he will have great future here under van Gaal. Not so sure about Mata.

7441~~~
Some of you are wishing for a certain DM, but how many do have the distribution skills of Blind? When teams park the bus against us, Wanyame for example has no use. You need a player who can distribute the ball to the forwards, raise the tempo with forward passes and makes himself available for the midfielders to increase the amount of options. Look at Barcelona with Busquets, or Bayern with Alonso/Schweini. But which DM's are you lot thinking of, and dont come up with Carvalho or something.

7442~~~
Blind is not a problem against teams who park the bus against us though. I wouldn’t like to leave him on his own against better midfielders though.

7443~~~
Ah, think the same about that, even Mou choses to play Ramires in tougher matches and he's got Matic. Blind/Carrick should be the duo in those matches with attacking players in the attacking positions.

7444~~~
Good game from Herrera. He has been good since he came in. Well done to him. Hopefully he keeps the midfield spot, is certainly better than Rooney there.

7445~~~
I agree, that it isn't easy to find the right solution, just because Blind's distribution and calmness in possession is so good. The only thing lacking is that the 'powerhouse' aspect.......That's not being picky, but just reflecting the demands of certain games. Like I said before, it's not necessarily a matter of replacing him in a midfield 2 but perhaps complementing Herrera and Blind in a trio where needed. I really thought Strootman was perfect for this role but that would be a no go now with his ongoing knee problems. Pogba would be perfect, Lars Bender (Leverkusen), Schneiderlin are others that come to mind......

7446~~~
We need at least one wide attacker, a CB and a RB more right now and more importantly, Carrick is apparently on the verge of signing a 12 month extension. 

No real sense in us doing that with Carrick unless we're holding off for a year and considering Blind's rapid climb and relative age as a DM (It's a late-peaking position, he has really only had 1.5 full time seasons there and the fans at Ajax thought he was shite until 2 seasons ago when he jumped up a level or three). I think the case for waiting a year is stronger unless Javi Martinez or Mascherano wants to come here or we're pretty sure we've found the next one.

7447~~~
I suppose timing is debatable. I can see your reasoning though, and agree CB is THE priority. Personally, I'd reinforce central midfield now. Carrick is a fabulous football player but 1 year contract extension or not, if we get the chance to establish a long term midfielder partner for Herrera/Blind then we should seize the chance. He is not going to be around too much longer.  Rooney or Fellaini in midfield (starting) for the odd game is acceptable, but if they were to play there next season more often than that, then I will say that would be a result of bad planning. (ref: physicality in midfield)

7448~~~
He did well today and have a typically tidy performance which I'm happy about. I think that pretty much sums Blind and Herrera up though currently, tidy. It's still a level below that of our rivals and as has been mentioned, it's not a midfield you'd play against elite sides. It's an improvement on what we've been used to in recent years though so I'm happy enough.

7449~~~
Blind's improvement, Herrera's class. I guess he would thrive in high-line counter-attacking team. He adapted well to our possession game unlike dimaria but he can certainly play more adventurous football than with this tidy approach which is set by the tactics. Best buy of the summer and best player in the team. I guess best player of MUFC would walk into any side in the world.

Anyway long way to go and surely space for improvement for Ander. I think Liverpool game will be a big test for him.

7450~~~
Well it certainly suits him more than Di Maria I agree and he's much more adaptable in terms of style of play. Best player in the side? Could walk into any side of the world? If that's what you meant regarding Herrera then let's not get ahead of ourselves, apologies if I've misunderstood.

7451~~~
I was sure this would be brought up. Well he does that often, but it's pretty effective, so I can't blame. How many midfielders have got that sort of awareness? There aren't too many.

To me, it looked like he was adapting his game to meet Lvg's expectations. I believe he should be his usual creative self; that's his greatest strength IMO. He still had a very good game, though.

7452~~~
Herrera would probably walk into any side in the premier league though, bar Chelsea as they have Fabregas. He's definitely good enough for a top team, though you wouldn't play a midfield duo of him and Blind against a top team I'd agree. Anyways, there's not many midfield duo's capable of playing against top teams now though. Against big teams, teams generally go for 3 man midfields.

7453~~~
Cmon mate, Chelsea, Arsenal and City have starting 11s that Herrera would not make. He's a good player though and he can definitely be an asset to us, which is all I really care about right now.

7454~~~
IMO the third player needs to be someone like Schneiderlin or Nainggolan who can defend from higher up on the pitch so that Blind doesn't have to cover acres of space.  Blind could play as a #8, but I think it would be a waste considering how good he is at building the play from a deeper position.

7455~~~
Verratti. One can dream.

7456~~~
He'd definitely get into City's side. Unless you consider one of Fernando, Fernandinho or Milner a better player? Because that's who they have in center midfield... He'd be in and out of Chelsea's team probably, wouldn't be a starter though I think Mourinho would really like him because of his work rate and pressing. As for Arsenal, well it depends on how they line up. Cazorla isn't really a center mid yet plays there often, and Herrera is a better player then Wilshere and IMO at the same level as Ramsey. He wouldn't start for every team in the world but he'd definitely be a great choice as a squad player at the very least for any team IMO.

7457~~~
Yaya, Lampard, Fabregas, Ramires, Ramsey, Cazorla. Those are the players that would mean Herrera wouldn't be particularly needed in these sides, for one reason or another.  He's on the same level as some of them don't get me wrong, but in terms of ability he's not good enough to force them out of the side based on what we've seen so far. He's got the potential to change that though once we improve the players he's playing with and allow him to flourish.

7458~~~
Lampard? He's 36 years old, capable of popping up with a goal here and there but he's far from good enough to start consistently these days. Ramires is awful. Toure is obviously a class above, and Fabregas as well. Cazorla is more of an attacking midfielder anyways but I don't think there's anything between Herrera and Ramsey. Anyways, it's all opinions, but I genuinely think there's only a few midfielders in the league who are better then him at their best, that being Fabregas, Matic and Yaya Toure. Cazorla as well if you count him as one.

7459~~~
In the last few games he was been quality, exactly what you want from a Central Midfielder. However some big games coming up and that's where we will find out whether he's worth the money we paid for him.

7460~~~
Yaya and Fabregas keep him out of the side. With Yaya a permenant fixture, they only really need a Lampard that can keep the ball and score from deep every now and again, he doesn't need to play consistently (bar ACON). Chelsea would always play Fabregas deep unless it's a big fixture, which we've already established that Herrera isn't suited for in a midfield two which is where Ramires comes in. With Ramsey and Cazorla, is there anything Herrera can offer that they can't would you say? 

In summary, I do think he's a good player that can do a job in most sides. He is a level below the elite midfielders that play for the best sides in similar roles; Yaya and Fabregas in terms of the PL.

7461~~~
Well, for one, Ramires is shite.

7462~~~
Reading the post above your one will explain why Ramires would be a preferred option for Chelsea.

7463~~~
I'd always start him. He's one of those players that the team plays better with.

7464~~~
Missed the game today but from reading the comments he did well again. I'm just so glad he's back in favour because for me we always look better with him in the side.

7465~~~
I somewhat agree. If we're not buying a completely static DM I'd be fine with just selling Fellaini, as his value will be as high as it's ever going to be, then making that guy Herrera's backup and Blind's backup.

Hell, even if we did buy a proper DM, we could still sell Fellaini and make Blind the backup for Herrera for a season as the #8. Might even get Pereira on the field a few games when we're just looking for someone to move around and pass or play a 4-1-4-1 type thing.

7466~~~
He is such a good player.. scares the shit out of me that LVG froze him if that is indeed the case. He is technically and in terms of intelligence on the ball better than anyone else in the squad bar Blind.. anyone can see that.

I always said thought someone like Herrera would excel under Mourinho and was glad we got this guy over Fabregas. The latter is more proven but Herrera has much better energy, mobility and will go on to be the better signing in my opinion. 

He needs to be supported by a top DM and a Barkley type attacking mid. Verratti Herrera  and Pogba would be a nice mix.. something along those lines.

7467~~~
So who is the best player in our team? I found the best players the ones who raise the whole game of the team. I can't see any player doing it, maybe apart Smalling and Herrera the midfielder can affect the game more generally..

Obviously it can sound really premature the conclusions I made but we still don't realize how good player we have. He's gem. He's no Ronaldo but what he does he does brilliantly and as I said he would excel in other team's more direct tactics. He's brilliant for Bilbao in 4-3-3 quick counter attacking football and hopefully we will soon quicken our play so he can show his massive potential. The same goes with diMaria who would be utilized certainly better than keeping the ball.

And when you look at diMaria who was arguably one of the best players in the world, Herrera has him in his pocket now. I always thought the best footballers are the ones who can adapt their game. Nevertheless we will see as the time goes. But I guess he's the most important player in our team now and on

7468~~~
In terms of ability there's quite a few. In terms of importance to the team currently, De Gea, Smalling and Rooney are at least 3 players I'd have over him. Some people may raise an eyebrow at Rooney considering his recent performances, but I really think we underestimate his influence. He's a player that makes things happen and he's effective, as good as Herrera is, I think he's a player that is complimented by these sort of players rather than one himself.

I like him as a player, and I think it's clear he's our best in terms of intelligent play, decision making and keeping the ball. He's much better than Di Maria in all those aspects but I'm not sure you can conclude that he's a better player overall, even if he's been better so far. I think in terms of personnel, style of play and position, we aren't playing to Di Maria's strengths so it doesn't surprise me a lot that he's performing below par.

I'm looking forward to see what he can do next season in a better, well rounded, more balanced side (touch wood). I just don't like the way we get ahead of ourselves with Herrera though and overrate his ability due to what he's shown. He's a level below being an elite midfielder currently, and I don't mind that, but I'd rather just be happy with what we've got rather than pretending we have someone that we don't.

7469~~~
A subtle but good display from him – again. Very consistent and always seems to be in the right place. Had a tenner on him to score as well at 5/2, but offside!

7470~~~
He's really good at football, and in general... I quite like it when we play people who are really good at football. Next stop, Juan Mata...

7471~~~
Best performance i've seen him as CM. It's very mature, measured and controled display of a midfielder. No headless run, always open up for passes, positionally aware of his CM partner, and knew when to do simple passes. 

Shoot me, but it was the first time I think he's better than Fellaini in midfield.

7472~~~
Very good first half. There were times when he did venture too far forward and not make himself available, for my liking but not that much to take note of tbh. Has been excellent on the ball and love how he manoeuvres and plays those angled and nifty passes. Liking the look of his partnership with Blind so far and his passing consistency has improved considerably as well.

Hopefully Mata comes on to give us another option on the ball and a better incisiveness in the final third. We certainly have been dominating possession and could do with Mata more than Fellaini in this particular game.

7473~~~
Thought that was one of his worst games for us.

7474~~~
Another solid performance, needs to adapt to playing as a #8 in the PL.

7475~~~
Probably, but nobody was great.

7476~~~
I'm a fan but tonight he was too quiet. In games like that, he should be spraying balls around and set the tempo

7477~~~
There were times when I thought he had a decent impact on our play in that he likes to go forward, but he had large spells of the match where I felt he offered very little to us, and he very nearly cost us a goal as well by dithering on the ball.

7478~~~
Spanish Dave was.

Also Herrera is usually the only one that plays well when the rest of the team are playing like idiots so it was noticeable tonight that he dipped.

7479~~~
He played like Cleverly tonight. Not good

7480~~~
You just wonder what instructions they are getting when playing away. The difference from the home and away performances are like chalk and cheese.

7481~~~
Him and Blind played with no urgency or imagination and it fed through the team... The midfield is still a problem.

7482~~~
Cleverley played well last night. He has played well lately, so might have been due a bad one.

7483~~~
Did well, apart form almost gifting them a goal. Not his best game, but I'm still a big fan. Seems to be the only player who wants to keep the ball moving with pace. Liked seeing him organising the defence at set pieces too. Something you;d probably expect Evans or Smalling to be doing, but Herrera kept screaming at Evans for where to be and who to mark.

7484~~~
He was quiet because IMO that's what LvG wants from his midfielders. Keep it simple and pass it wide.

7485~~~
We're they told to be careful. It seems odd.

7486~~~
Looked good in the first half, crap in the second.

7487~~~
I don't get the big deal about him. He's got good qualities to perform well when others are doing well as he can play on the same wavelength (specifically Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj, Young) but the way he gets heralded as someone who should be one of the first names on the team sheet..not for me. At least this season. This is a player who I think Van Gaal is doing the right thing by holding him back and trying to curb some instincts. We can't have Blind doing so much on his own.

7488~~~
I thought he was average in the second half after starting the game reasonably well, I hope LvG doesn't hold that mistake he made against him as all that will do is turn all our players into gibbering wrecks every time they are on the ball.

7489~~~
Maybe we need another like Carrick to sit in there, so Herrera can go forward.

7490~~~
Needs to be braver with his passing. Its his job to feed the attackers early while they are in space. Of course it could be the manager's instructions to retain the ball, but I'd like to see him take more risks while passing the ball. This whole waiting for teams to get organised and then trying to pass through them thing is taking us nowhere.

7491~~~
I think that his best position is simply #10 with much freedom.

7492~~~
He's clearly been told not to be.

7493~~~
I think it is instructions, don't take chances, don't risk losing the ball. That is the one worry I have with LvG and our team.

7494~~~
Which is a major worry, since I think that's the type of player he is. We won't get much out of him if he's having to stifle his style of play.

7495~~~
Big fan of his but he had a poor-ish game today. I'd push him further forward and allow him to take risks for the next game and drop Fellaini for Carrick.

7496~~~
He does offer a bit of dynamism and energy, and we know he can score and create goals as well. Look more dangerous with him in the side than without, although his midfield give-away which almost cost a goal is maybe evidence of why he's not entirely trusted yet.

Still early days in his career here though, and plenty more to come from him, i'm sure.

7497~~~
Agreed on all counts.

7498~~~
Yeap. This is what I reckon as well. Totally different from the Herrera we saw earlier. And surprise surprise, he's now playing a little bit more regularly.

7499~~~
Wouldn't actually be a bad plan, although since he had a fairly poor game and Fellaini was okay, I'd be surprised if we go with it.

7500~~~
He was quiet. Not bad or anything, just subdued I think.

7501~~~
Was average, luckily got away with giving the ball away on the halfway line.

7502~~~
Pretty average today, never tried to find the killer pass and made a mistake that could have costed us the game.  He is not a player to dictate tempo, he is an attacking midfielder wasted at the role assigned by LVG.  That role should have been assigned to Carrick.  However I do think Mata is better at that role than Herrera and LVG seems to even fancy Fellaini at that role just behind the striker using his height to torment defenders

7503~~~
Was a clear foul all day long. Perez came straight through the back of him and never touched the ball, pathetic decision.

7504~~~
Would love to see him in a 3 with Carrick and Blind, it would free him up to do what he does best.

7505~~~
Not to sure could go either way imo, he shouldn't have pondered over the ball so long in that position anyway esp with all our players in their box.

7506~~~
Anybody noticed how 90% of his passes go to Valencia? By some odd reason it really bothers me. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7507~~~
I think players are either too scared to play risky passes because Van Gaal criticize it often or just are urged to play like that. Herrera was too tidy today, he had some good moments and also some really annoying like he could do better with the ball in a creative way. I think he's scared to make a mistake or bad pass, that Van Gaal will be over him and bench him for that.. he's got ability but needs to show more

7508~~~
Herrera in my eyes is doing exactly what van gaal wants. Earlier in the season he was more creative but wasteful, and he kept getting dropped. Recently he's been more tidy but less risky, and he's playing every match.

7509~~~
Was an absurd decision. Michael Owen, the imbecile, acting like it was anything other than a clear foul on BT Sport had me steaming at the ears.

7510~~~
Was alright. Actually a fairly standard performance from him this season. Neat and tidy but a little lightweight. 

That's taking into account his actual performances on the pitch and not the ludicrous hype when he wasn't featuring. Hope that mistake near the end doesn't get him dropped. Would like to see him start the next game. He's allowed a quiet game and generally used the ball well.

7511~~~
Was there ever a worse commentator than Michael Owen, I seriously doubt it.  Would'have preferred to listen to Townsend or Lawrenson any day

7512~~~
He looked tired after about 70 mins, up to that he was excellent, he does the simple things so well, his passing and movement is nearly always forward thinking, where others hide behind players out of possession he dips into advanced pockets as an option to keep it flowing forward, he plays short balls forward in front of players to encourage them on the front foot, it makes a difference.  I wanted to bash him though for not getting rid of the ball quick enough later in the game where they nearly scored out of it, but even then he was unlucky with a bobble and he was fouled but he should know better to play safe when necessary.

7513~~~
I think he's doing well to adjust his game to suit what LVG wants, but at the same time, I think its a bit of a waste of his talents. 

Catch 22 I guess.

7514~~~
Glad I'm not the only one who thought it was a clear foul.

7515~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://instagram.com/p/z0v2GGPAyJ/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://instagram.com/p/z0v2GGPAyJ/</a>

Adnan genuinely looks like a child.

7516~~~
Is it me, or is Herrera's creativity overrated on the Caf? This could be down to Van Gaal's safe approach play, but i'd like to see him attempting more through balls.

People moan at Rooney when he's plays in midfield, due to the amount of times he plays it to the wing and lack of through balls, but to me, this is all i'm seeing from Herrera and Blind. At least Rooney actually tries the occasional ball over the top (Van Persie goal against Newcastle). 

This is not me saying I want Rooney back in midfield, because I don't, I just want to see more risks taken from Herrera, as we saw when Rooney played deeper.

7517~~~
it is just you. Plays adventurous----> bench. Plays safe and cautious-----> starting eleven.

7518~~~
For reasons I don't understand, I cannot imagine what sort of things Adnan and Fellaini talk about.

7519~~~
Poorest game since he returned to the side I feel. He's restricting himself considerably and I agree with the general consensus that it seems to be intentional. He can do the neat and tidy with ease; we need to give him more freedom to create.

7520~~~
I still think that Adnan hangs out with him cause he feels sorry for him, rather than Fellaini believing he's the authority figure in that friendship.

7521~~~
I like carrick and blind, but I think the both of them might be too static to play together.
I would like to see what Herrera can do in the #10 role though, he had a solid game today.

7522~~~
Why get rid of Tom Cleverley then?

7523~~~
Cleverly could do nothing in the midfield. He could barely pass or shoot and his movement was shit.
He was also a coward, hiding from the ball on occasion.


Herrera is none of those things.

7524~~~
I disagree. 

This is not me comparing Herrera and Cleverley before anyone jumps down my throat, but if you told Cleverley to do what Herrera did tonight, and against Sunderland, he would have, in my opinion. Quick passing (short range), constantly on the move, energetic, etc.

7525~~~
If there's one thing we noticed from this match about Herrera, it's his limited range of passing. There were several instances where I noticed that he could play a long diagonal out to Young or di Maria but, instead, opt for a short ground pass. The fact that he always looked for a short pass meant that our tempo and pace was going to be slow.

It didn't help that Fellaini was frequently pushing high up when we had the ball, thus making it difficult for him and Blind to play the ball forward without having it intercepted. Also, his movement and positioning was quite disciplined. It would be difficult to see Herrera really involved in the final third unless we had someone else fill in for him (total football-like).

Having said this, though, he really should work on his range of passing. A greater range of passing would allow him more control over our tempo and build-up speed.

7526~~~
Where he gave it away, it was a clear foul. It certainly wasn't shoudler to shoulder and he was clattered into in his back instead. He was okay but I really don't know why the players are so obviously told to keep the ball over anything. It's possession for the point of just having the ball rather than actually doing anything with it. He'd do much better given a license to be more risky.

7527~~~
In some of our upcoming matches, I feel like a solid base in the midfield would be useful. Especially Liverpool and Chelsea away. Blind can be more mobile, we've seen that from him. He just is usually asked to be a holding mid when he's filling Carricks role like today. Think adding Carrick in there would free them both up a bit and we could see more of their attacking and passing range without having to use someone like Fellaini or Rooney in mf

7528~~~
I see your point....I hope LVG comes to the same conclusion as well.

7529~~~
I thought he did ok. He intercepted a lot of passes it looked like, but ya he was also kinda invisible. In games like this you'd expect a player like him to make the difference. Hopefully he can sort it out and be as creative as he can in games like that.

7530~~~
Exactly. Extremely cautious passing is definetely LvG's instruction.

7531~~~
I watched the match again, and I noticed that Herrera was clearly playing more cautiously than he did in the past couple of matches. The whole team was, to be fair. He was quite cautious in his positioning and only went forward when our wingers got the ball in the final third. His passing was quite good, but the fact that we didn't have a proper #10 made it difficult for him play the ball forward as he only had Rooney to aim for. It didn't help that Newcastle had 11 men behind the ball for much of the match; it meant that playing the ball forward would often result in us losing it, hence why both Blind and Herrera played more safely than they did in the past couple of matches.

7532~~~
I think thats a fair, and good, assessment. He looks like he's playing against his natural instincts, but he is adapting to the LVG's methods and that can only be a good thing for his long term future here. 

Personally, I prefer the riskier Herrera we saw at the start of the season, but I think we just need to all accept that that isn't LVG's way of playing, and we're going to have to get used to this style of play, as its here to stay (while LVG is here anyway)

7533~~~
I think this is just Phase 1 of Herrera's transformation for van Gaal. Now that he's become more disciplined, I believe the next phase will be for him to improve his passing range. Given that our wingers rarely cut inside when we were trying to build up our attack, Herrera will need to improve his passing range so that he can quickly play the ball out wide and stretch the opposition. He hasn't really shown a good passing range, and I'm hoping that he can improve on that so that he can be fully capable of controlling our tempo and build-up speed.

7534~~~
If ever I've seen a player trying to obey orders, it's Herrera. He was obviously on a, "be more like Blind," instruction set which makes sense if we're heading in a 451 (with wingers) type direction for the next few games. Unfortunately I think he'll get dropped so that Carrick partners Blind, but that's a different issue.

While he's working with those orders, United are missing a link man going forward. Di Maria isn't in good enough form and his orders probably say, "only lose the ball in the final third." Mata would seem to be the obvious route for a passing/possession driven team and I was really hopeful in those odd games where we saw Herrera, Di Maria, Mata working together that it could really blossom into something good, but it looks like we're not going to get that.

7535~~~
This is something that I don't understand, he was consistently disrupting our possession game, by pushing up and not being available for a pass, numerous times he should have been the bridge between Herrera-Blind and Young but he was pushing high up sometimes to the point to be totally offside.

7536~~~
Agree with <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> regarding Herrera. The Spanish lad has been obviously instructed to play it safe, taking minimum risks. Looks like the creativity is solely on AdM's shoulders. Also agree with the posters who say that Herrera was fouled last night, when Newcastle got the ball and countered. That was a clear foul.

7537~~~
He looks like the pain in the arse little brother who always tags along.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7538~~~
It was typical of the type of challenge that is referee'd differently in the PL and in Spain. We've seen the same thing happen to Hererra a few times. It's all good, though. Part of his learning curve. He'll be a better player for it.

7539~~~
Not sure if it was a foul that is referee'd differently in the two countries. Ander was not shielding the ball, it was not a situation where he was brushed off the ball because his opponent won shoulder-to-shoulder contact. It was a push imo. Rooney who is stronger than Ander would fall down and lose the ball too. Though Fellaini probably would not <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

7540~~~
I've been a bit critical of some of Herreras game but that's just savage.

7541~~~
Nah, that's fair enough. Cleverley had some good performances for United. He had some shit performances too (especially recently) but why re-write history?

On a good day, Cleverley could have done everything Hererra did last night. And probably a bit more.

7542~~~
Once upon a time I thought Cleverley was going to be the big beneficiary of Van Gaal's appointment. I thought he might enjoy the kind of renaissance Young has had. Or put another way, I thought he might become the kind of midfielder Herrera is turning out to be.

7543~~~
His creativity was very restricted last night. You could tell he was advised to play a certain way. I am hoping to see him in a midfield trio with Carrick and Blind at some point with Herrera being the creative output.

7544~~~
Agree with that, but I think Herrera's mentality is less questionable. He'll dig in and want the ball even when things aren't going too great. eg Yoevil away. Doing the opposite of this is definitely Clevs' main issue.

7545~~~
He's a much better version of Cleverley. Much better.

7546~~~
Love Ander Herrera, was not impressed by him last night. He had some bright moments in the first half where he found Valencia through the eye of the needle when switching the play, on the whole I thought he looked hesitant, risk-averse and as though he was over thinking every action. This was typified when he was caught in possession in the run up to Cisse's one on one. He had the ball and got caught out trying to be cautious instead of moving it quickly as he used to instinctively. I am disappointed that I can barely remember him running forward to receive a give and go or driving from midfield with the ball at his feet. Hope he's more ambitious next week.

7547~~~
Herrera is still finding his feet in EPL. If we compare both his and Clevs top performances, then it is Ander during his Bilbao times, a terrific player. So, while Clevs will hardly ever play in CL or probably even in EL again, I am optimistic about Ander's chances  of winning a European cup with us.

7548~~~
Yes. He definitely seems a stronger character. All the more so considering his personal circumstances, compared to Cleverley. He's also a better player.

I was really only disagreeing with the idea that what we saw last night was somehow above and beyond anything Cleverley ever produced for United. That's not true at all.

7549~~~
Barely managed a forward pass last night. Can only assume he was told to take less risks but took that to a new extreme. Hope we don't coach the joy out of his game.

7550~~~
We played 4-4-2 last night, it’s clear all of our creativity should be coming from wingers in that setup. His safe passing is keeping him in this team and it’s crucial in that setup, because he only has CBs and Blind behind him, so it would be criminal to lose the ball in such situation. It's not like we didn't create chances either. 

I don’t think his future lies so deep though (his long passing isn’t good enough I reckon), he seems much better player when he has the license to take more risk with his passing. I would rather see him ahead of Fellaini and Blind in games like that. It’s not like Fellaini couldn’t do the job against Newcastle who were around their penalty area most of the time.

Regarding Cleverley, yes I think he would have done well yesterday. But he would be useless against any other opposition that wants to play football and win, that’s why he was sold, rightly so.

7551~~~
I hope LvG plans to use him as the AM in 4-3-3 once he gets the box to box controller he wants.

7552~~~
I didn't like his performance last night, but that's probably what van Gaal is asking from him lately, which is bit stupid, but okay, as long as he's playing I won't complain too much, but he is definitely better player than he is showing in last couple of games.

7553~~~
I thought he, like Blind, looked a bit tired/laboured last night... some of his passes were very nice, but in general he seemed quite a bit slower on the ball then he usual is - especially when it came to darting forward with the ball.

Also got very lucky when he was caught in possession... yeah it might have been a foul (need to see it again, but I thought it wasn't on first view) but he's taking a risk there that he really doesn't need to take.

7554~~~
Not at all. A typical game for Cleverley consisted of getting the ball, keeping it ticking, playing short passes, constantly on the move, playing safe, etc. I don't see how that's savage. 

If Van Gaal wanted a safe player to keep possession and move the ball at a quick tempo, then Cleverley would have been ideal.

7555~~~
Only Cleverley didn't do any of that when he did get his chance under Van Gaal. He was also very poor under Moyes. For some reason he obviously struggles with doing himself justice under pressure. So he's not ideal for United, no matter how he plays the game.

7556~~~
After hearing the article with those "anonymous" quotes from him about Keane working them into the ground and to paraphrase  "it's ok to do that at United but not for what we get paid at Villa", that told me everything I needed to know about him.

I always thought he came across as headstrong with lots of self belief with the way he spoke of himself when he was here. In hindsight I think he was actually a bit self entitled and deluded about his own ability. He got a reputation fast and then rested on his laurels. Clearly felt he had made it.

7557~~~
If we're not counting pre season games, as a lot of people like to do, then Cleverley only had one competitive game under Van Gaal, which come against Sunderland, where, from what I can remember, he wasn't bad, he was just typical Cleverley, as I described before.

Yes, he was poor under Moyes, and yes he did lack confidence, but so did everyone else.  Of course it doesn't help when a petition is made to not have him in the world cup squad - ridiculous. 

If he played in a team with confidence - a team that has emphasis on keeping possession - as it seems Van Gaal is doing, then Cleverley could, and has shown in the past, he can do that job.

7558~~~
He was terrible. A lot worse than Hererra last night anyway.

7559~~~
Except he wouldn't.

The Cleverley of early 2011-12 would but the current one doesn't do quick passing and barely moves at all.

7560~~~
Him and/or blind need to start spreading play more. Too many players that play the side pass. Too many simple balls. I think we're too exacting at the minute resulting in creating or shooting fewer times. We did create about 4 or so chances but in general need to test the goalkeeper more. The Cleverly comparison is fair, though I Ander seems to have more potential for goals at the minute

7561~~~
Terrible? No chance. Also, it's pretty pointless comparing the both performance wise, as they were playing in complete different systems. Yesterday we played a 4411. Against Sunderland earlier on in the season, we played a 352 that everyone struggled to shine in. 

If you're going to compare the both performance wise, you should probably go back to our first game of the season against Swansea, where Herrera was bang average, hence why he got taken off for Fellaini. 

As I made it clear before, I just think if Cleverley was in the team yesterday and against Sunderland, in a 4411 next to Blind, we would have seen similar performances. That's just my opinion anyway.

7562~~~
I've just sat and watched the whole game through again. Ander was not bad actually. The role he and Blind are playing is very taxing tbh. The amount of work those two lads are getting through is amazing. They both are putting loads of effort in and does anyone know how many passes they both got through last night and the success rate of the passes. It is no wonder they both look exhausted at the end of games. There is a good partnership developing there as you said. I would prefer to see Ander being allowed to attack more, but at least he is working hard for the team.

7563~~~
Yes Herrera was taken off, but Van Gaal admitted he shouldn't have done it. Herrera and United were just taking control of the game and putting Fellaini on actually lost them the game.

7564~~~
Cleverley as good as Herrera? Not a chance. Herrera has a lot more desire for a start.

7565~~~
Where did I mention that? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

7566~~~
Taking Herrera off was a poor substitution that day to be honest, he wasn't great, but he was a damn sight better than most.

7567~~~
Yep, Herrera, at his best, is actually the player id hoped cleverly would become.

7568~~~
Your whole thrust was that Cleverley could have played better in that role, was it not?

7569~~~
Nope.

7570~~~
Not better but basically as well as?

7571~~~
I am now beginning to think it is better commenting after watching a game again later and more objectively. The comments yesterday were made when people were stresssing that we might not win the game. Ander is a better player than Tom Cleverley, there is no doubt about that. His attitude is spot on and he puts total effort in every game. The game yesterday, he played better than you'd have thought reading this thread. LvG has obviously asked him to curb his flair and stop making risky passes. He is actually doing that pretty well. Does it take something from his game, of course it does. Tom was going along quite well, until he got himself a celebrity girlfriend and started thinking they were the next Posh and Becks. Herrera has more intelligence, imagination and skill. Now that might be more down to better coaching in Spain than the coaching, not just as footballers, but as human beings . They have to work hard to get where they are, here they think as soon as they sign a professional contract they have made it big time.

7572~~~
I wasn't too impressed with Ander against Newcastle and I understand the comparison to Cleverley in that restricted context. He did the easy stuff very competently but was sloppy in his forward passing and generally didn't do anything special, which was Cleverley's stock-and-trade before he lost his confidence and fully went rapidly downhill last season.

Herrera is far better, just yesterday's game wasn't a great example of that.

7573~~~
Funny enough, they were talking about yesterdays game on Talksport and saying that LvG has no confidence in that defence and that he won't play attractive football until he sorts it out. We have lost most of the back 4, Vidic, Evra and Rio and Shaw has hardly played due to fitness. Rafael has disappearred completely. Smalling, Evans and Jones were back ups when the others were in their pomp and I am not convinced and I presume LvG isn't either that they are good enough to be the first choice defence in the future. It is probably no suprise that we are being rather sterile and won't take risks. Herrera and Blind were covering every blade of grass yesterday, that might actually be taking it's toll on their stamina towards the end of games. If Carrick comes in to share the workload it might help both of them. I don't think the defence is the only issue, the forward line isn't mobile enough either.

7574~~~
It seems so.

I don't remember Cleverley getting even a sniff of the goal in yonks before we shipped him off (Herrera offside against Sunderland).

7575~~~
I'd agree with that. I think that one of the reasons Herrera was out of the running for a first team place for so long is that LvG didn't want to play a defensively porous midfield in front of a shakey back-4 - it's no surprise that Ander's getting starts now that he's proven his willingness to change his game.

Although I don't think that entirely explains his performance yesterday, he did try to make some killer passes last night and more often than not got it wrong. That's not a reflection on his ability though, he's proven himself capable of making those passes, it just wasn't his day in that regard. In basically all other aspects of his performance he did his job incredibly well.

7576~~~
In terms of the Herrera/Cleverley debate, I think the main difference is that Herrera looked a frustrated figure last night in possession. He'd receive the ball and he'd hold on to it and advance with so much time but was unable to do anything incisive with it. Still, dribbling with the ball draws someone out of position at some point and that's something Cleverley never does. As soon as he gets the ball, he moves it on, whether he has 2 yards of space infront of him or 20. It was very sideways for Herrera last night, but he was actually creating some space when he was in possession most of the time, you wouldn't get that from Cleverley.

7577~~~
I don't have a problem with sideways passing as long as the team is moving forward as a unit at the same time. Ander likes to get the ball then move into space, problem starts if nobody makes themselves available for the pass in the first place or don't grasp what he is trying to do and then pass it backwards.

7578~~~
That's because we're geared to a certain set up though. If Fellaini has pushed on into the box for example, there's no point in trying to force it through the centre of the field when it's clear we're anticipating that the ball will be worked down the wing.

7579~~~
Maybe that is why we could do with a couple of nippy forwards. Wilson would thrive on through balls. Unfortunately Fellaini doesn't and RvP/Falcao don't now have the mobility.

7580~~~
Herrera on Arsenal clash: "We are Manchester United and we are not afraid." 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Mar/Ander-Herrera-looks-ahead-to-Arsenal-cup-tie.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...e=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

7581~~~
I'm hoping that Fellaini will be phased out next season when we're comfortable with moving the ball up the pitch. I'm pretty sure the only reason we play him there is so that we can retain possession when we are pressurised back to the goalkeeper and resort to going long. Ideally, we'd have someone there that is able to transition us into attack when teams press us high, rather than be a plan B when we are unable to work the ball through teams. As you say, when we are in the final third there's players that'd be a lot more useful upfront/midfield than Fellaini.

7582~~~
If this was meant for me then, as I said before, if Van Gaal wanted a player to play it short, sideways and be cautious, then Cleverley could have did what Blind and Herrera did against Sunderland and Newcastle, in my opinion.

This is not to say Cleverley and Herrera are similar players, though. I guess like people have suggested, he might be just instructed to play safe.

7583~~~
He was never a midfielder with fantastic passing range or world class technical ability. People just get so overhyped when we buy players comparing them to Scholes and all that bollix. Ander is what he is, a bundle of energy who likes to get on the football combined with a fantastic work rate and attitude. Will never be a world beater and in all honesty probably wouldn't start for Chelsea or City but with an improvement in quality around him he can turn out to be a big player for us.

7584~~~
That sounds like Scott Parker to me, and Ander Herrera isn't really just this. If he was, then he'd never have been scouted in the first place.

7585~~~
You've got to have a degree of common sense before taking every definition by it's face value. Scott Parker wasn't very good on the ball at the highest level and his work rate and energy was put into winning the ball back rather than when a side was in possession.

7586~~~
Hes got loads of technical ability, a consistently  brilliant first touch, a good dribbler of the ball, a reliable passer (with his short passes) and he has a good shot on him. You're doing him a disservice saying a bundle of energy is all he is when he's class on the ball, is a very intelligent player and has a great eye for a through pass with his creativity. Also when comparing him to city midfielders, only Yaya is better then him so he'd probably start for them, though they'd need a more defensive player behind them since Toure isn't that.

7587~~~
He's not starting ahead of Silva, and City prefer to play with 2 strikers anyway.

7588~~~
No but he is ahead of Fernando, fernandinho, Milner, Nasri, dzeko, bony and jovetic... So there would be a reshuffle if they did have him. He's not world class but those players are all pretty poor so it's not exactly huge praise saying he'd start over them, he's just clearly better. Though I do rate him very highly.

7589~~~
He's hardly proved he's better than Fernandinho yet, has he?

7590~~~
I think he's shown more in his limited appearances then fernandinho has shown really. Fernandinho is decent but I've never been impressed with him, he fouls constantly and has the odd really good game, but more often then not is a bit shit. At least the impression I get when I watch him.
Not so much of a case of what herrera has shown, rather a case of the others showing they aren't very good.

7591~~~
That's the fecking spirit lad. 

When you hear that attitude it's hard not to contrast to Moyseh last season. "Do you think you can win?" "Well that's not really the priority right now, we've first of all got to believe that we are not going to lose. Right now I don't but I'm going to keep grafting away and working hard and hopefully this shithouse bunch of players I have been left with don't feck up and make me look even more of a wanker than I already do. With a bit of luck we won't concede six and that will be a real good effort and something to build on. Liverpool and City is the target, I really admire those clubs and their fans and I hope we can get to that position as a club. Chance would be a fecking fine thing though."


Incredible to think that's an actual quote from his press conference in the run up to the Villa game last season.

7592~~~
He's not competing for a place with Fernandinho or Fernando because they're defensive minded options. He's not competing with Bony or Dzeko either because the decision to go 442/4231 would be a tactical one rather than based in personnel, and as I say, Silva is getting picked behind the striker before he is. He's a better option than Milner or Lampard as footballers, but  considering Yaya is first choice, there's no real need for high quality replacements. 

Basically, he wouldn't be first choice whether City play 442 or 4231, which is what I think the original post was implying.

7593~~~
Tactics are assessed via personnel for most pragmatic managers, not the other way around. Herrera is actually exactly the kind of midfielder City could do with in their squad and first team. Silva is fantastic, but what's behind is bland (Fernando, Fernandinho) or flagging (Toure, Lampard).

I've been calling out their midfield for a while now. Toure aside, it's nothing to shout about. And buying a creative, energetic central midfielder that is comfortable on the ball all across the midfield is exactly the kind of signing I dread they make. If not Herrera then better players like Pogba and Koke.

I think Herrera in midfield for City would improve them, definitely.

7594~~~
The decision of whether to play a 4231 or a 442 would be based on the opposition they're playing I'd say. Would playing an extra striker enable us to push the Barcelona back line deeper and create more gaps in their pressing game? Rather than, is Herrera better player than Dzeko. 

A lot of people on here suggest going with a 433 for United against elite opposition with Carrick behind Blind and Herrera, because the latter in a midfield two would be too open. I'd dread to think how open City's midfield would be should they have Herrera, Pogba or Koke next to Toure, I genuinely feel sorry for Fernandinho because he's basically a one man army in the centre of midfield.

Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of average players at City and I'm happy we have Herrera at United, but my point is that for the two roles you'd ask Herrera to do there, they have a better player to do it in the starting eleven.

7595~~~
Partly. The opponent certainly comes into it, but from a starting point in team selection the manager will always look to play the team that most benefits the playing squad. The City 442 has worked in this case, for the most part. I think we'll agree there.

I think this City team may be reaching its nadir, however. Toure only has so long left at the top. Kompany and Zabaleta haven't been their reliable selves. I think they need a revamp, particularly all across the midfield, with perhaps a change in formation. I think they could do with the dynamic influence of a player like Herrera, although I wouldn't then necessarily advocate pairing him in two man central midfield with Toure at the Nou Camp, for example.

I do take your point, though. If they want a defensive midfielder then he's not that, and if they want a goalscorer from midfield then he's not improving what they have there either.

7596~~~
Meh, that was the impression I got when I read that. That statement was meandering toward the other extreme, for me. Actually, come to think of it, that's a better description of Jonjo Shelvey/Steven Davis than Scott Parker.

The only thing I agree with is that he hasn't yet demonstrated a world class passing range. I am hoping that he can improve on that as it will really make him a complete midfielder. However, he's demonstrated everything else at a very high level. His technique was on show against Newcastle when Abeid/Sissoko would try to win the ball against him and he'd keep possession with great balance and skill before passing it out. His ball control is very good (typical Spanish), and his passing is also quite accurate. He's also shown an eye for goal that he's never demonstrated before. Defensively, he's not as unreliable as people make him out to be. Sure, if he pushes high up the pitch as a central midfielder, then we're in trouble, but whenever he recovers his position, his defensive work and handling of the opposition attacks is very good.

None of us here have been saying that he's comparable to Scholes or world class already, but he's been a key player for us this season, and he's done well so far in his first season here.

7597~~~
Herrera can play like Cleverley but Cleverley can't play like Herrera is the point. 

Herrera has a lot more in his locker and by following this line of argument you're just insinuating he is no better, which is just weird, 

As I said Herrera scored against Sunderland but was ruled offside. So even if he was instructed to play the lynchpin role he still had the nouse to spot an opening. 

Massive upgrade on Cleverley. And yes I think you've answered your own question at the end,

7598~~~
To be honest, I'm in agreement with you that someone like Koke or Pogba would be ideal for them. If they want to keep getting the best out of Toure without sacrificing their defensive system, then a pivot 433 with Dinho behind Toure and let's say Pogba would be beneficial. The problem is that Pellegrini has his preferences and philosophy and a 433 isn't a part of it, and he predominantly likes to play with two strikers so I can't see that happening any time soon, which is good.

7599~~~
He's a good player who is a useful option for most sides. He's a well rounded midfielder that has a lot of qualities and very few weaknesses. He doesn't particularly excel at anything though, which is why he is a level below the elite players that the best sides in the world have. And I'm talking about regarding elite status here, saying he doesn't excel doesn't mean I'm branding him with any average midfielder, players like Cleverley don't belong in this discussion and that's why he isn't with us currently.

7600~~~
Initially, you replied to my post saying, 'Cleverley as good as Herrera? No chance'.

Like I said before, not once did I say Cleverley was as good or better than Herrera. I was just saying that if we're going to play the way we've been using the our centre midfielders, then Cleverley could do that role. Again, that's not to say he's a better player.

For example, we could have Xavi in our midfield. However, if he's asked by Van Gaal to play five yard passes and be very cautious in his passing (sidewards and backwards), then that's taking away the natural abilities of him as a player.

If Van Gaal gives Herrera more freedom and allows him to take more risks and be more adventurous, then of course I'd have him over Cleverley. I mean, that's what we bought him for, right? However, I'm not seeing this at the moment.

I must say, though, this Van Gaal telling them to play safe is being exaggerated, in my opinion. I mean, Van Gaal has expressed that he likes to switch play, and drag teams from side to side; however, I very rarely see  that from Herrera or Blind, who prefer short passes. I mean, sometimes you have to drag teams from one side to another, and the only way you can do that is by hitting a long ball sometimes. There were loads of opportunities Blind and Herrera had to switch play against Newscatsle and they decided to play a short pass, which is pretty easy to defend, especially when played at a slow tempo.

7601~~~
I actually think cautious passing suits Xavi better, he very rarely plays long Pirlo or Scholes style passes. Xavi's game has always been about moving the ball side to side like a see-saw until someone goes chasing, then he'll quickly slip one across the deck into the space left by the defending player who breaks shape.

Herrera is not nor will he ever be a Xavi type player. Herrera's more inclined to run with the ball, to advance into forward areas to receive the ball, to get stuck in and get up and down the pitch. Van Gaal won't like that because if his #8 gets caught too far ahead of the play it means his #6 will be exposed to a 2 on 1 situation. Van Gaal's philosophy is all about creating overloads through good shape and positioning, and avoiding being overloaded by good shape and positioning.

Herrera, together with others, is clearly trying to curb his natural footballing instincts to play as Van Gaal would want him to. You are probably right that Van Gaal has not told them to only play 5-10 yard passes, however because its all new the team they find it difficult to do anything else. They resort to a lot of laboured slow passes because they don't want to risk deviating too far from the plan. They know if they keep it simple and keep the ball they'll at least be congratulated by the manager for controlling the game.

7602~~~

7603~~~
Yeah that's very much his style. That Barca team at their peak pulled teams back and forth until they found a killer ball that was no riskier than any other pass, for the reasons you say. The only player in that team who really played risky balls was Alves. Xavi in particular was happy to spend 4 or 5 minutes straight camped on the edge of the penalty area waiting for the right moment.

7604~~~
Awww... his little face. You can see it means a lot to him. Good on him.

7605~~~
Well deserved! Happy for the lad after his spell out of the team.

7606~~~
Good lad. Happy for him, it's well deserved.

7607~~~
Everytime I see him I can't help but notice he has the shoulder width of a 12 year old girl.

7608~~~
I mean, it's probably not far off.

7609~~~
He called the players <i>shithouse</i>????? Surely he was more diplomatic?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7610~~~
Good. Pleased for him.

7611~~~
he won himself some starts with this price so no need to worry about some more adventurous passing, Ander...

7612~~~
Isn't he a lovely little thing?

7613~~~
Congrats amigo. Keep working hard.

7614~~~
Fantastic for Ander and he has been very solid for us since being recalled into the starting eleven. Will only get better with more experience. With Carrick coming back this will only help him in his adjustment to English football.

I just don't understand why he didn't play more matches in the previous months. Should ALWAYS start before fellaini.

7615~~~
Well done Ander, he's become a fan favourite in short time and has done well. He needs to develop his positional sense and work on his long-range passing and he'll become an excellent cm.

7616~~~
More than proved his worth. Fantastic to see him starting game after game now. He's got a fantastic engine on him, and that's why the fans have been calling for him to play whenever possible.

7617~~~
Perfect

7618~~~
I still can't understand how Van Gaal thought that Rooney was a better option in midfield for so long.

Herrera on Arsenal clash: "We are Manchester United and we are not afraid."</span>

The boy learns quickly. Exactly the right attitude you need for a United player….

7620~~~
To accomodate those useless duo upfront.

7621~~~
More of a case of needing to be sure about Falcao.

7622~~~
He is by no means perfect, but he say's all the right things and his attitude is spot on. I really do think he will turn into an even better player for us, he genuinely want's to work hard and improve, and more importantly win. Love the lad and glad he won the POTM.

7623~~~
Agreed with the rest, but short passing =/ cautious passing. 
Barca's passing was through incredibly tight spaces, to team-mates under pressure, where a few centimetres off on the pass, a tiny bit of predictability, or a less than killer first touch would mean losing the ball. It was a risky strategy enforced by supernaturally talented playerws, and Xavi was at the heart of it.

7624~~~
What the feck is wrong with journalists? Quote about our summer signings from <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/08/manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-arsenal-fa-cup" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this article</a>:

"Since the six can be broadly divided into <i>galácticos</i> (Di María and Falcao), solid performers (Blind and Rojo), and future prospects (Shaw and Herrera), the signings appeared a shrewd blend."

...Herrera is a year older than Blind and Rojo. Not to mention that when played he has easily been a "solid performer" (which can also be said for Shaw). Seriously, do they just not bother doing research?

7625~~~
I'm guessing by solid performers they are meaning good but not great players so with Herrera and Shaw they are thinking they have the ability to be great players.

7626~~~
I suppose, doesn't really seem like that's what they're saying though. Especially because there would be no more reason to put Herrera in that kind of category than Rojo or Blind <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

7627~~~
If they can say Lallana is a prospect, so can our Ander and no they don't do any research. Ever.

7628~~~
I love Herrera. I think he's a great player and will be essential to us for the next years, but I absolutely love his attitude, both on and off the pitch. I read that Telegraph article about him, and I like how he comes across as someone who loves football more than anything else, and who understands what being a supporter is as well. He's got the perfect attitude for this club.

7629~~~
Pretty poor first half in my opinion. Mostly being strolled around in midfield.

7630~~~
Love the urgency he brings to the side. He's everywhere attacking and defending.

7631~~~
Think he's playing much better then Blind though neither were great. He got better as the half wore on. Good on the ball but along with Blind getting bypassed a bit too easily.

7632~~~
Yeah, Blind looks very slow tonight I think.

7633~~~
He finished the half strongly. It's a tough shift for him and Blind with Cazorla pulling the strings and the movement they have.

7634~~~
I think he has either been told to keep it simple most of the time or he's worried that if he tries to be more expressive and it fails then he'll be back to the bench. He also has to take responsibility for helping Blind who we can't leave too isolated due to his lack of pace.

7635~~~
He has, it's (rightfully) what Van Gaal demands from his centre-midfielder, that much is apparent.

7636~~~
And he's out of here.

7637~~~
On a card, let's not just fly with our imagination here.

7638~~~
Not really surprised, we were being walked around in midfield. Blind wasn't great either, mind you.

7639~~~
I'd have rather kept him on than Blind personally, even though I'm a fan of Blind.

7640~~~
Why don't we move him higher up the pitch in front of Carrick - Blind? Is Fellaini really that important for our play?

7641~~~
Poor tonight I thought. no urgency or invention in his play on an evening where we've at times been borderline dynamic.

7642~~~
Now you see why you don't take him off. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

7643~~~
Don't understand why he was subbed. It feels like we don't have a midfield now he's gone off. We ended the first half so strongly, felt we'd go onto win. Now it's all long ball.

7644~~~
I assume you're joking.

7645~~~
Swansea game all over again.

7646~~~
He wasn't playing well anyway. A Blind/Herrera midfield has its own problems.

7647~~~
Then that is why you put Carrick in there as well.

7648~~~
He played a decent role in our goal, and was helping us play some pretty good stuff at the end of the first half. Do we look like we've improved without him? Poor sub.

7649~~~
The moment he was subbed off it was destined for us to lose the game.

7650~~~
He's our most dynamic midfielder. Full of energy, running, and capable of scoring and creating goals. We were far worse when he went off, and I bet that's no coincidence.

7651~~~
Taking him off but leaving Marouane the Shitmachine on was baffling.

7652~~~
Felt the exact same way. He was arguably our best player in the first half, and if he doesn't have an injury then it should go down as one of LvG's worst subs.

7653~~~
Should never have been taken off. He wasn't exactly playing tremendously well but it's so, so evident that he influences the team positively.

7654~~~
If he isn't injured, which I don't want him to be injured. Then what the hell did he say to Ander to justify it?

7655~~~
<i>"Philosophy"</i>, and nothing more was said.

7656~~~
he wasn't adventurous enough again but I guess could have been given other instruction or encouraged to play different role, maybe as 10 instead of Faulaini. But that Blind- Carrick midfield was world class, my word :-D I guess you will never see less pacier midfield than today. Bye bye top four, when you look at the fixtures, we will be really off the pace with what we are going to line-up. 

You just know that Herrera will be on the bench next game, you just know that he's not player who will not survive average performance and is not gonna be backed. We just know we're fecked..

7657~~~
He should've remained on at half-time. Far from perfect and he didn't offer that much, but he's a different outlet to Carrick and Blind.

7658~~~
I don't think he has any future here. He is not strong or dynamic enough to be a box to box monster. He was invisible in the first half. Van Gaal will replace him in the summer

7659~~~
Just watching MUTV and Ron Atkinson said the Herrera substitution made us lose any momentum in the 2nd half.

7660~~~
He was key bringing to the ball forward to our right flank where Di Maria created problems for them. We had better control of possession, yes we struggled a little bit at full back positions but fortune favours the brave and we made our midfield as slow as you could ever dream of with Fellaini, Carrick and Blind. Add to that the fact that Young wasn't as good as he's been recently and Rojo is not an attacking full back the players out there were mostly negative or passive ones. For me, Blind and Carrick should never be seen together in midfield, they should be battling for one position next to Herrera.

7661~~~
I felt that we needed a bit more from him in the 2nd half, because he was keeping the ball well but in his position we need a bit more than that.

But taking him off we didnt even have that player keeping the ball well anymore. We went from Ander's 89.3% to Carrick's 80.5% and even less penetrative play

I remember in the first half Blind had around 77% when I checked at half time and he ended the game at 82.3%, Ander's accurate passing while not enough to be considered a good performance was definitely helping him control the game.

7662~~~
I'd rather the manager went first. There I said it. I hope the board are taking note of this.

7663~~~
Same here.

7664~~~
He should just tell LvG to feck off.

7665~~~
Crazy to bring him off at HT, he was miles better than Blind and one of our few players not acting like a massive fanny.

7666~~~
He'll have to start wearing clogs obviously.

7667~~~
He was not great, but he was a lot more composed on the ball than some of the others.

Carrick should have been on for Fellaini, who was giving away stupid fouls and was poor whenever the ball was played on the ground. 

I just don't understand LVG, if you want to play possession football, then play players who are good on the ball. Mata rotting on the bench is a shame as well.

7668~~~
Starting to be redcafe's most overrated player since Kagawa and I really like the guy.

7669~~~
Let's be honest. He plays adventurous, he takes him off. He plays reserved, he takes him off. Why play him then?

7670~~~
May not have been his best game but the one thing we lost when he went off was movement. He was always an option for the pass prior to this and kept the midfield ticking over.

7671~~~
Agreed

7672~~~
I agree, he wasn't in the game that much because he obviously played much further than Blind who had all time to set up attacks but at least he was moving all over the pitch tryna link the play and was giving something to think about to Arsenal players. With Carrick coming on we had two deep sitting very immobile midfielders who can pass the ball but with not enough movement up front(Fellaini) and time on the ball to make something happen.
We didn't get over the halfway line first 20 minutes in the second half just to concede the careless goal. 

Herrera's card was worrying but I guess he could have stayed on the pitch as Fellaini and Rojo were also red cards waiting and it was dimaria who was rightly sent off in the end.. The only good sub was Shaw down, but it could have been Young to play as leftback and perhaps Januzaj as winger. But van Gaal was worried with our shaky defense which conceded anyway.

 It was an intense game with lots of mistakes, so I guess that happens but antitactics with Failaini as the "ball chester" doesn't work out everyday. Could have been Mata who could start in the first place we would have been controling the game much better and some chances for Rooney and co would come up eventually.

7673~~~
Not trying to make excuses for him, but I think we would be one of the best midfielders in the league under Ferguson. I honestly think LVG is heavily restricting him, and I know for a fact he is way more capable than he is showing.

7674~~~
He wasn't injured as he went on to sit on the bench right away.

LvG just wanted to tighten up things by bringing on Carrick.

7675~~~
Exactly the same thing happened when he went of vs Swansea at the start of the season. Its almost as if you need to be spraying balls all over the park to get noticed. His pressing and energy was very good for us first half, he was playing with the shackles on though, not taking much risks with his passing.

7676~~~
Yup. Funny how much some people overrate him. He's not really that good.

7677~~~
Wrong decision to take him off he finished the half strongly. I think it turned the tie in Arsenal's favour.

7678~~~
Bad game for Ander, his passing was sloppy and his defensive coverage is weak. He is quite adventurous but the difference between him and the very top players in his position is that they're simply more successful. That could be in terms of dribbling, passing, tackling and even movement. He is a solid player but no where near being top class . I won't be surprised if Carrick displaces him permanently for the remaining games.

7679~~~
He's far from great, although I think most people felt he would've offered something different to Blind/Carrick who are arguably too similar.

7680~~~
That went well then?

7681~~~
He wasn't playing well, but he was playing as well as anyone else. Having Carrick and Blind as a midfield is never ever going to work. They are too slow, have no dynamism and have an extremely limited range of passing. They move everything so slow also. It was a ridiculous decision and as soon as I saw it I knew Arsenal were bound to control a hell of a lot more, which is exactly what happened.

7682~~~
There is no way I'm going to believe Van Gaal is the one instructing him to be so safe with his passing, if he is, then why are blind and Carrick passing the ball with more risk than he is? He's turning into joe allen ffs.

7683~~~
He's miles better than anything else we have in that position. Anytime he gets taken off our midfield gets visibly substantially weaker. He may not be fantastic but he's easily the best we have, yet he seems to be the easy touch for LVG.

7684~~~
It failed miserably but i can see why he did that. I can even see why he didn't take off Fellaini for Carrick and i honestly think we would have won the match had Valencia not made that silly mistake.

7685~~~
Didn't LvG say he wasn't happy with him giving the ball away so much? 

That was despite his stats been on par with everyone else.

7686~~~
I think he is, have you not noticed the coaching staff always talking to him. I think that is exactly what he has done.

7687~~~
On what basis? DDG kept that score line respectable. We keep possession, that's all well and good. We do nothing with it. Arsenal had more chances than we did. Simple. With over 60% possession Arsenal still created more.

7688~~~
Yeah, I'd agree with that. Like I said before though, he's not at the level you should be aiming at for a first choice player. 

Never should have bought him.

7689~~~
It seems to be the case though, since hes come back into the team, he has been far less risking with his passing.

7690~~~
Blind doesnt take any risks. Carrick played long balls to Fellaini when we went behind.

7691~~~
He wasn't very good, but at least he can move, unlike a Blind/Carrick/Fellaini trio.

7692~~~
They didn't have that many chances after the break until we went full attack in the last 15ish minutes.

7693~~~
Stating the obvious to everyone except Louis Van Gaal sadly..

7694~~~
That trio......

7695~~~
Its painful isn't it? How can anyone manager put that on the pitch and expect it to work?

Its just so obviously terrible. I'd love to be an opposition player facing that.

7696~~~
How can any manager expect it to work against Arsenal, who have one of the fastest midfields around? Baffling.

I don’t think Carrick – Blind is a good idea but I can understand that. However, subbing Herrera and sticking to Fellaini in those circumstances was simply wrong.

7697~~~
Its just mind boggling tbh.

7698~~~
Yeah, that's just nonsense. And he has the stats to prove it on his side. Not his fault how the manager is using him.

7699~~~
I think he carried the can for Blind and Valencia having a tough first half. Not that they improved in the second of course. In fact all that happened was we went from a good performance to a drab one. But I do think LvG trusts/likes them in a way that he doesn't trust/like Herrera, and I don't know why that is - hopefully Ander does and can work on it.

7700~~~
He was poor really. Didn't contribute anything and was on a booking. Not sure I would have subbed him at half time though, deserved at least 10-15 minutes to try and improve it.

7701~~~
Picked up an injury apparently

7702~~~
Feck, just when the fixtures got difficult too.

7703~~~
He made a lovely play under pressure to keep possession and hit Valencia in the buildup to the goal. He's miscast in this team, but I love his game as the 8 in a more pressing based set up with a higher line behind him.

7704~~~
Im not sure why people are saying he was poor during the Arsenal game. He did nothing wrong, was having an decent game and was the link between Defense and attack and enabled us to keep the ball further up the pitch away from our goal. As soon as I heard he was taken off at half time I was ranting in the match day thread about it as that meant we would be back to playing with pretty much no midfield. Carrick and Blind may be Defensive Midfielders but they pretty much become extra CBs and it ends up being 4 attackers and 5 defenders. Carrick and Blind are too slow too be playing together and their games are too similar, pair one of them with Herrera and we have an ok midfield, if not it will just be so slow paced and get overrun easily. Im honestly dreading us playing with Blind and Carrick together over the next few weeks if that's Van Gaals plan.

7705~~~
Bolded part is the problem.

7706~~~
He definitely wasn't poor, but he wasnt good either. He just accurately passed the ball around when his team werent able to do that. Usually thats what we'd want from a Blind or Carrick, but hey both of them played and were nearly 10% less accurate with their passes than he was and just like him they didnt create much

7707~~~
Don't know where you've heard that but I suspect even if he wasn't that's the line that will be peddled out now. 

Few lads at the game saying that Giggs was berating him 3 or 4 times for not being close enough to cazorla.

7708~~~
Has LvG explained the sub? Was he injured? Making 2 subs at half time is a drastic measure, and Danny Murphy got it spot on. It really destroyed our rhythm. We were playing with a lot of pace in the first half, and that didn't carry over into the 2nd half.

It was perhaps an understandable sub if we were getting battered and needed to plug the midfield with a player liek Carrick, but we weren't. I thought we were the better side in the first half, but shite in the 2nd. Blind and Carrick were too far away from the attacking players. Fellaini was too far away from the midfield players. Herrera was linking that up fairly well, but without Herrera, there was very little link, besides for long passes for Fellaini/Rooney to fight over or Young/ADM/Januzaj to run onto.

7709~~~
Herrera was bang average in the first half.

Carrick was definitely needed in there. Arsenal had far too much space on the counter and you could see the goal coming from a mile off.

I would have taken Fellaini off mainly because we all knew the inevitable hoofball that was to follow in the 2nd half but Fellaini had a better first half than Herrera.

We lost the game because Valencia and Di Maria fecked up. Not because of Herrera going off.

7710~~~
This is what gets on my nerves. Herrera shouldn't have been the player picking up Carzola, it should have been Fellaini and Herrera should have been playing deeper alongside Blind. It seems an awful waste of Herrera's talent to be man marking while Fellaini roams freely around the pitch. I don't understand why LVG plays Herrera and Fellaini as advance midfielder when their on the pitch together and leaves Blind on his own to get over run. Furthermore then bring on Carrick to play alongside Blind to give him protection and control the game when you already had Herrera on the pitch who could also do that if you played him deeper makes no sense what so ever. Every time Herrera dropped back he looked to move the ball forward and give Blind options from the back but then he had Giggs in his ear telling him to get further up the pitch.
We cant play Blind and Carrick as a pair, its 1 or the other and Herrera as deeper cm or box 2 box midfielder alongside either, that is what we should be doing and have Fellaini man mark who needs to be. That then opposes a question is Fellaini good enough in that position? In all honesty I'd put Rooney (#10) there with falcao or RVP up top, if we have to play Rooney as a striker I'd play Mata in the #10. Were wasting 3 players here with the current tactics, not all 3 can make it on the pitch at the same time but 1 player need to play in the right position to benefit the team and support Blind/Carrick and the other needs to replace the god awful tactical conundrum that is Fellaini. 
I guess for now we'll have to just put up with it until RVP returns from injury, then LVG has a choice to make Fellaini or RVP, saying that with LVG it will be Herrera making way for Rooney to go back into midfield, tactical genius *facepalm*

7711~~~
That's probably the bit on TV where they showed Giggs in the technical area shouting something. Still, there was no way I would have taken him off.

Like people already mentioned, Fellaini and the hoofball tactics should have disappeared altogether at the start of the second half.

7712~~~
He's made to curb his instincts and play safe always - for that role, Carrick is better.

If he wanted to change the midfield, I would have thought Blind out for Carrick was a better change. Personally I thought Carrick was superb under pressure yesterday, short and long passing, tackling and dribbling. Clearly a big class gap between him and Blind.

7713~~~
I'd agree with all of that. 

Fellaini actually had a good game with the ball on the deck. So frustrating that his mere existence seems to provoke us into hoofball as soon as we're under any real pressure to score.

7714~~~
Luckhurt from the MEN is saying it was 'tactical'. If so, what was the tactic behind it? Gut our midfield of any link man and let Arsenal advance onto us and put our defence under sustained pressure? Arsenal didn't even have to work that hard for the win after Herrera went off. We simply stopped playing through midfield and resorted to hoofing it to Fellaini in hope. Our defenders looked in vain, time and time again, for someone to give it to and then in despair just hacked it up field where Rooney chased nothing balls all second half. 

Clearly Van Gaal didn't see this. If he did it would just prove my suspicion that he is more concerned with keeping it tight with actually trying to win. We weren't great in the first half but we were, in my opinion, the better team. Nothing needed changing at half time. It was an open game, maybe too open for Van Gaal, but since when have Man Utd been afraid of an open game? Anyone remember beating Reading 4-3 in 2012/13? The first half of that was utterly insane. We looked a force in the first half of last nights game, in the second we never looked like winning even before Di Maria was sent off.

7715~~~
That's an idiotic tweet tbf.

7716~~~
It is a bit odd. Is he basically saying that if Blind had played against Arsenal in November we would have lost?

7717~~~
I also don't believe we lost because Herrera went off, but there was a clear missing link between midfield and attack, which Herrera was providing more than Blind, Carrick and Fellaini.

I agree with you though. I'd have taken Fellaini off. I think a midfield 3 of Herrera, Carrick and Blind could have been very effective in that game.

7718~~~
That's how I'd read that bit of the tweet. Luckhurst seems to feel that a Blind/Carrick midfield isn't dynamic enough to challenge Arsenal. Not sure that's wrong. Blind did not play well last night, seemed to get lost by the pace of the game, and in the second half just got sucked deeper and deeper.

Still, the first point, that the Herrera substitution was tactical is what stands out. 

If the Herrera sub was tactical it was because Van Gaal decided that instead of playing to win, he wanted to ensure we didn't lose. Had Moyes made a similar substitution Old Trafford would have groaned at the sight of it. Van Gaal is using his reputation to ride out ridiculous decisions. 

I was no lover of Moyes, everyone knows that, but I know for a fact that if he was doing the kind of stuff Van Gaal has been doing he'd be getting slaughtered. Why is what's good for the goose not good for the gander when it comes to Van Gaal? Sometimes it feels like people were more willing to criticise Fergie for playing Sheasy and Smudge in midfield than to criticise Van Gaal for his bizarre tactical changes.

7719~~~
Now this is bang on assessment. 

As much as I dislike Lvg and his stupid substitution I thought bringing Carrick on was no brainer. We were so open in first half that every time Arsenal attacked I feared a goal. Decision was vindicated as we controlled the game much better and Arsenal hardly created a chance until we gifted them the lead and Di Maria got sent off.

7720~~~
One step forward and two back for him. He'll be dropped for 4 or 5 games now.

7721~~~
What exactly does he do? If am not mistaken, I saw more forward passes from Blind [the stats will be good, if anyone can dig that up]. He's supposed to be the one controlling things and linking MF and attack, but he doesn't do that enough, yes, he has good movement but he's really not showing this world class quality that I keep hearing about. I felt he was bang average last night and that left Blind with almost all the work to do in midfield, but coming here, he's getting a free pass while Blind is being castrated, I think he's a good player but I don't get the favouritism at all.

7722~~~
That's because he was poor. He doesn't need to do what Valencia did to be poor. I hate this "he did nothing wrong" comment that gets thrown about anytime a CAF darling has a mare.

7723~~~
Yeah, it's nonsense. He seems to have forgotten that Arsenal created far more chances in that game than they did last night. And that was 11 v 11.

7724~~~
I'm a big Herrera fan but that's not how I saw it. Pretty much everything good we did going forward in the 1st half came on the back of either Rooney, Di Maria or Fellaini. Herrera was fairly invisible.

I don't think there was anything wrong with the 2nd half performance until Valencia fecked up. We were a LOT more solid and Fellaini even set up Di Maria for a good chance right before they scored.

For some reason we panicked after they scored and resorted to hoofballing for the rest of the game which seems to have skewed people's perception of the 2nd half.

I'm as big a LVG critic as any but the Carrick-Herrera sub made perfect sense.

7725~~~
It was his usual cowardly substitution. Rather get a draw.

7726~~~
He doesn't need to move. He knows where to be!

7727~~~
It wasn't cowardly at all. Van Gaal recognised the threat Young and Di Maria were causing and wanted to get Carrick on so he could use his range of passing to get them on the ball more regularly and hopefully in behind the defence. 

That showed by exactly how Carrick operated, spraying the ball to them where possible. It was a sensible tactical move that was also designed to sure us up defensively. Nothing wrong with that when playing a good side like Arsenal.

7728~~~
Herrera was poor in the first half but - a) he was one of the few players actually putting himself about / challenging and b) we played approximately 2 forward thinking passes from midfield, and both of them came from him... Blind was having an equally poor time, but he can't make up for it with simply getting around the pitch like Herrera can. And, as soon as you take him off you lose the legs in midfield (Carrick & Blind is the opposite of legs... its arms... or something) and it showed.

7729~~~
We lost, so it didn't work. The defensive side is down to him. There must have been better defenders out there than we have. He insists on using Valencia and ignores Rafael. We have never had injury problems at LB, now we have Shaw. Smalling/Jones and Evans are all an accident waiting to happen. He will have to get rid of at least 3 of the CB's in the summer. He presumed his genius would get us Top 4. If we lose on Sunday, he can forget that.

7730~~~
He was no poorer then anyone else in that team thats what my problem was. I thought he looked quick on the ball personally and looked to move it quickly too creating space for other players.

7731~~~
It wasn't cowardly, but it took our legs from us in midfield.

It also used two substitutions at 45 minutes, when we really only needed to use one (but then he does have a substituting full-backs fetish... that was probably just one for the wank bank).

7732~~~
He is going to play Blind until he will barely be able to walk. Carrick will be injured more than being fit. He was that obsessed with Strootman that he hasn't given Blind and Herrera the protective presence they need with them. Fellaini certainly isn't it.

7733~~~
I find it weird that people criticize him for not being offensive threat. He’s job in 4-4-2 is to protect the defense and give the ball to our attacking players. He isn’t very good in 2 man midfield, but you really can’t blame him for not being creative and playing it safe because it’s clear that’s why he is playing so regularly. That’s what van Gaal wants.

7734~~~
To feck with his head.

7735~~~
That would make sense. Unfortunately for Herrera and for me.

My trouble is I actually enjoyed the first half. It was faster, sharper than we've looked in ages and there was a proper match going on. The subs and the halftime pep talk changed things. To LvG that may have meant we were more controlled, to me it just looked like we were slower, and more predictable.

7736~~~
There was a moment on the sideline where the camera picked up Giggs bellowing "Ander! Ander! ANDER!" to get his attention. He sounded annoyed, like it wasn't the first time he'd had to!

7737~~~
Ok I have been pulled up on the "did nothing wrong part" by two of you. IMO he was having a decent game and taking him off was a big mistake. Even if he wasn't having a good game the way we set up in the second half was all wrong, we literally had nothing in midfield at all and taking Herrera off caused that. Blind "does nothing wrong" every game but nothing good either and most of the forum seem to rate him so highly when his is a basic average DM who should be nothing more than back up for DM and LB.

7738~~~
He's the only player we've had this season to successfully link midfield and attack.

Without him out there we never look like scoring. More like watching Chelsea than United.

7739~~~
Not just you mate - all of us!!

7740~~~
I thought he was shouting "Angel, Angel, Angel!" <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

7741~~~
Wasnt great first half but was getting better towards the end of it. Momentum seemed with us after the equaliser.
Thought it was a mistake subbing him rather than Blind though. Blind was all over the place first half and bringing on Carrick for Herrera instead of Blind pretty much killed the link between midfield and attack!

7742~~~
Surely you're not referring to the current Chelsea or United sides?

7743~~~
No, I'm thinking Chelsea in the early Mourinho days.

7744~~~
He was.

7745~~~
He's been immaculate in possession against Spurs so far. His dynamism and energy has been a big part of why we've been able to press so pro-actively. Also linked with Mata telepathically at times. Gets up and down, does his bit (as always). Nothing to dislike.

7746~~~
I really like his work rate, he's always closing his man down and getting his foot in and going forward he's quality, shame he got called offside because he would probably have an assist to his name as well.

7747~~~
Pass and move. Complements Carrick's style so well and balances the team.

7748~~~
His tackling is quite brilliant. Made a mug of Harry Kane on the edge of our box.

He's great.

7749~~~
I thought he had a really good game. Seemed to be playing more advanced than in the last few games.

7750~~~
He's finally starting to show signs of the player we hoped he could become....very tidy performance.....Herrera coming into form at the right time gives us a real chance of grabbing a top 4 finish

7751~~~
Quietly efficient game from him, played his role well between Carrick and Rooney but saw less of it in attack as we went down the other channel most of the time.

7752~~~
That's what annoyed me on Monday when he was taken off at half-time. He definitely works better with one of Carrick or Blind than the two of them work together.

7753~~~
Would be interested to see his stats but seemed like he had quiet some interceptions today. A very lively and energetic display and he and Mata are just great together

7754~~~
Very good performance. More of the same please.

7755~~~
How the hell do you bench so regularly a player like this ? Hopefully LVG has seen the light.

7756~~~
He really does offer a lot in midfield. He must be so annoying to play against <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7757~~~
6 tackles, 4 interceptions. Our main ball winner today by a fair distance. Valencia 5 tackles and 1 interception, both CBs and Blind with 3 of each

7758~~~
Thanks, that are quite good numbers. He had a wonderful game I thought and due to his quick movement and passing, we are able to move the ball quickly

7759~~~
Made both the most tackles and the most interceptions in the team, made the most passes and had the second highest pass completion %. He's involved in so much even when he's not doing much creatively. Still think van Gaal's biggest balls-up so far is taking so long to recognise Herrera's importance in this team.

7760~~~
I thought he was excellent; only real criticism is that his two shots went wide in the 2nd half.

7761~~~
Was everywhere today. Thought he was excellent. Linked the play, tackled, blocked, passed it well. Great performance.

7762~~~
Man of the match today imo. Magnificent.

7763~~~
It's clear that he's defensive game has improved, clearly he's playing to instructions.

7764~~~
Can pass it better, if he'd done so that would be a 10/10 performance, guess he'll have to settle for 9/10. Wonderful stuff.

7765~~~
He's always been good defensively. I really can't see why he hasn't been playing all season.

7766~~~
This. I just think back to Monday's half time sub and think to myself we'd be winning the F.A. Cup this season if it never happened, we were well on top at the end of the first half.

Favourite Herrera moment today, the slide tackle and then scooped pass off the floor to Mata. Composure.

7767~~~
I may be overrating his performance but he was outstanding IMO

7768~~~
Those are good numbers. Still amazed he was subbed against Arsenal.

7769~~~
Really good today I was surprised Neville didn't mention him, he was going through so much work.

7770~~~
You don't think Herrera has improved as the season's gone on? I do. Still gets out of position occasionally but generally much more aware of his defensive chores than he was when he started. Hence he's racking up interceptions now, as well as tackles.

7771~~~
Clearly the most important player in the team, he links everything everywhere on the pitch, great numbers mentioned above. The thing I like the most about him is his sliding tackles, you can see he wants to win the ball for the team. He deserved a goal for his complete MOTM performance, he was edged by Carrick, Fellaini and Smalling..

7772~~~
This. I wasn't a fan of Herrera before these last few games. He used to be indiscipline; all action and getting stuck in, just like seeing the young Gerrard in CM.

Kudos to his willingness to learn and adapt. Now he is more intelligent with the ball, more restrictive with his passing and going forward, but still make an impact to the fluidity of the team play, as a good CM supposed to do.

7773~~~
Brilliant today. I just love how quickly he does things. The first time passes, the split second touches/decision making, it adds something we sorely lack.

7774~~~
Loved that. Great tackle it was too. Didn't expect that pass to follow. Supreme.

We look better when he plays. We have an actual midfield, and he can do things quickly. Like Carrick, he's usually already picked his pass before he even gets the ball, but he has a more attacking head on his shoulders. Hard to believe we had a spell where he couldn't get on the pitch.

7775~~~
Now he has improved his defensive game, he looks like a proper all-round midfielder. Only thing that is lacking is long passing. Not sure he can’t do it or it isn’t part of the philosophy.

He’s also very reliable player, always delivers. I reckon he’s one of our most important players and still improving.

7776~~~
I very much agree with you. Playing Rooney out of position to try and squeeze Falcao and Van Persie in would be the other big one but you can at least understand why you'd try to do that. I think Herrera has been extremely good in his appearances for his first season in English football. Offers us so much in the middle and makes us play better as a team.

7777~~~
He was making plenty of tackles at the start of the season before he was dropped

7778~~~
Just love watching him play, he sets the tempo of the team perfectly. The way he keeps the ball under pressure is great.

7779~~~
I remember reading an interview with Herrera where he mentions that long passing is something he needs to work on.
Fantastic today, complete performance from him.

7780~~~
He was amazing today. One of the most exciting midfield performances I've seen from a United player in years. Some of his touches and turn were on some Zidane level, he took the absolute piss at times. I loved every minute of it.

7781~~~
Can we get one of them highlights videos of every touch he made today?

7782~~~
Gem of a player. Him and Mata are just so easy on the eye and on the same wavelength. Love the pair of them.

7783~~~
For a CM there's a hell of a lot more to defending than making tackles.

7784~~~
Yep agree with that.

7785~~~
This guy is built for Champions League football.  It would be such an incredible shame if we do not get into the Champions League next season. I can see him really kicking on and being in team of the year next year

7786~~~
As far as I'm concerned he's basically been the same player all season, and for some reason it just took Van Gaal six months to get comfortable with the idea of him as a regular starter. I don't care though - he's a starter now, and that's what matters.

I love how he's able to go into a tackle knowing he won't be first to the ball, but still be the one to win it. He reads the opponent's intentions and positions himself to make the block, rather than trying in vain to get to the ball first. He's also got the knack of sliding in such a way that he can be back on his feet instantly to gather up the loose ball.

7787~~~

7788~~~
Brilliant footwork

7789~~~
Agreed. It's not like he's changed his game drastically to start being played in the side. It was evident very early on that he was going to be a good player for us and one of our best midfielders. I still not convinced LvG is fully on board yet. Once Shaw or Rojo are back I'd imagine Blind goes back to midfield. Then LvG has to make some decisions. At the moment I would drop Blind or Fellaini to keep Herrera in the side. He really is a fantastic player. Some people have to remember this is his first season in the EPL. So yes there is a learning curve but he has come on far better than any of our other first season players bar maybe Blind.

7790~~~
He's my favorite United player.

Yes, he has a lot that he can improve on, but I really think he is a great all round midfielder.

He can play as a deep-lying playmaker, as well as further up the pitch and is not scared to put in a challenge.

7791~~~
Yep. I'm a big fan of Blind but he has to be in competition with Carrick, not with Herrera. If LVG wants Carrick in the starting XI then it's clearly Blind who has to make way (either to the bench or into LB like today.)

I reckon Rojo, when fit, is first choice with Smalling, narrowly ahead of Jones. As for Shaw, I like him but at the moment I doubt LVG would start him at LB ahead of Blind, and given how solid Blind has been there recently, I wouldn't argue.

Nice problems to have, anyway.

7792~~~

7793~~~
Loved his performance.

7794~~~
So one game we're all complaining that Van Gaal has changed his game, the next we're saying he's always played this way. Make your mind up, redcafe.

7795~~~
He can keep us happy with highlight videos all season. He is a one man highlight reel.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7796~~~
I think he has tweaked his game. He definitely has more discipline about him.

7797~~~
He has become my favourite player too. It is the touch and technique. His weight of passing as well.

7798~~~
Agreed. Better player for it too.

7799~~~
The club didn't fork out 30m on this guy for nothing, he's a talent. It takes some foreign players longer to settle than others, and he's starting to find his pace now. Next season he'll be brilliant.

7800~~~
I do think he's improved since the beginning of the season. He's more positionally disciplined as you say and he seems to be pushed off the ball a lot less now, and generally he seems more settled, but I think he's generally been one of our best players in almost every game he's played right from the start.

7801~~~
I think he played a riskier game earlier on as part of the diamond, which made us fluid but a bit less solid, and also affected his defensive stats (obviously) and his edge in attack positively. I still maintain that he was still, on balance, our best CM back then, just playing a different role.

As one of the two CM's in this formation he's tweaked his game and he's still a brilliant little player.

I will never understand Van Gaal and his reasoning for benching Herrera in favour of playing people like Rooney, Mata or Fellaini in CM. I also will never understand those who didn't see his qualities earlier on, even though he did play a different game.

7802~~~
Yup. My thoughts excactly. 

He misplaced more passes when playing a riskier game. Got more assists and goals for it, though, so it depends on instructions, formations and roles. Still been one of our best players in most of the matches he's played.

7803~~~
This guy speaks a lot of sense regarding Herrera's impact on the game.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3v-r2PY41V4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

7804~~~
He is the perfect mixture of Spanish flair and technique, mixed with British grittiness and hardwork. He really seems to relish the battling side of the game, which I think has shown why he has improved already this season, he will only get better and better too.

7805~~~
I didn't realize Scholes visited a tanning booth.

All jokes aside, he is a very bright technical midfielder. He has the eye for the splitting pass and he reads the game very well. Had a crummy period but fair play to the guy for keeping his head up and battle his way into the team and never losing sight of his XL spot ever since.

7806~~~
Was brilliant today. Was looking forward to seeing him partner Carrick all season, they didn't disappoint. Perfectly compliment each other.

7807~~~
Yeah true, its great to see the chemistry they have playing together. I'd like to see Di Maria added to the duo as I believe all 3 would be magnificent together. Obviously someone would have to make way to make that possible, I'd say Fellaini but he played well today so would be harsh. I'd love to see...

.....on the pitch together and Fellaini as plan B.

7808~~~
Even as a huge Ander supporter, I have to admit that he was guilty of over complicating things and getting flustered when spaces were closed down at the start of the season. Maybe it was the pressure of playing at a club he has a great deal of admiration for or him being in and out of the starting XI or perhaps the frantic pace of the league which forces you to process everything quickly and at times make ill judged decisions ? But he is slowly progressing to the level of performances he evidenced at Zaragoza and Bilbao, which is a positive indicator of things to come. A few of his touches (both against Tottenham and in previous matches) are probably the best of any United player since Berbatov. 

Once he gets more settled into his position and fully grasps Van Gaal's ideology, I have no doubt that he can be one of the unanimous Top 3 central midfielders in the league and form one of the strongest tandems around with Carrick and whatever player(s) we end up buying in the summer. A lot of people were questioning the transfer at the start of the season but once Ander starts stringing these sort of performances week in and week out, it'll be more than justified in the long run. The keyword for him now is just consistency and keeping a stranglehold on his place in the teamsheet (which admittedly is a bit out of his control at times with a manager like Louis). And hopefully all this chatter of Van Gaal not rating him and planning to ship him out is put to bed too.

7809~~~
Very good performance, he is excellent.

7810~~~
Anything to avoid using the p-word!

7811~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7812~~~
The creative midfielder is the heart of the attack, he's crucial to our success and we have no natural backup.

7813~~~
He played well although I was surprised at people talking about him as a MotM contender - for me Rooney, Fellaini, Carrick and Young were all comfortably ahead.

That is the sort of role I have wanted to see Herrera in though, not as a #10 but as a proper central midfielder, with one of Carrick/Blind next to him, allowing Ander to push forwards and link midfield and attack.

7814~~~
The Yang to Carrick's Yin today. Hopefully it's a midfield pairing we stick with, I think it's our best. Shame we haven't used it more often!

7815~~~
Carrick's been great today but imagine for the seasons coming, Herrera playing alongside Schneiderlin, that wouldn't simply be fair pairing for the opposition. 

It's all about confidence, letting him be more adventureous and not only him but other players too. 

Herrera could be one of the best players not only in the league if we start to play with high pressing game, he's born to play like that. He has all set of skills - he can defend, steal the balls, setting quick counters, link everything in pace, release through passes and poach some goals too. That's one of the reasons he was so good at Bilbao. They're game has been very intense. We need to play like we played in the first half more often.

7816~~~
Agreed with every word of this. Schneiderlin was fantastic today. I'm worried he'll sign for Liverpool or Arsenal and be a massive upgrade in the spots Gerrard and Coquelin have played in.

7817~~~
My kind of midfielder: flair and technique mixed with grittiness, closing down, and generally hurrying your opponents, but also intelligently keeping track of your positioning and staying defensively solid. Now, he isn't top class in all those aspects but you can tell he loves them all, and he certainly has the talent. if he can get it all together, we will have a gem on our hands. My MOTM today because I believe his movement, passing, and work-rate was the main factor for breaking down the Spurs midfield.

7818~~~
A lot of matchgoing fans rated him very highly, for most of them he was MOTM. I just think that his movement and his presence all over the pitch gets noticed better at the stadium than on the TV. I thought Rooney, Fellaini and Carrick were better, but Herrera's performance was great too. Hope he keeps it up and nothing happens with the trial of match fixing allegations. Can see him getting soon called up for Spain, should have happened earlier if it wasnt for the injuries.

7819~~~
Couldn't give him MOTM because there were a few players who were better, but he was very good. Loved his defensive work the most, with his interceptions and tackles.

7820~~~
I like the way he links with the wide men as well. Whenever he gets in those areas he looks menacing.

7821~~~
I'm a huge fan of his play so I tend to take note of his work even on TV, but I agree that it would be more apparent watching at the stadium. He gambled a little too much with closing down on a couple of occasions, which got us open every time. It's a delicate balance, but I believe he can get it right because every time it happened he was quick to close down other lanes to allow other players to easily bail him out. Its obvious but playing consistently will massively help him on this, more so because other players will understand him better. Ultimately I feel shaping our team play on his style would be a fantastic way to go, we would literally suffocate teams, and at the same time everyone would understand each others risks and respond correctly if a teammate is beaten.

7822~~~
Not just tackles, his defensive positioning and general defensive game is improving, better than anything I've seen from him previously, earlier in the season he was playing well but we were too open at times, in the last few games he has shown a bit more discipline and is improving that aspect of his game.

7823~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> It's amazing isn't it? When he doesn't play well it's Van Gaal restricting him and when he does play well, it's because he's class. As much as I like Herrera, it is very clear that he is now playing like a proper CM, something he did not show earlier in the season, and which was why he was dropped. Credit to the manager and player, for putting the hard work into that. In that diamond, his lack of defensive nous left us exposed too much, I'm glad he seems to be working hard to overcome that weakness. Credit to player and manager.

7824~~~
From very good, to poor and will be sold, to great again. That's how this thread has swung this season.

7825~~~
Fair enough, its true he was making tackles but Blind was left exposed too often despite Blind himself doing a good job

7826~~~
He's a terrific midfielder and his defensive workrate has been underrated for a good while. He positions himself very well and what's absolutely key in his game is that whenever he manages to win the ball back he's very quick to release it and pick a good pass, which sets us up for a good counter attack plenty of time. He's pretty strong too IMO.

7827~~~
So what we're saying is Herrera is a better central midfielder then Rooney, Mata or Fellaini?....Who would have thought it eh?

Its criminal how LVG has used him this season. At least he seems to have finally learnt his lesson.

7828~~~
I loved the way he took a dropping ball in his stride when he was (incorrectly) called offside in the second half. Instant control with the outside of his right foot and a pefectly weighted pass to Rooney with his left. A really elegant bit of football. Anyone got a gif?

7829~~~
Yup. That's how I see it too. No more getting caught upfield ahead of the ball. His defensive positioning is hugely improved and he's much more aware of runners coming from deep. Seems like a really intelligent footballer, so no great surprise he's able to adapt and evolve his game so quickly. He's actually the sort of clever player that Van Gaal will really appreciate. Can see him becoming a real favourite of the manager if he keeps this up.

7830~~~
Forget his passing. That's a given. We clearly knew he would be top tier in that aspect.

Its his ability to close down, press and win tackles. Its been some time since we've seen someone not named Carrick do that kind of defensive work in midfield. Shockingly suited for the Premiership and he has the potential to go on to be one of the best in this league. If he hits the gym and gets stronger then watch out!

Its crazy that we haven't used him more often earlier in the season (I know he was injured for a lot of it). Hopefully he will be a mainstay in the team EVEN if we are struggling.

7831~~~
He drew a lot of appreciation applause for beautiful touches and passing I noticed.

It was a great run and control but I think that Lloris would have got out to the pass if the whistle didn't go.

7832~~~
Probably. He's lightening off his line. Did look to be in that really tricky zone where he would risk conceding a pen if he over committed though. Feck it, I'm giving Hererra the benefit of the doubt!

7833~~~
The thing that frustrates me most is we wouldn't be struggling if we hadn't have insisted on benching Herrera, wasting Rooney in midfield and losing the benefit of his goals and movement at #9, just to accommodate the out of form Falcao and Van Persie. Just look at last Monday's F.A. Cup tie against Arsenal. We were on top at half time, yes it was an open game, but we were far more of an attacking threat in the first half than we were in the second. Without Herrera's mobility and dynamism we wilted against Arsenal, as we have in so many other games this season. Had we been playing the best team, instead of the (on paper) best players, we'd be fighting for the title.

Herrera offers the team, with his energy, effort and ability, the capacity to press from the front, pressure the ball and play a proactive game. The result of that kind of football, as opposed to the zombie football we've seen for much of the season, was in evidence yesterday against Spurs. Herrera is not at the level where you would be talking about him as one of the world's best in his position. However, he's got something we don't get from other players. That alone should guarantee he starts in our midfield, until or unless someone obviously better is signed.

7834~~~
My favourite summer signing - this lad will get better as he gets more used to the elague too.

7835~~~

7836~~~
I don't know why, but I worry about Herrera getting dropped again. I just don't get the sense that LVG rates as highly as the fans do. Will be interesting to see what he does when Shaw comes back from injury. I wouldn't be surprised to see him dropped for Blind.

7837~~~
His ability to go into a 50-50 on the ground and come out with the ball is quite incredible. I'm not sure if its because of some amazing judgement, or because he's just a tenacious little fecker. Either way, its blooming great.

7838~~~
After yesterday, no chance. Van Gaal specifically mentioned him and Mata as having excellent games and he's clearly changed with regards to Herrera, probably due to Herrera changing his ways a bit to be more cautious (which in fairness he needed to become, to an extent). Balanced it perfectly on the weekend and was great defensively so I highly doubt Van Gaal will change anything. The only thing I can see him changing is Rojo in for Jones maybe and Di Maria in for Mata, though I'd be very hesitant to do either of those.

7839~~~
Yeah agree with you completely. At the start of the season Herrera was too risky. He was pulling off some sublime passes and skills but would also lose the ball a fair bit. He's growing into his role here with each game now, fantastic to see him doing well.

7840~~~
Don't see that happening, he resembles a proper CM instead of an AM playing in midfield (like at the early stages of this season). He is pivotal for our midfield to work, and I really don’t think LvG would like to mess with it right now.

7841~~~
Yeah, though to be fair I still would have played him as he generally was among our best players even then and wasn't <i>that </i>much of a liability defensively. Glad to finally see him with Carrick though. Carrick is much better then Blind positionally speaking and in terms of holding the midfield and keeping it solid defensively. Always felt Herrera next to him would be great, on paper at least, and it proved to be that way on the pitch.

7842~~~
I missed the LVG, what did he say about Herrera and Mata? Hope you guys are right though.

7843~~~
I'm not worried about it as I'm certain it'll happen. He's like Mata to LVG IMO.

7844~~~
Can't remember exactly but I saw it on twitter, something like I'm very pleased with the performances of Mata and Herrera and Fellaini especially. You know, as close as it gets to glowing praise from Van Gaal.

7845~~~
I agree that he will get dropped. I would be surprised if he starts against Liverpool if Shaw is back. I just dont think van Gaal will ever trust him completely in the CM role.

7846~~~
He played really well but Liverpool will be a totally different challenge.

7847~~~
Then more fool him. Because Shaw will likely pull something within the first half. I would play Carrick and Herrera.

7848~~~
People still think LVG doesnt rate him, but I dont know based on what exactly.

7849~~~
He always comes across as an intelligent lad, I think he actually sees him as a bit of a project, which actually appears to be working. It's taking time, but it is coming together. LvG said it takes time for some players, wasn't actually thinking he meant changing Ander Herrera into another player completely. He has asked him to adjust his game which he is doing. If he refused then he would be in trouble, but has taken it on board. The thing about settling in the country, language etc do not appear to have affected him at all.

7850~~~
I don't see how people cannot see that Ander has clearly tailored his game to what LvG wants from a CM, the interesting aspect is that Fellaini has the more attacking license of the midfield 3 right now, but if we get the right CM in, in the summer then I think that will free Ander up, still playing as a CM but with more freedom than right now.

7851~~~
Herrera has certainly improved on how van Gaal wants his box-to-box players to be, but because we're still playing Fellaini I don't think he sees him ready for this role fully yet. In van Gaal's playstyle the number 10 is extremely important and does most of the creative passing, so Fellaini playing there isn't really his style. He plays pointing forward in a middle 3, with the CDM and box-to-box as defensive minded players.

Therefore I still think we'll bring in a specialised box-to-box midfielder which leaves Herrera competing for the #10 and maybe as box-to-box backup. He needs to be able to switch his mindset for this though: at #10 he can be free and creative, as a box-to-box midfielder he can't because he's one of the 4 defensive minded players. 

Unless he significantly improves his defensive awareness he will be seen as creative by van Gaal and won't play as a defensive minded player much next season. This season he's doing a fine job though.

7852~~~
I agree, I don't think long terms LvG sees Ander as a #8 and that is the position he will look to improve on, but I think Ander is the lead choice in our current squad to play as the #10 style CM once LvG gets his box to box player in.
For instance the recent Nainggolan rumours make sense as he can play the way LvG wanted Vidal or Strootman to, and Herrera will fit in as the #10/AM with Carrick as the #6.

7853~~~
Naninggoalan is a good shout, not crooked like Strootman, good defensively, has a good pas and shot on him and on top of that he can run all day long. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> He's full of energy and is everything you want in a CM.

7854~~~
Poor Paddy if we sign him!

7855~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He can call him by his name then. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7856~~~
Especially if Nani ends up coming back.

7857~~~
Yes, he kinda reminds me of Vidal before the knee injury, he has many of the same qualities and would add a different dimension to our midfield.

7858~~~
He wont be the next Scholes but his work rate and energy is just outstanding. He also does the simple stuff perfectly, which is a very underrated quality imo

Lvgs biggest fault this season is benching him so much

7859~~~
Couldn't find any highlight reel of his for the game against Tottenham.

Some care to help me out?

7860~~~
Rooney isn't <i>that</i> creative for a 10 in the sense he is predictable at times therefore I can see Louis van Gaal using him as a 9 and why not? He will guarantee goals in my opinion and he is very creative for a 9.

Herrera and Mata both could be excellent 10's and I see the manager using them for this, there are plenty of games, rotation will be necessary next season providing we get European football and when you factor injuries etc, what a wonderful position to have both Herrera and Mata compete for the 10 position.

But it goes further, these two players are different, it allows for more tactical flexibility and so if both players are in good form the one selected could be based on the opposition strengths and weaknesses.

7861~~~
Just make it Nani-goal.

Thanks a lot. Must have been uploaded recently.

What an excellent performance by him. He was everywhere. Tackling near our box, center of the park, and also in the final third. Not to forget the passing triangles he was a part of with Mata and Valencia on the right wing. Definitely my favourite player in the team right now.

7864~~~
Pass of the season?  Has to be up there, what an assist.

7865~~~
He's a little beast.

7866~~~
I love how he is right in there on any loose touch from a 'pool player. We've caused quite a few turnovers, need to try hit a bit quicker though.

7867~~~
Remember when people said he was average and shouldn't be starting? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7868~~~
Been terrific in tandem with Mata. One thing impresses me most is his ability to defend and press.

Glad he has found form and looks to be a mainstay in the first eleven.

7869~~~
I love the way he presses. 

He's awesome.

7870~~~
Between him and Mata for best player so far. However, considering they have been playing like they are one player, we can say Marrera has been the best so far.

7871~~~
Still don't understand why he was dropped. He wasn't playing at this level, but not bad enough to not play at all.

Same with Mata. That random absence after a good run of form was truly baffling. 

Glad to see some of the big names benched to get the in-form enthusiastic guys in.

7872~~~
Truly baffling. Mata was our best player for a month and he was just inexplicably dropped. Great to see them come back and play well.

7873~~~
Bargain.

7874~~~
Him and Mata are just running rings around that right channel. His touch and movement is just really refreshing to see. Valencia has been decent but a more direct and skillful RB could really let them run havoc.

7875~~~
Super little player. Like a young Paul Scholes that can tackle <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ok I exaggerated a bit but you get it.

7876~~~
Loved his reaction to the Mata goal, hopefully there was a camera on him

7877~~~
What a player. That pass to Mata was the peach of a pass

7878~~~
A fecking little clever pitbull player. I fecking love him. I declare that 'can't believe he's not Scholes' is his, now.

7879~~~
I think he's just brilliant. No one'll be wincing at the price tag when it's all said and done.

7880~~~
Great performance. Fantastic assist for Mata. I've probably been a bit harsh on him but the lad put in a great performance today.

7881~~~
These are the games where the quality players stand up and are counted. Ander you are quality.

7882~~~
Dominated Liverpool. What a man.

7883~~~
Love how he contemplated smashing Gerrard for the tackle on Mata but was smart enough to pull out. Proper United player.

7884~~~

7885~~~
Yeah, brilliant all-round midfield performance... you couldn't really ask for more.

7886~~~
He's a fantastic player, and he seems to have improved defensively too. Just a few months back we were worried about him not being in LVG's plans and now he's one of the first names on the team sheet.

Herrera x Mata 4 lyfe.

7887~~~
What a player. Makes the people doubting him earlier look silly.

7888~~~
Brilliant.

7889~~~
Starting to really love the guy. His assist for Mata was top drawer, and he's just an archetypal Spanish midfielder, isn't he? Great technique, great movement, great passing, an eye for goal, and also a real competitive edge.

Needs to be considered a nailed on first teamer.

7890~~~
He was excellent today, he and Juan Mata's link up play at times was magical.

7891~~~
Couldn't agree more bring in Di Maria for Young and Rojo for Jones and we are looking like a good outfit again!

7892~~~
Is it too early to name a stand after him? If not, can we make it the Kop?

7893~~~
His allround game.seems to have improved this season. "I can make every player better, it's true" LvG

Ermhagerd!!!!!!!! Ermhagerd!!!!! Juanito!!!!!!

7896~~~
Love him.  He's seriously excellent.

7897~~~
Fast becoming the midfielder that we needed for years. Been exceptional recently. Has it all.

7898~~~
A class display, his calmness on the ball was vital and his intelligent use of it was a huge part of our ability to control the game.

7899~~~
I love him such an intelligent player who does no much.

7900~~~
Fantastic player. Works well with Mata and alongside Carrick. Brings something different to the squad than most of those around him.

7901~~~
I fecking love him, that reaction was exactly what I was doing here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant player, 7 tackles in the game apparently too, loves to get stuck in.

7902~~~
Great game. Alongside Mata our best player on the pitch today.

7903~~~
No doubt about it.

Those tackling stats and THAT assist. How has Herrera not played more for Man Utd this season..?

7904~~~
What a player. Absolutely dominated Liverpool's midfield. Fast becoming my favourite player, if he isn't already.

7905~~~
Proved why all of us wanted him to start every game, he's such a great player

7906~~~
Balls out performance from him.

Helped us dominate the game and beautiful assist.

Weird having a properly functional, creative and dominant midfield. Bravo.

7907~~~
My favourite player right now. Sublime.

Nearly shat myself when Van Gaal took him off for Rooney but fortunately Rooney did much better in CM than up top today.

7908~~~
Whoscored.com have him with 7 tackles today. He is a fan favourite but strangely gets little attention from the media.

7909~~~
Always loved the kid from the get go. If he keeps improving, he'll soon be something special.

7910~~~
He's such a fantastic midfielder, it's amazing that LVG left him out for such a long time. Him and Mata are just beautiful to watch together.

7911~~~
It's the media. Once they settle on a narrative its hard to make them change their tune. I am just glad LVG has remembered his worth.

7912~~~
He is genuinely one of the best CMs in the league. In recent weeks you'd struggle to find a better midfielder.

7913~~~
Him and Mata have a telepathic understanding. 

Brilliant performance by him. Again! He shouldn't be taken off in the end of the matches considering that he and Mata can kill the game by keeping the ball all day long.

7914~~~
Amazing player. Has really come into his own lately. 

Was brilliant today.

7915~~~
"Can't defend at all, another no 10."

7916~~~
Needs to be one of the first names on our team sheet in this form.

7917~~~
It is weird though, you never hear Gary Neville singling him out for praise in commentary either, no matter what he does.

7918~~~
nice combination of the spanish flair and british gritty in his game.

7919~~~
He was on a yellow to be fair and by taking him off we got rid of any chance he'd be sent off. Otherwise he was simply brilliant.

I think we have finally found balance in midfield with him, Carrick and Fellaini, with Mata outside too.

7920~~~
Herrera's first half was sensational. Best player on the pitch in those 45 mins. Much quieter in the 2nd half.

7921~~~
Top top top player. Perfect in a midfield three.

7922~~~
I llovee how he wanted to put one in on Gerrard to defend the honour of his best mate... good on him!

7923~~~
second best player on the pitch today.. hope that substitution was precautionary with the card and stamp.. He brilliantly reads the game further up the pitch it's not the first time his pressing high up the pitch won us a great opportunity to score. Fantastic all round player, well taken assist at the first goal, we need this through balls more..

7924~~~
I love this guy! easily becoming one of my favourite players he's brilliant.

7925~~~
Lucky not to have his leg broken by that over zealous, primadonna, Stevie me.

7926~~~
I hope we keep him. I think he's going to turn into one hell of a player for us. He's bedding in well now, getting used to the premier league and no doubt bulking up slightly. Very skillful, albeit still a talent developing.

7927~~~

7928~~~
Was brilliant. Should never have been booked either. It was just to appease the crowd somewhat.

7929~~~
Just sliced through the Liverpool defence with his pass, just cannot help replaying.

7930~~~
Just like Joe Allen, right <a class="username" data-user="85690, @Bob Loblaw" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85690/">@Bob Loblaw</a> ?

7931~~~
Immense today, who'd have thought that after so many of CM problems we'd solve it by playing 5 CDM/CM/CAMs in Herrera, Blind, Carrick, Fellaini, Mata at the same time <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7932~~~
And sticking Di Maria on the bench <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7933~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7934~~~
The guy is pure class.

7935~~~
No that's Xavi isn't it?

7936~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No idea what gave people the idea that he's average at best. Quality player, made Liverpool's misfield his bitch today.

7937~~~
For me he's the catalyst in making this formation/style of play work for us right now. He puts so much effort in tracking down players and intelligently positions himself to cut off passing avenues, he forces opposition players to play quickly and that's key in turning possession over quickly, add that to his creativity and eye for goal and we have a complete midfielder on our hands.

On current form is there a better midfielder in the prem right now?

<3

7941~~~
Again did the most defensive work. 7 tackles and 3 interceptions, 60 passes, 2 key passes at 86%. Impressive stuff, a perfect performance

7942~~~
He was playing at this level. Scored a couple in those few matches as well. I am just assuming that he was dropped after <i>that</i> Leicester match cause LvG didn't trust the defense and wanted to shore it up.

7943~~~
He's too busy praising everyone we play against to make sure nobody can accuse him of bias

7944~~~
He was once again immense. Just took the game to them, he once again set the tone. Best player behind Mata for me, though their understanding is wonderful.

7945~~~
He's going to be in the Spanish squad sooner rather than later

7946~~~
Why twist my words? I've already explained that post two or three times. It wasn't a comparison of their ability.

7947~~~
Very tidy and intelligent player. I love how he rolls opponents on the turn, drew a few fouls from it today.

7948~~~
Give him a bit of stick a few weeks ago for playing too safe, which I felt was down to Van Gaal's tactics, but since we've gone to a 433/4141 and Mata's been put into the team, he's been super. He's everywhere and has all the attributes to be that number eight Van Gaal's looking for. Greta performance.

7949~~~
Classic Herrera. Aura of positive energy in his performances. Tries to keep team in one shape.

Made Stevie Me raging quite quickly. Some kind of a new record.

7950~~~
Because of his slight frame his defensive work was seriously underrated. Pleased that he's getting plaudits now. On his tackle, why was Gerrard so angry to stamp on him? Looked potentially dangerous going in but then pulled out and didn't even make contact with him. I only saw it in slow-mo after the event, did it look worse in real time? Or did Slippy overreact?

7951~~~
Where's charleysurf these days

7952~~~
His yellow card was a joke
He overreacted. The tackle Gerrard made on Mata a few seconds ago was worse. Like you said, he didnt touch him and it wasnt really malicious.

7953~~~
Having watched it a few more times, I honestly have no idea what the feck Herrera even got a yellow for, he was no where near him really. The right leg comes out to block the pass and his left is trailing behind him. I think he's literally given it to appease the crowd.

7954~~~
That ball to Mata was sublime. Little whippet stealing the ball bike like it was going out of fashion.

7955~~~
The lad is a star <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> So happy for him that he's back in the team and performing well (The very same could be said about Mata too)!

7956~~~
I think he has the potential to be the best midfielder in the premiership. Technically I see no weaknesses with him but he just needs to keep growing in authority and confidence.

7957~~~
Fantastic again. That Mata/Herrera partnership down the right is just brilliant. Made Moreno look like a mug today

7958~~~
It isn't even an attempted tackle, he went to block the ball.  Nothing dangerous in it at all.  Gerrard can't even claim he retaliated in anger.  
Glad the referee and the linesman had the bollocks to do the right thing with SG.  Shouldn't have booked Herrera though.

7959~~~
What's going on? He's supposed to be my obsession.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7960~~~
Notice in the apology that Gerrard mentions Anders studs. Even the apology is trying to put some of the blame on Ander.

7961~~~
Such a classy footballer. I personally don't see how you can leave him out. His intelligence on the ball, his touch and quality on the ball is so blatantly obvious. He and mata look made to play with each other.

7962~~~
In addition to his good work defensively, I reckon he's our best "number 10" without being a number 10, as odd as that sounds, in that I think he links up play better than anyone else from central positions. He's better at it than rooney and possibly even Mata, who is looking more impressive cutting in.

7963~~~
Absolutely brilliant.

7964~~~
We can both fight over him

7965~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7966~~~
Does he have a girlfriend?

7967~~~
That touch and turn he does every time he plays is beautiful. Plays with a picture, complements Carrick so well in that midfield trio.

I'll never be fully convinced by Fellaini, which might be unfair but Herrera completely sold me from day one. Wonderful to watch his highlights every week.

7968~~~
Yep. Hard luck.

7969~~~
hands off, bitches! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

7970~~~
Damn. Mata's taken too.

If Keane had a basque mam, perhaps.  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

7979~~~
I actually think Herrera benefits a lot from having a Fellaini at #10.

We have seen previously this season that LVG is reluctant to use Herrera as a CM when we played with two strikers, or with Mata as #10. The fact that Fellaini offers a good amount defensively when playing there, allows us to have someone like Herrera - a primarily attacking CM - without being left too unbalanced.

Conversely, if Mata was playing centrally as #10, I don't think LVG would want to 'risk' having Herrera at CM as well, as he would see it as too attacking and not solid enough defensively.

The current system is exactly how I envisaged Herrera being used when we signed him, and I am very pleased that he is performing well.

7980~~~
How come he got a yellow, did nothing wrong

Had a great game <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7981~~~
The reason he was left out is where he has improved the most, defensively. His other abilities were never in question.

7982~~~
Links up so well with Mata. Would love to see a midfield of Mata, Herrera and Carrick one day.

7983~~~
did very well , great pass and was a dynamo on the pitch

7984~~~
He was class today, good stuff.

7985~~~
What? I thought he was mine <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We haven't had a player of his style in years. Doesn't shy away from a tackle either!

The Spanish Cleverley eh? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

7986~~~
He is better at every single aspect of the game than Cleverley. It is a ridiculous comparison. Ander is a complete midfielder for me.

7987~~~
Hopefully LVG has changed his mind on him. Him and Mata play so well together. Superb player.

7988~~~
His tackle on Gerrard which lead to the sending off was a retaliation for slippy's tough challenge on Mata. Looking out for his brethren.

7989~~~
Would get even more out of him if Valencia wasn't so hesitant at times.

7990~~~
He said Iniesta is his favourite player, you can tell the way he plays he models his game similar to him.

Technical engine, high pressing, vision and tracking.

7991~~~
Yep, couldn't care to go back just a few pages where someone called him an absolute passenger of a player and the Spanish Cleverley! I think it was the game he started after a long period out when he was actually fantastic. But yeah, a few weirdos aside, most have acknowledged the fact that he's a wonderful little player!

7992~~~
I still think his best position is AM. But thinking ahead to next season, will he play there ahead of Mata? LvG obviously wants a box to box player to balance things out. Might make it difficult to play both.

7993~~~
He is my obsession, too. There are so few midfielders around nowadays who have it all / who are as good at attacking as at defending. He is a great mix of a good Spanish and a good English midfielder, I love him. 

Oh and doesn't take any s*** either, a proper classic United midfielder!

7994~~~
On top of being a brilliant footballer, his attitude on the field and passion for the club makes it impossible not to like him. 

What a player.

7995~~~
Depends what type of 4-3-3 we use. If we play with a proper holding midfielder, Herrera plays the role he did today. If we play with a number 10, there is a shout for Herrera to be that advanced player. Presses so well, and it's nullified Spurs and Liverpool recently.

7996~~~
He's a great CM and will only improve as one too. Absolutely no need to move the best central midfielder we've signed since Carrick into AM.

7997~~~
Just finished watching the match.  My hands are still shaking but I have to say that Herrera was one of the better players today.  Hope he continues to start for us.

7998~~~
The thing I enjoyed most about his performance today was how he just turned up at Anfield and stuck 2 fingers up at them.

He got stuck in and absolutely killed it. Poor old Henderson and Allen had no idea what was happening. Definitely his best game so far.

7999~~~
Can someone photoshop a hat into Mata's hand?!

8001~~~
He's <i>like</i> a better version of Oscar. Not only does he get stuck in and put tackles in, he also is creative and brilliant with his vision. He seems to be three steps ahead when he receives the ball. Absolutely mental. 

You can also tell that he is loving it here, which makes him all the more endearing.

8002~~~
His tackling has been brilliant to watch, hasn't it.  It's at the point where it's almost 50/50 when you see the opposition gain possession, you see Anders and his winger converge and think, Anders is going to get that.

8003~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

*** pass, btw... Herrera's pass for Mata's first was absolutely stunning.

I will say his first touch technique on certain occasions looks a bit like Bambi on ice.  Still love him, though.

8005~~~

Topn notch banter. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8010~~~
I thought he was absolutely fantastic. First half displays was one of the best CM performances I've seen in the PL this season. He's such an interesting bundle of characteristics. An excellent tackler, who is also elegant and technical in possession. Kind of like Oscar, I guess, without the cheating and arseholery. I felt the Arsenal performance was being talked up a bit but he deserves all the praise he gets after yesterday. Quality.

8011~~~
Much stronger too.

8012~~~
Has that court case gone away yet? Certainly seems to have rediscovered his form from the 1st 3rd for the season, perhaps that was playing on his mind.

Long may it continue <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8013~~~
Far better passing range, too. I see the comparison, though.

8014~~~
He's excellent. He's got it all, and all things considered he's having a pretty good first year in English football. Absolutely love him. Now he and Juan can get their magic working on keeping De Gea at the club.

8015~~~
Agreed. I also loved the way after Gerrard crunched into Mata, Ander thinks 'nah, not having that' and goes crashing into Gerrard himself. We need a bit of that in midfield. He's good technically but he's got that edge to his game, he's a fighter.

8016~~~
He has a fine balance between Spanish skill and finesse and English grit and determination. Such a class player.

8017~~~
Herrera and Mata are both on the same wave length. If we can get another attacker in sync with them it'd take some stopping.

8018~~~
This

And this. 

Awesome player. There was another lad from Bilbao, Itturaspe, how has he been doing in La Liga?

8019~~~
I think he has been injured. Noticed he has been on the bench recently for Bilbao, so just coming back and they are hitting a bit of form, so might just be eased along back into the team as no rush.

8020~~~
Considering it's his first season in a new League he's been fantastic. His characteristics compliment Carrick so well; his energy, creativity, tackling ability and stamina are all very, very good.

Even his poor games have some mitigation; a lack of game time or being brought back too quickly from injury.

8021~~~
It's good to see that we have left all this nonsense about van Gaal being ready to ship him off and about Ander feeling frustrated because he wants to have a more advanced role on the pitch behind us. Each week he looks better and more confident in the role LvG has given him. Most people will focus on his beautiful assist but his overall performance yesterday was magnificent. 

There were big parts during yesterday's game in which our passing game was quick, precise and aimed to expose the gaps in Liverpool's midfield and he played a big part in that. He was always making himself available for a pass in our half and that was important cause Liverpool is a team who can press high. He provided an extra option for the CBs to pass the ball out of the defense, he took some pressure off Carrick and formed a very successful triangle with Valencia and Mata on the right wing. 

But the most impressive aspect of his game was his defending off the ball. It's clear that he's been working on that at Carrington and it seems like the more he understands the role the more he enjoys his time on the pitch. Don't forget that Rodgers had Coutinho lurking in that area of the pitch and that Henderson was constantly looking for a long shot chance. We offered them very little space to run with the ball and very few chances for a good shot  or a key pass and had set double-teams everywhere in our third. Herrera played a big part in nullifying Coutinho's threat yesterday.

I'm sure he'll get even better and that his impact in the first team will increase as the players' roles on the pitch become more and more distinct (same thing goes for Mata).

8022~~~
Would love it if he can establish himself as one of the prem's best midfielders next season .

8023~~~
Yeah i get that too. He is often the first one to come off in the second half, should he start. That was the case yesterday too when Carrick was the one making mistakes in the second half which also led to Sturridge's goal.

8024~~~
The best thing about his performance yesterday, when he wanted to give one back to Gerrard because his mate had one put on him.

8026~~~
That was his best performance so far. He was great against Hull and probably had more influence on the game that time, that wasn't at Anfield though! Not gonna get too carried yet, we know all too well what a couple of injuries and loss of form can do to a player. Him, Fellaini and Carrick looks really balanced, hopefully we stick with this until the end of the season if possible. Di Maria can play on the wing until then

8027~~~

Really interesting interview there. It is in Spanish, but I'm sure Google Translate will give a good enough gist of it.

8028~~~
Interesting from that interview is his comments about van Gaal having a go at him a few times early in the season for going looking for the ball too much. Explains why he wasn't in the team as much as most fans wanted him to be at the time. Clearly van Gaal insists that his players follow his instructions to the letter and we as fans probably got a bit carried away with Herrera's dynamism given our lack of that type of midfielder for years and were more than ready to forgive him losing possession occasionally as a result. LVG has now found a way to get both Herrera and Fellaini into the team that gives us different options to get the ball forward, either direct to Fellaini or via Herrera, Mata and Carrick. Having both options is giving our opponents problems at the minute and leaving the spaces for either Fellaini or Mata to get into positions they can be most effective.

8029~~~
Really refreshing to see us having a truly dominant midfield again, and he's been a big part of that. The last 5-6 years we have really struggled whenever we were put under big pressure on the ball, but what a difference it makes having someone like Herrera and Mata in there who can handle it no problem and instantly kill that pressure. Doesn't get fazed at all when people close him down because of his brilliant and consistent first touch and quickly moves the ball on to just leave the opposition out of position. Where before we'd have players sit too long on it, and so as a whole we were susceptible to being put under pressure, yesterday showed more then anything how big of an impact having technically brilliant midfielders can have.

Liverpool tried pressing us from the start, but realized shortly into the game that they were just being moved out of position and weren't getting anything out of it because how quick thinking Herrera and Mata are and how good they are on the ball.

Interesting interview though, seems to be very honest but also has a great attitude as well. You can definitely see the difference in his positioning and as he said how he used to always chase after the ball to get it back and so dragging the others around, while now he picks his moments a lot better and has really improved his defensive game (even after it was pretty good earlier on anyways).

Probably our signing of the season, certainly my favourite one. On this kind of form probably the best midfielder in the league as well, considering the only two who I would consider more talented/better generally are Fabregas and Toure and they are way off form.

8030~~~
He is pure class. We just seem to play proper football when he's on song. The link he has with Mata will be one I can't wait to enjoy over the coming years.

8031~~~
Also to add onto my previous point... Whenever somebody says that Henderson is better then Herrera, laugh and show them this (works with Ramsey as well):


He's better in every way.

8032~~~
I think he's fecking fantastic and I reckon he's got a few big goals in him as well. 

Imagine him in a few years..

8033~~~
On the one hand I'm gutted we had to wait a year to sign him as he is exactly what we've been crying out for during the Passenger Era. On the other he avoided catching the Moyes virus that the rest are finally starting to shake off.

8034~~~
I honestly believe that if all goes well, Herrera will be one of the finest midfielders in the PL for years to come.

If you think about it he's got literally every attribute in his game - fantastic passer, fantastic CLEAN tackler, scores goals, intelligence - and he's being managed by Van Gaal...

I also love how much of a student of the game he is. His interviews are so refreshing and insightful.

God, watching that back it just dawns on me what a great, great game it was.

To beat them at their own game with such craft and such confidence. A sweet day.

8035~~~
Along with his Spanish amigos, my favourite United player at the moment. So glad to see some of his former critics praising him now.

8036~~~
Mark my words that boy will lift the European cup in a Manchester United shirt. Possibly as captain.

8037~~~
no pressure.

8038~~~
Easy there. I'm very hopeful we'll win the champions league within the next 5 years but he's not gonna be captain at United, that's something that will always go to the homegrown/british players I think. Rooney for the foreseeable future, after him who knows. Though if there's one foreign player in with a real shot of getting it, if he's still here when Rooney is done, it would be De Gea for sure.

8039~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8040~~~
That was some stubborn virus, once it was there it started to spread at a devastating rate even months into LvG's season. As you say only now / recently it has been defeated. Imagine Moyes had stayed longer, it would have taken us almost a decade to heal afterwards!

8041~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> almost a decade

8042~~~
He cost a lot but he's starting to show that he might have been worth it and perhaps he would have made a big difference to last season if Moyes had him available.

8043~~~
Pledging yourself to the club without being pressured to do so, and without answering in cryptic, open ended soundbites.

So easy to do, yet so rare. Nice from Herrera.

8044~~~
Yeah I came to the thread to make just this point. Good football matters, but at anfield you also have to stick up for each other when the tackles start flying in. Good to know someone's going to give it out if needed.

8045~~~
It was another great performance from Herrera, and his quick thinking is something we've dearly missed in midfield since Scholes left.

The fact that he's always unfazed under pressure is really useful for us against aggressive teams like Liverpool. His composure and calmness on the ball was a huge factor in helping us handle Liverpool's pressure. I should also mention that, even if he's playing with more discipline, he still finds moments where he enters the final third and has a chance to score (case in point: his blocked long shot just before Mata scored his second goal).

It's clear to see that his studious approach to the sport along with his enthusiasm for it was a huge factor in him learning from intelligent coaches like Bielsa, Valverde, and van Gaal. Bielsa gave him the aggression, defensive positioning, and quick-thinking, Valverde provided him with discipline and composure to his game, and van Gaal is currently shaping up those qualities into him becoming a potentially all-rounded footballer.

I really hope he can become a mainstay in our team wherever he plays. I think I've said this many times, but him being on the pitch makes the whole team sharper and quicker on their feet.

8046~~~
Absolutely agree, we need more of that, builds and shows team spirit.

8047~~~
Great engine, good tackler, has a good shot, good vision and quite frankly, outstanding technique compared to many others of our midfielders. 

Especially one moment against Spurs he impressed. Held of two players, did a nice little turn near the sideline and then released Valencia with a sweet chip

8048~~~
He's such a player. His latest interview really highlights the troubles he's had and they are more about LVG's specific tactics rather than LVG not rating Herrera. 

Herrera would have been so fecking great under SAF in an aggressive box to box role. I am hoping that after Herrera learns to control the pace he plays at - LVG gives him more room to use the fact that he can suddenly force the team to play at the highest pace in a split second.

8049~~~
He’s The Midfielder That Represents Value For Money.

Seriously, if he improves his long passing he can become one of the best in this league. Not sure he will get into Spain national team, but he’s like the perfect Spanish midfielder for Premier League. Absolutely love him, such a difference he makes.

It’s worth pointing out how consistent he is.

8050~~~
Love him. Probably my favourite player already.

8051~~~
I posted this back in September:
I think the Liverpool game confirms that he really is a big game player. I watched him a lot last season at Athletic Club (I just had a feeling that we would go back in for him) and he was good all round but really showed himself in the big games particularly away. He hasn't has as much of a chance starting in all of our big games this season but he played well at Anfield. He was dominant and determined to make his mark. I seriously adore him.

8052~~~
What's this then?

8053~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://deportes.elpais.com/deportes/2015/03/22/actualidad/1427045616_015938.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://deportes.elpais.com/deportes/2015/03/22/actualidad/1427045616_015938.html</a>

I think there is a thread about it with translations.

8054~~~
Cheers.

8055~~~
You're welcome. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> It is a really good read, one of the most in depth interviews I've seen in a long while for United. Usually the players say as little as possible in the media but Herrera was completely honest, shows good confidence.

8056~~~
Is there a proper translated transcript of the interview or are you talking just about the bits that have been posted in tweets on the thread?

8057~~~
I've just read the one I posted, but I found the interview through those tweets so assumed they'd have translated it all as it isn't that long. They must have.

8058~~~
Nice to not talk about CM being our problem for a season, and the reason for this is Herrera in my opinion. As Carrick gets older it may come back into play.

8059~~~
Then he will need to make sure he has a replacement in place for Carrick. I am just hoping Michael doesn't play for England. At least Ander and Juan are getting a rest.

8060~~~
agree, he's playing like robot too, cannot play the through ball to the central midfielder.. with Rafael there we would be certainly more threatening

8061~~~
He really is a great blend of Spanish brain, and English 'grit', as somebody said a few pages back.

8062~~~
The way he owned that midfield during the first half was a joy to watch. How many times did he break their possession, inside their half? Made a fool out of Allen on numerous occasions. 

He's figured out the system and now has LVG's confidence. Greatness awaits if this continues.

8063~~~
Interesting in the El Pais article hearing him talk about LvG telling him to maintain his position more and stop ball chasing.

When the original rumours about us buying him came up I was one of those who compared him to Steve Gerrard (different skillset and ranking, before anyone goes after that) a lovely player, a real fighter, a potential fan favourite but who might not have the "discipline" of a typical Spanish midfielder. A better English midfielder than Spanish one in fact.

It may be that he's met LvG at the ideal moment in his career. He can develop a new kind of positional sense and style of play. Hopefully he will become the ideal match for United and the PL. I hope so, he's one of those players I really like to watch and one who seems to have the personality to be something special for us.

8064~~~
Yep, reading that yesterday reminded me of Benitez' quip about Gerrard running too much, that he was not tactical in the way he played the game. Unfortunately for him (<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>), his ego and/or lack of tactical awareness precluded him from being a proper midfielder... With Herrera, it seems the opposite is in play: he'll adapt and mould his game to fit the team in the best possible way. We really hit the jackpot with him lads, £30m is going to be looked back on as a bargain! Can't wait to see what he does in Europe, be that Europa or Champions League (not going to declare the top 4 race over - been around too long for that). He'll fit it, as he does us, like a glove. I'm sure of it!

8065~~~

8066~~~
His pressing skills are amazing. He isnt too quick or too long but he covers ground and intercepts/deflects quite a few passes.

8067~~~
His performance against Barca in the 2-2 at the Nou Camp either 2 or 3 years ago was one of the best games, if not the best,  I've ever seen a Spanish team player have against one of the big guns. I don't watch every Spanish league game that Real or Barca play, but his performance vs Barca and Banega's for Valencia against Real stick in my mind.

I love his sliding tackle technique too. There's an assist/goal (can't remember) he got against Levante/Getafe (I think) where he does his on-one-knee slide on the edge of their box, recovers the ball, dribbles and sets up a goal or scores.

8068~~~
Was just seeing the Herrera performance against Liverpool video again. Missed it during the match, but he was booed by the Liverpool fans while getting subbed off? Had he tried to con his way, that would be understandable. But that was a bad stamp and had every bit of malice behind it. 

I mean, that is an absolute low for the fans. No wonder I hate the club and their fans so much.

8069~~~
They've booed him probably because he took his sweet time walking to the touch line... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8070~~~
He really reminds me of young Scholes that I fell in love with. That drive, energy, clever body move, and toughness. He's like a 'new' player that I've never seen before in United shirt. 

Whatever LvG has fed him all this time, it works!  Maybe Herrera needs to spend more time on the bench again.

8071~~~
Great performance from him, he was joy to watch on Sunday.

He seems to always fool those pressing him. A quick unexpected turn or a flick and a chance is created.

He might need a bit more muscle but he seems to cope quite well with his current frame.

8072~~~
A fried of mine also compared him to Gerrard what made you do so ?

Fantastic player we have, if he can cut out the ball chasing to go with the quality he already has that can be one of our midfield spots sorted for the next 5 years. He has the Spanish technique, movement and understanding i the game but he can also get stuck. Perfect player for us.

8073~~~
Love his little trick where he is receiving but it lets it run half the way through him and turns back once the marker buys the wrong direction

8074~~~
If he keeps improving i can see him being the most dangerous player on the team tbh

8075~~~
Along with Mata and Fellaini he has become our most improved player, and important player.Very easy on the eye. Given that like the other two, he appeared to be frozen out and out of favour, he has stuck at it and developed his game to suit the team. I wish ADM and Falcao could take his lead and get stuck in and stop feeling sorry for themselves.

8076~~~
I already said it, but I'm almost sure that he wasn't frozen out, LVG needed him to do a work and couldn't find a place for him before he was ready.

8077~~~
Check his interview, he wasnt frozen out, LVG just didnt like his style of play at the beginning.

8078~~~
He was frozen out though. Listened to the manager, adapted his game and now he's a regular starter. Obviously a smart footballer and a quick learner. Credit to him.

8079~~~
Being reformatted isn't being frozen out, when you are frozen out the coach doesn't care about your future evolution, he doesn't take time to adapt you to his needs.

8080~~~
Depends what frozen out means exactly, Rafael is frozen out it seems, Herrera was just waiting to come back to the starting 11 while adapting his style to LVG's liking.

8081~~~
<b>The RedCafe Anthology of Great Senantic Arguments: Vol. 6 feat. </b>

"How the SHIT can you say he's world class? He's clearly a top, top, top player."

"I'm not saying he's a bad defender. He just defends badly." 

"Frozen out? FROZEN OUT?!?! Okay. Let's take this one step at a time. The Oxford English Dictionary defines frozen as...."

8082~~~
I must be the only one that thought Herrera went to block the pass rather than 'Do' Gerrard in that challenge. Look how far from Gerrard he actually ended up being. If he wanted a piece of Stevie he would have got it.

8083~~~
Actually quite a few people made that very point back on Sun. I thought it was only Gerrard and acolytes who believed otherwise.

8084~~~
I agree completely.

8085~~~
I agree with that too, which makes the yellow card for him even more ridiculous.

8086~~~
I thought the same. Especially because that's practically Herrera' trademark tackle. More than any United player I can remember watching for years and years, he knows how to win the ball even when the opponent gets his foot to it first. Most players, once they decide to tackle, just throw everything at reaching the ball first regardless of whether they have a realistic chance of doing so. Herrera tends to see this coming, predict where the opponent's touch will take the ball, and set himself to block that touch instead.

8087~~~
Has Stevie apologised to him yet?

8088~~~
What do you think? Unless he has done it personally. I would imagine if he had, Gerrard would want to milk as much publicity out of it as possible.

8089~~~
The most over rated midfielder of all time can apologise to Herrera and while he's at it clean his boots.

8090~~~
The only reason Atkinson booked Herrera was because it was Anfield. Nothing else. Herrera doesn't even touch Slippy G at all.

8091~~~
Interesting player. His mix of attributes makes it hard to tell just how much potential he has.

I'm certainly less worried for his future here after hearing his explanation for why LVG left him out earlier in the season.

8092~~~
I refuse to believe that, mainly because it would be such a terrible technique. You're only every supposed to go to ground if you're 100% certain you'll get to the ball. If he's trying to second guess his opponents first touch he'll be left on his arse by a simple feint or dummy.

8093~~~
I rewatched the Liverpool match and noticed he actually did that - went for the predicted trajectory of the ball and not where the ball was at the opponents feet. He intercepted the ball <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8094~~~
Watch him tackle in the future. Brightonian is right, of course sometimes he'll slide to win the ball before the defender but he really does have a knack of knowing when to slide for the ball or to slide for the block.

8095~~~
I missed that, what did LVG say ?

8096~~~
Basically told him to be more disciplined. Not to run around after the ball, that the ball would come to him.

8097~~~
From Ander himself  <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

''Van Gaal loves possession and doesn't like to risk losing the ball. He wants to take time with possession and to keep the ball because he believes space is created by staying in the right place, because the team has the quality to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/565823/avoid-him-Ander-Herrera-reveals-LVG-tactic-Manchester-United#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">find</a> you.

8098~~~
Sounds like he is keen to learn from LVG and he will improve him as a player

8099~~~
It is refreshing to see and hear. Too many players think they know it all.

8100~~~
Nice to hear Van Gaal is open minded too, and not as dictatorial as he sometimes appears to be. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8101~~~
I'd imagine he like players who are willing to listen and change if necessary. If they won't, then he would lose patience with them. He seems to be lucky that our players seem to be the former.

8102~~~
this look at the replay. stevie me was borderline on mata and was never touched.

8103~~~
He definitely didn't touch him. Also agree about tackle on Mata. Gerrard was completely in the wrong frame of mind to come on. He was out to get someone. To show how hard he is.

8104~~~
I bet this was in his head as he walked onto the pitch:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YkADj0TPrJA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8106~~~

8107~~~
This - the ref knew he hadn't done anything dangerous and it was a blocking tackle, but having sent off the bell-end did that to get them off his back somewhat.

8108~~~
We're talking about moments when he's going to be beaten to the ball by a fraction of a second. The ball's only really going in one direction. Nonetheless, in that split second situation most players tend to just hope that they'll be the first to the ball and end up late as a result, either catching the player or getting skinned. The evidence is on the pitch, anyway - I'm just pointing out something that we see him do three or four times a game.

8109~~~
Is it just me or does anyone else here think Herrera now is the player we hoped Cleverley would be? I thought Cleverley would reach Herrera's currently level when he had a good run of form couple years ago.

8110~~~
I think you're right, it could have come back to haunt him though later in the game. Supposing Herrera made a bad challenge, that could have been him off and then a tactical yellow to appease the crowd then not only could affect the outcome of that game, but the next one as well.

8111~~~
Yes, definitely - it forced lvg to sub him.

8112~~~
I think he can still be better and will be better next season, very promising.

8113~~~
It's been said numerous times, I don't think anyone will disagree with you there. 

He's a very similar player, only he's productive rather than shying away from responsibility.

8114~~~
He does look similar at times, only difference with Herrera being twice the player Cleverley is <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Also think he will only get better, this guy could be phenomenal in two years time. I still remember that pre-season game against Galaxy, he was just taking the piss !

8115~~~
Herrera has better technique on the ball though. Looks more assured and seems to have more time on the ball than Cleverley, who sometimes looked hurried and panicky in possession.

8116~~~
Is up there with Blind as signing of the summer. Bet nobody predicted that when our signings included Di Maria and Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8117~~~
We might have hoped. But aside for goal scoring perhaps, Cleverley never showed himself to have anything like the talent of Herrera. 

Herrera has a much better touch, a better weight of passing, better creative passing i.e. splitting defenses; he is a better tackler and he has as better temperament for the top level.

8118~~~
Range is all that's missing from his locker now (long passing). Smalling's seemingly developed one this season, Herrera shouldn't have too much of a problem if he works on it.

8119~~~
I imagine that's purely as in Spain a long 30 yard pass would be looked down upon, or almost a cheat. He can do them but he lacks the control somebody like Scholes/Xabi Alonso/Rooney has when attempting it. No doubt with a bit of practice he could get that sorted.

8120~~~
How anyone can claim Herrera & Cleverley to be similar is beyond me.
Cleverley loved to hide and pass it sideways, Herrera had to be told and dropped to not show up for the ball all the freaking time and try to create something with hard through-balls.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I know what you mean, but you get the gist.</span>

8121~~~
I think it's more to do with his role in the team. He's never really needed a long passing range as he's always played fairly high up the pitch. He had Javi Martinez behind for quite a while who always looks like a quality long range passer the times I've seen him. Thiago and Koke also have a terrific range from the current generation of Spaniards.

8122~~~
He has no shoulders.

8123~~~

8124~~~
Is he in the Spanish squad for the internationals this week? Thought he should be rewarded with a call up for his recent fine performances

8125~~~
Nope, the Spain midfield (starting 11 against Slovakia) included Busquets, Iniesta, Koke, Silva and Fabregas. He still has a lot to do and prove to make it into the national team.

8126~~~
That only managed a 1-0 win. I would expect more from that midfield.

8127~~~
I don't know. That midfield is so one dimensional; there' absolutely no pace for them to work around. Iniesta's ageing, Silva's 29 himself and may have passed his peak, it's April for Fabregas (seasonal decline). It's not the midfield it once was. Given Herrera's form, it may have been worthwhile to include him in the squad.

8128~~~
You would, but then who drops out? I'd love for Herrera to be a regular for the Spanish NT but he's just not that level. Maybe his style of play will prove to be something that will help him.

8129~~~
I think Herrera would do well for Spain, his direct approach would help.

8130~~~
There are better players ahead of him

8131~~~
There are but theres also Mario Suarez and he isnt. 

Ander should have a good shot for the bench, the likes of Iniesta aren't pulling up any trees. And while almost everyone would pick the likes of Fabregas, Koke and Silva more often than Ander, Ander can provide more balance than most of the spanish midfielders. He's a goal threat and they're lacking goalscorers at the moment, but he also much better at winning the ball than these players except for Koke who is about the same.

Personally I'd probably play Koke, Cazorla and Fabregas with Ander making regular appearances off the bench. There's also a case to be made for 
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b>Iturraspe</b></span> in there providing defensive responsibility.

8132~~~
Doesn't matter. Team > Individual talent.

8133~~~
What makes you think that the other Spanish players do not work as a team? Some have been playing together for years? The El Cantera players shared the same football ideology (Iniesta, Fabregas etc)

8134~~~
It took Del Bosque long enough to get De Gea in. Herrera is going to have to do something mega special to get in.

8135~~~
If the lad was English he would walk into the squad. Spain just produce that many good players.

8136~~~
I'm not saying that. If his more direct approach would benefit the team, he'd be ideal to be given more games. Their is a lot of too similar players in the Spanish side. Herrera is a bit more direct than most of them.

I'm not saying he's a better player than any of them.

8137~~~
You're forgetting that England are generally managed by morons.

8138~~~
That's true. Lee Catermole would likely get in before him.

8139~~~
Indeed.

The journos wouldn't put him in ahead of Barkeley and Wilshire...

8140~~~
Exactly, even though Wilshire is an injury waiting to happen and Barkley hasn't got a brain.

8141~~~
Watching Spain over the International break should give Herrera the confidence that he can make it into the squad for the next round of fixtures. I thought Spain were very average against Ukraine, not sure about Holland (sure they were rubbish given the result).

8142~~~

8143~~~
Love his attitude. Quickly growing to be my favorite player in the squad.

But it shows how little we, the fans, know about the going ons at our club. Around Jan most thought he would be off in the summer but its clear LvG was grooming him to fit his vision and style of play.

8144~~~
Love this guy, such an intelligent & tidy footballer.

8145~~~
Ander doing Ander things <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Quality finish

8146~~~
Ander Herrera, he scores goals.

8147~~~
Not just a good finish, he's been one of our best players so far.

8148~~~
His transformation into Scholes is progressing really well.

8149~~~
He's providing goals from midfield which we've been lacking for years

8150~~~
Just getting better and better.

8151~~~
Wow. Love him.

8152~~~
So good

8153~~~
Our new Scholes. Took us a while, but we finally found him. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8154~~~
Love his dynamism, he seems to be everywhere.  Very enthusiastic little player.

8155~~~
That ball to Valencia for Rooney's fluffed over head chance was one of the passes of the season from any of our players.

8156~~~
Thank you, Ander. I am just so glad he's playing for us.

8157~~~
So lovable this guy.

8158~~~
We don't know that either. It could've just as much been van Gaal not rating him at first before realizing he was wrong.

8159~~~
Love him!

8160~~~
It's like a goal or assist every week from Ander these days, ain't it? Although my favourite Herrera moment of the half was his slide tackle interception to stop a Villa counter and start a United attack. Just quietly keeps the engine room ticking over, and that clipped pass to Valencia on the left of Villa's area... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8161~~~
I'm still in shock at having a central-midfielder in the team that can score goals <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8162~~~
I love him, and that's a nice goal, but he always has one or two baffling decisions in a game. That backpass was hilarious. Anyway, good to see him scoring again.

8163~~~
Long may that continue. If it means he's fresher for us and keeps turning in performances like today then I'm all for Del Bosque to take as much time as he wants!

8164~~~
Technically, him , Mata, Carrick and Blind are great to watch.

8165~~~
Happy for him, to think some were saying hes not that good. I reckon he is going to be some player for us for a few years.

8166~~~
Nah, won't be like Scholes until he starts getting booked every other game.

8167~~~
Super goal.

8168~~~
6 goals and 5 assists in 24 games is a pretty great record. Particularly when he's only started about 70%-ish of those.

8169~~~
he's been absolute quality, linking everything, winning tackles, great interceptions, creating chances, scoring goals, level above carrick who is just solid as Valencia at RB.. Shame Rafael doesn't play he would make that right hand side even more effective..

but Herrera, you couldn't help but love the guy

8170~~~
Which he was in Spain and at the beginning of the season <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

8171~~~
His ability to think/pass it quick nullifies all the pressure when in possession. Tidy and excellent. Goal scoring CM? That's so unlike the recent us <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8172~~~
Such a good footballer.

8173~~~
Especially when you consider all his other attributes.

8174~~~
It's weird to compare him to Scholes. Other than goalscoring I don't think they are that similiar.

8175~~~
What I like about him is he thinks ahead before the ball comes to him.

8176~~~
He also needs to grow red hairs and give less interviews.

8177~~~

8178~~~
Yeah, I wasn't expecting his output to be this good.

8179~~~
And of those he's started how many has he actually finished the 90 minutes?

8180~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8181~~~
And shunted to left wing with Spain NT.

8182~~~
That's why I think that he should play the offensive box to box role, next to our new "defensive" box to box.

8183~~~
Need to watch younger Scholes.

8184~~~
He isn't really comparable to Scholes, obviously his first touch and technical ability is, but if anything then his game is rather comparable to Keane than Scholes.

I hope Scholes isn't missing Kroos now. He is going to love Herrera soon enough if he doesn't already do. There really aren't many allround players better than Herrera nowadays.

8185~~~
Herrera had an interview a month back where he said he had to adapt to LvGs system because in Spain he would look to beat players one on one but LvG prefers players to hold their space and pass the ball around players.

8186~~~
Why are people taking the Herrera/Scholes comparison so seriously? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's just good to have a midfielder that can score goals and is technically brilliant again.

8187~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CBwZ-ouUsAALCi0.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CBwZ-ouUsAALCi0.jpg"/>

8188~~~
Great picture.

8189~~~
Im not making a case for it but these types of performances are similar to a younger Scholes, when he used to play behind a striker. Not the later Scholes who turned into a deep lying playmaker.

8190~~~
He is so brilliant. Put him on the field and the team is energetic and on fire, take him off and you lose it.

8191~~~
Great that he got another goal, but he and mata have both been sloppy in possession in my opinion.

8192~~~
Eh ? Sloppy in possession ? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Both him and Mata have completed over 93 % of their passes with 60+ passes apiece.

8193~~~
Carrick's patented nipple cripple claims another victim.

8194~~~
Maybe its just me then. Not necessarily talking about giving the ball away mind you, but rather passes not being of quite the right weight/direction, which isnt something you would associate with either player.

8195~~~
how's he sloppy? he's on around 95% passing accuracy :-D

just because he can play one-two, quicken the games and pick creative passes doesn't make him being sloppy, he has got his one or two ambitious passes per game but in the end its nothing what he brings to the game with his "risky" style

8196~~~
Lovely finish that one.

8197~~~
How many goals and assists does this guy have now? In league and all competitions - anyone know?

Edit - just realised its in his profile haha. Are those updated after every game or straight away?

8198~~~
Scholes. (Without the shit tackling)

8199~~~
Love the guy.

8200~~~
Complete package. Scores goals, plays delicious passes, tackles, intercepts.

8201~~~
Made it look so easy

8202~~~
This week's Mata.

8203~~~
I believe it's now 5 goals in the league, 2 in the cup. Not sure on assists.

8204~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8205~~~
Mata and Herrera

HUGS

8206~~~
Love him to bits. Pure and unashamed love.

I also love his Labrador puppy reactions when other people score.

Just so glad we bought him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8207~~~
Fantastic performance from him, very easy to pick a MOTM today.

8208~~~
Brilliant.

8209~~~
well done Ander, making a big contribution lately

8210~~~
Signing of the season. (United)

8211~~~
I love how he seems genuinely happy to be here, excellent signing.

8212~~~
Man crush overload.

8213~~~
It feels like a real understanding is forming down that right side. They've got calmness, control, technique and it is finally paying off.

8214~~~
Gif of the second goal would be nice, I missed it.

8215~~~
He is magnificent. I love him.

8216~~~
What a signing he will turn out to be.

8217~~~
He's awesome. Tackled, scores goals, excllent technically and very intelligent.

8218~~~
7 goals and 5 assists in 23 games, a lot of them subs.

Today :

110 touches of the ball.
96 % pass completion.
2 shots, 2 goals.
2 tackles.

MOTM. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8219~~~
MOTM.

8220~~~
10/10 would bang

8221~~~
Was my MoM even before the 2nd goal. Great midfield performance.

8222~~~

8223~~~
Just imagine Falcao hesitating and letting the ball roll past so Ander could calmly bury it with a confident strike.

8224~~~
96% pass completion, 108 touches, 2 shots - 2 goals!

8225~~~
I love him.  Great attitude and great ability.

8226~~~
All of the hugs.

8227~~~
It's hard to believe it's not Scholes it's Herrera you know, best player in the fecking universe

8228~~~
What a player. Superb goals today.

8229~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8230~~~
His composure is fantastic. What a player, he's going to be great for us for years!

8231~~~
That second goal was such a class finish. Makes it look so easy.

8232~~~
Our right side with Valencia, Herrera, Mata is terrfic

8233~~~
Wow. Just wow <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8234~~~
What happened to the other 4%? 

Sloppy.

8235~~~
The guy is turning into such an important player for us. His determination is brilliant and sure he makes errors..but at his age, he's going to get better and better. The problem will be us hanging on to him...

8236~~~
His best game in a United shirt, so happy for him.

8237~~~
Give him a new contract and add a clause that our academy gets first dibs on any sons Juan and him adopt.

8238~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> I love Herrera!

8239~~~
Very good game, capped by 2 good goals. He can become a top midfielder here. The ability is definitely there.

8240~~~
Is he the best finisher in the team? QPR, Leicester, Swansea, Yeovil, and today; all brilliantly placed goals.

8241~~~
His reaction when mata scored that overhead against the dippers was fantastic. He was running around with his head in his hands in disbelief.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Juan-Mata-Herrera.jpg" src="http://cdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Juan-Mata-Herrera.jpg"/>

8242~~~
And most of his goals are so alike - smart movement and accurate, not overhitted shot in the corner. Fantastic player

8243~~~
Thank god Falcao left that for Herrera. He's got a great finish on him. Pinpoint accuracy.

8244~~~
Has anyone got a gif of his first goal, I missed the second half.

8245~~~
Some of his passes today were wankworthy. Class today all around. What a signing he's turned out to be... And to think so many on here were doubting him and comparing him to Kagawa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8246~~~
Exactly the type of player our post-Scholes midfield has been screaming out for. Love him.

8247~~~
Carrick face looks like a serial killer holding his victim <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8248~~~
There's not another CM I'd prefer right now.

8249~~~
Great player,so glad we bought him.Still boggles the mind how he couldn't get a game for a run of 10 games around Christmas.Would easily have hit double figures in goals otherwise.

8250~~~
Love him

8251~~~
Or a lustful older man....


...

8252~~~
110 touches that's a lot, he is turning into a real playmaker.

8253~~~
Andonio Materrera is such a good 3 man combo. If Valencia could cross, by God we'd be killing teams.

8254~~~
He's what I thought Cleverley would be for us. Just brilliant, my favorite player at the moment.

8255~~~
Villa clearly tried to nullify Fellaini by sticking an extra man on him. The result? Herrera had a little bit extra room and used it immaculately.

He's such a great all round player. With our 4 midfielders I really don't see a need for another one.

8256~~~
What is especially important is that he didn't start dropping easy balls at the end of the game when we were stressed and shaky, he improved his passing percentage in that time.

8257~~~
Today Ander provided more reasons to justify why I went ape when Moyes messed up his transfer two summers ago. If only we'd have had Herrera at the start of 2013/14...

...can't believe Herrera's been sat on the bench for so much of this season.

8258~~~
Knew he'd add goals to our midfield but surprised at how much of a goal threat he is really. In 15 starts, he has 7 goals and 4 assists apparently. Great numbers from a central midfielder.

8259~~~
I'm starting to think we wouldn't have been as terrible to watch as we were under Moyes had we signed this lad earlier. Regardless, I do think we should have signed him at least a year prior.

8260~~~
Gracias. One of the best things Falcao has done this season!

That goal was very smart.

8261~~~
Herrera and Mata are our midfield equivalent of Yorke and Cole.

8262~~~
For every player, there's a certain group of posters who only come out the woodwork to insult certain players at the slightest chance to do so. Herrera's a gem though.

8263~~~
Not surprised by Ander in the least. Got a great attitude to boot and seems to love the club. Great spot/buy by Sir Alex<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

8264~~~
Then Moyes prolly would still on the job

8265~~~
This. Love the combination between those 3. Valencia didn't have a good game at crossing today, but he's working well with the other two. Mata and Herrera with the intricate play, and Valencia being able to adjust to their game and use his speed.

Herrera was magic today. Pops up everywhere.

8266~~~
He's going to be regarded as one of the best in the league sooner before later, his performances have been immense.

8267~~~
It could be considered a positive that Herrera's mentality wasn't completely obliterated by David Moyes <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

8268~~~
Yeah that right hand side would look lethal if Valencia could cross.

8269~~~
Brilliant player we haven't had a midfielder like him since Scholes.

8270~~~
Didn't have him as a goalscoring midfielder, but his composure in front of goal is excellent. Never tries to blast it and is always looking for the corners. Two great goals today, topped with a great overall performance.

8271~~~
Fantastic player and great to see him improving every game!

8272~~~
Great stuff.

8273~~~
Great for him to get a couple of goals.

8274~~~
Always maintained it. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

When was the last time a United CM scored 2 goals in a single match (not counting Rooney)?

8275~~~

8276~~~
And all our players will grow old and die.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8277~~~
You know that Ballague foretold this a couple of years ago when the transfer was first on. He also said that De Gea would be the best in the world eventually when he was getting flak in his early United career.

8278~~~
Had Herrera not sat on the bench for 10 games, he would probably be a genuine contender for our player of the season. He is the only out-field player putting in performances at De Gea level on a regular basis.

Fabregas 0.08 goals + 0.65 assists per 90 mins = 0.73

Herrera 0.36 goals + 0.29 assists per 90 mins = 0.65

8279~~~
Best midfielder in the league on current form. Generally only Fabregas is ahead of him anyways IMO (as Toure shows up on the odd occasion only these days), but he goes missing after New Years always. Herrera, Fabregas, Carrick, Cazorla and Matic are probably the best midfielders in the league.

8280~~~
As said already, fantastic player for us. A player that can use both feet, great touch, great vision, not afraid to shoot, box to box.

Hes what we all wanted Cleverley to be.

8281~~~
Both should never be mentioned in the same post, does a big disservice to Herrera.

8282~~~
You could make a nice 4-3-2-1 with this players.

8283~~~
He's just a lovely little footballer. His bromance with Mata is beautiful as well.

8284~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I didn't get the weight/direction of his pass criticism either. There were misplaced balls yes, but they were extremely rare (can only think of 2 myself, the one where he played the ball too soon for Valencia who failed to make a run and a back pass which was over hit) and there were a few lovely penetrative passes he made in the right hand channel (one fantastic through ball for Valencia in the first half which led to the Rooney overhead kick and another in the 2nd half for Mata).

8285~~~
Yep, definitely. 

And scary part is that he was a relatively weak (by his standards) tackler today. A lot of matches he totals 100 touches, a goal/ assist and 5+ tackles won. While there might be some truth to the argument of him being similar to Scholes, actually he's more like a lovechild of the Ginger Prince and Keano with his high octane style of play and work-rate combined with an eye of goal (something he never fully harnesses at Zaragoza or Athletic club) and technical flair. 

<a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> has compared him with a younger Gerrard on several occasions, and that all-action play-style comp is quite apropos from a stylistic perspective, apart from the him being wayyy more like-able part.  

Once he gains more experience in the league and we get more quality midfield help around him, he has a good chance to become one of the Top 3, if not the outright best central midfielder in the league, especially with the recent decline of Toure while leaves a vacancy waiting to be filled.

8286~~~
He's hot buttered love on toast!

8287~~~
I'm chuffed to bits. Had so many raging arguments with morons on here after his initial failed transfer... "not worth the money", "not good enough", "not what we need".

Bollocks.

8288~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28916, @Invictus
@jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@Invictus
@jojojo</a>  is totally right with Bilbao(under Valverde) he had the game of Gerrard but without the end product, but now he is playing like a very good playmaker who scores goals, and I can't find any good comparison maybe a less skilled Juventus's Zidane.

8289~~~
He's bloody brilliant.

8290~~~
Need to ask him who to buy next!

8291~~~
Interesting that Robbo commented on Herrera midweek because Ander is almost a less powerful, less dominant, more tippy tappy version of Bryan Robson. Dynamic, gets stuck in, sets up goals, scores goals, keeps things ticking over: Herrera is everything you could ask from an #8 and he's still years away from hitting his peak...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Once Ander develops the ability to really drive the team forward from the centre of the park, we'll finally have a midfielder in the mould of the classic Man Utd box-to-box player.

8292~~~
scholes

8293~~~

8294~~~
He's been quietly bossing that inside right channel like Fellaini is doing with the inside left. Him and Mata combining to release Valencia into space has been beautiful.

8295~~~
Scholes, Riquelme, Gerrard, Zidane, he is just brilliant. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Edit: He changed his game, though. The time where he wasn't playing was clearly a period where he was adapting to a new game.

8296~~~
7 goals and 5 assists in 1,239 minutes in all competitions.

Goal/assist every 103.25 minutes. Not bad, Ander.

8297~~~
Didn't get a ten from me because he decided to just hoof the ball back into our side of the pitch at one point.

8298~~~
Sounds about right !

Ok let's include Robbo in the hybrid too then. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

8299~~~
What happened next wasn't <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

8300~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8301~~~
A lot of United's best players have had to overcome time on the bench/not being in the team!

It is how you react and overcome that to prove you belong in the team. Herrera is doing that right now and it is great to see.

Fellaini has shown that quality as well tbf.

8302~~~

8303~~~
He played a couple of beautiful crosses to be fair, if Fellaini was sharper today, he could have got an assist off one of those.

8304~~~
So fecking glad that finally after how many years we don't have to hear how shite our midfield is. He's a fantastic player that seems to love the club already. Seems a great lad aswell

8305~~~

8306~~~
And to think while rvp was fit we were shoe horning rooney into midfield instead of him. 

I keep thinking where we would be if Herrera stayed in midfield, or if RVP never got injured and rooney stayed there. He really has made such a difference to us!

8307~~~
the best thing about the stats is that he it is not the main thing what is so great about him. His defensive contribution (tackles, interceptions, pressing) and hardwork overall is what Fabregas can never offer. That's why I think Ander is better than him already even though Fabregas did fantastically well in the first half of the season, no doubt about that.

8308~~~
Its great that its obvious he loves to play for us.

8309~~~
Poor Falcao.

8310~~~
Not even surprised, he's been playing excellently for some time now. Delighted he's going to get the recognition he deserves after scoring twice.

Looking ahead this should be a great example to any players that van Gaal wishes to modify or develop, they can simply ask Herrera if it's worth it. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8311~~~

8312~~~

8313~~~
He is a delight to watch. 

I'm very happy for him that he's settled in the team and made his mark. Clearly loves the club and gives it his all. What a player.

8314~~~
96% pass completion. He's now playing exactly the way Van Gaal likes his midfielders to play.

8315~~~
This.

I'm sure if you search this thread you will find people saying Herrera isn't up to it and we should buy someone like Pogba. They seem to forget that Pogba was offered a contract by United (just not the terms he wanted) and left for the cash. 

I prefer signing players like Herrera (and Mata) who seem to care about United, its history, its fans and the city its based in, over bigging up mercenaries to do down our own players.

8316~~~
I agree with you on the general idea. But Pogba left us for less money, he wanted to be a 'guaranteed' starter which has been refused.

8317~~~
I think Pogba was too impatient in the grand scheme of things. If he had waited another season I think he would have started playing regularly for us. 

Oh well, it's in the past.

8318~~~
I stand by my post earlier in this thread that he's got some important goals to score for us. He's just fecking wonderful.

8319~~~
TBH if I was him, all the signs showed a lack of faith by the manager. I think he has made the best move for his own personal career in fairness.

8320~~~
Yeah, I feel the same, it was his season, at least to me Ferguson was doing what he did with every other young players, regularly on the bench for one season with the odd start in cups and then brusquely played the next season.

8321~~~
Exactly. Another player who loves it with us too is Rojo. Mata too. It's always better to have those kind of players.

8322~~~
I fecking love this little bastard.

And I really want to hug him.

8323~~~
Really good player he's got everything you want from a creative midfielder and adds his work rate/tackling to the side as well, he's been good in almost every appearance so far, it just goes to show how LvG was mad to leave him out for all those months everybody could see his ability. Oh well at least he's getting the games now and taking his opportunity with both hands.

8324~~~
Worth every penny that boy! Has everything we wanted to see in a midfielder for years!

8325~~~
I adore this guy

8326~~~
I have a serious mancrush on this fella.

8327~~~
I would breast feed him if I could. ticks every box and is the fan on the pitch

8328~~~
Not only 2 goals today also amazing passing stats with a 96% success rate and 43 final third passes

8329~~~
He's a tremendous footballer... pretty much the complete midfielder.

8330~~~
O'Shea like conversion rate <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8331~~~
I admit, before we bought him (and even since, when he wasn't doing well) I've compared him to Gerrard (for his willingness to lead, his aggression going forward, his ability to compete against superior odds) and Scholes (for his availability for a pass, and his instinct that it's his job relieve pressure on another player).

But like all comparisons they don't mean much. His first time passes are a thing of beauty if his teammates are on the same wavelength. His ability to control and turn with a ball in a tight space reminds me of Ince, but that don't mean much if there's nowhere for the ball to go next.

So yes, he reminds me of a lot of truly exceptional players, but he's not them and that's OK, because we never really do replace like-for-like. All I can really say is that to me he always seemed like he was best suited to the role of a classic English  box-to-box player, but with the control and touch of a Spanish player. I really hope he can become the best version of Ander Herrera possible with us, because then he'll be a special player and we'll get the benefit.

But then I am biased <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8332~~~
I don't agree except that he had to get used to the physical EPL. I remember his first few starts the opposition made a point to put him on the ground at the start of each game trying to make him hesitant. LVG, IMO, was slow to get him in the side during the WW15 (woeful winter of 2015). It's probably his biggest mistake as a manager this season.

Overall, though, I see the same player and think LVG only tweaked his game if at all.

8333~~~
This sums up my feelings for him.

8334~~~
This is the reason we paid 30 million for him. Start him.

8335~~~
Our best signing last summer for me.

8336~~~
Yeah ? It's maybe me then.

I think that him and Rakitic have changed their game, they are better at controlling the game, now. Up until last season they were very aggressive, always trying to find the killer ball, now they wait more for the right opportunity, but maybe I'm seeing what I want to see.

8337~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8338~~~
The big question is, when is Del Bosque going to open his eyes and play Herrera? He's been overlooked for way too long and would do brilliantly for Spain.

At the minute, he would definitely add more to that Spanish team than Iniesta, Suarez, Pedro, and even perhaps even Fabregas (considering Herrera's ability both going forwards and defending). A midfield of Isco, Koke, Herrera and Silva, with Busquets behind and Morata up front would do much better than what they had against France.

Obviously have Mata instead of Silva and you've got an insane team there.

8339~~~
That is pushing it for the moment. He's been benched for a while here and just broke his way in to the team, he's just started his 12th game of the season in the league. Same goes for Mata over Silva, Mata has been brilliant out wide for a few games now while Silva has been playing at that level for a couple of years. Also I don't see why they can't play Silva in the left and Mata on the right in that case. 

Even if they'd ideally want width I am not sure Pedro/Navas is worth it over Mata and Silva.

8340~~~
LVG described him as a 60metre midfielder today.  What's that mean?

8341~~~
Mata over Silva was mostly tongue-in-cheek, but at the minute Mata is in better form. Despite the quality of Spain's midfield over the years, I think it is crazy that Herrera does not have a single cap for the senior side. He was very good at Bilbao and if he can keep playing as he is, then he will definitely warrant a call up. What I was saying was, if I were to pick a Spanish team right now, Herrera would at least be on the bench, if not starting.

8342~~~
Herrera and Blind were undoubtedly our best signings last summer. 7 goals and 5 assists in 18 starts, rarely finishing any of those games would be amazing for an attacking midfielder let alone for a central midfielder.

You have to remember that it's not all about the flashy names when making signings, sometimes you just need to buy the right player for the team.

8343~~~
Haha. It's probably box-to-box in Dutch. 60m is probably about the length from one box to another.

8344~~~
He is sex. Goals from midfield! At Manchester United! I'd forgotten what that felt like.

8345~~~
I wouldn't have been able to guess that one. 40m for both boxes in a 100m field. Can Van gaal speak normally ? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8346~~~
Is there a thread dedicated to Louis Van Gaal-isms? I've noticed in almost all interviews he does he just makes up a word that doesn't exist, but I usually understand <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8347~~~
Really?

8348~~~
The part that is so impressive is that he is doing everything that we knew he could when we bought him and has added more goals to his game.  His immaculate close control seems to give him the time to consistently pick out a placed shot when others would have to snatch at getting one off.  Unless his touch and composure deserts him, he could be scoring 10+ goals a season consistently for us.

8349~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8350~~~
Brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8351~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8352~~~
His one touch pass with a little effect for Valencia was jizz worthy. The weight on it was spot on.

8353~~~
He has grown into his role more and more, been absolutely excellent the last 3 matches. I see him trying to dictate more and more and that is what we need from him, you can't really compare him to any player, he is very much his own and can do most things. Safe to say i'm a big fan already.

8354~~~
Fair enough in my eyes too. Only Fabregas has been really outstanding of the Spanish central midfielders this year with Isco as a close second and then Herrera in third place. Martinez and Alcantara are injured though which is important to keep in mind, especially Martinez who is the defensively great midfielder they currently lack. 

However you try to line up with their players it ends up looking a bit FM like, and Herrera is definitely the defensively best option of Fabregas/Isco and him.

8355~~~
Box to box?

8356~~~
Except one poor half at the hawthornes he has been a huge upgrade for our midfield and should never have been dropped. Some posters decided to be stupidly pedantic and delve far too deeply into interpreting his stats when your eyes were showing how you how much better he made us. Future captain.

8357~~~
TBF we all would kiss Ander given the chance. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8358~~~
Fabregas has only been outstanding in terms of assists (they are important tbh as they produce goals) but in terms of general play he's been ok and even disappointing since January. Isco has been more consistent than him.

8359~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8360~~~
Koke is the starter,it will be very difficult for Herrera despite his good season.I would bench Fabregas who usually play shit in national team

8361~~~
Can somebody GIF that little flick up with his right foot and then volley over the top of the defense for Valencia to run onto? it's kid in the park type stuff <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> beautiful

8362~~~
Never ever thought he'd be this much of a goal scorer. He wasn't really that prolific when he played further forward at Athletic. He's gone beyond my expectations.

The lad has a superb knack for hitting the ball along the floor with pace and control.

8363~~~
Yeah Koke if he plays as a CM is up there as well. Personally I am a bit disappointed that they don't let him have a flank as they seriously lack anybody to do that job. Playing Isco as a winger, or Pedro/Navas seems so wrong when they could have been playing Koke/Silva.

8364~~~
Yup. That is the issue with their team. He can't play with Busquets at all either and generally looks crap for the NT and previously for Barcelona. Their midfield is really off balance until Martinez returns and who says he will return as good as before.

8365~~~
Brilliant player.

Any midfield purchase we make has to be done with who would compliment Herrera in mind.

8366~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

8367~~~
we'd be winning the league if he'd been playing week in week out. why the feck has it taken this long for him to be first choice?

8368~~~
Wonderful player, loved him since day one, but watching him in pre-season I had a small feeling he may be more of a number 10, but his recent performances have been excellent, a real box to box midfielder, and his link up with Mata has been great. Also very impressed with his return, 7 goals is excellent, we've missed a goal scoring midfielder for a while.

8369~~~
Sadly I think Van Gaal will do the opposite and will bring in someone to take Herreras position and he will use Herrera as back up.

8370~~~
Why? He's bemoaned having too many AMs and not enough CMs who add balance all season. Fellaini is only a short term option for LVG.

8371~~~
I think it's too simplistic to say that we could have done this if he had played regularly and stuff , for me there has actually been a huge improvement in his performances from the start of the season to now . At the start we were so desperate for a midfield that his weaknesses were getting overshadowed , but he has worked on his game and become a better player

8372~~~
van Gaal is such a goof <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8373~~~
I just still feel he doesn't fully believe Herrera is the solution long term, I still don't think he rates him that much. I hope your right though. We know its one of Herrera of Fellaini who will drop out if we sign a CM that LVG wants in the summer, I just don't know which one it will be.

8374~~~
I do see what you mean. I think LVG might actually want to play something like this long term:

Which would be tough on Herrera, but more understandable than dropping him and leaving Fellaini on the pitch, which would be mind-blowingly annoying.

8375~~~
Completely agree.

Should be a first team choice every match.

8376~~~
It doesn't fully matter if LVG rates him or not, he's not going to be here long term anyway. Herrera will be a big part of our midfield for years to come.

8377~~~
the problem for Herrera is that in the position where He could play are Busquets and Koke. Del Bosque could search space by removing some midfielder but seeing how conservative he is (the best example is de Gea/Iker) is going to have to do an incredible season.He won´t sit  Iniesta and I'm sure that Isco, the idol of Madrid(and over protected for press) will play before Ander, even out of position. In any case I am sure he will go to the euro

8378~~~
It's really frustrating that he has taken so long to establish himself, but who's to blame, him or LVG ?

8379~~~
Herrera would even work in the DM position you have there though really. He is like a box to box CM, he puts himself about and can tackle. I don't think we need two Defensive mid and im classing Carrick as one.

8380~~~
Yeah, I think there's a level of composure and discipline that wasn't there earlier in the season. He's becoming better at those two aspects and LvG reward him with playing time. He's developing nicely lads, his time out of the squad probably spurred him in that direction

8381~~~
He's only started 15 games, all season; and they've been scattered all over. I might be wrong, but this may be the most consecutive games he started for us. He's not been able to establish himself as he really hasn't had the opportunity to do so, till now.

8382~~~
Well he's staked a claim, can't see him being left out for the City match, I like him as a player.

8383~~~
Is the correct answer

8384~~~
In fairness, he had <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/players/4246/ander_herrera_injury.html?affid=77" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">several injuries</a> up til Xmas, particular that rib injury that resulted in two fairly long spells out.

8385~~~
I don't think Del Bosque will let Herrera get a proper chance unless he has some proper long term success, it was just a response to a person who was saying who he would pick for Spain just solely based on form at the moment. 

Herrera doesn't deserve to be there yet and we know that after he clearly should be starting Del Bosque will need another couple of years to figure that out. Isco has been very, very good too, I've repeated it through-out the latter part of the season that Isco-Marcelo-Ronaldo has been carrying Madrid.

8386~~~
Those LVG comments <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Absolutely in love with Herrera, we have the most likeable team in the league.

8387~~~
Crazy to think there were murmurings we were going to offload him.

8388~~~
He should be starting every week in a midfield three of himself, Carrick and Mata.

8389~~~
Blame the time it takes any footballer to learn what a new manager expects of them. Herrera has added a discipline (for which LVG and the staff can be credited) in his game that wasn't present earlier in the season, and he's now flourishing in LVG's system.

8390~~~
He will get a Spain call-up sooner or later, after all the likes of Suarez and Raul Garcia are getting them, too. But I doubt he will be in the Euro squad, at least not as long as Del Bosque is there.
Spain won't progress anyway with Del Bosque, Xaviesta in their prime were just perfect for Del Bosque's laid back nature and possession style, but there won't be another pair that good anytime soon and Del Bosque somehow seems incapable of changing things a bit or adapting their style.

Having said this, Koke and Isco are better than Herrera, that's not the issue. The issue will be that inferior or out of form past it players will get ahead of him as long as Del Bosque is there (like at the WC DDG/Casillas or playing Xavi/Iniesta/Alonso ahead of the best Spanish midfielder of last season in Koke).

8391~~~
His link-up play with Mata is unbelievable. He's looking like an excellent buy, prolific passer and can score goals from midfield which is something we've lacked for a number of years. Glad to have him and he should be a certain starter.

8392~~~
He's mental.

8393~~~
In the bad times (a couple of months ago) I opined that he and Mata were too lightweight for us. 

Not much sign of that now. When quality football is played, with quick, accurate passing, good movement and plenty of options, size matters a lot less.

8394~~~
Yep and while the leagues aren't really analogous the great Barca side wasn't physical at all and dominated heavily. Having Messi helped but I mean, the physical point stands.

8395~~~
Did he have to learn from the bench though?

8396~~~
There were a lot of times when Herrera would play as a #10 for Bilbao, or even act as a wide playmaker so I'm not too surprised by his omission from the senior squad. However now, with Xavi retiring, Iniesta generally ineffective, Javi Martinez injured and Illara's regression I would really hope that he's rewarded by a call up.

8397~~~
Nope. All that time Rooney was being wasted in midfield, so Van Persie and Falcao could look unconvincing up front, Herrera could have been playing. We'd have been much better for it too.

8398~~~
Wonder what Paul Scholes is thinking right now after getting annoyed that we didn't sign Kroos and signed Ander instead.

8399~~~
Yeah but Herrera was injured quite a bit during that time as were others and Rooney was the convenient choice for midfield while LvG was trying to make the partnership of RvP and Falcao work. 

It didn't though and thankfully LvG has assigned Rooney back as our main striker with the midfield to match. 

You can't really blame LvG, much.

8400~~~
He wasnt

8401~~~
They've only got Koke, Fabregas, Silva, Cazorla and Isco as alternatives. What a ridiculous set of midfielders they've had over the last 8 years <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8402~~~
So, is it now acceptable to rate this lad and think it a complete travesty that he was benched for so long in order to accommodate RVP/Falcao upfront?

If we'd played him all season, and dropped one of the strikers, we'd have a good few more points imho.

8403~~~
really impressed by Herrera since the US tour, he stood out against our other midfielders (only lacking Carricks passing range).....Anyone else think LVG is still a bit funny on him?

I know LVG made some strange comments about Herrera in the past and seemed to resist playing Herrera for a while.....

when LVG was talking about Rooney and Herrera after the game there was a contrast......he almost seems to find a way to ask that Herrera should improve even after scoring 2...

maybe a bit like Mata he seems to have reluctantly given these two their chance together....

8404~~~
Okay so I can't be bothered reading all the pages but I am guessing I will just be agreeing with everyone. He was very, very good. I was uncertain about him earlier in the season but he has fit in really well. Without having to accommodate RvP and Falcao we have struck the perfect team balance, which Herrera is a huge part of.

Goals from midfielders this season <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8405~~~
He was. LvG had also been trying to get the Rooney / Di Maria partnership going and it worked for a bit and the team had gone on a winning streak and I believe that's why van Gaal wasn't playing Herrera and Mata. Herrera came back after the rib injury had a game against (if I remember correctly)  Southampton but then hurt it again. He had one or two games until Christmas and even scored but Rooney and Di Maria were the selected midfield at that stage.

8406~~~
It was West Brom, was also before Rooney was playing CM.
Herrera was on the bench and fit for all the games Rooney started in CM. LVG came out and said he wasn't in the team because he needed to improve, and Herrera has come out and confirmed that too

8407~~~
Yet Herrera came on as a sub in a few games. I remember him scoring a lovely goal after coming on.

8408~~~
Probably not in my opinion, but I'm sure LVG had his reasons. We were on an impressive run of results, if not performances, without Herrera. I was screaming for him to play earlier as well, but I'm more happy it's worked out now.

8409~~~
Tbh, he (sadly) probably did need that bench time. 

If he played his own/old game, and kept getting picked, he'd probably be far less likely to change it up.

He was dropped, told what he needed to do to get back to being picked, went and done it, never looked back. Excellent from him, and excellent management.

8410~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I have to agree with this. Yesterday was probably his best performance for us, and he had 96% pass completion. That's what LvG wants from his midfielders.

8411~~~
Cliché(not the mediocre fullback) an all that it's become, but the philosophy.....

Control and patience, not that I'm comparing with quality, but in style, we're closer to Barca than we've ever been. Dictating the game, right in the opponents face until they crack. Passing in their face, dropping to the CB's if nothing's happening and starting again. Ander was always far more direct and aggressive than that.

Personally, I'm a fan of more, umm, reckless, attacking football, but if the last few weeks results persist I won't complain.

8412~~~
I hope we don't change to that kind of line-up, I prefer the flexibility of the 4-3-3 we are playing and it would be crazy to drop Herrera just to play Mata centrally.

8413~~~
He's barely changed. The one change he's made since the start of the season is the one Ander tells us about, where he wanted to move to the ball and demand it - something a lot of players get praised for. LVG told him he wanted him to hold his position even if he's well away from the ball and wait for it to come to him. You can see that change in him, nothing else. He was winning the ball, scoring goals, mostly keeping the ball well (with an occasional poor pass, just like yesterday's pass back that completely missed Rojo) and the occasional killer pass - right from his first league games, where he, Blind and Di Maria were playing really well

Its pretty obvious he should have been playing for ages before he came back in as a starter. LVG was stubborn with playing Rooney and Fellaini and also incorporated Mata into the CM role instead of him instead.

When he kept doing well off the bench eventually LVG gave him his chance from the start again and we saw Rooney and Fellaini moved into forward areas and now Mata wide right. Which pretty much displays how poor the choice was.

8414~~~
Love this fellas celebrations, he really goes for it. Looks like today meant a lot to him.

He seems to be really kicking on in terms of creating an understanding with players alongside him in midfield. We've been screaming out for the kind of player than can help dictate play in the middle of the pitch but also chips in with a few goals. Going to be exciting to see this guy develop further.

8415~~~
He's our Vidal, which is why we didnt need to sign him in the summer.

8416~~~
What I noticed yesterday is that he has great vision and quick decision making to play a great pass.

8417~~~
Absolutely loveable and quality footballer.

8418~~~

8419~~~
That'll happen with Ander in the team.

8420~~~
Yep. He usually knows what pass he wants to play before he even get the ball. Great vision.

8421~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Van Gaal's desire to shoehorn three strikers into the first XI kept Herrera out of the team. Fellaini and Mata themselves have been victims of that, its harsh to blame them. Over the winter we saw good performances from Herrera, Fellaini and Mata, which were often rewarded with being put back on the bench so Falcao and Van Persie could play.

What you say about Herrera's performances being virtually unaltered I agree with though. Ander wouldn't have a goal, assist or key pass every 60 minutes to his name if he'd had a serious dip in form. Statistically, his output has remained strong all season. The only obvious alteration in his game is his positioning is more disciplined and his passing less ambitious. That's it. Those are minor tweaks to the game of a player who was always going to be huge for us.



Like Jones says, it was obvious three years ago that Ander Herrera was going to become a big player. Thank God it will be at Manchester United.

8422~~~
Herrera, Mata, and Blind are all really good at making quick deicisions when under pressure and still finding a pass. It's no surprise with those three (and Carrick) in the side we're looking much more composed.

8423~~~
I didnt blame them. They dont pick the team and have all done well in their recent roles and deserve to be picked

But LVG himself couldn't have been more active in keeping Ander out of the team, trying everything but him. And now he finally gets his chance and is playing brilliantly, there are posters who want to give LVG credit for that.

8424~~~
The change in his game is about positioning, holding his position and picking his runs. It might look very simple, but it's a big change that ensures we have 2 players in CM. Earlier in the season, Ander was still scoring, and playing well, but his positioning made it look like we were playing a one man midfield of Blind, we were too open at times, now, you can decide if you're better off having one or two in the middle. It's how LVG wants him to play and he has adapted to it, simple. Every decision that fans don't like they always interprete as the manager not liking or not rating the player or being stubborn, it's really not. Mourinho was not stubborn to bench Mata, Mata just couldn't fulfil a requirement Mourinho wanted of his #10 and he got benched.

8425~~~

8426~~~
We're also playing a different formation, with Young on the left who was our leftback earlier in the season.

We've used 4-1-4-1   7 times this season and I can remember when we used it before earlier in the season was when Adnan was getting his run of games. We had Mata and Fellaini in the 2 AM places and it may have been Blind in the DM position.

Thats why we arent as exposed when he's making runs forward, both the lineup and formations are completely different to when we were using the Di Maria - Blind - Ander 3 man midfield. Di Maria doesn't defend at all

8427~~~
This lad is great for these videos. Some players you would be lucky to find 8 minutes of highlights for their whole careers.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8428~~~
Thiago too. If he recovers well from his injury he's the leader in Spain's midfield. Everyone else can fight to play alongside him.

8429~~~
I would like to see him playing more balls into Rooney. It seemed like a lot of his passes were to Mata and Valencia yesterday.

8430~~~
Think you're focusing too much on the players and not enough on their roles and the systems they're playing in function of... At Sevilla and Athletic they were usually the main playmakers in the final third (though capable of playing more restrained occasionally), now they're being asked to play deeper and more as controllers in systems that rely far more on keeping possession than at their previous clubs. Additionally, Athletic under Bielsa were aggressive, intense and "non-stop", Ander's playing style just reflected that. Under Valverde they became more measured and he took on a more traditional AM role.

8431~~~
that interception at 3:30 was great, shame its poor cut, and 4:45, 6:44 highlights for me <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8432~~~
arise Sir Ander

8433~~~
If LVG moves Rooney down in midfield again to make room for Falcao/RvP im going to be seriously mad. I would say hes out best CM hands down, and he is only going to get better.

8434~~~
Straight away.

8435~~~
Have used the profile data first time after seeing your post.. It is simply amazing.. Wow,what an awesome feature.. Can't believe i missed that till now.

8436~~~
My favorite player of the season before the last 3 game, was 'very angry and confused' when he wasn't started. Great to see a midfielder in this form, especially as an United fan.

8437~~~
If this lad was playing for another team he'd be rated twice as much right now.

8438~~~
Struggling to think of any other Premier League centre mid who I'd swap for Herrera in a heart beat.

8439~~~
The way rooney was playing yesterday I
Don't blame him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

To be fair rooney was marked tight all game so it's hard to feed him, the space was always wide.

8440~~~
Spot on.

8441~~~
I use to post the gag with the Simpsons when I used to get so frustrated with the teams lack of tempo. You can have a possession game, but still have the tempo, now we are getting it and VG is getting. I look at united, we look more stronger than our rivals in the next few years to come, if this possession game starts to get to new levels, especially in Europe this asset VG is drilling into the team

But what I have loved about VG, is getting our players better technical on the ball. Even guys like herrera are thinking with they're brains now, and with this we are very good at just taking the sting out of games, like at anfield a perfect example. If we make the top 4, we left the CL a broken team, and we could re-enter it has a very unknown team for teams to work out, because we playing like a European team.

Herrera defiantly has played a part in the cog of this machine, and it is fantastic seeing us hold onto the ball, and try a gameplan that fergie tried to do in 2011 but failed at it

8442~~~
I struggle to think of one too.

8443~~~
I would like to hear (from someone who watches EPL a lot) who are the best midfielders in the league right now. Unfortunately I watch only United this season.

8444~~~
Depends what you regard as a midfielder I suppose. If we're talking strictly centre midfielders I'd plump for Fabregas, Herrera and Cazorla as my current top 3. Could also throw in Carrick and Schneirderlin but they may regarded defensive midfielders and I guess their inclusion would warrant 'number 10' players getting a look in as well such as Silva or Eriksen.

8445~~~
Depends on what kind of midfielder you are looking for. Cazorla although more of an offensive one is a good call as he spent most of his season as no8, doing surprisingly well in defending, playmaking from deeper role. Schneiderlin has done reasonably well too but his contribution is rather defensive, he and Waynama is the reason why they conceded as few as 22 goals. Matic and Fabregas were the best midfielders in the first half of the season but they faded a little, they were palying all the time 4 competitions, Fabregas creativity-wise(4+22 in all comps) and Matic breaking the play, similar to Schneiderlin. But their team was working really well all season.

Checked on Ramsey too, at first I though that he spent most of the year injured but he has 8+7 in 32 games which is great numbers even not as good as last season. If there is an all-round player similar to Herrera I'd say it's him from the lot. The rest is either too offensive or too defensive or they didn't make my list because they didn't perform this season. Well Henderson had a good season too but he's cnut and got battered at Anfield.

I'd say Herrera is the best all-round midfielder in the league but he didn't play enough games. And played in completely new and forming team who struggle to get going for the most time of the season..

Can't wait to see him next full season, what he can do in better playing team, hope he can stay prolific - it's a pleasant surprise for me, never thought he has so many goals in him..

8446~~~
there is a lack of world class CMs in the PL. No wonder we look shite in Europe.

8447~~~
good story on him today in the best Spanish newspaper: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/2015/04/05/552107f2e2704eda708b4575.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/2015/04/05/552107f2e2704eda708b4575.html</a> (en español, naturally)

Any chance of a translation as google wouldn't do it for me?

8450~~~
Surprised us all. He scored 7 league goals in 94 league games for Bilbao, he's already got 5 for us in 19 matches in the Premier League. When you take into account he's made a transition to a new country and not always been in favour during what is his first season, his development purely goal scoring wise has been terrific.

8451~~~
Well done to LVG as well, for moulding him into his philosophy. 

When a player is not in the starting eleven every week it doesn't mean they are sat at home playing on the Xbox 24/7!

LVG will have been coaching him everyday and now it appears to have clicked and everyone is happy.

8452~~~
Scholes was never heavy weight...  Quality is used when you have it, buff and strength when you haven't...

8453~~~
I see what you're getting at but I think it's outrageous to suggest that Fabregas isn't the best midfielder in the league by a country mile this year. 22 assists as a no.8.

8454~~~

8455~~~
There's not really any new information. Just a good overview of how well he has done lately, and I was impressed that a top Spanish newspaper was picking up on it.
Describes him as Moyes' planned cure to the anemia that United's midfield has suffered since Scholes left, but a year too late.

8456~~~
Weird, I had no issues.

Not a great translation though.

8457~~~
At least he has the humility to realise he would have to adapt his game. There are plenty of big heads out there who would think they know better than the manager. The same with Mata he has had to adapt. That is why I am beginning to respect LvG, that he can get players to do this. Jose just gets rid. To me that actually makes LvG a better coach. LvG does get rid of players, but he also sees talent and will spend the time bringing it to it true fruition.

yeah, the impression you get is that VG will try to give everyone a chance unless he judges you are a complete lost cause. Except for the possible exception of RVP, he doesn't seem to play (undeserved) favourites. If you're not starting now it doesn't mean you won't be starting soon. And if you're starting now, it doesn't mean it will always be the case.
I like that he really uses the squad. I guess it can hurt as regards inconsistency in the defence, but at least you've got plenty of options late in the season when it all really matters.

8461~~~
I agree, but there might be certain situations where you might prefer someone who defends better than he has. In most cases you'd find a place for Fabregas in your team, because he's worth sacrificing a striker

8462~~~
Fabregas deserves the prize that's for sure but I think that Herrera is more useful player and best all-rounder in the league..

8463~~~
Fabregas is an assist machine, but Ander gives you goals as well as assists and can also break up play. His long range passing is getting better as well. Fabregas seems to go off the boil towards the end of seasons, if you are playing for a contending club, it isn't the best time to be doing that.

8464~~~
Has been obvious even since before the Preston game that he was doing this......

8465~~~
...Along with quotes like  "We are Manchester United and we are not afraid. We are going to play in front of our fans [vs Arsenal] and we need them to win." -What's not to like?

8466~~~
Do people seriously think fabregas can't defend? He's as good as Herrera at it.

8467~~~
I knew once he got a run in the team he'd prove his worth. Can't make my mind up who's been the best signing out of him and Blind. I saw on the transfer forum someone was prepared to sell him in order to buy Verrati I think we would be crazy to do that.

8468~~~
why sell him to get Verratti? People are weird sometimes. We could use both. I dont think PSG would sell him, so there is no point in doing that.

8469~~~
No idea, to be fair it was posted before the Villa game so they're probably not thinking that now.

8470~~~
Fabregas has nothing to prove. His level in my opinion has been up there with Xavi and Iniesta. In fact I think it was a crying shame he wasn't in the Spain side more often. At his best, I don't think there is anyone better. I have to say though his team mate Eden Hazard ain't half bad and looks a future Ballon d'or winner to me.

8471~~~
You mean throughout is career or on his good days ?

8472~~~
He's miles behind Herrera in terms of defensive ability.

8473~~~
To think that when I suggested Herrera-Martinez as our future CM I was shunned away because Herrera would never come to Manchester and Cleverley/Ando will be better then him.

8474~~~
If you can Martinez here, you'll have cracked it. I wish we could and he was fit.

8475~~~
I meant at his peak at the time when he first went to Barca. At that time, I remember thinking I'd have him in the team ahead of Xavi! I felt he was a special hybrid of Premiership and tika taka. The direct style he brought. I remember watching him for Spain, and he just seemed to be all about that assist and end product. Him being in the side provided a goal threat.

8476~~~
At that time he wasn't better or as good as Xavi and Iniesta, and he never managed to adapt to his teammates with Spain or Barcelona. In a more direct team he is great but he doesn't seem to be a versatile midfielder he has one style, one tempo he is comfortable in, and that's it.
Now when the team strategy suits him he is great, but he is not even close from Xavi and Iniesta.

Edit: And like Herrera there isn't any tiki taka in Fabregas, that's why Herrera doesn't have any selections, he is rated in Spain but didn't suit the rest of the team, until now.

8477~~~
There's still time, we have a buy back clause for Ando and Cleverley is just on loan to regain confidence.

8478~~~
Nowhere near, he was world class at arsenal without a doubt but still not on the level of Xavi and iniesta, part of the reason why he failed at barca. He wasn't in the Spain side because he just wasn't good enough basically.

8479~~~
Not disputing the class of Xavi or Iniesta, the latter being one of my favourite players of all time. I just felt that even accounting for all the talents of the Spain side of the last 10 years, Fabregas still, offered something different. He was, under used in my opinion..

8480~~~
My favorite bits...

I would rather have Herrera than Fabregas to be honest in their current guise for our side. I think the former is more dynamic and stands out in a poor side, whereas Fabregas needs to be carried to a certain degree these days. United needed a guy who could stamp his authority in high energy games and a really good personality .. Fabregas would have added an air of entitlement to the squad which with the likes of Falcao, Di Maria, Rooney, RVP.. we really don't need.

8490~~~
I'd be more worried if my sister looked like Wayne Rooney.

8491~~~
True <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8492~~~
I shouldn't be doing this, and I'm usually against muppetry, but what the hell can you imagine a midfield three of Herrera and Pogba either side of Carrick, or better yet Herrera and Pogba either side of Schneiderlin? Dare I say sex in heaven with a goddess <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8493~~~
He was a bit sloppy against Aston Villa at the start and struggled against Delph's tenacity and aggression, but he handled Villa's midfield's energy and aggression well, generally, and once again, he was very good on both ends of the pitch. He's such an enjoyable player to watch, and his intelligence is quite visible on the pitch.

I was very glad when I first saw him signed up last summer, and I'm still happy to see him play for us. He's been quite a revelation for us, and he's become one of our key players in the team.

8494~~~
Fabregas is the Ronaldo of midfielders. Can be wank or phased out by strong opponents and still end up with 3 assists. We as United fans have generally always been a little bit sceptical about Fabregas, or should I say not as enthusiastic as others. Not to say we didn't want him in the summer, because we did badly. I just can't get over his multiple shite performances against United (watch him play a blinder later this season). Can't remember him having more than a couple of good games against us. Saw him dominated in his own backyard by Anderson and even this season - outperformed and more importantly outclassed by Marouanne Fellaini (still got the assist from a corner if the memory saves me right).

Ander is an all-rounder. He's everywhere and he isn't afraid of getting stuck in. He's not as classy and he may not be as talented as Fabregas for all we know but I can't see him throwing a towel against a physical opponent like Fabregas did against Fellaini. English football-based fans love that. Like jojojo suggested, he's got English engine but Spanish wheels. That is something I've been looking for in top midfielders and he's such a refreshing player to have in your ranks.

Needles to say he's much more loveable than Fabregas too, who's got such an obnoxious and punchable face imo.

Edit:

22 assists is crazy, though, and it should make him the best midfielder in the league for the time being. It's Giggs/Beckham's level but that's Fabregas for you, he would get you assists if he was told to walk on his hands.

8495~~~
Rooney dressed up as the Herrera lookalike's sister who's really Herrera trying to get a peek at some minge, to get a peek at Herrera's bits. 

Crazy feckers.

8496~~~
You mean that great cross that Rooney tried to score spectacularly from (but failed to do so) ? Or you just decided that because his crossing has been poor for the last 3 years it had to be the case this time round as well?

8497~~~
Can you not like him?

8498~~~
I get the superstition thing but having the whole name on the back of his top just looks messy.

8499~~~
I really hope we sign her in summer.

And his sister too

8500~~~
It's the latter, I honestly don't recall how good/bad the cross was - I just thought it would have been bad invariably like his most crosses are.

8501~~~
Oh wow im in love.

Can anyone actually make out what's going on there? Why is it played at such a high speed?

8506~~~
Was just going to say the same thing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8507~~~
You can go to their site and watching it but yes, I can make it out. Herrera receives the ball on the touchline with no space to move into, so he flicks it up in the air with one foot and knocks it over the defender to Valencia with the other foot. 9 times out of 10 the player in his position runs out of play with the ball, blasts it off the defender to win a throw or loses it. The quick thinking and confidence to pull that off...

8508~~~
I saw the match. And appreciated it at the time (especially the thinking part of it). I just can't make it out watching that.

8509~~~
My only annoyance is how we didn't get him earlier! Already 25 and will be 26 in August (though I can definitely see him becoming a that can play to their mid 30s).

8510~~~
I think it's lucky for us we couldn't get him last Summer. He's the sort of player who I think would play well despite Moyes and could have been a difference between 5th and another season for Smug Dave and 7th and the boot.

8511~~~
Future captain ...... that's all

8512~~~
It's actually us playing at a really high tempo, instigated by Herrera.

8513~~~

8514~~~
Good for them, we are ourselves interested in Messi to replace Ashley Young in 2016.

8515~~~
They can feck right off

8516~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> If they ever again make an offer for one of our good players I would love us to send that message back to them!

For anyone who reads Spanish the original Mundo Deportivo piece can be found <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20150407/102771257615/ander-herrera-vuelve-a-la-escena-del-barca.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, interestingly its the main piece on the homepage of MD's site.

The piece claims Barca have been following Herrera since he was 11 years old...

8518~~~
So it's taken then 14 years to decide he is any good?

8519~~~
Hands off our Ander! Bloody Barca<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

8520~~~
They were sniffing around him for quite a while. I am sure i read reports in 2012  and 2013 that they scouted him and wanted him as Xavi's replacement.

8521~~~
Can these Spanish clubs just feck off please. Get your own De Gea and Herrera!

8522~~~
It is typical of them and Real to try and unsettle a player as soon as they show any form. He will be 27 by the time the 2016/17 season starts. I would have thought they would want someone younger to get the years out of them. Also no doubt there will be another midfielder who will tickle their fancy by then.

8523~~~
Both Barca and Real can sod off. 

Anyways Herrera looks happy here to even consider a move and there's transfer ban place on Barca so I wouldn't worry at all.

8524~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This. I like the anger in this post.

8525~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this can't be serious.

8526~~~
Exactly it is just shit stirring. We should put reports out about one of their players.

8527~~~
The article says they are waiting for season 2016-17 when Iniesta will be 32 years old to make a move for Ander. Mundo Deportivo makes out as if it has been a long term plan to let the Xavi/Iniesta era pass and then bring in Ander. Mundo Deportivo say Ander's seen more as a less silky more goalscoring Iniesta than Xavi, but that his keep ball skills and ability to pick out the key pass are comparable to the latter's.

8528~~~
This isn't bad either:

"Ander Herrera was the piece that coveted <b>David Moyes</b> to cure anemia"

8529~~~
When we see reports like this, no wonder it is so damn hard to build a special team, when these leeches keep stealing our best players when they start to settle and we never see the true fruits of our labor. We progress with these special players, and we get flawed, like we are seeing with DDG, and ronaldo before

8530~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at the idea Herrera should be seen as one of the fruits of our labour. We genuinely did steal him. Bilbao said no and he left anyway.

8531~~~
Herrera doesn't strike me as someone that has a burning ambition to return home one day to play for one of the big 2 in Spain.

I think he will be happy enough here and will give us 4-5 years as long as his relationship with the management doesn't change too much.

With De Gea I see things differently. I feel for him returning home one day is important.

8532~~~
One polite fe.k you to Barcelona.

Yeah he kind of hinted at his disappointment with how the smaller clubs are not allowed to thrive in Spain in that large interview he did recently when he spoke of how much he loved the FA cup away games in the early rounds. He seemed to have a great affinity for the football structure and culture in England.

8538~~~
Bit of an unfair comparison, everyone bar Liverpool fans know that Henderson is nowhere close to Herrera and especially Silva.

8539~~~

8542~~~
He'd be spectacularly wrong for Barca anyway. Jesus, if <i>Fabregas</i> wasn't 'Barcelona enough' for them, Herrera sure as hell wouldn't be. All-action, box-to-box, takes risks and doesn't prioritise possession especially highly. He's nothing like Xavi.

8543~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
You don't really need stats, eyes are sufficient.

8544~~~
Barca can feck right off. They stole our trophy in 2011, they're not getting our Ander.

8545~~~
Herrera loves short passing and constant moving, though. He's like Iniesta's pragmatic, goal scoring little brother.

8546~~~
What's Catalan for "go feck yourself"?

8547~~~
And those things are important to Barca, but keeping possession is important to them too, and Herrera is far from being a specialist in that. Remember that Fabregas, who's far more of a typical Spanish/Barcelona midfielder than Herrera in style, didn't fit in because he was too direct.

He suits us. He wouldn't suit them.

8548~~~
Just googled it. 

everone repeat after me: 
que et fotin

8549~~~
By 2016, Louis' philopsohy will be strong in him. Look at the 'progression' from now since the start of the year. He'll be tailored made for Barca by that point. I can't see him leave though. He really does look like he wants to stay for a while.

8550~~~
Que et follin!

according to youswear.com

8551~~~
Van Gaal isn't making him 'more Barcelona-friendly', though. Where is there any evidence of that? He's not become any more of a possession-centric player, he's just changed his style off the ball a little. Don't confuse Van Gaal's 'philosophy' with how Barcelona play either, the two have very little to do with each other. The 'philosophy' isn't a specific way of playing, it's just Van Gaal's way of analysing the game and training players. Van Gaal's teams have played a wide range of strategies, styles and formations over the years.

8552~~~
I could see why Barcelona have interest in Ander, whenever i watch him play my thoughts goes "why didn't barcelona sign this lad".
He is a big fan of Messi and Iniesta himself, i don't know if he would consider a move there, but him being Spanish and all i could see it being a difficult choice.

8553~~~
Van Gaal wants him to play with his mind, not instinct. He wants him to create space, isolate gaps through possession and tire the opponents. Many aspects of van Gaal's philosophy directly correlate with Barcelona's identity of football. You'd be foolish to think otherwise. You're taking Barcelona's style to the extreme also. With Enrique as coach and players such as Suarez, Neymar, and Rakitic frequent players in the side alongside Xavi weaning out, Barcelona play a more direct brand of football, with less emphasis (still enough, of course) on the intricaces on possession. The article seems to suggest also through Herrera they would phase out Xavi's and Iniesta's era and bring in the new prototype of Herrera who is almost a halfway house between the possession dominant and the all out direct route.

8554~~~
To be fair, in '09 or '11 neither of those cups were stolen. Just comprehensively taken.

8555~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  good work!

8556~~~
Pretty sure barca tried signing him loads of times before, or were interested at least. They just weren't willing to do the buy out clause

8557~~~
If they wanted him so bad they would have payed the buyout clause. The guy has just arrived here, and already there is this talk, which is mad

8559~~~
If they were unwilling to pay his buyout clause, then what the hell to they think they would pay to buy him off us. If he progresses as he is then it will be a lot more than his buyout. Also how much would you charge to buy a Xavi/Iniesta replacement. He will be 27 then. You would have thought they would have bought him younger and groomed him into the player they want.

8560~~~
Barcelona and Real Madrid tend to treat La Liga players and in particular the Spanish U21 players as "theirs" and merely on extended loan to other clubs. Barcelona just haven't (hadn't?) completely accepted the idea that they might then have to pay full market value for them.

Real Madrid took Isco and Illarra a little earlier than normal and paid their valuations. Barca weren't willing to do that to get Javi Martinez, despite needing a central defender, so buying an expensive player like Herrera as a contingency or for the future certainly wasn't their style.

To be fair, looking back at the Herrera transfer thread on here (2013 and 2014) a lot of people were saying that 15-20m would be reasonable, £25m if pushed and Barcelona had the same opinion. If they're debating it again now - good, it means he's playing well. It would be more surprising if they weren't.

However, he's our player and the more games he plays, the more he looks like the player I hoped he was - a proper United player.

8561~~~
In other words they are cheapskates where Spanish players are concerned. Ander seems like someone who would like to stay here tbh and gain legendary status here. I would not want to be the player who replaces Xavi/Iniesta, if you don't live up to their standards it could finish your career.

8562~~~
You just know him and Mata have some wonderful games of Tennis in the summer.

Doubt anyone else at United joins them though, so it's probably just a case of Juan on Juan...

8563~~~
I believe Real and Barca dislike triggering release clauses because of the tax liability they incur on the transfers. I read somewhere that when a Spanish club triggers a buyout clause for a Spanish player it works differently to when a foreign club does it. Usually the big two use media pressure to beat down the selling club so they will negotiate a price. However, its different with Bilbao because no matter what they can never find Basques of similar quality and so they don't ever negotiate. Guess Barca are going to try and wait until Herrera is in the last two years of his deal at United and then try and make the deal happen.

8564~~~
If he is essential to how we play, then we should just tell them to get lost. Or charge them an extremely astronomical price. Ander is too nice a lad to play for that bunch of tossers.

8565~~~
Herrera is the sort of player who won't leave for a club like Barca or Real after all the things we did to him. He also loves it here, best buds with Mata and De Gea so hopefully they stay for as long as possible.

8566~~~
,


Not really. However, they do worry that as there's a lack of case law in the tax courts, so the rules might be interpreted differently next year. Hence when you use the release clause formally you end up paying even more expensive legal fees than normal and may decide to put an indemnity (or legal insurance) in place.

The main reason they avoid it is that it's considered to be rather undignified, a kind of bullying, so they prefer to be seen negotiate. They usually do have something of value to offer the other club as well. Both clubs have big youth systems so they can often offer a player on loan, or preferential terms on a sale to sweeten the deal. But however it gets dressed up, it's really just a matter of valuations.

Basically it comes down to money and with Athletic, because they only take Basque players, there aren't normally any tempting bonuses like player loan deals that can be offered.

At any rate, it doesn't matter, because we're the ones who actually paid the money and bought him. I was thinking about that the other day, watching Herrera and Mata, Woodward must be relieved!

8567~~~

8569~~~
Ander made EA Sports' FIFA team of the week.

8570~~~
Barcelona can (not so) kindly feck off!

8571~~~
Agreed. At least he's been singing about staying at united for many years, lets see how quick that turns around given their interest if its true, haha! Love the guy though - the new Hernandez personality wise!

8572~~~
I think Dani Parejo would be a good alternative for Barcelona instead of Ander. There's not a great deal between them but generally he's more of the controlling/accurate passing type that fits into Barcelona's philosophy and im sure he'd be cheaper than Ander from us.

8573~~~
I can think of a few names, Koke being one of them.  They won't sell to Real so Barca have a good chance of landing him for cheaper than Herrera.

8574~~~
What is Jagielka doing there? Surely there was a better CB performance. How can Alex Teixeira be better defensively than Ander? That is a joke

8575~~~
5 years time, he can play for England. He would still be good at 30 and besides Spain don't need him but England sure do especially when Carrick retires. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8576~~~
tbf he would be perfect player to their system, could help them hunt the ball high up the pitch and win it, perfect for the fluid combination, but yeah they can feck off or you can have him for 500m - the price for the best player in the team..

8577~~~
He's so huggable.

8578~~~
Just when you start really enjoying new characters in United some feckin Spanish twat comes immediately with an offer.

This shit needs to stop at this club or we're going nowhere with everything.

8579~~~
Fu.king Barcelona. Hate them and Madrid. Fu.k off.

8580~~~
There is not really much you can do as a club when Barcelona and Madrid come knocking at your door. When you shine as a player at a club like United, the exposure will be immense ( in comparison to Athletic Bilbao) and therefore it comes with the territory that other clubs will sniff around.

8581~~~
He can't play for England, he's already played for the under-21s.

8582~~~
That statement should never apply to a club like Manchester United.

8583~~~
He's recently stated that he's gonna be here for years, so chill out.

As long as he's a starter he won't go anywhere - feck around benching him in order to shunt Rooney into midfield and he'd probably start considering his options, as he should.

8584~~~
Is that the rules now. I thought you have to play for the senior team first.

8585~~~
Yes he can. But he won't.

8586~~~
I really doubt Koke would be available for cheaper

8587~~~
Of course, with Dyke there, its unfathomable. Besides, its best that way, other nations do it but I wouldn't go down that road not unless we we were really shit.

8588~~~
Exactly, we're not Spurs or something...

8589~~~
This!

8590~~~
Exactly. If this thing of selling players to Real and Barca becomes regular then we're setting a very dangerous precedent and sending out wrong signals. We'd become a feeder club for big clubs, like Arsenal has been in recent years.

8591~~~
Only one offer from Barcelona was sufficient to turn Liverpool FC into toothless vampire.

8592~~~
I think many fans seem to accept this status quo. It is seen almost as a thing of provide that Real or Barca want one of our players. It is a barometer to determine if a player is amongst the very best. 

Players themselves will start thinking like that and see Real and Barca as some sort of holy grail.

8593~~~
Herrera would not be eligible for England, just like Januzaj actually wasn't. Foreign players with no family link to the country can only get called up if they spent five years in education in that country before the age of 18.

As if it would ever happen anyway <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8594~~~
The Basque country has a team that plays friendlies. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_national_football_team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_national_football_team</a>

They only seem to play around once a year.

8595~~~
And when was the last time we sold a player to Barcelona...?

And when was the last time we sold a player to Real Madrid...?

And when was the last time we bought one of Real Madrid's best players...?

What I will agree with you all on is that we need to aggressively oppose <i>the risk</i> of becoming a feeder club to these two, and this will happen by tying our own players down and also by actively pursuing Real and Barca's best players...

I think Woodward has the same idea. We need to really start aggressively using our financial might to ensure we're seen as nothing less than an equal of Real and Barcelona.

I think they already do. To be a star at Real or Barca is considered, rightly or wrongly, the pinnacle of club football.

Between them Real and Barca have - 

Messi
Ronaldo
Suarez
Neymar
Bale
Benzema
Modric
Rodriguez
Kroos
Busquets
Xavi
Iniesta
Pedro
Mascherano

And that's just forwards and midfielders... mental.

We became <i>incredibly</i> uncompetitive in the transfer market in Fergie & Gill's last years but thankfully Woodward seems hellbent on making waves again. Hopefully between Van Gaal's knowledge and Woodwards spending we get it right.

8596~~~
You just killed the whole thread with one post.

8597~~~
He will now be known as 'The Thread Slayer'. Where <a class="username" data-user="87069, @JUPITER" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87069/">@JUPITER</a> passe the thread trépasse.

8598~~~
let's buy Pogba, Schneiderlin, Depay, Reus and Hummels and we are going for the champions league title.. agree with the lack of transfer activity we should have been doing better. It will be interesting to see how much will Van Gaal want to invest or which strategy he will take, all players are gettable and potentially world class, only POgba would cost big penny and maybe available next year. Who cares he might imbalance the squad a little bit when he's future ballon d'or contender. Fergie used to buy strikers when they become available and always found a place for them..

       Schneiderlin 
Herrera     -     Pogba     

This is perhaps too much of dreaming and different thread material but still this looks like the hell of a midfield, almost unbeatable if everything clicked. With all respect to Carrick and Blind, they wouldn't have place in thism, still good squad players tbf to them though

I'm going to bed and close my eyes, haha

8599~~~
You know there's something wrong with the world when people start taking EA Sports' FIFA team of the week as any kind of serious reference.

8600~~~
Such a relief that he's playing so well. At the turn of the year there was so much doom and gloom about how most of us signings look like failures and that we have wasted so much money. Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Di Maria all had big question marks around their names with Shaw being let off only because of his age. Thankfully 3 out of 4 seem to be playing well and Di Maria will probably kick on next season.

8601~~~
I disagree, at least in part. They are the pinnacle for Southern European and South American players perhaps, but if you were to ask most players from North America, Asia and northern Europe then I bet they'd largely choose us over the Spanish clubs. Unfortunately for us, it happens that the best players tend to come from the regions the Spanish club are held in higher regard. With the population numbers in 'our' regions and increased popularity of football there, I'd imagine it won't be too long until we start becoming the pinnacle for some top players. If we aren't already.

8602~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Very good.

Who do I have to pester/bribe/flatter to get this as my tagline...?

8603~~~
When we had player like Ronaldo and now we have a player who can be similar powerhouse but in goalkeeping with already not far away to best in the world status.

Do the math.

8604~~~
I don't think the 'when was the last time we sold a player to Real' argument is as valid as people make out. As I said earlier, in my opinion, it is almost seen as a thing of pride to have a player that they would a actually want. The fact is, even most of our beloved heroes we have had in recent  years may not have gotten into their team, or they would not be interested for other reasons. When we had the De facto best in the world, there was an inevitability he would go to where the best players (officially ) in the world tend to play - Real Madrid (or Barca). Fans seem to be approaching  the De Gea  situation with the same inevitability, despite minimal noise from Madrid themselves. It is almost a case of 'he's so good, he will obviously end up there'.

I remarked around the time of the Januzaj hype last season when there were question marks about his contract at how many posters were saying he should sign for us now, and then he can go to Madrid when he's 25 if he wants. There had been nothing from either the player or Madrid to even hint of an interest,  and we could not even play the 'all Latin players dream of bla bla ' card with a Belgian.  It was simply inferiority complex speaking I think, and the expression of many of our fans seeing us as a step down to Madrid, and a place that Januzaj will of course end up if he becomes so good that he may dare to catch their interest. At least we  an get some good money and grab some bargains from their boot sale as part of the deal hey!

Likewise , I have seen justification on spending X amount on Pogba as he is still young and can be sold to Madrid for profit once he becomes the best in the world.

8605~~~
Correct, i actually meant that whenever a player shines at  a club like Manchester United, the exposure will be immense and therefore clubs like Madrid and Barcelona will be sniffing around for the 'best'. I totally agree that United is on the same list as the above mentioned clubs.

8606~~~
Ok, without meaning to sound patronising (genuinely), it's really important to remember that De Gea hasn't been sold to Real Madrid (or anyone), he's a Utd player.

So the answer to my question of when was the last time we sold a player to Real Madrid, is 2009. That's <i>6 seasons ago...
</i>
The last time we signed one of their best players was about 9 months ago.

Fair enough if that annoys you, but it's just fans talking - it has no bearing on the club's actual dealings.

David de Gea is <i>from Madrid</i>, his family lives in Madrid, his girlfriend mainly lives in Madrid. If he goes there, these factors will obviously play a MASSIVE part in his decision.

8609~~~
What has happened with Ander really does seem like the perfect meshing of an experienced coach and talented player finding a middle ground and the player coming out an even better one on the other end. For me Ander has to be one of the corner stones we build this next United team around.

8610~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8611~~~
Remember Rio tweeting them to complain about his pace?

8612~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> did he really?

8613~~~
He feckin' did!

In a sadder variant, I remember Fletch mentioning that it was hard to explain to his sons why his card wasn't as good as other Man Utd midfielders.

8614~~~
He's also worse than Quaresma. That is enough proof to say that those ranking are pure joke.

8615~~~
Do we need a box-to-box midfielder now that Ander is adapting to this position? LvG said he is becoming a 60 meter midfielder and suddently the need for balance is no more. 
Carrick/Blind besides Herrera with Rooney in front of them would provide enough defensive stability.

8616~~~
If you count Mata as a midfielder we've got 5 in total, Carrick will be 34 and Blind is sometimes needed at LB. Herrera can't play every match, plus we'd have no backup (Rooney) if he or Fellaini can't play. I'm sure he still wants another midfielder.

8617~~~
We have Peirera though who has been involved with the first team this year, seems like LvG rates him so he could be the backup.
Of course it depends on how Herrera performs in the last games of the season.

8618~~~
The last time Pereira played was as a right winger, we need depth and we also need to upgrade at every opportunity, if Mata is a midfielder we need a winger, if Mata is a winger we need a CM.

8619~~~
We need defensive midfielders cover, not attacking. Don't think Peirera is that.

8620~~~
It was funny because i thought he was an AM aswell, but people who follow the youth teams say he can play as an #8 aswell.

8621~~~
I haven't seen enough of him personally so I wouldn't know. If he's a genuine 8 that could be an option, if not we're buying a CM. I don't think in a year with Europe he wants to rely on Pereira as the only cover for Herrera/Fellaini though, especially since he's not physical (something which he said he underestimated about the PL).

8622~~~
Question is whether we're better off going for cover or do we instead bring in someone for the first 11 and relegate either Herrera or Fellaini to the bench.

8623~~~
Some unsurprising but to the point stats :

Started CM <b>9 times, 5 goals and 2 assists</b>
Started AM (in the hole) 1 times, 0 goals and 1 assist
Started DM (in a deeper midfield duo) 2 times, 0 goals and 0 assists
Subbed on 7 times, 0 goals and 1 assist

Now imagine if he had started as a CM every week. Also, thats just in terms of productivity. He still did a decentish job in the hole, did well in a 2 man midfield with Blind and has still more often than not had a good effect off the bench. But starting him in a lineup that gives him the freedom to get forward like the 4-1-4-1 sees him have an impact on the scoreline

8624~~~
What I like about Ander is that he scores goals with both feet, against Villa, one left footed, one right. There is no point in trying to drive him onto his wrong side as he doesn't seem to have one.

8625~~~
Really hope he continues to develop the 'Lampard' arrival on the edge of the box. Thinking back to some of his goals this season like QPR, Swansea and the second vs Villa he's a great weapon to have for cut backs as his finishes are controlled and deadly accurate. Consistent goals from midfield next season would be <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

8626~~~
Really big game for him today. Needs to do it against a team like City for people to really respect him as one of the best in the League and in Europe.

8627~~~
Souness saying he doesn't know what he is good at apart from scoring the odd goal. What a cnut.

8628~~~
Yep, clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. Embarrassing.

8629~~~
Was just about to say this. "Assists?". " yeah but you'd expect that from a midfielder"

What the feck?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8630~~~
haha i don't think he's going to be considered as one of the best in europe no matter how well he plays

8631~~~
Well not because of one game, no. But that is what he should attain to. International recognition and CL and big game performances will put his name in such conversations.

8632~~~
Superb 1st half. Reminds me of Modric.

8633~~~
He's been excellent so far.

8634~~~
Top class midfielder.

8635~~~
He's so good

8636~~~
I love'em. Completely owning that midfield today on the ground while Fellaini dominates in the air, leaving Carrick to tie things together with ease. Great stuff.

8637~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> He is such a smart little player, isn't he?

His footwork is sex

8639~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> So silky in possession

8640~~~
One of two players early in the half that didn't shit himself at the prospect of playing City.

8641~~~
Ridiculously composed. We've finally found that CM to give us some movement in the middle. So pleased

8642~~~
He's just a spanish Cleverley. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

8643~~~
Very much this. I thought he was a dead ringer in terms of style of play in that first half.

8644~~~
Those are great stats for a CM.

8645~~~
The odd mistake in him when he keeps the ball a tad longer instead of passing it first time - I wish he'd cut that. 

Otherwise, so tidy in possession, this lad. The last bit of foot work at the end of the half! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Even annoyed with Rooney for not playing Fellaini and rightly so!

8646~~~
Well, he did do one pass in a similar fashion where he swung his passing leg over his shoulder

8647~~~
Disappointing. Why does he not score yet? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

8648~~~
So good

8649~~~
So clever in every way, turning passing etc.

8650~~~
Brilliant so far. Tried to be a bit to cute at times, but his composure is possession is just fantastic. We now finally have a CM who does not shit himself when being pressed

8651~~~
Just a joy to watch play, his control and composure has been vital in us getting a foothold in the game after City flew out of traps.

8652~~~
My God I love him. His touch and his control are magnificent.

8653~~~
He doesn't do anything apart scoring apperantely.

8654~~~
Does he get an assist for youngs goal?

8655~~~
Definitely.

8656~~~
He's been very good. Hopefully he can get a bit further up the pitch in the second half but given his stature he's been the leat effected by how physical City have been.

8657~~~
I don't think so.

8658~~~
We need to get a gif of that pass around 81:50 to Di Maria. Amazing first time pass

8659~~~
I wanna give him a cuddle

8660~~~
He is superb.

8661~~~
excellent game again

8662~~~
Absolutely brilliant today, even when we were up against it he was the one still performing well.

8663~~~
He's magnificient. The best signing of the summer, by a big margin.

8664~~~
He is just superb. Souness can't think of anything he can say about him other than the goals he's scored recently. Well, he was watching today, there was plenty to talk about. An incredibly intelligent, agile and positive footballer.

8665~~~
Very good game, doing a lot of dirty work in the quiet.

8666~~~
Great game and his touch is just delightful. That pass to Valencia in the 2nd half <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8667~~~
Brilliant player. He's answered our long ignored calls for a better quality centre midfielder.

8668~~~
Solid performance. Did so much so quietly and kept the team ticking on.

8669~~~
He seems to have gotten much stronger physically as the season progressed. He got bullied very easily at the start of the season but now he's shrugging off players like Toure, Fernandinho and Kompany.

8670~~~
Oh its beautiful to have a mid, and a bloody good one too. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8671~~~
Excellent once again.

8672~~~
Where have you been all these years, Ander?

8673~~~
Always a classy player even when he doesn't have a truly stand out performance. Has a very high 'bottom level' so to speak.

8674~~~
Subtle display by the midfield maestro today.. not eye-catchingly brilliant but tactically good in all aspects today. Scary thing - he can play much better.

8675~~~
good game

8676~~~
No, as it came off young and then the defender

8677~~~
He was our foothold in midfield until Carrick finally warmed up and got control of the game. The one player City's aggressive pressing couldnt get near as he elegantly and comfortably passed the ball around them. It was very important

8678~~~
Brilliant player. Best midfielder in the league since he's come in the team

8679~~~
Best Spanish midfielder. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

Are you watching del Bosque?

8680~~~
Superb movement throughout. We've been crying out for someone willing to create space like that for years! He must be awful in training to have been overlooked for so long.

8681~~~
Him versus Fabregas will be interesting.

8682~~~
Out of interest how did you get the tagline? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8683~~~
Not a bad performance considering he "doesn't do much" as old Souness claims.

8684~~~
He keeps getting better and better in his new role. He's developed a very good understanding with Carrick, Valencia and Mata. He played a very big part in our build up play and he was always at the right place at the right time to become the extra man in our half of the pitch. He also had four (!!!) dribbles which is quite amazing considering he was the b2b midfielder playing closer to Carrick.

He stayed a bit deeper today cause Fellaini had to spend more time in advanced positions and chase those long balls out of the defense but i wouldn't be surprised if LvG says that this was one of Herrera's best performances thus far for the club.

8685~~~
Sixty metre midfielder.

8686~~~
Such a great all round performance. Great ball in for Young, ran all day long, great skill in tight areas, some fantastic passing and bounced off Carrick so well.

What a man.

8687~~~
Indeed. It's always amazing how easy he seems to deal with being under pressure.

8688~~~
His ability to receive any type of pass, control it and give it in less than 3 touches is outstanding.

8689~~~
Works hard and has bags of class, excellent player I love him.

8690~~~
He'll keep Gundogan out constantly at this rate should he join us.

8691~~~
good player

8692~~~
Does that one-touch body-feint change of direction thing have a name? Or should we just name after him?

8693~~~
I agree, and think he should get credit for turning the tide against City's dominance in the first 10-15 minutes.  He was the only one in midfield that looked on top of their game in the early developments of the contest.

8694~~~
I was too critical about his debut against Swansea, in which, I believe, he was really crap. However he's now mine highest rated player on this site (bar Perreira, whom I only rated against MK Dons).

8695~~~
I'm just glad he plays for us.

8696~~~
He was an unsung hero today, absolutely class performance.

8697~~~
His performance was sublime (was going to say sexual for some reason<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>).

8698~~~
Growing into one of the most important players in the team. The guy is pure class.

8699~~~
He's excellent, doesn't panic and can tackle. Brilliant player.

8700~~~
Made such a difference in midfield today. Literally glided around both on and off the ball. Seemed like City couldn't touch him.

8701~~~
Would love to know how much ground he covered today, he was everywhere. He also was the only player that turned up inside the first 20 mins.

He's brilliant.

8702~~~
I just love this guy. It's so nice having a top central midfielder playing for us again.

8703~~~
It's called 'The Scholes'.  

Also did anybody hear Sourness (I spelt Souness but it autocorrected and I thought it was appropriate) pre match?  
Saying something about Herrera scoring goals and then said he's struggling to think of anything else he's good at.

8704~~~
The Scouse in Sourness is still aching about Herrera going to JuAnfield, getting an assist, getting Stampy sent off and taking a massive s-t on "Hendo" & Allen. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8705~~~
To be fair to Souness, after the game he was full of praise for all the team.

8706~~~
This + incredible movement off the ball

8707~~~
It's not like he had a choice.

8708~~~
The fact Souness can't see what else Herrera does apart from scoring goals is ridiculous. I don't even know if its sour grapes or a genuine lack of knowledge about football.

8709~~~
That close control to leave Fernandinho on his arse was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8710~~~
What a terrific player he is.

8711~~~
Yeah in the pre match he was itching for a huge City win.

8712~~~
Christ I love this man. He was so silky in possession and also kept it ticking over very efficiently. Stood his ground and kept the ball well too.

8713~~~
The former. Bitter and twisted Scouse bastard.

8714~~~
You mean the one where he switches the ball onto his other foot while running? Its called 'la croqueta' and it was popularised by Iniesta in recent years. Btw Iniesta is Herrera's favorite player and im sure he's learnt a thing or two from him.


<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbT3m4w4AL0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8715~~~
Yep, he was talking absolute garbage.

8716~~~
Yeah but still. His natural sourness must have been hard to fight.

8717~~~
Maybe if he could do the amazing things Lucas and Allen do then Souness would appreciate him.

8718~~~
Worth every single penny of his price tag.

8719~~~
Pure sex.

8720~~~
Was always this good and despite most of the big clubs in europe having midfield crisis', he was never in demand! Shameful stuff really. In matches like those, where the opposition is pressing us heavily, your 8 should be your best player and he was. Quality footballer, that's what a midfielder looks like.

8721~~~
That's not the thing the guy was talking about I believe (it's a simple, yet so bloody effective, feint to one side with actually taking the ball the other way), but la croqueta's the move I wanted to mention, he's done it in midfield today and put somebody on his arse with it, I think it was during some counter when Fellaini was charging down the left side, Rooney was in the middle and in the end he fecked up the move by chosing right wing.

Think it was Fernandinho he left on his ass.

8722~~~
Nah it's not that one. It's when he's about to recieve a pass he leans as if to let the ball run across him but taps it back in the direction it came at the last moment. Did it twice today I think.

8723~~~
Great player, he sure loves to slide tackle though

8724~~~
He didn't have a shot on target today did he? So this means he still holds his record of scoring with every shot he's had on goal.

8725~~~
Brilliant again

8726~~~
For me, if it wasn't for Young, I'd have him down as MOTM. Don't take that as a slight against any of our other top performers though.

Relentless pressing and so cool under pressure. Absolutely integral to how we're playing right now.

8727~~~
He was fantastic, yet again. 
God, Souness is either incredibly bitter or just an absolute idiot when it comes to judging a footballer.

8728~~~
That Gentleman, is called 'The Laudrup'.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftu3OFoSAVs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8729~~~
2 rash slide tackles in the 1st half but excellent otherwise.

8730~~~
For me he has the talent to be the best midfielder in this league. Quality quality player.

8731~~~
He's our Iniesta.

8732~~~
There is no doubting he is growing into a very good player but he lacks composure when in deep areas (often hacking or scewing the ball away) and sometimes he tries to over complicate things when its not needed. So pleased he is showing what a good player he can be now though. 

To be honest though there are few poor performers in the team at the moment. If anyone.

8733~~~
Right now he's playing to the level of Vidal last season, he's been that good.

8734~~~

8735~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8736~~~
Yeah he's done it a few times this season, really throws the opposition off balance and it's hard to read where he is going. I don't remember anybody else using that type of touch before, really makes space well.

8737~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8738~~~
Another very good game from an increasingly impressive and authoritative player. Really like his blend of skill, tenacity and end product.

And not a single cap for Spain. If he was English, he'd be our first choice midfielder.

8739~~~
Quickly becoming one of my favourite players. He's got plenty of room for improvement but he exudes class and I love his attitude and work rate. Also very impressed how confident he is on the ball when players are pressurising him - he's doing what Kagawa could never master for us.

A much, much better player than anyone is really giving credit for yet. I couldn't believe it when Souness openly stated that he couldn't find any positives in Herrera's game apart from the recent goals (despite highlights being played showing his passing range). Pathetic, lazy punditry from a bitter man who's clearly not watched United play over the last month.

8740~~~
Had Fernandinho on his arse all game

8741~~~
Andrés Herrera. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Another top performance, we've really missed a player like him in our side and he just brings so much to the table.

8742~~~
I think he's pretty much my favourite player. So good on the ball and works tirelessly off it.

8743~~~
Apparently covered the most km today as well with 11.4

8744~~~
Are you referring to his signature move? Is this the one?

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/124771967" width="500"></iframe>

Also one from the Sunderland game:

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/120899877" width="500"></iframe>

8745~~~
Yup! Cheers for finding it

8746~~~
Lovely first touch. So important for a player in his position.

8747~~~
Especially the fact that he can do it on the turn, means he can just inject pace into the game and get away from his opponent so quickly. A lot of players need to get to square before they can confidently control the ball.

8748~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaBTZ0SaErM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

That pass at 2.56. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8749~~~
I don't know that it's enough of a 'trick' to have a name. It's just him feinting to turn outside and then not doing it, stepping back into the direction of the pass again instead. Executes it brilliantly though. It's just one of a whole catalogue of deceptive first touches that he uses to instantly make space when he receives a pass.

8750~~~
If he improves then we really could have another Iniesta on our hands. He has been quality since he has started getting regular football. Really is a fan favourite now.

8751~~~
He's not really that much like Iniesta in style. Can't we just enjoy him in his own right without always having to throw some other player's name around as a comparison?

8752~~~
Popularised by Iniesta, perhaps, but Laudrup mastered it like a Level 86 Wizard King.

8753~~~
He's certainly been the best signing this year. Such a composed and skilful player. Someone who can compete against anyone. Who would have thought that he would have such a fantastic end to the season a couple of months ago?

Him and Mata on the right could be a solid partnership for years to come now and 6 months ago both of their futures were getting questioned by people like me <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

8754~~~
Is he the best central midfielder in the league at the moment? I can't think of anyone Id swap him for.

8755~~~
He'll have to keep it going for longer before we can rate him properly I think.

8756~~~
I've never seen a player so good against players that press us. He's just so calm and is always thinking 4-5 steps ahead of the opponent.

Honestly, I was disappointed that we did not get Vidal in the Summer, even though I was ecstatic about Herrera. At the minute, however, I reckon even Vidal of last year would struggle to get in ahead of Herrera.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Stats-wise:</span>

Herrera (this season) - 25 apps - 7 goals - 5 assists

Vidal (this season)     - 35 apps - 6 goals - 3 assists

Vidal (last season)     - 44 apps - 18 goals - 5 assists

(In all comps)

Considering Vidal plays in a much worse league, plays/ed in more competitions and had 19 more appearances last season and was part of the overwhelmingly dominant team, I'd say Herrera has done better.

8757~~~
He did. During the spell we were playing ping-pong inside the D early in the second half. Talking about that, Carrick should have done better on that one.

8758~~~
An ideal complement in the right side triangle with Mata and Valencia and hard to not just swoon over him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8759~~~
Really is a big-game player as well.

8760~~~
I had a dream last night that he decided to join Barca at the end of the season to play with his role model Iniesta. I was so pissed off and then I woke up and was happy again he still plays for us.

8761~~~
surely deserves a Spain call up soon with this kind of form.

8762~~~
Just watched the game because I was working all day.  I honestly think he was quiet today, along with Mata, Valencia and Rooney from an attacking viewpoint.  Most of our threat came down the left all game.  He still contributed some nice moments but didn't have the overall influence of previous games.  This is a positive though because it wasn't a great performance by us but we were still the better side for 65 minutes.  If we had all our players functioning to recent levels City would've been nowhere near us (although they are shit atm).  Bodes well for the future.

8763~~~
I'm not sure how many he has this season (or last) but I know he's very good at and takes Juve's penalties too.

8764~~~
That's not him in the picture at the top of the page, is it? Looks like a different man.

8765~~~
you are joking, right? i am on the phone, cant see a white text. Thats from his Bilbao days, 2 or 3 years ago.

8766~~~
Certainly. He's so well rounded that he is comfortable in any type of game that it turns in to. He's in my opinion our teams best presser, the engine of the pressing, and that says a lot considering how good he is in possession.

8767~~~
No need to downplay Vidal of last season, he was arguably the best or second best CM in the world last season. What makes Vidal special (or did) is that not only is the combination of productivity, the insane work rate, and defensive skills. As good as Herrera has been for us, he's not close to Vidal in work rate and defensive skills.

8768~~~
Not at all. As I said, I was really disappointed we did not get Vidal last season and he was definitely my muppet signing. 

I was showing how good Herrera has been for us in comparison to a clear benchmark of someone that pretty much everyone can agree is a world class midfielder, especially last season.

8769~~~
Fair enough. I'm really glad with how Herrera has progressed this season. He has been productive throughout the season, but only in our recent form, his overall game has began to stand out. I feel like having Mata in the same lineup really helps his game too, they have great chemistry.

8770~~~
Err a lot of players were doing it, no? It's "just" a double contact.

8771~~~
No he'll never get any where close to that level. He's class though. Love watching him.

8772~~~
Brilliant.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8773~~~
I vote for changing it to a picture of him in a United kit.

8774~~~
oh what a player we have in him, its amazing how quick he adapted to LVG and the league!

8775~~~
That's absolutely not true and just goes on to show how people lap up all the things said about certain players. Herrera's tackling and his ability to press at the right time have been excellent. He has been our box-to-box player in the actual sense and his ability to keep the ball under pressure is immense. Vidal had a great last season but just like no one needs to downplay Vidal's performances, there is no need to downplay Herrera's as well. If anyone asked me to chose between Vidal and Herrera right now, it will be Herrera hands down.

8776~~~
This.

The lad is fecking amazing.

8777~~~
He really is a gem of a player. We're lucky he still wanted to come to us after last season. Love watching him play. His intelligence, touch, composure and his work rate is what we've missed in the middle for a while. He brings dynamism to the midfield.

8778~~~
With him and Carrick we have probably the most underrated midfield in the league.

8779~~~
Herrera is like Carrick a very intelligent player who runs at the right time and covers the right spaces. Not like many other just running around and maybe tackling more often. This guy makes us so much better especially in terms of pressing. He is not running after the ball like Cleverley did he is running to put the opponents under pressure and get the ball off him before he looks for a through ball.

8780~~~
How many more incredible Spanish midfielders, who aren't much of a name and don't even have a cap or anything, are there? Let's go sign them all!

8781~~~
He's just brilliant, not only in the technical sense but his work rate is fantastic. Gets about the pitch so well and never stopped running yesterday. Didn't half put the work in for that result.

8782~~~
Has the 2nd best touch in the team, so Scholes like in the sense that the first touch will get him a shit-tonne of space without doing anything fancy.

8783~~~
"Watch with me, to the left! to the left!"

8784~~~
He left Fernandinho like his dad.

8785~~~
With all those players he's been likened to since he came here, I think we would do worse than to compare him with a young, Spanish Nicky Butt. Granted he's got more in his locker technically but the combative way of playing and all-round performances it surely isn't the worst comparison. Similar physique as well, skinnish but strong legs and frame.

EDIT: add late runs into the box to that. He certainly reminds me more of young Butty than he does of Iniesta for starters.

8786~~~
Fellaini's chest control first?

8787~~~
How did he play? Couldnt watch the match due to travel.

8788~~~
I don't know if either are capped but Camacho and Iturraspe are both players capable of playing for any of the top 5 sides in the league. Parejo too.

8789~~~
I thought he was excellent. Especially at the beginning when were getting hammered, he was the only one who looked like he wasn't bricking it. 

I love the guy. He's made for United. Every now and again you get a player and you just feel like they get it. He has character, he's mentally strong and he's tenacious. 

When he first came I thought he was a decent little player, now I'm starting to really rate him.

8790~~~
Different players really with different strengths. If you take both at their best, Hererra is better than vidal with the ball at his feet but vidal defensively is a difference make, the sort Hererra will never be. Vidal is one of those players that go charging around opposition midfields, hustling the ball away from them without really being out of position. Herrera has a solid defensive game without being really destructive. Herrera on the ball is in a whole different category to vidal, he's someone that wouldn't look out of place at barca. Depends on what a team needs.

8791~~~
Vidal last season: 4.1 tackles per game, 1.3 interceptions per game.

Herrera this season: 2.5 tackles per game, 1.8 interceptions per game. 

I cant find the statistic for distance covered per game, but Vidal has one of the best engines in the world, and the willingness to run around all game. Herrera has a high work rate too but not at the same intensity. I am not trying to downplay Herrera, I am really happy with his recent form and hope he keeps progressing. At this rate of development, it won't be long till he is considered one of the best CMs in the world, and inevitably Real & Barca will come knocking.

8792~~~
Again, not saying Vidal was not great last season but you also have to take into account that Herrera has just moved to a new league and been a consistent fixture in our team only for the last couple of months. Also, is that tackles per game only showing the successful tackles or taking into account all tackles which may also lead to fouls?

8793~~~

8794~~~
He may pick up a few Scholes-esque cards along the way for it, but I love the way he's trying to add some steel to his game. He's becoming much more aggressive and putting himself about in this recent run of form. He's obviously not Roy Keane or ever going to be, but that seemed to be one of the biggest concerns about him.

8795~~~
Remember when he was being compared to Kagawa? Those were the days...

I'm so glad he's doing well and has proven his doubters wrong.

8796~~~
10 times the player that Kagawa is and ever was!

8797~~~
I believed I compared him to Kagawa then because Van Gaal was not playing Herrera during that period. As such, I was trying to get a free Herrera campaign going.

Nevertheless and moreover, Herrera and Kagawa do share similar attributes. Both are tremendously technically gifted and intelligent footballers. I still wish Van Gaal had not have sold Kagawa. Him and Herrera playing together on the same pitch would be just too beautiful to watch.

8798~~~
It wouldn't have, Kagawa was average for us most of the time and he didn't fit in what LVG wanted for us, and we clearly do not miss him. He was a passenger and apart from that game in Norwich he did nothing in a red shirt that warranted the hype he received when he wasn't playing.

8799~~~
My opinion is different and I saw Kagawa as an influential member of our team in regards to playing better and aesthetically pleasing football. If he was giving more time, in particular in our current system alongside herrera and/or mata their would have been an improvement to his overall performance.

One things you fans have to remember is that the season before we had Herrera and blind, we had no technical gifted central midfielder. We had to rely on the likes of cleverley, anderson, Fellaini and fletcher(sparingly) as our number 8. It is difficult to have anything going in the attack with midfielders like those. It is really no surprise that United looks much better with Herrera in our midfield and I would not be surprised if we turned to shit once one of either blind of Herrera succumb to injury or bad form.

8800~~~
Firstly he was not influential at all, he was not on De Gea, Rooney, RVP (pre-slump), and Carrick's level of influence for example which is what you are referring to. Sure he worked well with Mata, but we didn't play aesthetically pleasing football when he was in the side, all it was, was side ways and short passing going nowhere 90 odd percent of the time with Kagawa. 

Also he is not a central midfielder he's a number ten, who plays in the hole. Carrick is also technically gifted by the way. And Kagawa was never used in that number 8 role because as LVG said I think, somewhere, that he cannot play in that role. We look better because Herrera is a quality player, an actual central midfielder and suits the system we play. Kagawa had no goals and about three assists in his last season, that's some influence.

8801~~~
We did look better when he was on the pitch, but I can not change your opinion, so I will not bother with that aspect.

On your second point, I never said kagawa was a number 8. What I stated was that it is hard for him to get any support when the players in the number 8 role then was clverley, Fellaini, anderson, and fletcher. Herrera is our current number 8 and we have looked so much better with a proper midfielder in that vital free role that links our midfield with our attack. Once again, if you take Herrera out of our team and replace him with any other players bar perhaps blind or maybe Andreas Perrera, we would not look as fluid or balanced as we look now.

8802~~~
LVG used him in that role in the summer before he sold him. Just replacing  any of that midfield and we will be completely different, I agree that taking Herrera out would make it different but that midfield three works well because of the balance that the three players give to the team. Also, I never saw Cleverley play that way with us, neither did Fletcher, Fletcher before the illness was a more defensive box to box player and he was damn good at it. In fact he was better than all those players. He was not used as a number 8 when he came back from illness, he was used in Carrick's role. Anderson was used, and until he became what he is today did not do too badly.

8803~~~
Fact. Kagawa never played much / consistently for us. Consistency was what he needed. His influence on our play was clear to see. Side ways and short passing was Kagawa's fault? Seriously? Because I don't remember us playing fluid football under Moyes for most of the time he was shut out of the first 11. He would thrive under our current system playing as a wide playmaker.

8804~~~
He had a run of games with mata and he did nothing. Even with Fergie we weren't fluid either, and although he was better he didn't have the influrence we all expected.

8805~~~
Good grief man. Too harsh. If that's your standard of a flop, then I wonder what you think of ADM. He had a run of games with Mata where we performed far better. And that run was at the end of a miserable season, and by the way, it wasn't a very long run either. The fact is he wouldn't had needed to be coached much; he's a natural like Herrera in terms of understanding movements and when to time them. He struggled because our team had no idea how to pass and move, a travesty for a modern football club. Van Gaal has rectified that.

8806~~~
Not too harsh at all mate, and I really like ADM actually. Nah, I still think Kagawa did not make the grade he didn't step up when we needed him to (like most of the players btw). We don't miss him, don't need him and he was overrated anyway.

8807~~~
Here's a question, Do you think if we had got Herrera a year earlier as planned it would of resulted in Moyes doing better and keeping his job?

8808~~~
Probably not. LvG has recoached him into a far better player. The way the defence was and the rest of the team were performing poor Ander would have been dragged down to their level. It has actually worked out well for him to arrive this season. A lot better manager and a lot better coaching staff.

8809~~~
I think that's being a bit generous. Herrera at his best at Athletic was every bit as good as he has been for us in the last month or two. What I'd say LvG has done is mould him to fit in his system properly and show the positional discipline he didn't previously have, I don't think he's made him a better player, we're just seeing him at his best now because he's playing regularly and full of confidence.

Anyway, you'd expect him to be getting better regardless, he's 25 after all, for a midfielder it's safe to assume he isn't close to his peak yet.

8810~~~
You are right, but I still think it is better for Ander to have arrived at the club at a more optimistic time. The dressing room last season was poisonous, far too many agendas going on. He has come into a really happy tight dressing room this season and has shown himself to be willing to learn and improve. Moyes didn't know what to do with Juan Mata, not sure he would have utilised Ander properly either, fortunately we don't have to now worry about that.

8811~~~
Needs to play a lot better in his second season or he'll be a flop too. 

It's unfair to label any new signing a flop in their debut season (which is why I'm even a little bit wary about writing Falcao off, just yet) If they don't kick on and improve in their second season (as we're seeing with Fellaini) then it's fair enough to call them a flop. As far as Kagawa's concerned his underwhelming return to Dortmund (and struggles for his national team) speaks volumes. A fairly average player we signed after a fairly exceptional 18 months.

8812~~~
Off topic, but I really don't consider this to be a 'flop' debut season for ADM. I think the main reason people see it as so is his enormous fee, which I guess it's fair enough, but I would've hoped by now that the majority of us would be able to look past transfer fees considering how crazy they are in the modern game. 4 goals and 12 assists really isn't a bad debut season for a player new to the English game who played in a mostly under performing team. I do expect better next season, though, obviously.

8813~~~
The ever growing but entirely ridiculous myth. They had one good game together and that was about 30 good minutes against the worst side in the second half of season in Newcastle.

Kagawa was about as average as average gets. Mediocre footballer who had 6 good months. Herrera is on a different planet and more importantly is not a footballing coward.

8814~~~
If he'd arrived with a similar fee/profile to Kagawa then I probably wouldn't be using the "F" word but when Ashley Young is keeping  the most expensive player in the history of the Premier League on the bench, during our most critical run of games this season, you'd have to say he's been a long way short of an actual success.

But yeah, off topic. Hererra. Definitely not a flop!

8815~~~
Lvg using kagawa in that number 8 role was a very bad experiment and it is no surprised he did not do well in that position as he is not a number 8. 

On the bold point, what role did you see Cleverley play at United? When he played, he mostly sat next to a holding midfielder player in either Carrick, Fletcher or sparingly Fellaini. That role is called a number 8. Even though he did not play like one, that was the role he occupied. Fletcher sometimes partner Carrick aswell last season and I agree post his injury, he adapted his game to be more of a deep lying midfielder, but once again the role he occupied when sat next to Carrick was that of a number 8, even though he did not look like one. As such, therein lied some of the problems we had with our midfield last season and as such, it had a bad effect on our attack.

I even remember last season saying that if we change our midfield for a league two midfield side we would be in much better shape. That how bad our midfield was last season and with a midfield that bad, I am really surprised how we got anything going in the attack.

Herrera touch and awareness: <a class="externalLink" href="http://streamable.com/4nai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://streamable.com/4nai</a>

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8818~~~
He's a genius.

8819~~~
Brilliant player we have on our hands.

The way he creates space for himself is a joy to watch.

8820~~~
That's kind of his signature move. Shapes to take it on the turn, then takes the ball back where it came from instead. Really effective and not something you see many players do.

8821~~~
Was he awarded the assist for youngs goal? It was a brilliant left footed cross to be honest

8822~~~
Is he doing a feint? Not particular sure what that move is called. It seems to be a signature move of his. 

Edit missed the post below.

8823~~~
Love watching this lad! He is just fantastic, hope it continues!

8824~~~
Can't stress enough how important first touch is especially for midfielders. A good first touch is like have an extra move. A great first touch is worth an extra move and a second or two.

8825~~~
Well I would say it is especially important for goalkeepers. A goalkeeper with a bad first touch sounds terrible.

8826~~~
Should teach Rooney how to do that

8827~~~
If a player has a good solid first touch, he can decide what to do with the ball before he has it. His teammates can also start timing their runs before he has recieved the ball. If his first touch can't be counted on, he and his teammates will have to wait and see where the ball ends up and then they finally can decide what to do. It slows the play down a lot. So I think it's even more important for good team play than for the individual player.

8828~~~
I agree he was overrated. Not to flog a dead horse but my point is the whole argument about him "stepping up" is weak because he wasn't given a fair shot. If we're nitpicking I could argue that he had a better first season than ADM is having at the moment. 

Agree that his inability to pick himself up speaks volumes about his mentality. Totally disagree that he's an average player. Anyone can see his talent and quality. 

You really should learn to watch how our play improves when we have players who know how to move and pick a pass. We looked far less mindless with him on the field under Moyes. The malaise was the team and lack of basic footballing principles that were not rectified by the coaching team, there was no one player we could pin the blame for Moyes' debacle on. Moreover, Herrera and Kagawa are similar in terms of their intelligent attributes but not the same type of player.

8829~~~
For me, talent and quality (however you define those concepts) mean nothing without the right mentality. "Average" is an exaggeration but he seems like a fairweather footballer. Looks good when everything is going his way but can't dig deep when he needs to. Nobody to blame for his failure at United but himself.

Contrast with Hererra, who had to knuckle down and work his bollocks off to win over a manager who obviously had grave doubts about him. That's the type of player we should be signing, not the likes of Kagawa.

8830~~~
I really don't need to learn anything if your evidence of us looking less mindless is limited half an hour against a terrible team. Nor did I pin anything on Kagawa. He was a bang average player. Can't blame him for not being able to change anything.

They are not similar in any shape or form. Herrera effects games. Not just in goals or assists but his incisive passing and tackling. So much so that he was dropped for looking for the ball and moving out of position. Kagawa moved around the pitch doing sweet feck all only for his fanbois to claim it was excellent movement and football intelligence.

8831~~~
I thought Kagawa was the type of player (which he was hyped as I might add!) that could bring us closer to Barcelona.. How wrong was I? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Herrera, however, is exactly that kind of player <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8832~~~
oddly enough I'm not disagreeing with you Pogue. I agree that talent and quality are nothing without the right mentality and that Herrera is exactly the type of player we need right now. I was defending Kagawa and will continue to do so against people like akash who seem to have a special hatred for him whilst not being able to recognise that there was a far more deeper problem with our football and our team the time he was there and the fact that people are slamming a guy who wasn't given a fair shot.

8833~~~
Calling someone average isn't hating.

I long for the day when people stop blaming everyone but Shinji Kagawa for his performances at the club and realize that maybe, just maybe he wasn't actually very good after all.

8834~~~
Unironically shits on Fabregas.

8835~~~
Don't jinx him.

8836~~~
Sorely missed further forward, as great as he has been.

8837~~~
He isnt a DM, his defensive awareness gets exposed

8838~~~
Unbelievable how many balls he wins and intercepts.

8839~~~
I thought he would be OK in a deeper role but he is definitely doing better than I expected.

8840~~~
Best player on the pitch by a distance. I genuinely think he's a better CM than Fábregas, and as an AM Fábregas is nullified relatively easily.

8841~~~
Carrick is disguise?

8842~~~
Yeah he's definitely been our best so far. One misplaced pass that Chelsea countered from, other than that he's been our Xabi Alonso so far

8843~~~
He's gonna be the best midfielder in the league.

8844~~~
Already is

8845~~~
Different role but still fecking brilliant.

8846~~~
Great performance but also partly responsible for losing the goal.

We have too many offensive minded midfielders on the pitch and the lapse in tracking back for the goal showed.

Other than that how can you complain. Its just too bad Carrick or even Blind isn't around to play at the base. I really think we are a different team when Mata and Herrera combine in the last third. So much more dangerous.

8847~~~
Fantastic player. Seems to thrive in multiple roles.

8848~~~
Wonderful little player.

8849~~~
What a versatile player can play anywhere in the midfield and play that position well.

8850~~~
He's been great. Such a complete midfielder.

8851~~~
Such a good player. We are definitely missing him further up the pitch though. He is wasted not being a box to box.

You can see Mata is not playing as well either, as Herrera brings out the best in him.

8852~~~
I love spanish Cleverley, we should sign spanish Milner too.

8853~~~
His composure and effortless ability on the ball has been a joy to watch in that half, the role is not a one that uses his most potent talents but he's leading well from the deep position and has done his best tracking the Chelsea attack such as it is.

8854~~~
Looked like a penalty in real time. Verdict?

8855~~~
Nah it was obviously not a penalty even in real time for me. It was just a bit naughty from Herrera

8856~~~
Never a penalty.

8857~~~
Certainly a dive, excellent technique.

8858~~~
Definite dive, but I thought he did the right thing, unlucky and would have fooled some refs

8859~~~
Look, we don't like diving, but other clubs don't give a toss. So I am past caring if we push the bounderies when others have no qualms.

8860~~~
He played well. I was impressed. I'd much rather have him in an attacking position and the goal showed that he's no defensive midfielder but we all knew we needed another DM before the game.

I have to say, Mourinhos reaction if that penalty was given would have been so hypocritical, I might have enjoyed that more than if we'd have won the game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8861~~~
He is good, but the praise is a bit too much. Had 2 careless passes today, has to be said. Is a bit slow and forgets to pick up runners, at least in this deep role.

8862~~~
Very good, sometimes makes silly passes but tries very hard, best midfielder on the pitch IMO.

8863~~~
Lol at 'he put his legs into Cahill'. Could say that about half the penalties given. Drogba has made a career out of it and Mourinho actively encourages his players to do the same thing. Im not sorry about it.

8864~~~
Exactly. When Ashley Young got cleaned out at Sunderland (a game we drew), nobody in the 'we don't want <i>it</i> in our game' lobby was shedding tears for us. Ander goes into the tackle with Cahill, leaves his leg there, and gives the ref a decision to make. Any player in his position would do the same thing. 

Played ok today but we missed him in the areas where he's a specialist. Mata is half the player without Herrera to bounce off, and Valencia just looks clueless without someone coming short to relieve him off the ball.

8865~~~
Some sloppy passing but he was good overall.

8866~~~
Was a great dive tbf. Januzaj and Di Maria could learn a thing or two from that.

Had a good game as well.

8867~~~
Im one of his biggest fans, but thhis is true. Not great today, two really bad decisions cost us dearly. Or came close to, anyway.

8868~~~
Yeah that pass put us in a world of trouble. Still thought he was our best player in the first half.

8869~~~
It shouldn't be a penalty, but it wasn't a dive either, it's something Hazard gets fouls/penalties quite regulary.

Btw, he was excellent even in holding midfielder position, he is excellent player.

8870~~~
He's not a Carrick. But it's not his fault he was put in that role. A real Carrick alternative is needed.

8871~~~
Can't really blame him for that killer pass that opened us for a counter, he's not really a #6 and still done a good job today imo. That dive was unnecessary but I don't blame him either to be fair.

8872~~~
Excellent dive, feck off Mike Dean for making such a good decision.

8873~~~
Needs to improve his passing range. Doubt he'll need it often when he's playing in his usual role but still a good thing to have in his locker.

8874~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hypocrites the lot of ya. If that was drogba against us, I would have loved to see your opinion.

8875~~~
5 interceptions (most on the pitch)
3 tackles
110 touches (most on the pitch)
95% pass accuracy (most on the pitch)
93 passes (most on the pitch, and more than Fábregas, Matic and Zouma combined)

And some people come in here to throw weak criticisms at him. Bizarre.

8876~~~
Best player on the pitch, was doing so much work, his stamina is fantastic.

8877~~~
He did a job as DM, a better job than I expected, but as usual the caf is overrating its favoured spaniards. Herrera gave the ball away in dangerous areas several times, and could have cost us goals. 

His dive at the end was much too obvious and you can bet your arse that if that were Young or Januzaj, there would be an absolute witch hunt on here.

Overall it was a decent performance but no more. I wouldnt expect more than that when playing in an unfamiliar role from him, but that doesnt automatically mean that he can do no wrong.

8878~~~
He's not slow. Not being as fast as Hazard isn't being slow. But yes, defensively, Carrick he ain't, as if anyone ever thought otherwise. But in that respect he was better than I expected, and in possession he was fantastic in my opinion, save for that one horrific brainfart.

8879~~~
He played well in a role that is not a natural one for him, his composure and passing was mostly very good and he stuck to his task diligently, can't see any reason to fault him today under the circumstances.

8880~~~
He is good.. our best midfielder......No cannot make 100% passes each game.. Carrick made an error against Liverpool that cost us a goal..

8881~~~
Good game, Great dive.

8882~~~
**. I hate this style of football but when you are playing against the Kings at this awful style you may as well reciprocate.

8883~~~
Motm for me.

8884~~~
He Shat all over fabregas.

8885~~~
Did well in the DM role. I think we missed his link up play with mata and his general ability to find a bit of space further forward. Still had a good game.

8886~~~
Second best player today, should have had a penalty at the end.

8887~~~
Of course we are, but do you think Jose would have said anything if Drogba had got a penalty that way.

8888~~~
it doesnt matter. If we concede 2 goals, he will get slaughtered. I was just saying it, i know people will praise him for his performance. His mishit passes irritate me, because they often result in a good counterattack, like today.

8889~~~
I know he's gonna get a stick for his occasional one bad pass but apart that he was brilliant, I think he had like 8 interceptions or so, orchestrating the game too, desperate to win the penalty, getting into box like pitbull, I can really forgive him as it was a dive but his determination to do something with the game outweighted the dive.. the only problem with Herrera playing deep s that he can't play further up the pitch as no8. Cloning machine would come in handy..

Can somebody get his today's numbers ? I really am curious..

8890~~~
A bit less influencial in the 2nd half and the pass that lead to Chelsea's counter where Hazard hit the post, was a bit crazy for someone playing DM. Its those few badly executed passes that mean he doesn't really suit the role. But he still did as well as we could have asked him to with 2 better DMs unavailable.

8891~~~
Never a penalty. If Young did it he would be crucified.

8892~~~
Absolute bollocks. It happened once and and you've decided to for some reason invent the others in your head. Yes, he gave the ball away a couple of times and yes he failed to track his runners a couple of times. That just means he had an imperfect performance, not that it was in any way inadequate.

8893~~~
It was a dive, but then their goal was started off with a foul, so no qualms about him doing that. Fairly excellent otherwise aside from a couple of misplaced passes that dont matter so much when in his usual position.

8894~~~
He isnt that slow, no, but he isnt fast either. That said, he forgot 2 times to pick up Fabregas, which didnt result in anything at the end. I was just saying that today in this role, which isnt his real position. Slight critisicm, nothing more. I also thought he had a good game overall.

8895~~~
I love the guy but that at the end was never a penalty. He made the contact happen and not Cahill.

8896~~~
Good performance, but we sorely missed a natural DM. Don't think his positional awareness for that position is great, understandable though. Really, badly missed his link up play on the right, which was anonymous most of the game.

8897~~~
Not at all, but doesnt mean we have to snoop to his level. We are better than that <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8898~~~
Two weeks running he's watched a player run past him in midfield. It's an area he'll need to improve but he isn't a player who can play in Carrick's position so it's unfortunate he was forced into it by injury.

8899~~~
What I would say is that his choice of pass wasn't quite as good as Carrick's in that role, but that's hardly the biggest criticism in the world. Yeah there were one or two dodgy moments, and he let Hazard go for the goal, but considering he hasn't played there all season, it was a good performance.

8900~~~
It was a dreadful dive that deserved the yellow. Hate to see players diving.

8901~~~
Considering he's not actually a defensive midfielder he wa fantastic. The way he built moves from the back was very impressive. I always he was too attack minded to do that.

8902~~~
Anyone think he did great today in difficult circumstances? ie probably just training in this role 2 days ago?

8903~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

The fact he made the most interceptions, the most passes and was the most accurate passer doesn't matter because one pass annoyed you? I think that applies to everyone else criticising him to be honest. One moment which frustrated them mattered more than everything else he did. Standard reaction I guess. Completely ruins any potential for a reasonable discussion though.

8904~~~
Ditto. 

He was my MOTM for how well he did out of position but we could have done with two of him out their today.

8905~~~
I don't even feel remotely bothered about the dive. I'd forgive any gamesmanship against that lot. Fight fire with fire.

8906~~~
I would have voted him my MOTM if it weren't for the dive. That said, I'm not going to put too much blame on him. I thought it was a peno at first and I was so desperate for a point I'd have dived too in his position.

8907~~~
Who was the 1st? 

<span style="color: #ffffff">Please don't say Hazard...</span>

8908~~~
Didn't think he was that good. Okay but some slack play. I think he's helped massively having someone deeper who's always open. Blind or Carrick always give an option that isn't straight back to the defence

8909~~~
dimaria's crossfield attempt was much more worse, Rooney also set up a counter attack with really poor pass. It was really clear that some people would come here and criticize him for one and a half of mistake today. That happens and he needs to cut it off his game but as I said earlier he dominated the game, absolutely deleting Fabregas. Also If it ends up 0:0, he would never get so much stick, and would be praised instead...

Yeah and btw it wasn't his natural position, he started against the champions of the league and wasn't far from Scholes's finest performances to keep them at 30% possession at HOME! This is bloody ridiculous. His defensive contribution was immense again.. just a lucky game for Mourinho.

And I'm not criticizing your comment but overall negative comments on his address. I think he deserves fecking praise for playing in unfamiliar position such fantastic game..

8910~~~
Played exceptionally well for the most part.
A couple of sloppy passes and could have tracked Hazard for the goal.

Really let himself down with that dive though. He's better than that.

8911~~~
I don't really blame a player for doing what he did in this day and age (especially against a Mourinho side) but he got the outcome he deserved. Credit to Mike Dean for once.

8912~~~
Absolutely. Was very good. Some people need a day to get over the loss and get their objectivity back.

8913~~~
I love how he quickly and almost invariably wins the ball back after he loses possession. But the times he doesn't do it could cost us a game, so I'd rather wish he cuts this switching off nonsense. 

On the game itself - excellent first half and an OK second half. The most dynamic player we've had in a long long time tbh.

8914~~~
Some bollocks in this thread, really is. It's disgusting to see and I cannot defend it, let's not pretend we're holier than thou because we're not. Young, Januzaj, Di Maria and now Herrera, it's pathetic and we need to cut it out sharpish. With regards to his performance, gave it a good go but we severely missed Carrick.

8915~~~
It was a quality dive! I bought it hook, line and sinker!

8916~~~
Delighted he tried to dive to be perfectly honest. If it had come off he'd get 10/10 from me. Top man

8917~~~
I didn't mind the dive at all. Chelsea are a team full of thugs who do whatever is required to win, perfectly fine with our players doing the same to them.

8918~~~
I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.

8919~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Same here. Chelsea and their thugs can go feck themselves. Dean got it right, the cnut.

8920~~~
Then other teams will do it to us and we can sit on our moral highhorse.

8921~~~
Made Fabregas look like a League one midfielder.

8922~~~
Considering the circumstances of his performance, Ander just about edges out Shaw (another player who acquitted himself really well) for the MOTM vote. 

Before unfairly critiquing the man, let's bear in mind that Herrera has never played in the #6 role before today. At Zaragoza he was mostly an attacking midfielder, for the Spanish U team they had Martinez in the role, with Athletic Club again either Iturraspe or Martinez. It's very tough for a naturally inventive and attack minded player to curtail his instincts, stay put on an island and try to control the the opposition. It's a whole different approach to the game, almost like asking a comparable player in Modric or Gundogan to fill in for the absence of some like Alonso or Bender. Even world class holding midfielder like Carrick went through a gradual learning/ acclimatization process, rather than being thrown in the deep end against a sturdy midfield-attack combination of the odds-on champions.

Did very well overall, retained and recycled possession really efficiently, put in a couple of crucial tackles and evidenced a good feel for the game from deeper areas. Solid, composed performance, maybe the pseudo-central defensive midfield position will be something to consider once he's 30+, and on a progressive natural physical decline.

8923~~~
Funny. He was most responsible for the goal when he gave up on following Hazard, he misplaced 2 passes allowing easy counters...but he was easily the most dominant midfielder on the pitch ahead of Fabregas and Oscar and the tackling side of his game was impeccable.

8924~~~
Cesc manages to do that all by himself. Hasn't shown up against a big side even once this season.

8925~~~
As I said, I dont expect him to put in world class performances as a DM, because he isnt a DM. However the overrating of a "decent" performance on here is - as usual - laughable.

8926~~~
I'd probably give him a 6/10, he wasnt as good as hes been in the last few weeks for us but to say anything else is going too far. 

Just because we lost today doesnt mean everyone automatically gets 3s and 4s in the ratings

8927~~~
I really enjoy Herrera as a player, always moving and making himself available.  As well as getting about the pitch and tracking back.  His quick touches and ability to get out of tight spaces is fantastic to watch.

Hope he continues to thrive at the club, joy to watch for me.

8928~~~
He gave away the ball too much in dangerous areas today, but then again he was asked to perform a bit unfamiliar role for him so I won't be too harsh on him.

8929~~~
Thought he was brilliant today, best player on the pitch and best midfielder by a mile. Generally is the best midfielder in the league. Had 2 sloppy passes that gave Chelsea a chance, but that's because he was the holding midfielder and everyone was closed down forcing him to take a bit of a risk with everyone closed down. 

95% pass accuracy with 115 touches, away to Chelsea. Delighted we went for him over Fabregas is all I have to say.

8930~~~
Happened twice all game, and he won it back once anyways. That apart he was class I thought.

8931~~~
He is done decent job and was good in most part but you could see that DMC was not his forte today.

8932~~~
Plus, it's always a case of the second half of the season syndrome with Cesc. Was the same at Arsenal in his later years and Barcelona. Starts off brilliantly but then fades post-December. Can't quite put a finger on the reason though, perhaps he doesn't have the natural endurance to last the whole league calender.

8933~~~
Only issue i had with Herrera today was the dive for the penalty - you're better than that!

8934~~~
Thank god we have people like you on here to guide the ignorant masses on how to rate a player. Please teach us.
<ul>
<li>Most interceptions</li>
<li>Most touches</li>
<li>Most passes (and more than Chelsea's midfield trio combined)</li>
<li>Most accurate passing</li>
</ul>What is it that these numbers don't tell us that bring it down from what on the face of it looks like a very, very accomplished performance to just a "decent" performance? A lack of energy? Nope, couldn't be that. A lack of vision? Again, nope. Being constantly in the wrong position? Definitely not, he created space for himself and the defenders all day beautifully. I'm stumped.

8935~~~
I find this guy baffling tbh (Fab that is)

8936~~~
It's nothing to do with being able to sit on our high horse, it's about playing the game the way it's supposed to be played. I don't give a shit if other teams do it, I'll never condone that sort of behaviour because it's wrong, no matter how you try and justify it.

8937~~~
We won plenty of titles taking liberties in the past.

8938~~~
While he was excellent today we did miss having him further upfield IMO.

Rooney and Fellaini won't unlock a defense with a decisive pass most of the time. Whereas Herrera does that regularly.

8939~~~
People see things differently, yet you always seem to jump on anyone who has a different opinion to yours.

8940~~~
Unfortunately it was him who went to press Hazard for the goal when he shouldn't have done. But it's hard to blame him when his natural game is not that of a #6 and to always press the play. We knew he would make positional errors and we would have to hope it wouldn't cost us, unfortunately today it did. Cannot fault him though, I thought he did the best we could've expected of him.

8941~~~
That's why we need Carrick or Blind back. He is wasted playing deep.

8942~~~
Not as effective in this role as he has been recently. Still did ok, but he needs to be in and around the box because he is a danger there. Thought his passing was a bit too risky at times today for the role he was playing. It's fine if there is another covering midfielder, but as the deepest midfielder it can cause problems.

Also, definite dive. I've seen that work before, but you can't argue about it not being given and he can have no complaints about the yellow either.

8943~~~
I entirely agree - the performance overall was pretty good. I gave Herrera a 6 as well, the only player I gave less than 5 was Falcao.

But reading this thread people have him as MotM, which I find ludicrous and representative of the bias that the caf has towards and against certain players.

8944~~~
He did okay there. Some sloppy play however and didn't track Hazard for the goal. He did some good things, but certainly wouldn't want to see him in DM again.

8945~~~
I think that is more the point, we lost his effectiveness up front. I hope Blind or Carrick are back for Everton.

8946~~~
You can bring out the same cherrypicked statistics that you have already posted if you like - Herrera was arguably one of the main culprits for their goal which won the game. He was caught in possession a few times - this is normal for him, but more problematic for the team when it happens in a deeper position - and got booked for diving in the end, which lost us the ball in a dangerous area.

Other players would be crucified for the dive alone, but naturally Herrera gets talked about as a MotM contender because - as your statistics show - he can in fact do no wrong.

8947~~~
If he had a big afro Walrus would think he was the best player ever.

8948~~~
That's the essence of a discussion...two contrasting opinions and engaging in a conversation to elaborate on the basis of those opinions. I did so with statistics that paint him as the best possession player in the game and one of the most involved defensive players and all I got back with was "it doesn't matter, he annoyed me". What else can you say to that?

Perhaps I've misunderstood the purpose of a discussion forum.

Cherry picked? You're kidding, right? You'd struggle to find more relevant stats for a midfielder. Touches, passing, interceptions and tackling. You'd also struggle to find stats to support your opinion that he was as poor as you're suggesting aside from those, what, three moments? 10 seconds of play? that you're using to define his performance all to fit your agenda.

There are an awful lot of agendas here these days. It's a bit weird.

8949~~~
Oh snap, you've sure got my number.

8950~~~
Felt it was impressive how he played the #6 role, he really was one of the best players on the pitch today. He was so good the first 30 minutes, I actually was scared that he wouldn't have any legs left for the second half. I knew it was not the first time he played this role, but I was surpised with how well it worked out, his statistics today speak for themselves.

Sure he misplaced two passes, but there's much more to say for the referee being at fault for their goal than to point out Ander I think.

8951~~~
Don't tell Walrus that.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He wasn't perfect, but he was the best option we had available to play there. I much prefer him playing further forward where he is more effective. He can give the ball away which where he was playing is not ideal, but other players were giving the ball away as well.

8952~~~
<a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> honestly, I cant be bothered to go rewatch the entire game just to dig up the moments where Herrera was caught in possession, or misplaced a pass, or any other such event - for the sake of an internet argument. I gave him a 6, which I think is a fair reflection of the game he had, it was the same score I gave to plenty of other players. So I will agree to disagree and leave you and the others in this thread to the Herrera Ballon d'Or campaign.

8953~~~
He'll win it next season.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

8954~~~
He was great today in my opinion provided we accept that it is definitely not one of his positions. In his more usual areas of the pitch, he totally dominated Chelsea's midfielders, and looked particularly excellent by comparison to Fabregas. In Carrick's role, most of what he did was good but there were three clear errors in dangerous positions. That said, he twice recovered wonderfully to turn errors into opportunities.

For a player 'out of position', not at all bad. Certainly better than Rooney would have been as the deeper midfielder, I think. Van Gaal got them the right way round for me.

8955~~~
played a very good match

8956~~~
That is really how you have to look at it. If Rooney had been there, then people might have been in serious panic mode. Or god help us Fellaini. Just hope a couple of these injuries clear up. He made Fabregas look awful.

8957~~~
I thought he was the best player on the pitch by some distance. A few sloppy passes in the second half but he almost always recovered the ball and it doesn't take away from a brilliant performance. He was excellent in an unfamiliar role. Bossed the first half massively. 

I remember after we signed him he said he watched the Netherlands in the summer wondering where he would fit in, and I think he said he imagined himself as the De Jong, meaning the DM. Having watched almost all of his games in his last season at Athletic Club that isn't a role I would have earmarked for him but he certainly showed today that he can do a job there for sure - against the best team in the league too. 

Without a doubt my motm.

8958~~~
Thought he absolutely outplayed Cesc today. Brilliant player we have in the club.

8959~~~
The whole performance is a bit like that really. Fair play to Chelsea, they executed their game plan and it worked. But take away those four key injuries to us, returning Carrick to DM and either Rojo/Jones to CB, and on paper that would at least shift the result to a draw.

It's the sort of defeat that doesn't mean anything particularly bad.

8960~~~
Best CM in the league right now? He was incredible. Gave the ball away and only once did he not immediately win it back. He truly is a complete midfielder.

8961~~~
I was really relaxed about it all. I just wanted them to put in a fighting performance and to do us proud and they did. Won't stop me despising Chelsea though, for all I hate Liverpool and City at least they try to play football. Chelsea spend millions and millions and wouldn't know attractive football if it belted them round the chops.

8962~~~
He was constantly ignored by our CBs when they had the ball. He wasn't quite as good as Carrick as showing for it but who is. He was still available. 

I don't know if the CBs trust themselves to play the pass or if they don't think Herrera can take the ball in tight situations. But if Herrera is asking for it, give it to him.

8963~~~
I thought Shaw was MOTM but Herrera was second. Don't think thats ludicrous really. There weren't many better than him out there. Had to shave off a point for that awful pass in the second half though.

8964~~~
Ander was very good in an unnatural position. He dictated the game. He's the only one of our midfielders who can really deal with being pressed, he then comes out of it and makes the right pass. He was sloppy a couple of times but i would give him a 7.5/10, he was the bets midfielder on the pitch. If we had him further t would have been a different result.

8965~~~
Agreed, he was my MOTM behind Shaw

8966~~~
Had a couple of ugly passes who got us into trouble, but other than that i thought he was superb.

8967~~~
I love Ander, but I voted for Luke as MOTM.

8968~~~
I'm sorry but this is just not fair. Herrera was one of our, if not our best, players today and you are almost solely focusing on his negatives, making it out as though he just had a 'decent' game. Herrera misplaced very few balls (with a passing accuracy of 95%) and most certainly did not give the ball away in dangerous areas several times. I can recall a mishit long ball to Mata which was intercepted and another which I can't quite recall.

On the other hand, Fellaini was anonymous and was shut down today. You do make some good points there about how we could have better exploited the potential tactical advantage we could have had, with the attention Fellaini received from Chelsea, instead of the usual 'he was shite today' posts. However, you are just focusing on the positives for Fellaini here and ignoring the fact that he was anonymous for large periods of the game and doing just the opposite for Herrera.

8969~~~
I told you that he already played that role, but he is a lot better in the final third, he really is an attacking player who can defend.

8970~~~
Thought he did a really good job today, considering he's not a natural holding midfielder and that Chelsea had a sea of players running towards him when they countered us.

8971~~~
Well said, at least he tries to do things and doesn't just wave his arms about if he loses a ball, he goes and gets it back. He did a good job today. He doesn't let people bully him, we have had too many of them recently.

8972~~~
He can do a job sitting deep, but it isn't his strength. Just unfortunate Carrick injured and Blind nobbled.

8973~~~
Did well today. Was comfortably our best midfielder.

8974~~~
Agreed, although I liked having a more mobile person in that position he put us under pressure a few times with misplaced passes as he does take more risks then Carrick/blind.

8975~~~
I don't think his passing accuracy really matters when the whole team acquired statistics close to his; it was a good performance and definitely not his best. That pass where he nearly assisted their second was horrible and his defending for their first wasn't great. However, for a guy who's playing there for the first time, in the EPL, it was a performance for which he should be proud of. His dive was magnificent, and deserved a penalty.

8976~~~
I would rather not get into discussing Fellaini in this thread, as it is not the Fellaini thread - but the difference for me is that Chelsea specifically set out to counter Fellaini. That is a circumstance in which I can excuse a player if they dont turn in a fantastic performance - because it should create space and opportunities for the rest of the team to capitalise on.

As for Herrera, I am just trying to put a bit of perspective into things. I dont think he was one of our best players today, nor was he one of our worst.
Our top two today for me were Shaw and McNair - after that there were no standout candidates, I felt that Young, Smalling, Rooney and Herrera all put in decent performances and there was nothing between them (as far as ratings etc go).

You can argue that Herrera was playing an unnatural position for him and I agree - I have said several times that he did better than I would have expected in a DM role. But again, he was one of those primarily at fault for Chelsea's goal and he got booked for diving which lost us the ball in a promising position. Herrera had the type of game that he normally has - unfortunately that means that when he gets caught in possession or similar, that it is in a more dangerous area than in his normal role.

I would like to point out that when we - as a team - end the game with 70% possession, and Chelsea put little-to-no pressure on the ball at any point, it really isnt <i>that</i> difficult or impressive to achieve a high pass completion stat. Again, not saying it was bad, just that a little context is needed.

So, well done Herrera - going into the game I was concerned that without Carrick or Blind, we would get overrun in midfield and get hammered. As it turns out, we didnt - part of that is due to Mourinho setting up to nullify Fellaini, which substantially weakened Chelsea's ball retention, but part of it is also because Herrera did a decent job of covering as a DM. He did better than I expected in that role (to be fair, I didnt expect him to be playing that role but rather Rooney), but MotM isnt based on which player exceeded expectations the most, but rather just the best performance.

8977~~~
Even, I, this woman obsessed with Herrera didn't give him MOTM. I gave it to Shaw, which maked it annoying that he was taken off the Blackett, who isn't a patch on him.

8978~~~
Decent game considering the job he had to do. Its a shame because I dont think Chelsea score that goal if Carrick is playing as he will fill in the hole where Hazard runs. I dont entirely blame Herrera for that because we had Valencia jogging back and then stopped trying to get back and we were caught by a lovely pass from Oscar (after a foul which wasnt given for some reason).

8979~~~
Yet all some people see are ''the two careless passes'', forgetting that we had chances that we should have taken to make the error meaningless in the bigger context. Those are MOTM stats and made even more special by the fact that he was out of position.

8980~~~
If Herrera was playing where he should be we might have actually scored as Rooney would have been up front.

8981~~~
I agree. Carrick and Blind both not playing (and even Jones) meant we had to bring both Herrera and Rooney back from where theyve been playing. This also made the triangles of Mata/Herrera/Valencia ineffective which meant we relied on the left which Mourinho had a plan for. 

Herrera had a few stray passes but he was trying to force it when we were 1-0 and was in a deeper position (as opposed to being in the oppositions half which is a shame).

8982~~~
Agreed. Our biggest problem today (as I predicted unfortunately) was in having Falcao up front and not Rooney.

My proposed lineups before the game had Herrera in his normal position, and one of Valencia, Rafael or Fellaini at DM (relocating Fellaini once it became clear that Zouma was going to shadow him all day would have been a smart move by LVG I feel).

8983~~~
2 suicidal passes, otherwise very good.

8984~~~
Considering everything the referee let go in Chelsea's favour in a typical Stamford Bridge performance, I didn't mind Herrera trying either.

8985~~~
He  did ok in the #6 role misplaced a couple of passes and he does not have same positional awareness as Carrick but other than that he was fine.

8986~~~
The reason was Mike fecking Deane. 

Imo Valencia was.out of posion for the goal.

8987~~~
Said in another thread. It would.have been given if it was against United at OT with either Dean or Atkinson in charge.

8988~~~
Jose just negated Fellaini which stopped a lot of the effectiveness. If the others were playing in their correct positions it might not have mattered, unfortunately they weren't.

8989~~~
Chelsea aren't capable of scoring a goal that doesn't have a foul somewhere in the build up for a start.

8990~~~
He was but I think if he had bust a gut, he could have put some pressure on hazard as he was striking it. But ah well, it happens, players will get caught out of position in transition and we need other players to be smart enough to cover for them.
Fully agree with that. Ifs and Buts. I honestly dont think we lose if we play the same team as last week and would have had a better chance of winning. Will never know. Its just upto us now to finish the season strong, capture automatic CL for next season and then kick on <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8991~~~
I am feeling optimistic for the future now. A few signings and cannot wait for next season.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8992~~~
Fair enough <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> . Guess we will have to agree to disagree on the level of Herrera's performance today.

8993~~~
He did well and the fact Louis van Gaal trusted him with the role might suggest he will give him a chance as the box to box player next season instead of signing a specialist for the role.

I did feel we lacked him in the 8 position, our left unit of Blind-Young-Fellaini was broken due to Blind's injury but Herrera's deeper role caused in my opinion Mata and Valencia to suffer also and in general slowed down our game.

I think had we another centre back available then it is possible McNair would have been used as a CDM making it a straight swap instead of playing both Rooney and Herrera out of position.

Louis van Gaal probably considered the option of Blackett or McNair in that position and the other as the centre back but it's always a difficult decision to take.

8994~~~
McNair started off as a midfielder early in his career I think, so he might have done a job there. We have just had too many injuries in the wrong places at the wrong time.

8995~~~
TBH, that's only hypothetical. I haven't seen referees having the guts to feck Chelsea over at Stamford Bridge really often (the Mark Clattenburg case in 2012 was a very rare case), but referees did screw us over at OT a number of times in the last few years.

8996~~~
It probably would've been given if it was like in the 70th minute. Everyone just expected to see a last ditch attempt for a penalty to save the game in that situation, a 50/50 ball with him just getting there before Cahill. You see pens given for that all the time and I think Dean was expecting to see a dive and made his mind up before anything happened (of course, still was a bit of a dive and right decision, but it could have been different if circumstances were different and Dean didn't make his mind up before it happened).

8997~~~
6 for this kind of performance after you spent the entire season praising Fellaini for performances which were good but definitely not better than this on average? Yeah, you are not biased at all.

8998~~~
Which performance is better than another is a matter of opinion. Im not going to get drawn into a Fellaini vs Herrera battle, especially not in this thread.

8999~~~
Did you lose a bet or something? I think that's the third post I've seen tonight in which you point out your gender <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

As for Ander, bar one misplaced pass he was absolutely majestic for the first 30 minutes! Can't comment on the rest of the match unfortunately <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9000~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> She described herself as a woman. Should she have written 'man' just so you wouldn't think she was being too pointed about it?

9001~~~
I don't have objections to it, I just found it curious for the reason I specified! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9002~~~
Fair enough. It's not really curious. Some places in the internet may mainly be blokes but that doesn't mean that anyone referring to themselves as anything else is doing it to make a point.

9003~~~
I wouldn't even have thought twice about it if I hadn't already seen it earlier tonight, which made it seem curious to me. It obviously wasn't the fact that she was a woman, because as far as I can tell they're hardly unicorns around here. Not that it matters one way or another!

9004~~~
Look, he wasn't all that great. Did some sloppy stuff and as the deepest midfielder those aren't welcome. Funny enough he also did some good stuff(the control when Drogba was hounding him down was fabulous). However his passing from deep was pretty much mediocre. In such a match we needed more, and pity he doesn't have the range of a carrick for example so wasn't able to build up our play as well. All those half a gazzilion passes are worthless if they are moving our team nowhere. 

Something that's magnificent about him is how quickly he reads the play. He really is a quality front foot player who knows how to constantly dispossess the opposition midfielders, viera-like in that sense. Sadly for us though, on the back foot he lost his man and didn't even communicate to anyone to track him. Should've done better in that instant. 

He's our future captain imo. Did you Guys see just how much directing he was doing out there? Constantly communicating with others, and generally handing out instructions, it was really great to see.

9005~~~
Decent performance given the unusual circumstances. He did give the ball away a couple of times but all in all, can't really complain. Classy player with a bright future.

9006~~~
I think he outplayed Fabregas today which is saying something. If the Spain coaches watch this match they will be tempted to pick Herrera over Fabregas, or at least take him to the next camp.

He is a future captain. He is becoming more and more vocal on the pitch and instructing players where the ball should go. I'm very excited he is with us for many years to come.

9007~~~
Even though he did dive, I loved the way he squared up to the Chelsea boys. Reminded me of Raphael. He's got a great footballing brain, but also plays with his heart, which is beautiful to watch. Really looking forward to seeing a midfield of him, Carrick, Fellaini/new CM and Mata next year. The football will be pure sex <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9008~~~
Poor dive. Thought he had a decent game though, was way too far away from Mata though.

9009~~~
Once we buy that missing piece to complete our midfield puzzle, Ander will be the best midfielder in the league. Awesome awesome player.

9010~~~
I actually struggle to fit him in.

Don't get me wrong, I 100% want him to play but he causes a real selection dilemma.


If you assume the missing peice of the midfield puzzle is going to be the one who provides balance, then it's Fellaini who drops out. Now unless it's another "defensive 10" you're pushing Herrera forward into that 10 role. Is he the best 10 at the club? At some point we are going to have to start fitting Di Maria, Mata, Rooney, probably another wide forward and probably another striker into the team*

*Maybe not at the same time in every game but it makes it difficult all the same. 

He'd solve everything if he put on a stone of muscle!

9011~~~
Good post there. By the missing piece in the puzzle, I mean a new version of Keano. Someone to anchor the midfield, provide a good cover for the defense, have a good passing and be mobile (can we get a younger version of Koke somewhere?). I'd play Di Maria in central midfield.
So, it would be something like:
DDG
Back4
Carrick/New Cm
Ander----Angel
Front3.

9012~~~
He has Raphaels heart but Raphaels brain?

9013~~~
Because it doesn't look as dodgy that I am obsessed with Herrera as he is a bit cute.

9014~~~
Same here.

As much as I love him, once we get a proper 8, its only the no 10 slot that's open. It'l be a toss up between Mata and Herrera I feel and I see Mata as the better fit there.

9015~~~
Carrick, Herrera and genuine box to box midfielder ala essien. Understanding of the game, creative spark and legs. Herrera, for me, is an ideal creative central midfielder. I don't see why we should struggle to fit him in. Fabregas fits in fine at Chelsea. You need a creative midfielder like him. We can't line up with Carrick, fellaini and another new midfielder who is box to box and legs. We need that one clever midfielder who technically a cut above. Herrera is that player IMO.

9016~~~
I doubt it tbh, I think the player we sign will be one who can play both 6 and 8 who can also be very physical in the game (which is why Strootman would have been perfect probably) and also I reckon LVG will be making Ander also learn how to play at 6, (he trusted him to play there today)

The new midfielder will play with Ander I reckon long term with one of Di Maria / Mata / Rooney playing as the 10

Fellaini will likely be the one to miss out, and as much I think he has improved this season, I think that is rightly so.

Also Ander can also fit in at 10 with Carrick/Blind playing as 6 I think that would complete our midfield options very nicely

9017~~~
He's the player LVG needs to build round. At the moment LVG is coaxing amazing performances out of Fellaini, Mata and Young but this is the one player who isn't even playing to his full potential yet is oozing class for me.

We need a strong DM i.e. Verratti and a David Silva/Pogba type attacking mid/CM hybrid alongside him to get the best out of him for the years ahead. He is going to be the best midfielder in the premiership if he is given the right support and coaching.

9018~~~
Are we even playing a number 10 right now?

To me it looks like this:

Carrick
Herrera------
------------fellaini
Mata----------------Young
Rooney

Apologies for the awful formatting.

We don't need a number 10 per say. We need three good midfielders in those three slots.

9019~~~
Fellaini will definitely be gone from the 1st team if Van Gaal gets the players he wants, agree with you there. 

So you see the new signing play the holding role? Where does that leave Blind and Carrick? It'l be tough to get an upgrade for that position tbh. I dont see Herrera playing as the deepest mid either, it nullifies his best qualities.

9020~~~
Not really no, but I see the new midfielder being one who can play that role as well as being a solid 8, he'll also need to have a very good passing range. Ander will likely play a more attacking role when the new guys comes in ( I think it will suit him) but Ander and the new guy will likely run the midfield in the future.

As for Carrick he will be 34 and we'll be in the UCL he'll be used a bit more sparingly I reckon, also Blind is a good player but I think he won't be a guaranteed starter.

9021~~~
Carrick is 33? He's had injury problems this season. And like I said before, we most likely will have European football next year, so we'd need to be careful with him. So for me, we should sign Schneiderlin.

I think Fellaini has proved he can be a starter in the last month. Teams are concerned about him. Even Fergie did what Mourinho did to him yesterday. He put Jones on him to man mark just like Zouma. That's the ultimate compliment and it creates more space for his teammates. The problem with Fellaini is that I don't think his physical approach is suited to Europe. 

As for Herrera, he should be a key starter for us next year.

9022~~~
I hope you're right. Have really high hopes from this guy.

9023~~~
I hope so too, I hope LVG see it, and it seems like he does.
I think Ander has the potential to be the one of the best CMs next season

9024~~~
That's how I see it as well. Carrick holding with Herrera and another midfielder playmaking from midfield, who should ideally be a complete box to box sort. 

That's how I'd like to see it work out at least.

9025~~~
If United make the Champions league there will be plenty of games and they don't have to play the same system every game. If he continues to play as well as he is currently he will play all of the big games. It's no coincidence that United failed to score when he played in a deeper role vs Chelsea. He is the key creative player in the team just now.

9026~~~
Oh yes, there will be plenty of rotation, I was referring more to our 1st choice line up for the big games.

9027~~~
Fair dues! But what should we make of the rest of the Ander and Juan love in here though, in which most of the participants are quite clearly both smitten and non-female? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Dodgy crowd! 

To be clear, I would probably have to include myself in that gang as well <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

9028~~~
Fantastic player, the one we needed in midfield last season also. At the start of the season, I thought he showed that he can become future United captain and I stand by that. If we get top 4, he'll be a big player in the CL games and the more games he plays for us, the better he'll become.

9029~~~
Nothing wrong with a bit of man love. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9030~~~
Been saying this for a while. Agree completely. Nice problem to have!

9031~~~
Thought he was excellent for the first 35 minutes and decent thereafter. Him dropping deep in between the centre backs caused a problem for Drogba as the lone striker at his age trying to chase the ball and it meant we saw plenty of Smalling and McNair getting forward.

9032~~~
You are complicating  everything for nothing, and he doesn't need to put a grams of muscle.

We have 4 midfielders  for 3 roles, 2 DMs in Blind and Carrick, 1 Defensive b2b in Herrera and 1 attacking b2b in Fellaini. In our system Di Maria is out of the midfield equation, he is an attacker, so if he wants to play he will have to take Young or Mata places. Rooney and Mata are also out of the equation since we play with two #8, 1 DM and no #10, we could tweak the formation, but why do that ?

If or when we sign a new midfielder, he will be in competition with Fellaini and Herrera, there is no need to sign a player who will be a direct replacement for Carrick since we lack cover for Herrera and Fellaini while we have the very potent Blind, when Carrick retires we will need someone to replace him numerically, though.

9033~~~
It's obvious the higher up the pitch the better Herrera looks and the more he contributes. He is quite able defensively which is a useful asset but he's more effective as a #8 or a #10 rather than a #6

9034~~~
after reviewing how did we concede the goal maybe this is the best reason why a player shall not play by instinct,  like running for the ball.

this was when the possession lost because of a foul on falcao. the transition from attack to defense began.  we had enough numbers in defense and mcNair, smalling & herrera formed a nice triangle in the center:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi57.tinypic.com/6h2m8o.jpg" src="http://oi57.tinypic.com/6h2m8o.jpg"/>

valencia prepared to intercept, mata tracking down, rooney shut down the space of fabregas, smalling watched out the dribbler & had an eye on oscar.  herrera tended to run into the space too despite he didn't need to.  he was better to watch out where would be the real danger:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi60.tinypic.com/5mwoyx.jpg" src="http://oi60.tinypic.com/5mwoyx.jpg"/>

herrera turned his direction up.  it looked like he predicted a square pass from fabregas and tried to intercept:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2jws3k.jpg" src="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2jws3k.jpg"/>

instead fabregas passed the ball foward to oscar.  herrera turned back again, and aimed at oscar also.  hazard started to run in:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi61.tinypic.com/k2jua0.jpg" src="http://oi61.tinypic.com/k2jua0.jpg"/>

hazard run into the blind side of herrera when he was focus on oscar:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi57.tinypic.com/2vvm6uh.jpg" src="http://oi57.tinypic.com/2vvm6uh.jpg"/>

oscar passed on to hazard who cut in the space:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2ps2knm.jpg" src="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2ps2knm.jpg"/>

herrera followed the ball and changed his focus to hazard:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi61.tinypic.com/166m2c3.jpg" src="http://oi61.tinypic.com/166m2c3.jpg"/>

hazard run into the space between smalling & valencia.  it looked like smalling once tried to point herrera to take oscar (but his can't be confirmed unless a close up in slow motion displayed).  from this snapshot if smalling could cut in with full throttle right now he might be able to intercept hazard somewhere inside the box.  can't tell if the without marked oscar distracted him: 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi62.tinypic.com/4g1xrb.jpg" src="http://oi62.tinypic.com/4g1xrb.jpg"/>

herrera chased hazard from behind.  the distance between smalling and hazard didn't close down:

herrera kept chasing hazard from behind.  the distance between smalling & hazard didn't close down:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2ent10p.jpg" src="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2ent10p.jpg"/>

hazard cut in the space between smalling & valencia and started to out run them:

smalling now determined to cut in hazard but it's too late:

herrera gave up chasing and moved himself into the center to cover.  it's already too late for smalling to intercept:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2nk1lqb.jpg" src="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2nk1lqb.jpg"/>

everything was too late.  we let hazard to run through the space:

i don't blame herrera for the loss.  it's more a collective defeat rather than just a single error committed by anyone.  even though if we could take three points from this game to be honest the title chase was still very remote.  so this is not a disaster to lose out this game.  but if herrera can learn from this lesson of why running for the ball can be a very wrong way to play football, this can make him a better player by the next season

9035~~~
He will learn...

my hope is we tie this lad down to a good long contract.

He is simply class....the first player who compares to Scholes.. get a player who compares in teh same way to Keane...we will win the lot.

9036~~~
Could've just posted the video on sky where they mention that Herrera tried to cut out where he thought the pass would go and so opened the space up... Having so many big pics is annoying when using a phone or tablet really.

But yeah, he tried to predict the pass, a lot of players do it every now and then, not entirely his fault that goal but every goal is a collective failing in the defensive unit pretty much. The main mistake was the ref not calling the initial foul which left us a bit out of position.

9037~~~
Even if he read the play he's not going to beat Hazard in a foot race, the only way he could stop him is fouling.

Without sounding like I'm 7 years old he's become my favourite player now. He seems to love the club and we should be looking to build our side around him. There arent many midfielders who is as complete as him.

9038~~~
i don't know what the sky said.  i just went to internet to get a video clip and took these snapshots.

indeed herrera made a series of mistakes in this run.  his prediction to intercept high up is not really the matter.  the most decisive one was his turn from chasing oscar to hazard.  he should let smalling to encounter hazard and dropped himself into the space then left behind to prevent oscar or any other blue shirts to cut into the center of the box.  by doing so there would be no way for hazard to run through without a single tackle before he could take a shot.

9039~~~
Just seen penalty or no penalty incident, loved his argument with Cahill and how he slapped that cu.ts finger which he was pointing at him. 

Was it a pen. That video was not very good to judge.

9040~~~
I don't think it was clearcut either way, and I think the ref was in his right to interpret the situation as a pen or not. I definitely don't think it was a dive from Ander though.

9041~~~
Its something you see players do almost every game - leaving (or sticking out) a trailing foot in order to make contact with the defender. He was looking for it was the one who deliberately made contact with the defender.

Its not a "dive" in the truest definition of the term (ie no contact), but if the attacking playing is deliberately making contact with the defender to give him an excuse to go to ground, that is basically the equivalent of a dive.

9042~~~
It wasn't a penalty imo. He went looking for it by leaving a trailing leg behind.

Reminded me of the Costa penalty against Holland which shouldn't have been one.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JjYq0OQTPP4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

9043~~~
It clearly wasn't a pen. It was a desperate attempt to get something with the game winding up. I see why he did it, but c'mon, it was silly. If Young had done this last season he would have copped it.

9044~~~
I thought Herrera's performance was excellent. We must keep in mind that this is the first time he's playing as a 6 for us. So considering the circumstances he did really well. He did make a couple of mistakes, but he will learn from them. You can't have a perfect game all the time. 

Now what we learned from this is that he can be played as an emergency 6 (and at a very high level) against most teams. This does bode well for the future, because I believe he is a far better option to play as 6 than say a Rooney. Of course this game also highlighted the need for an alternative for Carrick but that is a discussion for another thread.

9045~~~
It was a shame Blind was unavailable. It would've been interesting to see how a Blind/Herrera axis would've worked out with the team humming as they were. Even without a Blind or Carrick, we absolutely dominated possession and showed we could make do with what we did have last game. Although Rooney did a good job filling in, it would've been more interesting to have ADM do what Rooney did last game while having Rooney up top instead of Falcao. I think it came down to Rooney having a better range of passing & currently being more accurate (ADM has been atrocious with some of his passing lately). 

Except for a few loose passes, Herrera acquitted himself well, despite being a bit outnumbered in the center. When it comes to him & Mata, I'd rather have him in the #10 role (if we actually played that role). He gives us more workrate & physical presence in that role and just about edges Mata in passing repertoire (not by much).

9046~~~
i'm afraid there are too many people are wrong about "diving".

to decide whether if there is a penalty or not the main concern is whether if a defender do make a foul on an attacker inside the box.  to decide there is a foul or not the main concern is whether if what the defender do is legal.  what the attacker do is basically irrelevant to decide if the defender has made a foul on him or not

so the whole issue is, did the tackle cahill made on herrera legal? and the answer is certainly not.

cahill cut in the path of herrera when herrera already had the ball. cahill deliberately had his right foot intruded into the space where herrera had already occupied.  herrera didn't run on cahill, herrera run into space, and then both the right legs of the both players collided and herrera fell down.  so this is a foul since cahill illegally intruded into the space herrera had already occupied and made a contact, hence this is a penalty.

the action of herrera really doesn't matter on what cahill had done.  you may wonder why some players falling down so easily since they could have carried on playing.  but answering the question whether if this is a penalty you only need to decide if cahill did make a foul on herrera and this is definitely a yes.

just put the location of contact outside the box.  how often do you think a ref would award a free kick?  8/9 out of 10

9047~~~
He dived.

9048~~~
I find constant diving pathetic and annoying but trying to gain an advantage in a key moment of a huge game e.g. Gerrard in Istanbul is entirely understandable and not a big deal IMO. Widespread diving's a fairly recent development but gamesmanship's been part of the game since the beginning of last century. Varela and Uruguay's gamesmanship in the Maracanazo is still hailed in Uruguay as perhaps the defining moment in their footballing history and they're lauded for their cunning and desire to win using everything in their power. 

Herrera's dive was a little annoying in the sense he took an unnecessary risk and threw away our last chance in the game, but it almost came off in fairness and I'd have had no problems whatsoever in celebrating an equaliser from it. It was clearly a dive though.

9049~~~
Yep. Herrera deliberately engineered the contact with Cahill by trailing his right leg. 

Why people are still debating this is a mystery to me.

9050~~~
This is a ridiculous statement and to me, just proof of the amount of bias that you and other posters show towards Herrera. I can pretty much guarantee you wouldnt be say that if Young, Fellaini or Januzaj had done it.

Anyway I actually came to this thread to mention this little article from MEN, with Herrera's reaction to the Paul Scholes comparison;


Great attitude from the lad, fingers crossed he can fulfil his potential and become a really important player for us over the next 5+ years.

9051~~~
opinion without "farcks" are just empty words.  let's check out the "farcks":

herrera running along a path bearing 310'.  herrera already had the ball at this moment thus he was having privilege to the clear space in front of him.  cahill cut in from right his right hand side, bearing 225', a yard away perpendicular to the path of herrera.  watch out where was the right foot of herrera:


cahill cut in to the herrara's path.  cahill had with his right leg intruded into the space belonged to the herrera's.  watched again the right foot of herrera.  it's still touching the ground.  this means at this moment herrera DIDN'T put his foot on to the cahill's.  he's just keeping his course of direction of running:


now the collision happened. cahill had his right knee collided with the herrera's right knee:



the definition i give out for diving is:

pretended something had happened but indeed it didn't and still acted on it

just feel free to give yours.


how anyone can tell herrera put his foot onto cahill?  the right foot of cahill intruded into the space belonged to the herrera's.  this is 100% a foul from cahill.  you might say herrera can continue the play but he choose to fall down.  but this is not a dive.

9052~~~
I said previously, but yes that is probably the definition of a dive by the letter of the law, however in practice it can be expanded.

If an attacker deliberately makes contact with a defender, for the pure aim of drawing a foul/penalty, then is that fair play?
If an attacker goes down very easily from minimal contact when they could easily have stayed on their feet, is that fair play?

It doesnt matter whether you call it a dive or something else, for me the answer to both questions is "no" and both should be punishable by a yellow card.

In the Herrera incident, freeze frames do not show what happened. In realtime, and when watching the replays, it was obvious that Herrera left his trailing foot dangling and stuck it out a bit in order to make contact with Cahill - and as soon as he felt the contact he threw himself to the ground in quite an unnatural fashion. <b>It wasnt a foul, it wasnt a penalty, Herrera deserved to be booked - just accept it and move on.</b>

9053~~~
I think it was a foul but Herrera made the mistake by trailing his leg. We'll never know what the ref might have called if he hadn't done so. Anyway, spilt milk this.

9054~~~
If you have seen the match and the replay, it was clear as ice that Herrera engineered the contact deliberately when he could have easily avoided it and got booked for it. It is understandable though since Chelsea were playing very compact and narrow and we rarely had any chances in spite of 70% possession. I hope he doesn't make a habit out of it. It is extremely difficult to respect such professionals to cheat on the field.

9055~~~
To be honest I'm surprised this is a debate, its clearly a dive.

9056~~~
when cahill intruded into the herrera's path, the herrera's feet was STILL ON THE GROUND.  this clearly means herrera DIDN'T put his leg onto cahill.  again, the decision over the incident entirely depends on whether if there was a foul commited by cahill and this is 100% clear he did.  all these snapshots just happened within a single second a video play could even mislead you to a wrong perception.  this can only be clear by display in slow motion. 

you can't judge an action just because of a MINIMAL contact occurs.  what is a MINIMAL contact?  who's to judge?

in this particular case, cahill can never touch herrera at all unless he can make a clean tackle just aimed at the ball.  this is a common of worldwide football.  to protect ball possession is the only way to encourage for playing good football.

9057~~~
<a class="username" data-user="79494, @Subho611" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79494/">@Subho611</a> ,

why herrera needed to take initiative to "avoid" the contact?  this is his path and his right to run in.  this is the intruder's interest needed to be very careful to avoid a contact being made in order to avoid a foul on the person who have the ball in possesion

9058~~~
Personally, I couldn't give 2 shits about diving but you're spot on. The stick someone gets for diving is directly proportional to how well they are liked. Young got loads of abuse for diving. Probably from the same people who fawned over Ronaldo.

9059~~~
LOL. He initiated the contact by extending his leg, end of story. What's funny is I know if an opponent had done the same thing and gotten the PK you would be incensed. It's hard, but try to objective.

9060~~~
This is pretty much my view, Herrera moved his leg into Cahill and went down, had he not done that he would have actually been fouled anyway. So its a dive, but would have been very interesting if he didn't try to buy the pen

9061~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I said this about Suárez not too long ago:

9062~~~
If you look at it carefully, he did stop marginally so as not to get in his path. Herrara deliberately stuck his leg out to be caught and then immediately appealed. It was pretty obvious what he was trying to do to be honest.

9063~~~
Well at least you are <i>consistently</i> wrong then <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I do agree on that though, that feigning injury and acting like you have been shot is the worst and most embarrassing thing. What was that situation the other week in one of our games (City I think - was it Demichelis?) when their player was rolling around in agony, and got immediately back up when the ref stopped play. Even the ref just shook his head and gave the guy a look of pure disdain.

edit: Found it!

9064~~~
I've got nothing to add to the debate but can I just say this is the best paragraph ever. Such mathematical precision.

9065~~~
That's one of the strangest posts I've ever seen on here. Amazing.

It was definitely a dive, though. You should check out some of the footage if you get a chance. Those geniuses at sky sports have found a way to create moving images out of all those still photos you found. Makes it so much easier to work out what's going on.

9066~~~
This is spot on. Left the leg trailing to try and draw the foul, didnt and went down anyway.

You do see them given but you shouldnt. I guess travelling at speed then a referee can be caught out.

9067~~~
I think you owe <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> an apology.

@<span style="font-size: 15px"><b><a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/pogue-mahone.19580/">Pogue Mahone</a></b></span>,
i really don't need those idiots in the television to tell me what had happened.  just watch out the first two pics, herrera was still stepping his right foot on the ground.  this means he didn't change his position or his course of direction when cahill cut in and made the contact.  rather, the subsequent actions of herrera after the contact made let him looked like he's completing acting on it.

9069~~~
Look at the replays from one of the angles you can see how cahill stops and herrera moves his leg out to put it between Cahills legs. Still images isn't the best way to look at things

9070~~~
for the whole incident the critical moment is the moment when the contact was made, and important moments are the events happened before the critical moment since they are essential to decide whether if a foul was made.

at the critical moment herrera was keeping his path and holding his position, as proved by the 1st & the 2nd pics that his right foot was still stepping on the same ground between the two moments.  this proved herrera didn't run into anything but his own path before the contact was made

before the critical moment herrera kept running into his path after he took possession of the ball.  cahill was cutting in perpendicular to the running path of herrera.  cahill was NOT holding his position but running into herrera until the critical moment occured.

what happened AFTER the critical moment are basically irrelevant to the incident.  and what most people perceived herrera was diving because of those actions happened AFTER the critical moment.

all these motions happened withing a split of second.  a sequence of continuous events as displayed in the video can cause into a delusion to focus in what happened after the critical moment since those actions are more exaggerated.  the only way to have it reviewed thoroughly is to break it down into discrete pictures to find out exactly what happened within such a short moment of time.

just like offside (or goalline technology).  you may not be able to tell this is onside or offside if just reviewing the video because this is out of our brain's processing capability.  sometimes you have no choice but to break it down into a few shots and to check it out one by one, back and forth, so you can find out where is the critical moment.  and then compare the critical moment to what had happened before or after

i think i'm a bit critical to herrera here.  my first two posts here in some people's eyes maybe i was trying to trolling him.  now it deems i'm his biggest defender.

9071~~~

9072~~~
probably you haven't watched the first two pictures i attached earlier.

watch the right football of herrera between the two moments that it stick on the ground.  how cahill could have hold still and collided with herrera when herrera kept his right foot on the ground.  any suggestion?

9073~~~
Fairly anonymous today, didn't seemed to get caught between whether to stick close to Blind or get closer to the forwards.

9074~~~
I thought he was the only player that looked like taking the initiative with any kind of thought process behind what he was trying to do.

Not one of his better games, but our best player aside from Smalling.

9075~~~
Good and bad.  A bit anonymous too.  He usually thrives against teams pressing, but today he was struggling at the start of the game to counter the pressing.

9076~~~
That is a good point. He was the only one who tries anything, but Blind was awful, so you end up caught between two stools.

9077~~~
Thought he was ok too. Alongside Smalling and Shaw the only player who showed up. The only annyoing thing is that he protests to the ref instead of playing on.

9078~~~
He was very subdued today, Everton made it difficult for us to play through the middle and that restricted both he and Fellaini. But a lot of teams are going to do that and we have to find a way to rise above it. Unfortunately Ander, like Fellaini and the rest did not manage to find that extra bit of class to make it happen.

9079~~~
He was OK, nothing special. Thought he was going to bury that chance in the first half where he was left of goal. Should have just smashed it.

9080~~~
Thought he was sloppy in possession today

9081~~~
Only one who was trying something, and probably the best player from our midfielders/attackers. That's not saying much though, but he doesn't deserve any criticism for today.

9082~~~
He can't do it all on his own. Them cheating to get Fellaini booked didn't help. My god we miss Carrick.

9083~~~
Best player was Smalling by some distance, then Shaw and Herrera, maybe Mata and Young weren't as awful as the rest of the team. Herrera did okay today but he had struggling Fellaini and Blind providing him any kind of service rooney and van persie in midfield... no comment, desperately need world class defensive midfielder who can play no6 well asi his primary position - Schneiderlin... Then we will be okay

9084~~~
Thought he was the only one at a normal level today really. Tried hard but not too much movement in front.

9085~~~
I think unfortunately it is showing that Blind is not Carrick's replacement and that he is a backup CB and fighting for the LB position with Luke.

9086~~~
Zero link up today. Had the ball but did nothing with it.

9087~~~
He also went back to falling over a bit too easily

9088~~~
This post in the Fellaini thread by Kostur sums things up quite beautifully I feel....

The entire team played badly and Herrera was no exception.

9089~~~
They were all bad, they will all know it. Hopefully they will now realise Top 4 isn't a given. They have had so much praise lately a good kick up the arse might do them good.

9090~~~
Fingers crossed.

9091~~~
Along with smalling was our best player.

9092~~~
Another reason why Carrick is needed, he picks up spaces that allows Herrera to pass (with either foot) otherwise hes restricted to going out to the wing to Mata/Valencia. 

Blind doesnt offer himself like Carrick. Herrera was ok. Not bad, not great.

9093~~~
For some reason he looked miles off the pace today, almost as if he wasn't fit. By far his worst performance for us. 

Unlike some others, though, he never gave up.

9094~~~
That isn't really true at all considering almost everybody has agreed that today wasn't Herrera's best game. Still correct in saying that alongside Smalling and Shaw he was one of few that actually did themselves some justice.

9095~~~
You wonder how much the intensity of some of the previous games have just taken their toll a bit. Unfortunately there were too many players below par today. You can carry one or two, but this seemed to just about the whole team. They will all be wanting to be on the sick tomorrow rather than face LvG.

9096~~~
he was fine comparing to Rooney, Fellaini, Valencia, McNair and degea, in fact only two players deserved more "praise" and it's Smalling and Shaw..

Nobody said Herrera played great, he was okay under these circumstances, and that's the general thinking of him in this thread today I would say..

...but I understand that always there has to be someone in opposition, just for the sake of it.

9097~~~
Played with no real conviction today, disappointing performance.

Well done Ander. I was watching the voting. You could call it a landslide. I think he got about 63% of the vote.

9100~~~
I like the comments on his page.

9101~~~
Copy and paste the image location in the image tool box.

9102~~~
Smalling has been better than him in April, he should have won the award.

9103~~~
Sometimes he actually replies to the comments. It nothing special though, he is just being the great guy that he is.

9104~~~
Deservedly!

9105~~~

9106~~~
Bloody hell, I opened the skysports page only to find an article titled "Ander Herrera out for..." and started freaking out. Turns out the rest of the title was "second place", I just hadn't computed.

9107~~~
What did Scholes say about Herrera?

9108~~~
Scholes said: “Herrera's been the one who's impressed me most. He’s another one that did struggle to get in the team early on but now he's playing really well. He's playing really good football, looks like he's going to score goals, looks like he's going to make goals. He's been a great addition and he's only a young lad as well so hopefully he can get even better.”

9109~~~
Cheers. Good to know

9110~~~
His worst  performance, again West Brom.

9111~~~
I don't think he was that bad, he's just so restrained and Fellaini/Rooney/RvP aren't creating anything ahead of him. Desperately need Carrick back so he can actually do what a midfielder should be doing for us.

9112~~~
Awful today. If it's that he needs Carrick beside him, then we better see Carrick in the next game.

9113~~~
Did he get found out today? Is he good enough for Man Utd? A wonderful player but he went missing when we needed him most....I'm not sure if he is a Man Utd level player despite hitting a rich vein of form recently..possibly over-hyped due to playing well in a recent few games

9114~~~
Mixed performance. On the one hand, I think its a good shout to use him in the deeper role against teams who park the bus - we dont need a dedicated holding midfielder in those situations, so having someone like Herrera who can play that role but still go forwards regularly, is useful.

On the other hand, he is meant to be one of our playmakers who can link up with the attacking players. He got forward enough regularly enough today that he could/should have contributed in attack. As it is, we havent scored in three games and Herrera has to be one of those sharing in the responsibility for that.

9115~~~
Surprised by some of the comments. He did ok today. He has had much worse games than this. He played a deeper role today and had limited offense.

9116~~~
Yeah. I thought the setup was obviously meant for Rooney to be the more creative player. I actually sense that Herrera was curbing his attacking instincts today. So many times he would go forward, then rush back to a deeper midfield position.

9117~~~
He wasn't great today, but why will LvG insist on putting Rooney in midfield and hamstringing our midfield. They need to get Carrick fit and quick. Rooney to me is in one of his usual end of season slumps. It happens all the time.

9118~~~
He went missing? He probably played more forward passes than all of Mata, Rooney and Fellaini put together.

If we had more players doing what Herrera was trying to do today then we'd have won the game.

9119~~~
He's a wonderful player but he made insane amounts of wayward passes today and also insane amounts of sideways passes when we needed a risk taker in there....He looked very Cleverley-liek out there today...He is a great player but he is vastly over-rated here and has done very little in big games for us to suggest he is nailed on for a long term future in central midfield for us

9120~~~
I thought he tried hard and was looking for passing options but there was rarely anything on, he also looked committed the same as Young.

9121~~~
He was always going to play more 'forward' passes because he was a line behind those two so even when he's passed it to the wing it was usually releasing the winger/fullback rather than squaring it like in Rooney/Fellaini's case.

He was shit today just like everybody else and it's LVG to blame for me.

9122~~~
He was forcing passes into our centre forward all game long. Most of them didn't come off but at least he was forcing the issue.

He's been excellent in the big games, too. That last sentence is just total bollocks.

9123~~~
Thought he acquitted himself well today. Some people will erroneously compare him with Carrick in a deep lying role and that's kind of unfair because Herrera is a natural #8. It's almost like penciling Iniesta in Busquets' position or Fabregas in Matic's position and contrasting the relative difference in performance. A drop if inevitable.

Part of the reason Ander does so well further up is the presence of Carrick behind him, and Mata sideways. Both of them are likeminded technical footballers who operate on a similar mental wavelength. Today, not only did Ander have to tone down his more offensive instincts in favour of defensive workrate in deeper positions - he had to basically shepherd the center of the pitch in a patchwork midfield.

Overall he did his job, which was primarily to monopolize possession - 130+ passes, 90 % accuracy, 5 tackles. Can't complain really. Looked positive and proactive, and threaded a few neat passes through.

9124~~~
Sitting infront of a holding midfielder doesn't negate the need for Rooney and Fellaini to take the initiative and płay forward passes. We know that because Herrera himself has previously played lots of forward passes in the very positions they were both playing today.

Herrera was poor but I take issue with the notion he went missing. We know that he wasn't because he gave the thing away often enough.

9125~~~
Thought he was one of the very few who actually played well, along with Van Persie? Always looked to do something positive with it, passed it quickly, won the ball back often. Not his fault that the wingers or forwards couldn't finish. He had 146 touches of the ball, 3 shots, had the most key passes or whatever, and generally did all he could. Was a bit sloppy at the start but overall he would probably get like a 7/10 at least if the result had been a draw or a win, but since everyone else missed their chances people criticize him.

9126~~~
I thought he was just OK. Nothing horrible but didn't do anything special either.

9127~~~
I thought he played well, he's obviously not a #6 but he was ok IMO.

9128~~~
Poor by his standards but one of the better United players today. The problem is he's not a holding midfielder and the only one we do have is 35.

9129~~~
He has been excellent recently but the jury is definitely still out

9130~~~
He was trying things, most of which didn't work out, but I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say he played well.

9131~~~
I don't think he had a poor performance as such, he's just not that good when played that deep. He needs to be further forward and have more freedom.

9132~~~
Should not be playing as a DM, far better as an AM/CM. Not a great performance from him, although he's dropped off these last three games.

9133~~~
All games where Carrick has been missing unfortunately.

9134~~~
We can't keep using that as an excuse. We're a team of eleven and should be capable of more than what we've witnessed these past three games.

9135~~~
He should have also made sure he had a proper backup for Carrick, this summer is going to be vital on that count. The obsession of Rooney in midfield. Then god help us RvP in midfield.

9136~~~
They key is realising which player we should sacrifice in the situation we find ourselves in, and our manager hasn't responded well. We should have played Blind as a DM, Young as a LB, and allowed Herrera to play further forward. Stop playing Herrera as a ******* DM! LvG was poor, today.

9137~~~
Blind was utter shit in DM against Everton though, so Herrera is probably the best alternative. Sadly.

9138~~~
Yet he is supposed to be a tactical genius, unfortunately he has not come across Tony Pulis before. That'll teach him.

9139~~~
I thought that looked incredibly like a Cleverley performance. Nothing bad, but nothing stand-out. Like Clev though, he's only 1 outfield player out of 10 and it shouldn't all rest on him. He also was caught high up a few too many times but that's what happens when you shoehorn players into positions they are unfamiliar with.

9140~~~
I would have risked Jones there tbh. Ander is too good at other things to be wasted as a DM.

9141~~~
I think the trouble with Ander is that he would want to get things going and try to create stuff, so then he goes forward and then has to rush back as you can't trust Rooney and co. to cover your back. He is trying to do two jobs at once.

9142~~~
No way, dude. Blind has been poor, however, Herrera is quite simply... handicapped when playing as a DM. Push him further up the pitch and he's a completely different player.

9143~~~
Another descent performance but needs to be played furter up the pitch to get the most out of him.

9144~~~
WBA didn't actually create that much, so he probably did his job as DM reasonably well. However he is just wasted there and it takes away from the teams attacking threat. It has to stop.

9145~~~
Definitely agree that he's wasted in DM, but I can sort of understand why LVG plays him there with Carrick out. Not sure if playing Jones there would've helped, as I think our general ball retention would've suffered from it, but it would've been worth trying something at some point during the second half.

9146~~~
Exactly, and that is exactly what he should be doing. LVG is stifling his creative flair and because being creative is his natural tendency, he ends up being out of position which harms our back 4. Really strange to be honest.

9147~~~
Sure, but how does that help the DM issue? Blind had a mare there last weekend, so you can understand why LVG wants to try something else - what's the alternative then?

9148~~~
Unfortunately it's Michael Carrick.

9149~~~
Blind has generally been better at home, than he has away. We also probably would have known how WBA would have set up, and how we'd have had a good proportion of the ball which reduces the responsibility of the DM, with regards to defending. Therefore, we should have played Blind as a DM and Herrera further up.

It's not coincidence that we're suffering from creativity issues ever since Herrera has been handed more defensive responsibilities (and Carricks injury).

9150~~~
With LvG, you just never know. He could end up in goal, next week.

9151~~~
Has LVG stripped all the creativity out of him?

9152~~~
Yeah, he's probably the best one at it with Carrick out, been very impressed with his performances as the holding midfielder both in terms of passing the ball around and defensively, problem is he's our best creative midfielder for the other 2 spots as well. Having another one like him in style and play would help immensely (Gundogan, while not being the same, is a creative and all round midfielder so he'd be great). Carrick is a huge loss, but I'd say Herrera would be almost as big of a loss if he got injured.

9153~~~
Wouldn't single him out in this game. He did ok, still had some nice passes (set up Van Persie for one of his chances). It's really not his role though, and it severely limits his effectiveness. Mata also doesn't work as well in that wide role without Herrera playing closer to him.

9154~~~
I think he was one of the few who did his job really well. Won the ball back the few times they tried going forward, created a few chances, had almost 150 touches and generally controlled the game. Nobody can put any blame on him for us missing our chances or Mata/Di Maria/Rooney/Young/Blind/Valencia wasting so many promising opportunities to put in good crosses or make the decisive pass.

9155~~~
We had plenty of chances, but cannot hit the proverbial elephants arse with a mile wide banjo. Getting in the way of your own players shots doesn't help either.

9156~~~
Of course he has, just like he would do it and did it with every player, except the striker.

9157~~~
Played DM today.

9158~~~
It is almost like he wants to do something creative, then knows LvG will have his guts for garters so goes back into his DM role. Ander is not a DM. However our forward players should have been capable of putting the ball in the net.

9159~~~
Same will happen with Pogba, no need to buy him if he gets taken away his best assets. Herrera played DM, but he still doesnt play like he used to. I hope we buy a solid CM next to him, so that he can be more creative again.

9160~~~
He was fairly good, couldnt take many chances because of the role he was playing.

9161~~~
If it is all about don't take risks, then he, as you say, is wasting his time buying the exciting players we would like. Could imagine telling a George Best or Lionel Messi not to take a risk, just keep possession. Yes you can have possession but let the players do something with it.

9162~~~
We are really missing his attacking contribution when he has to play this deep.

9163~~~
Playing a creative player as DM made sense, as we were never going to do much defending. Let's be honest, he wasn't great. Fairly crap in the first half but was better after half time. Reminiscent of his underwhelming early season displays. Obviously still settling in. He's allowed to have a bad game, every now and then.

9164~~~
It might have worked if he had proper midfielders round him, instead he had Wayne Rooney in full slump mode and then somehow RvP ended up there as well. He was then isolated from Mata who was on the wrong side and who he has a good understanding with. Come back soon Michael and yes he is allowed a bad game now and then.

9165~~~
People will jump on me cause everybody loves Herrera, as do I of course, but him playing a DM is an excuse cause lets be honest he wasnt anythins special today. Lots of times he was near their box despite the fact he was nominally a DM and he wasnt exactly giving some great passes forward as much as he should have done. He didnt have so much to do defensively so he was involved in the attack very often. 
I dont believe he doesnt take the risks or make some defense splitting passes so often cause LVG told him not to. Or any player for that matter.

9166~~~
I like Hererra but yesterday really showed up his limitations. For a CM the rhythm and consistency of passing needs a lot of work. Doesn't have that ability to see and execute a progressive pass in an instant that you need from a top CM. Tends to always take at least two touches and/or play it backwards. When he did occasionally find enough time and space to try progressive passes they were usually picked off, or overhit.

A work in progress. Hopefully something to build on anyway.

9167~~~
I am his biggest fan, but i feel him playing DM just highlights his biggest flaw which is long passing, he doesn't have the range of passing Carrick has and can't switch play with one pass and get the winger one-on-one with the fullback it took us three to four passes to switch ball from from one flank to another which resulted in WestBrom finding it easy to defend. 

Secondly he is best playing further ahead where he can play expansively and his link up play with Mata helps both of them as they are on same wavelength and it allows Valencia time and space to cross. When he plays defensive midfielder obviously he has to contain his passing range as he's the last Midfielder and he has only Cb's behind him and losing the ball will usually mean conceding a goal. So in short Carrick is vital for us, and we need a replacement for Carrick next season its the most essential thing because it not only allows Herrera to play in his proper position it allows Rooney to play in his best position aswell.

9168~~~
Good post i couldn't agree more. Herrera's long balls aren't good enough or consistent enough to be playing a like-for-like Scholes or Carrick role. He thrives on short passes and one twos. Defensively he was sound. Made a couple of tackles but its clear his best position is as a number 8. I couldn't agree with the commentator when he said Herrera's passes aren't as creative as Carricks, or something to that effect. That was a ridiculous comment. Its the range he struggles with, not so much creativity. Carrick has never been a consistent deliverer of defensive splitting passes either, thats just not his game. Carrick is more like our version of Busquets. Great passer but not someone we look towards for unlocking a defense. Some of the comments just baffles me.

9169~~~
Anders game is based as you short passing. Pass and move. He can't keep passing and moving if he is being asked to hold his position in front of the back 4. Or he can but if the ball is given away by him or one of the other players, he has a mad dash to get back in front of that back 4. The fact they need protecting shows how many changes need to be made there.

9170~~~
True, Herrera had a good game he kept passing going on and defensively he was solid, he even tried a long ball which went out of play, and i have witnessed it plenty if times his long passing is very erratic, which he has to improve, but as you said technically and creatively he's really good and even yesterday he tried to create opening but his final pass let him down. 

As far as Carrick is concerned, i feel people under-rate his abilities that he's not a very good midfielder capable of defending but his passing range long and short is very essential for our build up play, and those people saying we should sign Schneiderlin from Southampton, i don't think he has the passing range and will be anywhere near as good at dictating play from deep, although defensively he's a monster and that could only be the reason we are not in for him, we need another Alonso and players like him are incredibly difficult to find.

9171~~~
Move him further back and he's not as good at Carrick's job as Carrick. Worst still, no one really takes over Herrera's job on the right so that passing option fails. Without Herrera alongside Mata, Mata looks lost.

Without Mata we really are very dependant on whatever we can make work through Fellaini. If an opponent blocks Fellaini then we lose both our fast out ball and our attacking plan B. It's a domino effect. Had Rooney and RvP been at their best then it might not have mattered, but they weren't, so it did.

So, not the best game from Herrera and he couldn't do what it took to lift the team, but I think that says as much about our squad depth and our tactics as it does about Ander.

9172~~~
LvG probably thought Blind was the answer, but he does not have the height and sheer physicality of Michael neither does Ander. Michael is quite a big unit. An option to stand in for/replace him is vital in the summer.

9173~~~
He can't play the DM position, that's clear. Move him further up and he's brilliant. One of the reason we didn't score is him playing so deep

9174~~~
Been on the end of some hospital passes from his teammates.

9175~~~
Yeah. Had to have a moan or two at a couple of them.

9176~~~
Think his form has dipped the last few weeks

9177~~~
Definitely tends to dwell on the ball a bit too long. He's having a decent game though. Well disciplined.

9178~~~
I think he is the one missing Carrick the most as we were fluid with them both in there. I personally love his commitment and fight and at times today he was played balls that were near impossible to do anything with from Blind, Fellaini and Valencia.

9179~~~
Every time he is poor or nothing special theres a good excuse amd it some other player's fault..

9180~~~
I think tbh he looked mentally exhausted at the end of the game. This league is exhausting and next season he will know that as the old cliche goes, there are no easy games. It is difficult coming from league, this counts for all the foreign players, where some games are a walk in a park. That is why it is vital to sign a backup/replacement of quality for Carrick. Blind was awful.

9181~~~
Difficult to criticise him when he seems to be the only player in midfield most of the time.

9182~~~
Needs to cut out those back passes.

9183~~~
I mentioned in another post that I thought he looked exhausted at the end, not physically but mentally drained. This league is a killer and as the manager said it can take a season to settle. I am sure he would rather be playing with Carrick than Blind. There are no walkovers here, anyone can beat anyone and you have to learn to mentally strong. I am not worried about him. I am more worried about the British players who should be well accustomed to playing here. Losing two players by half time won't have helped the team in the 2nd half. I actually thought him and Falcao linked up well.

9184~~~
Wasnt the best out there nor the worst, i dont expect him single handedly winning games for us. Looked ok, hopefully he can learn from it and with a better squad imrpove next season.

9185~~~
I thought he did ok, felt like he was our only midfielder today. I think all things considered,  he has been very good for us and will get better with a better squad and now that he's more experienced in the league.

9186~~~
He's just not going to look good unless we have Carrick, or more ideally a "new Carrick", behind him. 
But we'll surely be looking at CMs this summer...

9187~~~
He was okayish.

When under the press, he and Mata looked better than others ever so slightly.

9188~~~
He was alright but hes capable of playing better than that.
Id put him in more or less the same boat as fellaini and mata. 
They were all ok but none were much of a consistent threat and all were a bit anonymous at times.

It was a tired looking team performance and he looked as tired as anyone.
But its a team game and young came up with the goods today, as hererra has covered for some poor performances by him other days.

9189~~~
I think you are right that he is physically drained, this league is unlike any other, but I still think he'd not be so weary if his CM partners were better at passing and moving as he always looked great with Javi Martinez behind him and has been excellent for us with Carrick, without him he has to do too much as Blind either pushes on too far or sits too deep.

9190~~~
If the result goes well tomorrow, all the pressure will be gone and we might get a more relaxed performance from the team. The pressure of playing for this club can be one hell of a shock but I think this lad will grow with it. Some it can suffocate.

9191~~~
Maybe LvG needs to drop Blind until he learns to play in a more disciplined manner.

9192~~~
Wasn't great today compared to his usual standards. Didn't help that he was pretty much on his own in CM due to blind going missing.

9193~~~
With only 2 games left I think we have to persevere as the squad is down to the bare bones, but we must get a genuine Carrick replacement in this summer.

9194~~~
No alternative for the position without Carrick though...a proper DM is probably going to be the most important signing this summer.

9195~~~
Good game today. His first touch was noticeably excellent on a tough pitch to play on.

Disciplined and understated, but that was a solid away midfield performance. His cross to Rooney was particularly good.

9196~~~
Can they be fined for that pitch? It is disgusting, especially in this day and age.

9197~~~
He should definitely focus more on reducing the tendency to press and get caught ball watching consequentially

9198~~~
Yep.. Herrera is probably our best in that position after Carrick, problem is when we play him there we also miss him a lot in the box to box role. We basically have 2 players good enough to start and then have to start picking from scraps to complete a team.

9199~~~

9200~~~
That is a lovely Afro he has

9201~~~
Don Dinho.

9202~~~
Recognise him? Could have been last week ffs.

9203~~~
The rebuilt of our midfield needs to start with him. Add some around him. Let's start by trying to add quality alongside some of the quality we have and see where that takes us. Anything else then we're going to be stuck in a liverpoolesque vicious cycle trying to sort everything out.

9204~~~
He needs to be upgraded on imo, same with Fellaini.

9205~~~
Dissagree, reckon he's more than good enough. His passing is the only part of his game that needs work, everything else is on point. Far from fellaini who's nothing but a ball chest controlling nuisance.

9206~~~
Why? He's class. Scores goals, gets assists, does loads defensively and is excellent on the ball. Vidal would be an upgrade on him for a box to box position but that's about it really. He's probably the best all round midfielder in the premier as well.

9207~~~
I mean in his current deeper role he plays, his passing just isn't good enough imo especially his long range passing. I think he can be very good as the furthest forward midfielder though where he can help link up with the forwards. We have been heavily linked with Gundogan and I think LVG want's him to play in Herrera's current position or maybe he will replace Fellaini, I'm not sure.

9208~~~
would say Aaron Ramsey

9209~~~
Look how happy Ronaldinho is to meet Cory Matthews.

9210~~~
Ah, I think he's perfectly fine in the box to box role, so long as it's Carrick next to him holding. Gundogan I think is being linked to just have more depth and starting quality. Probably Herrera would go to the creative and attacking role, and Gundogan sitting next to Carrick when all fit, but if one of them gets injured then Gundogan either goes to Carrick's position and Herrera moves back to the box to box or Gundogan takes more of a box to box and creative role when Herrera is out. Would be good all around, if Gundogan gets back to pre injury form.

9211~~~
Nah, Herrera is better all around IMO. Is a lot better defensively, better technically on the ball I'd say, though Ramsey is a better goalscorer (Herrera certainly isn't bad at that either though).

9212~~~
Love him. Love him. Love him.

What a player!

9213~~~
Nice finish from him.

9214~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9215~~~
Great finish, wonderful movement, what a player.

9216~~~
Bargain.

9217~~~
One of the best buys of the season. Would walk into any midfield in the league in the form he's been in for the past six months or so.

9218~~~

9219~~~

9220~~~
Have to say, Ander's increasing penchant for goals has definitely come as a surprise. He was never particularly prolific at Athletic Club or Zaragoza, despite playing as a #10 at times. 8 total goals for the season from a central midfield position is a quality return, almost as many as he scored in the last 2 seasons combined, and the highest return for a United central midfielder in exactly 10 seasons (Scholes). The team has been crying for a ~10 goals per season central midfielder in the mold of a Toure or Ramsey. Resolves some balance issues, and an added bonus to his overall technique and tenacious style of play. Long may it continue ! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9221~~~
Almost any. Would be a tough fit in the Chelsea midfield. Even in City's team he would be competing with Toure for the forward mf role.

9222~~~
Herrera > Toure this season without a doubt. Also he'd get into Chelsea's, with Fabregas going as the 10 I think.

9223~~~
Matic - Herrera - Fabregas

Fernandinho - Toure - Herrera

Doesn't have to be one or the other. He's been brilliant. Top 5 CM in the league this season.

9224~~~
Like him a lot, think he's stalled a bit recently but briliant half there.

9225~~~
Love him. Should easily make double figures for goals next season.

9226~~~
Playing very well, Mata link up is great

9227~~~
He's just superb. That moment near the end where he beat 3 players and almost slipped Falcao in <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9228~~~
I definitely thought he was pricy in the summer (and the one before that as well, when we were first trying to buy him) but he looks every bit a £30 million midfielder this season

9229~~~
Fantastic player!

9230~~~
Brilliant player. Great linkups with him and Mata. Had a delightful throughball to falcao who was too slow to read it.

With further additions to midfield this summer, we might have a proper midfield at last.

9231~~~
I hope he's the player we build the new look midfield around this summer. He's too good to either sit on the bench or deputise for Carrick further back.

9232~~~
Very very good. Love watching him play.

9233~~~
So good. Took 3 Arsenal players out the game with those skills near the end of the half. Pity nobody made a decent run.

9234~~~
His improvement this season has been fantastic. Another great finish.

9235~~~
I am surprised how long Sir Alex ferguson has overlooked this problem area of our field. Herrera has been more than a blessing to our team considering the option we currently have when he is not fit. Some people on here stress the importance of Carrick, but I believe Herrera is a much more vital player to United. Nevertheless, great signing and I hope he can continue this form into next season.

I call bs or not. On target just means, he could have had plenty more shots.

9236~~~
Great finish for the goal and there was a piece of dribbling near the end that was just sublime. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

He's excellent. Anyone putting hypothetical teams without him in their side is off their rocker.

9239~~~

9240~~~
Indeed, very "hot Herrera"

9241~~~
I thought he was very good today, his all round game is so good, if we get better CM's in there with him we will have some midfield.

9242~~~
If Moyes had signed him he'd still have a job here.

9243~~~
It's a shame we couldn't have signed him a year earlier really. He's going to become a very important player for us over the next few years.

9244~~~
It seems a long time ago now when he was struggling to get into the team. Now I can't imagine it without him.

9245~~~
Spanish Cleverley. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i57.tinypic.com/n3unhz.jpg" src="http://i57.tinypic.com/n3unhz.jpg"/>

9246~~~
Very very good today

9247~~~
He was superb in the first half. Dropped away in the second, but that was largely down to Arsenal having more of the ball. Nevertheless I thought he was impressive with his defensive contributions too. There was a great slide tackle in the first half as he chased an Arsenal player down.

9248~~~

9249~~~
So he's going to play in new Twin Peaks right? Agent Herrera.

9250~~~
Ah to remember when people thought LVG doesnt rate him.

9251~~~
It's especially amazing that after that first touch you expect him not to make it on time to the ball yet he manages to outplay another two Arsenal midfielders when he gets to it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9252~~~
Absolutely love Ander Herrera. Wouldn't swap him for any other midfielder in the league.

9253~~~
best new signing - took awhile to get into LVG good graces.

9254~~~
Not as good, but Ramsey got him back.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Didn't break Herrera's ankles though.
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eAZgMv1F6ag/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

9255~~~
Along with Januzaj he looked the most interested in actually trying to win the game today instead of treating it as an afternoon stroll.

9256~~~
The thing I like about him is that even when the rest of the team is playing like ass, he still tends to play well. Has a pretty high bottom level, or at least this season. The only performance where he was genuinely bad was the West Brom game in November, when he played with a broken rib so it was understandable. The rest were decent at worst.

9257~~~
Only one of the few that was actually trying something. Some of his final passes were a bit poor though.

9258~~~
At least he knows that if you have a shot at goal, you might score. Where the hell were Rooney and Mata?

9259~~~
That seemed to a general malais through the whole side today.

9260~~~
Hit and miss today, but he's been the highlight of the season for me.

9261~~~
At least he was a bit hit. Some played like they would rather stayed in bed. The lad has given us something to look forward to, as I think he will only get better with the right players round him.

9262~~~
Rooney seemed angry and confused today and Mata vacated his wide role completely, strange stuff.

9263~~~
8 goals and 5 assists is a good return given how little he played at the start of the season. 

Overall i, like most, have been very impressed with what he offers us. I cant remember the last time we had a central midfielder who can get us goals!

9264~~~
would be easily outfield player of the season if he played more, well I guess he anyway is

9265~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9266~~~
See, he is just going home to Spain on holiday.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9267~~~
Where is David ? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9268~~~
David didn't travel, maybe because of his injury or maybe other unrelated things I'd rather not think about <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9269~~~
I hope he can play further upfront next season to really get the best out of him

9270~~~
I know hindsight is 20/20 but how the feck did LVG hold him out of the squad for half the season?

It really makes you question whether he is the right man to take us forward. I suppose LVG has one more season to get it right. This season was an absolute nightmare especially considering how most of the wounds were self inflicted, starting with not playing Herrera until the last few months of the season.

9271~~~
Our best and most entertaining performances came when he's been in the team. Scored some crucial goals. 

6/10

9272~~~
I've given him a respectable 6.7 over the season. He like most of our players is more effective when the opposition come out to play. When the team sits in deep he can resort to one to many side wards  passes to Mata and Tony.

9273~~~
He's a stubborn man who will always have some players he wont pick based on his "philosophy" excuse. Whether or not he's successful at the club, theres always likely to be a player or two that seems like he should be playing and isn't.

But that might be true at times about Sir Alex too. For example playing Valencia on the right wing when he'd gone bad, or Young after his first season when he clearly didnt deserve to play.

With Sir Alex he had some other areas where he was incredible, that led to us being more successful with him than if we had a different manager. Will LVG make up for it? We'll wait and see but he hasnt done anything particularly well to make up for his strange preferences leaving the likes of Ander and Smalling out early in the season

What a player we have <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9275~~~
I think he'll get even better when we have a few more quality players around him. Sometimes looks like he thinks a couple of seconds quicker than the likes of Young, Fellaini, Valencia etc....would also help him to have a striker who makes forward runs as opposed to always coming short

9276~~~
Very nice. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Something that even first time watchers can instantly notice with Ander - is that he has very neat defending technique. Not a lot of players have developed the knack for predicting the trajectory of the ball, or the movement of the ball carrier - and adjusting the tackle accordingly. A lot of his tackles are quite clean as a consequence, he seems to make a deliberate effort in terms of gaining possession of the ball, rather than just randomly clattering into players and disrupting the rhythm of the game.

9277~~~
Absolutely fabulous

9278~~~
I'd say he was our best outfield player yesterday. He's had a good first season at the club. It's important he pushes on next season and doesn't stagnate like some foreign imports do.

9279~~~
That's a fantastic compilation. 

I am a big fan of this guy, can't wait to see him next year!

9280~~~
What a compilation. Such an elegant player.

9281~~~
This guy can do it all, excellent box to box midfielder. With a world class CDM behind him our midfield will be in good hands.

9282~~~
Not called up to the Spain squad <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Deserved a spot.

9283~~~
Thiago wasn't either, wish England had so many options when picking midfielders. He'll get a nice rest.

9284~~~
Thiago wasn't becuase of fitness issues.

9285~~~
This type of thing makes me fear he'll want to go back to Spain eventually if the top 2 come calling

9286~~~
Not sure, he will be 26 in August, so he will get to an age that if he hasn't been capped, he isn't going to be capped. Going back to Spain won't change that. Unfortunately. Depends how much it bothers him or if he could rather concentrate on winning things with a club.

9287~~~
Such a fanboy of his.  I've forgotten what a half decent midfielder can look like.  Him and Carrick posses that ability to make space for themselves in the middle of the park; it's very refreshing to see in our midfield. If we get anyone in with a similar ability, but with that final pass on them, I will look forward to watching our midfield next season instead of wincing.

9288~~~
Shame that we never got to see a midfield of Herrera and Carrick as a 2, with mata ahead as a 10. Think it could work really well with Herrera doing the leg work and Carrick sweeping as usual.

9289~~~
We had to wait ages for Ander to get a regular place, then just as it possibly could happen then Carrick gets injured. Unfortunately Juan has not been played in his ideal position either.

9290~~~
Well Spain has a great choice for midfield so it's difficult. They're complete dunces though for picking that turd at Madrid over De Gea

9291~~~
United won every game that Herrera and Carrick both started. 15 points out of 15 in games vs Spurs, Liverpool, City, Stoke & Villa.

9292~~~
Didn't know that, good stuff.

9293~~~
If thats his first season with us I can't wait until next, he's already a Key player for us and will only get better.

9294~~~
So when is he going away for match fixing?

9295~~~
I remember the times in this thread where it was suggested he would be sold in the summer as he was not an LVG signing and not in his plans... how times have changed for the better <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

9296~~~
Ouch.

9297~~~
Luca Zidane is a goalkeeper <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9298~~~
He played with Luca Zidane?
He's off then.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9299~~~
Touch of the old man there from Luca

9300~~~
Sell him.

9301~~~
Sell Ander sign Luca

9302~~~

9303~~~
I remember that day, what a great day it was. Sitting at the university on my laptop uploading the page all the time til it was confirmed. Hope i dont have to wait for Ramos too long

9304~~~
What a nice lad. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9305~~~
So damn lovable.

And he's got a bit of a prickish nature and aggressiveness to him when he's actually on the pitch too, which I like.

9306~~~
<3

9307~~~
What a day that was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Doesn't seem like a year, mind.

9308~~~
Only regret is that it should have been 2 years ago, instead of just 1. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9309~~~
Agreed, although there's always the possibility that actually having a half-decent midfielder to partner Carrick might have upped our performanced just enough to save Moyes' job <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>.

9310~~~
He's a wonderful man.

9311~~~
Happy anderversary

9312~~~
Rooney should see this.

9313~~~
Awwww

9314~~~
I love watching him play.

9315~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> I'm sure he will?

9316~~~
Good. That passion to get better may rub him then <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9317~~~
Let's see if Herrera improves when he's nearing 30 eh?

9318~~~
He might be. But in what shirt though? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9319~~~
Hopefully ours? Let's leave this. I'm not getting what your point is.

9320~~~
The way Herrera retrained himself mid-season under van gaals guidance was a wonderful example to the rest of the players like Di Maria or Shaw who find them in & out of the first team.  A kind of commitment to the cause that we as supporters love to see.

9321~~~

Was he the best CM in the Premier League for the second half of last season?

Fabregas went badly off the boil. Touré is only ever on it half the time anyway. We saw Herrera outplay the midfields of Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea one after another. Even when we lost our way a bit in the last few matches his form stayed good - it was elsewhere on the pitch (losing Carrick again, mainly) that we suffered.

Possibly someone at Arsenal like Cazorla might have a shout, but other than that it was Ander, for me.

9322~~~
Agree. He was fantastic, no point in arguing against it. I also think he was one of the best midfielders once he returned to the starting eleven. That compilation is great too, shows exactly what a magnificent season he had.

9323~~~

Just look at him here.

This + <span style="font-size: 12px">Gündogan, a couple of wing-forwards, and a less possession-focused manager would be <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> They'd just be flicking, dinking, chipping the ball in little triangles all over the park. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
It would be awesome to get players in who can play at his (and Martial's speed) and build on it.
