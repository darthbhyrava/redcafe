Big Chris is the gawd

2~~~
Very good today. Our best defender.

3~~~
He is lightening quick, he can dribble the ball forward easily, and defensively he is by far our best.

4~~~
Smalling-Bauer made an appearance, was good to watch, he, Lingard and Kagawa were the only subs who can hold their heads high today.

5~~~
Excellent as always in his defensive anticipation and tackling today. It will be difficult for people not to have noticed him as the standout in the second half.

6~~~
Very convincing performance, shame he conceded twice but it wasn't entirely his fault. Hopefully he'll continue to prove the naysayers (who base Smalling's ability from his RB position) wrong.

7~~~
My gut feeling is that he will become the best player of the Jones, Evans, Smalling trio.

8~~~
Surely LVG can develop him to the next level, like he did with Vlaar at the world cup.  Our best defender today, should stay in the middle of the back 3.

9~~~
With the point of staying as the CCB, not only does it make more sense for his aerial superiority, but he also is put in far less awkward angles if he's playing on the right side, and that gives him more confidence to actually play with the ball as we saw tonight.

10~~~
Underrated by United fans and massively underrated by other fans.

11~~~
Great performance tonight, best CB performance out of him, Jones and Evans so far.

I've always rated him highly though, and if he's in the middle of a back three he'll thrive

12~~~
Did well today, was nice to see him playing in a position he's comfortable in.

13~~~
I've always felt that he has the natural instinct to be the best of the three. Evans and Jones are better with the ball, but I think Smalling has a knack that's something which is harder to teach. I really hope he can stay fit this season and gets games in the right position, I'm pretty sure Van Gaal isn't an idiot and won't be playing him as a right back

14~~~
When he's not played at right back he's very good. 

Ashame a lot of people judge him because he's a shit right back. Put Rio and Vidic there and they would be terrible.

15~~~
He'll like the back three. the RB stint will of helped that. Did well.

16~~~
Very good tonight. Let him do what he does best, defend, and we'll have a top player on our hands. Reads the game well and he can actually tackle. He also didn't shy away when given the captaincy. Hopefully he'll stay injury free and get a consistent run.

17~~~
It was good seeing him step out of the back 3 and attack the ball, which the back 3 allows him to do. He's very quick off the mark and seemed to catch them out a few times where he bombed out and nicked the ball away. He was a big presence. Great mobility.

18~~~
Explain to me why he's better than Jones.

19~~~
Make the effort to look around before posting, please.

20~~~
I did have a look around before I posted, sir. But I obviously missed the fact someone had already started a new thread for him.

Thanks for the post, god bless you sir.

I can't delete the thread, so mods please do so.

21~~~
No problem. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

22~~~
Twitter is worst. They have no clue, they laughed at a player's great performance just because conceded 2 goals. Oh human, they are so easy being tricked by stats and score.

23~~~
I've always liked Smalling and he's currently our best CB behind Evans. I only rate Evans more because his ability on the ball is certainly better than Smalling's and Evans is generally more consistent. Defending-wise, I think the two are on a similar level.

24~~~
He played well tonight, really took on the leadership role with the two less experienced CB's and I think it helped them.

25~~~
Yup. Keane and Blackett had good games and they were definitely helped by Smalling's confidence and composure back there.

26~~~
Agreed, he had a sort of "I got this" approach anytime there was a need to take charge of the back-line and that allowed the younger two to settle into their game.

27~~~
Exactly. There's a reason he was given the armband when Cleverley was taken off.

28~~~
Yes as he wasn't the next in line seniority-wise. Really looking forward to seeing how he does with a full season as a CB.

29~~~
Me too. If van Gaal brings in Hummels (long shot) then Evans and Smalling would definitely be the other 2 CBs whenever we'd play with 3 at the back. If not, then he and Evans should play with each other as much as possible.

30~~~
Absolutely. For all the Jones love due to his style, Smalling is easily the better CB.

31~~~
Glad to see some positive posts in support of Smalling, seems on the twitter thread theres a movement wanting him out of the club. Hoepfully this is a big year for him & he can cement a place as a centre back at United. Has all the attributes you'd looks for, physically imposing, fast & can read the game very well. Van Gaal can help him develop & wont be playing him as a right back!

32~~~
Looked rather commanding and we know he is really good defensively. He really has to improve his ball playing ability though, looks really awkard and starts pinging balls randomly or losing possession easily at times... Think we might have inadvertently stalled his and Jones progress as a centre back. If only him and Jones could have had a consistent run in the first team as centre-backs last season. There was a time when I thought we had the heirs to the pair of Vidic and Ferdinand, now it looks less likely but still possible nonetheless.

33~~~
Our best defender easily. He has all the attributes to become world class: athletic, strong, very good tackler, and very good aerially. His composure when bringing the ball out is fine, but his long passes are generally poor. Needs to improve on that, but other than that, he's done very well.

34~~~
Very strong performance. His ball playing skills are looking somewhat hit and miss. At times he looks very comfortable with it making great passes, and other times he looks so erratic and chucks it as fast as he can.

35~~~
Our best CB, simple as that. He's a rock at the back, and with slow improvement to his passing and preventing injury will be great for him.

36~~~
It's a shame his long passing is poor but he's our best CB. If he can keep his passing simply rather than playing more difficult balls then he can go onto become a really good player for us.

37~~~
Our best defender during the pre-season tour. Has pace, strength, good reading and just about every core ingredient that a good centre back needs. If only he can improve his on the ball ability...

38~~~
On pure defensive attributes, he is more or less very accomplished in most areas - athletic, strong, aerially dominant, good awareness & positioning and good in 1 v 1's. He is our most inherently talented defender. His distribution and composure - on the ball as well as dealing with danger - remains an issue, but he has the makings of an excellent defender.

39~~~
Smalling's athleticism and strength give him a great advantage when players are running towards him. Most of the time, he'll either make a great tackle or he'll out-muscle his man. In the box, when dealing with crosses, he's generally excellent. His passing skills, however, are average. I don't feel comfortable with him making long passes, and that's why we need our full backs and midfielders to provide good passing angles. 

Though he's not great on the ball, when he does play as a CB, he demonstrates good valiance in moving with the ball through the centre of the field. He's first choice quality, and hopefully this is the season where many fans can judge him fairly (in his natural position).

40~~~
I think he's one of our best choices for captain. On last season's performances he's the one CB that should be in the team every week

41~~~
Appears to be flourishing under van Gaal. I've been impressed with him the most out of all three of our centre backs so far.

42~~~
Right, so he's shocking on the ball for a team that wants to be in the top 4. Jones was bad on the be ball today but Smalling seems to take so long to handle the ball let alone decide what to do with it and then actually do what he's decided he wants to do with it.

43~~~
Thought he played well against the man mountain that is Bony.

But yes he is like Bambi on ice at times with the ball.

44~~~
In this system the defenders are seeing so much of the ball and Smalling is so poor in possession that it makes no sense. He's an ok defender but I don't think he's good enough on the ball.

45~~~
He's powerful and a stong tackler. But he needs to sort out the speed at which his limbs move. He actually moved like a mountain today.

46~~~
Uncomfortable on the ball and cumbersome. Jones has a much higher ceiling if he would stop flying into rash tackles.

47~~~
Jones was positionally inept all game. How exactly did he have a better game - through his last ditch heroic tackles? There's already a thread for Smalling btw.

48~~~
Distribution still needs a lot of working on but I thought he dealt with Bony in the air and on the ground really well. Not sure how Jones gets rated higher than him today. Smalling had a good game today, besides the issue with his passing.

49~~~
Given that he spent at least half the game covering for Lingard and Januzaj he was never going to be sound in his positioning. Other than the moment he let Routledge in early on, Jones was very very solid. His last ditch tackles were the result of covering for the mistakes of others, not because he'd let someone in and had to atone. He then went out to right back and did very well dealing with the pace Swansea offered. 

Smalling was okay but his distribution was horrendous. Won his challenges for the most part. Questionable on the second goal.

50~~~
Smalling and Jones are still learning their roles, none are the finished article, both are of a similar level talent and experience wise and both can improve. BUT they need lots and lots of games together, which so far in their short careers has not happened due to injuries and having Rio/Vida in the team ahead of them.

51~~~
They also need to be played in their correct positions from now on. Smalling and Jones as center halves are 100% better than at full back or in Jones case, midfield. That hasn't helped them at all.

52~~~
The second goal was Jones out of position, Smalling had to close Montero - the right winger on the right wing - down. I don't see how is culpable for blame.

53~~~
This. Smalling is a player who very rarely has to make a last ditch tackle because he's so good positionally. Both Blackett and Jones were being pulled out of position all game.

54~~~
His distribution has been good all pre season, one match it has been poor and the criticasters wake up again, pure defensively he is still the best imo, when Benatia is here, I think he wont be needed that much because then we have a very very solid defender.

55~~~
See, this I just don't get. People like to criticize Smalling for so many reasons, and this may just be the most idiotic of them all - claiming he is slow when he's outpaced Sturridge, Agbonlahor, Ribery and whoever you wish to put on that list. He was dribbled past once by quick feet and a nice dribble - that could have happened to Kyle Walker as well, yet would you call him slow? 

Criticize him for his shortcomings, which is his distribution. That being said, it was fine most of the match, but the midfield is hardly doing him any favors, are they?

56~~~
Smalling must be our most criticised player for nothing, the midfielders werent making themselve available, so only thing he could do is pass it to Jones, Blackett, or to Lingard, but he saw those passes ended up in nothing, and tried to be more risky, ofcourse when you decide to do that you will lose the ball more often..

57~~~
Exactly. 

He did have a couple of awful passes as well, but as did Rooney, Mata, Fletcher and all of them.

58~~~
Centre backs often have to cover for a full back who is on his way back from a failed attack. I think Smalling could have done better closing the ball down and stopping the incoming ball given that he and jones had obviously communicated to each other as to who was going where. Would hardly regard that as out of position myself. Out of position would be the way he let routledge in the first half.

59~~~
Phil Jones is the Scot Parker of defenders.

Positionaly inept but, gets away with it because he makes some "heroic" and "brave" last ditch tackles...There, I said it <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Smalling is alright defensively but, Christ he is shocking in possession. Bit like John O Shea

60~~~
The thing with Smalling is when he isn't defending it's all very awkward. Jones is a maniac but you always feel he'll win a 50-50 (even if it means he breaks himself in the process) and he's less likely to throw possession away after a great tackle.

Most of the last ditch stuff I've seen from him this year from pre-season and today hasn't been a creation from his own ineptitude. And again he had the job of covering for Januzaj and Lingard at wing-back, and then had to go into a less-favoured right back role whilst Smalling remained in pretty much the same position all game.

Smalling is a bit Wesley Brown for me. He can be very good at defending but he's really not imposing or confident enough to get things going from the back.

61~~~
Are people here really saying Smalling's defending is just "alright"?

Ok then.

62~~~
In comparison to a lot of our past defenders, yeah....

63~~~
Yeah, compare to the past primes of Rio and Vidic alone and you'll find pretty much all of the current premier league CBs are "alright". Pretty weird thing to say.

64~~~
Well alright....If we consider ourselves a "top team" and we compare him to other "top defenders" he's still alright.

65~~~
Spent too much time with the Ferdinand of the latter years with the hoofballs he does.

66~~~
Really like him today. He could be more vocal and commanding, but individually he's a beast. Nothing can pass him.

67~~~
In terms of his actual defending ie his positioning, his 1 on 1s, his standing tackles etc., you really think he is just alright? You should leave me to debate this for another day, because frankly I don't agree with that statement whatsoever. I can't argue against his distribution, but I would not say he is an "alright defender".

68~~~
Look, I like Smalling. A lot! 

He will be a great defender but at this moment in time, Arsenal, Chelsea and City all have better defenders. And they're the clubs we are supposed to be fighting among.

69~~~
He handled Bony really well today. Won a lot of header and tackles. But poor passes today. Surprise with his passing. He improved his passing since last season. And all of sudden he seems got confused where to pass today. Oh well, it's not like the other players made good passes anyway.

70~~~
I was talking about him on the ball. He takes ages to do anything. He's great on one v ones and generally very good defensively. But on the ball and in terms of distribution he can be very poor.

Also, extra sensitive on the topic of Chis Smalling?

71~~~
he is better/potentially better than the likes of Jagielka, Vlaar, Williams, Distin, Mertesacker, Cahill... and those players play pivotal role in their teams' defences. so not afraid to give him a chance to play for us central CB. did well in on preseason and good today as well..wish him and our other defenders injury free season..well it started nicely..

72~~~
Why does he slip so often while attempting a pass?

73~~~
Jones made a couple of brilliant last ditch tackles which were not from his lack of positioning but because the other players went to sleep. He was excellent the whole game.

74~~~
He seems very classy but I really believe Jones and Evans should be above in the pecking order.  A new defender would displace him from the starting XI, should Evans be fit.

75~~~
He's a beast. 

#SmallingPlusTwo I guess!

76~~~
He does take a little long on the ball and, that I agree with. 

I'm extra sensitive on everything, mate, but there's a lot of unfair criticisms towards him; some argue that his poor in the air (little of that of late), some say he's slow, poor positionally; some argue that he's poor one on one etc etc.

77~~~
He started running off when his number came up, despite there being a Swansea played stood there. He's an idiot. Far too slow at distributing the ball as well.

78~~~
Not sure, but I've noticed this too; perhaps something to do with his balance? I noticed Mata slipped a fair few times yesterday as well, so maybe it was just slippery.

I do think he's more than good enough to start for us, but we didn't play as a unit in defense yesterday. I also think that with three fast defenders in Jones, Smalling and Blackett, we could afford to sit a little higher on the pitch and allow less space between our midfielders and our defense.

79~~~
And you strike me as Einstein reincarnated with such comments...

80~~~
Is he injured or not?

81~~~
No, it was when Fellaini was stood there being subbed on for Herrera. He obviously thought his number was held up. 21 and 12 have the same numbers after all!

82~~~
I can't. Then again I can't tell you why Jones, undoubtedly, is better than Smalling. They're both raw. They haven't featured enough for us. And now they're featuring in a three man line back there which is unusual for both them and us.

Smalling is excellent one-on-one for my money. It's not easy to get past him and he will make it hard for anyone in an aerial challenge. He's positionally dubious. His reading of the game seems less than perfect. Exactly the same could be said for Jones. Well, with the addition that Jones seems less composed than Smalling one-on-one. He does seem more dynamic, though, more agile, even.

Both lack plenty in terms of - to quote Paul Scholes - "sniffing out danger". The latter being THE trait of a top class centre half. Rio Ferdinand (one of the players we have to replace in order to get back to having the best defense in Europe) had this in spades. Even as a youngster, prone to all sorts of bollocks due to youthful arrogance, he had it - the sometimes seemingly uncanny ability to just know where you need to be when the opponent attacks.

83~~~
Injured again.

Really typical. If he can't stay fit this season then we should get rid.

84~~~
Our passing from the back improved after he went off.

85~~~
What about Jones/Evans, also get rid of them?

86~~~
I don't think we would have had much of an issue if Jones played central and Smalling on the right.

87~~~
The man is not a footballer. For me, we should have taken the Vermaelen swap deal. There's a limit to how crappy a defender can be allowed to be on the ball, and Smalling is so horrible it makes me laugh. Especially with this new formation which basically makes him our playmaker. It's a disaster.

88~~~
Yes, if all three can't stay fit, I'd get rid of two.

Pointless having injured CBs always. When we really need a consistent CB partnership rather than chopping and changing every week. If they can't stay fit, what is the point of keeping them?

89~~~
Even if he didn't pick up an injury he should have been either substituted or switched positions with Jones. He had so much time and space on the ball to drive forward and that's just as bad in many ways, as he's so uncomfortable there and takes far too long to release the ball.

He's a good option if we want to drop off and defend the space in behind, but if we have to take the initiative and speed up the tempo, it's far better having Evans or Jones and the central defender, as they are more adept at the sweeping role and pressing forward.

90~~~
Smalling is our most naturally talented defender at the club. His *defending* is top notch.

I dont understand why he has been played in the middle of the back three (the one expected to bring the ball forward). If Smalling played RCB and Jones played in the middle it would be better all round.

91~~~
Personally I don't rate him that much as a defender either but obviously others do.

I just think that you have to be a truly exceptional defender to justify being such a lousy footballer, and Smalling is by no means an exceptional defender. He does not belong in a United XI.

92~~~
His defending has never been superb. He's played in the centre of the back three because the wide CB's regularly get dragged into wide positions and have to play 1v1 vs wingers or forwards where Smalling would look like a dear in the headlights. Both Jones and Blackett are far more athletic and capable of those toles than he is. If Smalling doesn't improve his distribution from defence his days playing for United or any top club are numbered as modern day football is moving more and more towards two way footballers and away from CB's who only want to win headers and hoof long clearances.

93~~~
He was doing good until he got injured..

94~~~
The fragility of our CB's may well put pay to LvG's 3-4-3 quicker than expected.

95~~~
he is the last person to put a blame on. he did his hamstring. He was on par with Jones in first half. He could grow into the match as Jones did and always does..

96~~~
He is the biggest victim of perception bias out of our entire squad, and there's quite a few contenders. 

He can find his team mate with every pass, control every ball perfectly, not concede possession once in the game and we'll have people coming on here after the match to tell us how poor he is on the ball. Maybe he doesn't look classy enough for some people but he sure as hell is nowhere near as bad on the ball (when played as a centre back) as is made out on here.

97~~~
We never had a problem there. It was the passing in midfield

98~~~
You are joking?
Smalling defends wide positions against wingers etc fantastically.

99~~~
I'm completely serious, he's slow and cumbersome which is why LVG has played him centrally.

100~~~
He is definitely not slow.

101~~~
OMG that's why you didnt rate Smalling the other time, calling Smalling slow is one of he most unaccurate/dumbest things I've ever heard, you clearly havent seen how he put up with the likes of Sterling/Ribery/Agbonlahor.

102~~~
This is why he will never be the backbone of a future united title winning side. he is injured far too often to be reliable.

103~~~
You're correct and in fact I'd wager no one has ever seen Smalling go up against Sterling since it's never happened. He didn't play in either of the derby games vs Liverpool last season and played an entire 10mins in one game vs Liverpool over the two derby games the previous season when Sterling wasn't on the pitch.

104~~~
Pre season lol.

105~~~
If you think Smalling is slow you clearly need your eyes testing. He is probably up there with Koscielny as being the quickest CB in the league IMO.

106~~~
2 games in and we have another CB injured.

Standard.

107~~~
Anyone who says Smalling is slow, you have to question their opinion.

108~~~
A pre season friendly were Sterling played wide left and Smalling was at CB. I watched the game and Jones was constantly 1v1 with him not Smalling.

109~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fc3Qb_vHZvc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

0:25, and watch this vid, and tell me he is slow. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wmp0NHonLuk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

110~~~
Smalling doing what he usually does, retreats and retreats until the edge of his box then makes a last ditch tackle. It's not surprising that some casual fans don't get understand that modern CB's in progressive systems need to be two way players and Smalling just isn't, he plays 5 yards deeper than everyone else which gifts forwards space and then somehow gets credit when he makes a block or tackle. There's a reason he'll be benched once LVG can bring in a few more capable players.

111~~~
That's not the point, you were saying he is slow, do you still think he is? Dont need that other discussion with you once again.

112~~~
Of course he is. Not putting yourself into a position to ever get exploited isn't disproving it especially when it's to the overall detriment of the team

113~~~
What are you on man? Are you talking about sprint speed or slow as in he doesnt react quick enough?

114~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How anyone can watch Smalling over a number of years and come the conclusion he's slow.

He's obviously not unbeatable one on one, like anyone he can be done by sharp movements, but if any attacker tries to beat him in a footrace over a decent distance he'll show them up.

115~~~
You'd swear some people in here never actually watch United play and take one look at Smalling size and come out with lazy comment about how slow and cumbersome he is when he is actually plenty fast for a defender.

People also do the same thing when talking about his football skills.They look at his height(which obviously makes him look a bit clumsy) and come with stupid about how awful he is on the ball.Sure he's not a great ball player but he's nowhere near as bad as people make out.

116~~~
He did not look comfortable moving forward into space with the ball in the first half.  He kept stopping and putting out his palms as if asking what do I do now?  Jones would race on and attack the space.

117~~~
Another injury. I hope Jones stays fit, he is the better defender.

I don't understand how you can a hamstring injury? If you stretch properly in the warm-up, this won't happen. I will understand if you get it at the end if the game.

118~~~
The type of player usually playing for the likes of Sunderland. And when a few suggest 'taking a punt' others reply that he's not United level.

119~~~
Wasn't there a rumour that he was injured heading into the game? If that is the case I can see why we risked him. We had no one else other than a very very inexperienced Keane. Anyway, I thought he was going alright until he got subbed. He wasn't spectacular or anything but it wasn't dreadful like that dross in front of him.

120~~~
The thing I noticed watching tonight's game, was how the likes of Gerrard and Fernando drop deep, pretty much into the back line, to give the CBs options to pass to.

Now granted if we play 3-5-2 there IS more expectation for the central CB to take the ball out himself, but I really do think that Smallings passing deficiency is exaggerated, and if we had Carrick or Herrera fit then it wouldn't be something that people would notice, as those are players who will show for the ball and give options to pass to.

121~~~
In the case of Gerrard he basically does all of the passing. The CBs play short simple passes but the responsibility of basically any attacking play starts with the deeper lying midfielder. I agree though, it'd assist Smalling if we did have that kind of midfielder. Although Evans coming back will probably be enough.

122~~~
Skrtel is Liverpool's Smalling in terms of distribution.

123~~~
What that does is also add extra protection when the fullbacks go bombing on. Most teams when in an attacking transition actually are playing a "3-5-2". Liverpool drops Gerrard deep between the CB's as they spread, which allows Johnson and Moreno to push high and wide. That allows Coutinho to come inside and work the space between the midfield and defence; especially against City who had a 2 man midfield, they were already busy picking up Henderson and Allen.

I feel once Carrick is back we can also modify ourselves to play a similar 4-3-3 type formation, allowing Herrera and (Vidal hopefully) to bomb forward, and have Shaw and Rafael as the wing outlets.  Mata/Januzaj can play the Coutinho role and Di Maria the Sterling. 

As much as it pains me to say I like the way Liverpool play currently.

124~~~
Yup - a Carrick or Vidal figure to slot in between the CBs can essentially transition the formation between 3-5-2 and 4-4-2 (diamond). What you then end up with is something like;

---------------DDG---------------
----Smalling -------- Evans-------
Di Maria ---- Carrick --------- Shaw
-------Herrera ---- Vidal?
-------------- Mata
--------- RVP ------ Rooney

Carrick can drop between the CBs when the WBs want to bomb forward, but when defending it can easily become a traditional back four with a packed midfield. Its an option anyway.

Back to topic, like I said I think Smalling has suffered a bit due to our current CMs not showing for the ball effectively enough. Countless times he would have it and visibly be looking for options, but nobody was making themselves available to recieve the ball.

125~~~
First point not entirely true. Jones is brilliant at the last ditch tackles and so on, but his decision making and his positioning is weaker than Smalling's. I would also say Smalling at set piece defending is fantastic.

Second point, Hamstrings are the weakest part of your legs. If you have damaged them before, it is so common for it to recur, no matter how much stretching you have done. It's the biggest nuisance of an injury to get.

126~~~
Injured again. Two games -TWO GAMES - into the new season and Evans and Smalling are back in the sick room. Makes a bit of a mockery of the assurances the medical staff gave van Gaal that the trio of these two plus Jones would not be plagued by injuries this season. 

The issue of the quality of any of these three has become secondary to their dreadful fitness records. We can't look to build a title winning side on the back of a Jones/Smalling/Evans defensive core. Particularly whilst also trying to adapt to van Gaals preferred system. They are not able to build understanding and gel as a cohesive unit because they are never fit enough to string a run of games together.

We now have Rojo but he will need time to bed in. Given the club knew Vidic was on his way and were not going to offer Ferdinand a new deal, it's pretty lame (pun intended) that we started out with three sick room season ticket holders as our senior central defenders.

127~~~
Missed him tonight. Those waxing lyrical about Evans' passing compared to Smalling got a bit of a realty check I would wager.

128~~~
Agreed. His passing hasn't been bad at all this season. Lazy narratives will always happen.

129~~~
The beast is back, hope he can stay injury free from now on.

130~~~
Glad he's back. Hope he can stay fit for an extended period of time.

131~~~
This.

132~~~
Raf Smalling Rojo Shaw is my first choice back 4 at present. 

Very quick defensive line will help us keep the high pressure.

133~~~
Blind's presence should help him with his with ball work. Always seemed to be available last week for the CBs.

134~~~
Him and Jones need a chance to form a partnership. Already the best 2 at the club.

135~~~
That's 5 years ago? I am talking about even more recently in 2012, or isnt it a huge coincidence that he looked very good when they were still here, since their decline/leave he has been proper average? When you play around better players, you soon can look better, the people next to you make it easier for you. For example, Munir El Haddadi, dunno if you have watched him but he is looking like a world beater right now, and thats not because he is the new Pele, its Neymar/Messi making it easy for him, they are putting him in good defenders, withdrawing defenders away from him, creating space for him, creating chances for him. Dunno how you could say Evans is our best defender, still think its a academy thing, nobody except for United fans rate him even a little bit.

136~~~
Agreed.

137~~~
I didn't say Evans is our best defender, I'm saying that you are using lazy narratives to buffer your argument like how the others players make him look better, he's overrated because he's an academy player etc etc. I'm hardly his biggest fan, he'd be my 3rd choice CB( haven't seen Rojo at CB, Blackett hasn't played enough games to warrant a ranking)  but I think he's done enough to show that he can cut the mustard here.

138~~~
Also I have no idea how/why people are saying Rojo should be first choice seeing as basically no one has seen him play at centre back.

139~~~
Agreed

140~~~
We lost our two main CB's, we needed strengthening at CB and spent big money on one in Rojo. I think it's a fair shout to have him starting a CB.

141~~~
Arsenal wants him in January

142~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> they can feck off. We need defenders too, because 3 of them cant stay injury free for 2 weeks

143~~~
Shouldn't let our best centre back go in January. But what worry me is he supported Arsenal when he was a kid.

144~~~
Best centre back? 

Slow and clumsy. Awful in possession.

145~~~
Smalling just showed Jones and Blackett in 88th mins how to not be clumsy or caused PK in penalty box

146~~~
Good turnout from him in a diabolical defensive performance.

147~~~
3rd goal was his fault. Just doesn't communicate with Blind and heads the ball away poorly. Which wasn't the first time he did both today.

148~~~
Not good enough at this level. Full stop!!!!

149~~~
He has zero composure and absolutely shits himself on the ball. His presense caused all sorts of panic in defense. Looks completely out of touch with modern football.

150~~~
Him and Jones have always been overrated on here.

151~~~
He's best at man marking, not organizing. When he's partnered with a 'car-crash' like Blackett, he'll suffer. When Blackett's gone, Smalling performed better. Coincidence?

152~~~
Awful performance today, I really worry every time the opposition get forward and attack us with Smalling at the back, He is so slow and positionally bad, He has not progressed at all in his time at the club, It doesn't help that he is not in a settled back line but I think the people who are hoping that Jones / Smalling is our CB pairing of the future are slightly deluded at this point

153~~~
He has actually regressed.

154~~~
Its becoming clear to me that Vidic carried these guys(Smalling,Jones and Evans).

155~~~
Yes he needs a leader alongside him. Does not make him a poor player, stick him in an experienced back four & he'll do very well.

156~~~
Now this where I disagree, It doesn't matter if you have Hummels, Benatia or even Vidic in his prime next to him, He is just too slow, Leicester were running at him with ease, And to be a top defender at United you need to be better than that. To think people used to say they were glad we got rid of Pique because he was slow, He is lightening in comparison to Smalling

157~~~
Smalling isn't slow, but you have your opinion & will only argue against facts <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

158~~~
He shits his big girly pants when he's in possession, it's pathetic. Can't have these wimps at CB.

159~~~
He has regressed since his first 2 seasons at United, would have surely been shipped out along with the other deadwoods if we were not lacking in defenders. Simply not United quality.

160~~~
Close to giving up on him. He's never been good on the ball, but he seemingly can't even defend anymore.

161~~~
Exactly. I said it last season and I'll say it again.

He's a midtable defender. Never wants the ball, always happy to clear the ball from crosses etc. Scared to his bare bones sometimes. Midtable quality.

162~~~
Smalling isn't slow. That isn't even an opinion, it verges on fact.

163~~~
Smalling is an excellent defender. His partner today was terrible and he tends to suffer when that's the case. He was weak for the third goal, though. With a run of games at centre half his defensive ability is always obvious and I expect him to improve with game time. Fitness is his biggest issue right now.

164~~~
And herein lies the problem. With a run of games, Smalling, Jones and Evans would be world beaters, I'd be surprised if any of them have finished 5 consecutive games not injured in the last 18 months.

165~~~
Him and Evans will both be sold in the summer and hopefully they will be replaced by 2 quality centre halves. He does the same shite over and over again, he always watches attackers outside his area and just lets them shoot at De Gea like wdf!! Same with Evans, they both just ball watch 99.9 percent of the game, it's gotten quite embarrassing now and is costing us quite a lot of points. Regressed badly in the last 18months.

166~~~
I know he's just back from injury but he's awful. Like with Anderson there comes a point when a player shows that he is not mentally strong enough to perform consistently and Smalling has hit that point by now where it's more than likely he will never make it here and we would be wise to plan without him

167~~~
usual knee jerk reactions...

168~~~
How on earth are they knee jerk? You obviously haven't seen the guy play for the last 12-15 months, he's been a complete liability.

But I guess he just needs a run of games to become world class doesn't he? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

169~~~
At centre back, he hasn't been a liability in the slightest. He was quite good there last season, sadly lacking at right full back. Take a look through his player thread and you'll get a decent indication of that. Defensively he's seldom poor. Today, coming on half way through the match and playing alongside a teenager that looked as if he didn't know what day it was certainly didn't help his cause.

170~~~
True, it's a problem.

171~~~
Smalling isn't slow? Jeez!!! Guess that's my cue to log off for tonight

172~~~
Log off then. He's kept up with some of the quickest attackers in the league. He's a big unit but he's rapid when he gets going and there is plenty of evidence for that.

173~~~
Smalling slow. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

174~~~
He's slow mentally that's for sure.

175~~~
Smalling isn't slow at all.  Neither is Evans or Jones, but I think Smalling wins in a footrace.

176~~~
Anyone claiming Smalling is slow hasn't really got a clue. 

He's not the quickest turner but how many times have you ever seen him outpaced? 

Therein is not where the problem lies.

Today he was shite on the ball and looked uncomfortable throughout - understandably so given the circumstances.

Still, we really needed someone to take responsibility and he sure didn't look like he was going to do it.

177~~~
Yup, I've been surprised by how much ground Smalling is able to cover when racing back to defend.  Must be the long strides.

178~~~
This is what concerns me more than anything about his performance today and Evans' at MK Dons. When younger defenders alongside him needed them to stand up and be counted they were found wanting. 

That's not to say they are completely to blame to those defeats. Of course they aren't. But this is their chance to step forward and cement their place as more than just a squad player. Neither are anywhere near doing that at the moment.

179~~~
This is just pathetic, everytime Smalling has a run and plays good I only see **, **, ** etc, now he has returned back from injury, played next to Blackett he is slow, pathetic, deadwood etc.

180~~~
I've thought he was average since he joined. 

I think he's clumsy and shaky as a defender. And a top club simply can't have an outfield player who couldn't hit a blue whale from five metres.

181~~~
As ever on the caf, most folk are set in their opinion and will not consider any other possibility.

Smalling didn't do a huge amount wrong today. Rojo and Blackett both had shockers, and Smalling was returning from injury and only had to come on to replace Evans - we don't even know if Smalling was 100% fit (obviously LVG didn't have him starting, this may have been purely tactical or may not have been).

This season he has been pretty solid at the back, in my opinion less error prone than Evans or Jones. His strength is not on the ball, this is true, but now that we have a shielding midfielder like Blind (Carrick would fill this role when back from injury as well) he should have an easy outlay.

Look at the other top teams, they aren't relying on their CBs to be playmakers. In a 3-5-2 you need the central CB to be comfortable bringing the ball out, but in a traditional back four there should be other players coming to receive the ball. This is what Gerrard does for Liverpool, Arteta for Arsenal, Barry or McCarthy for Everton, Matic/Ramires for Chelsea and Fernando/Fernandinho for City. We have for a long time lacked midfielders who will do this. We now have them and as the team settled we will see the improvement I hope.
Smalling has in the past been very composed under pressure and been a very capable ball player, I expect the current issues are purely mental. Nonetheless he would benefit from having another experienced CB alongside him rather than the likes of Rojo and Blackett.

182~~~
Once he hits top speed, Smalling is comfortably our fastest central defender. Hell, he'd be one of the fastest in the league.

However, his acceleration is fairly poor. His first 4 or 5 steps are relatively slow, and if he gets turned that can give the attacker enough of a headstart that Smalling can't make back up.

183~~~
He wasn't even in the picture for the fifth goal we conceded. Blackett and Rooney tracked back, resulting in Blackett's challenge. Smalling lacks position sense as a RB.

184~~~
Not really concerned with Smalling. Still think he is our best CB in terms of pure defending attributes. It was his first game back and there was chaos around him for the last 25 minutes.

185~~~
I never quite get the bashing of Smalling and it seems to happen all too often. People instantly blaming him for us conceding so many goals yesterday, but then I found out this:

Sure, we conceded a lot of goals, but I can't see why people jump the gun and blame him when he was probably the best of the back four, admittedly in a horror display. He cleared the ball and passed it from the back brilliantly, which is what we need. The main problems for me are the team not defending as a team and our individuals up front all trying to go for glory. This was always going to be an issue when you play three players who are pretty much out-and-out strikers wanting to take chances and drop a midfielder (even a very attack minded one). This led to us not keeping possession and now wearing out Leicester or the clock when we were in a commanding position. The ref didn't help, but we can't keep going on about that.

Will be happy to see a back four of Rafael, Smalling, Rojo, and Shaw against West Ham. But the rest of the team needs to be on song, and we need to only ever start one of Falcao or van Persie, I think that was always going to be the only option. Someone has to settle for the bench.

186~~~
If Smalling is our best CB, we're fooked.

187~~~
Can someone explain what all of the Smalling hate is coming from yesterday?

If it was Evans and Smalling playing yesterday and it was Smalling getting beat up at the end of the match .... I would understand. BUT, NONE of the goals were related to ANYTHING Chris Smalling did yesterday. If you want to say he wasn't controlling the box, well that can go to a few people.

188~~~
Feel the exact same.  As far as a pure defender goes, I think Smalling is our best.  Granted, I've yet to see Rojo play centrally.  It's only his ability on the ball that Smalling is poor and leaves plenty to be desired.  Then again, we're not Barcelona and I've always felt the most important attribute for a center-half is to be able to defend.  Understand that he might not be as vocal as some would like, but not sure where the hate is coming from.

189~~~
He's not that bad on the ball. He's certainly looked stronger than Evans, who was our 'ball-playing CB' just last year. He just gives the impression that he's terribly ditzy and clumsy due to being quite gangly and awkward looking. People state Blackett looks assured and assertive in his play, but all he has been doing is hoofing the ball. In fact, Smalling's passing accuracy percentage has been the highest of all our CB's. He is poor on his left foot though, and that's why he can sometimes look very weak moving with the ball.

190~~~
Smalling and Blind jumped for the same ball in the build-up to Cambiasso's goal. The lack of communication and leadership at the back is concerning.

191~~~
And entirely expected with what is effectively a completely new team.

192~~~
Our CB situation is pathetic, none of them are stepping up and its been that way for the last 2 years. Were Stacked with Injury prone, full of "potential" young British defenders. That's great and everything but were conceding goals like there's no tomorow. Jurys still out on Rojo, he's a wildcard. I rate jones the highest out of our cb's though. Wouldnt be fussed if we sold evans and smalling if we replaced with non injured quality cb's.

193~~~
No it isn't. Twice that happened. Blind had total control of the header and then Smalling comes steaming in. 

Smalling is an Arsenal like defender. He just gets bullied too much if he doesn't have Rio or Vidic next to him. He is nearly 25. The same age Vidic was when he was helping us lift the European cup. He's just not good enough. How long should we persist with these so called young centre backs?

194~~~
Blaming Evans and Smalling is the norm on the Caf these days. To me, the problem was Rojo at LB and Blackett at CB. They probably weren't communicating (language barrier, Blackett being young) and lack of understanding. Rojo and Smalling will have a better understanding as it will be more natural for Rojo in his position. Blackett was also a LB for the U21 so I guess that's where some of his problems are. Shaw will know when to tuck in and cover for Rojo. I'm not blaming Smalling until he is partnered with Rojo against West Ham and the same With Rojo having Shaw next to him.

195~~~
Smalling has his flaws but he certainly isn't slow.

196~~~
Smalling seems to be the new O'Shea/Brown/Fletcher on here, don't get all the hate! He didn't do much wrong.

197~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's amazing how someone can be so sure of their opinion that is just so, so <i>wrong</i>.

198~~~
How exactly should Smalling (and Jones) have stepped up when they were constantly played out of position, and not given much/any gametime at CB over the last two seasons?

199~~~
Smalling is our best defender with the most potential. He lacks the experience next to him. My biggest problem will all the defenders is bar Blackett absolutely terrible either on the ball or their passing. They all lack composure and I can see a couple of them being moved on in the summer......

200~~~
Just doesn't look up to it to me. Great in the air and a very natural defender but seems to shrink within himself. Dunno if he's up to it mentally.

201~~~
Playing at RB has definitely hindered his progression I think. If he had been played as a CB I think he would have been much more comfortable and advanced than he is at this stage.

202~~~
Not a big fan of him, but i didnt slate him or Rojo or Blackett for the game this weekend like some other guys on here. Hard to judge from the game. But what i dont like is that he looks so nervous. As soon as he was standing there on the touchline to come in for Evans, you could see how nervous he was. Totally uncorformtable with the situation and didnt look like he wanted to go on the field at that moment. 

I personally dont think he will establish himself here, but that is just my opinion. We bought him after a decent season with Fulham, and i still dont know what we saw in him to pay 12m for him. Jones is the only one i hope and expect to become the player we all need.

203~~~
I would give him a season in the team, playing centre defence each week, to prove himself. It is somewhat ridiculous that, after 4 seasons, we still don't have enough evidence to know whether he is good enough or not; all we really know is that he lacks the technique to be a competent right-back. If he starts 25+ games and doesn't impress then time to let him leave.

If the situation were different, I might be more patient but we currently have so many defenders with potential, defenders who need a season to adjust to the PL. LVG needs to know who he can trust and who he can't out of Smalling, Jones and Evans. Previous managers haven't helped him much in this department. Progress would be knowing that Jones is up to the task but Smalling isn't. Or vice-versa. Of course, ideally we'd discover a new partnership.

204~~~
Nail on head. This guy is typical of what Arsenal have and that fecks up everything whenever I think about our situation at the back.

One thing I have learned over the years is that the new generation of English center-backs is, for a majority, totally unreliable.

205~~~
has definitely stagnated. Wes Brown was twice the defender, in terms of actual defending.

Smalling's passing is also shocking.

Lets hope he digs deep for the rest of the season

206~~~
Yeah with 92% pass completion so far, his passing is shocking. 30 forward passes average per game.

207~~~
Stats don't tell the full story. He's as unadventurous as they come in that regard.

Again its somewhat to do with confidence.

Wes Brown was also injury prone but was far more capable of stepping in at the highest level without many games under his belt.

208~~~
Why would you want any center back to have adventurous passing if he isn't in the Maldini/Rio class of defender to recover if he loses the ball?

209~~~
We're no Barcelona, if we have one good ball playing defender next to him its oke. Smalling is brilliant when he has a run at CB.

210~~~
Some are blaming Smalling and Blackett, but I guess its LVG who wants a high line, which is clearly not possible with our defenders. Smalling is at far best when not in a high line, same for Jones. Remember a match vs WBA when we played a high line, it was terrible.

211~~~
It does seen like people are more concerned with our CBs passing and ability to play defence splitting through balls, rather than actual defending.

We may as well bring Scholes out of retirement again and put him at CB the way folks on here are talking.

212~~~
Personally, I am a fan of Smalling so naturally I agree. However, I think his lack of composure and gangly and cumbersome frame can present issues when it comes to his defensive work also. For instance, there were a few occasions when Smalling was battling with Ulloa or Nugent with a high ball and often he would win his aerial duels, but there were a few times when the forward is trying to bring the ball under control and Smalling would try to stab at it and intercept he would fail to get a foot to the ball and subsequently get turned easily where 3v3 situations would ensue.

He has many attributes in his favour that should make him a very good centre back and he is certainly the definition pf a natural defender. His pace, reading of the game, aerial prowess and 1v1 ability isn't in question. But his lack of composure and frame can also present itself in his defensive and off-the-ball work and not merely just on it.

213~~~
He is naturally a better defender than Evans imo but he has lost a lot of confidence since the last year when Fergie had him as aRB after he came back from injury and of course under Moyes.  His injury record is as bad as the rest too. Quite a few players in the last chance saloon imo.

214~~~
Doing the rounds on a few forums that he got injured again in training today. 
A thigh injury. 

Not sure how reliable or how true it is but, trying to find a credible source

215~~~
Daily Mail are reporting it too, dunno about anywhere else yet though.

216~~~
If thats true our defence is not in good shape.. So Rojo...

217~~~
If it's true then, I'm at a loss

218~~~
If true we're looking at a back four of Rafael, Blind, Rojo, and Shaw, with Fletcher in Blind's position.

West Ham will really fancy their chances.

219~~~
Blind in a back 2 has disaster written all over it, rather play Thorpe there if Smalling is actually out.

220~~~
fecking hell.

Smalling (and Evans) are made of glass and neither of them are actually good enough to justify the patience we've shown. I hope that if they (Smalling to a lesser extent) can't put a run of games together this season, they will be shipped out next summer.

221~~~
Say hello again to 3-5-2 lads <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Seriously though, this is an utter farce. Always the same three players

222~~~
Only a matter of time before all 3 of evans jones and smalling get injured in the same time..oh well...

223~~~
That would leave us with Rojo and uhm, Keane ? Carrick at CB? 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

224~~~
Keane is at Burnley I think.

225~~~
Keane is on loan.

The trio of them are a joke. If all three are let go within the next year, I wouldn't complain. Rio and Vidic aren't the reason that they haven't developed as much. They all just made of glass.

226~~~
Oh right, even better, cheers.

227~~~
Keane was moved out on loan on deadline day wasn't he? Or was that the other one?

If this is true then it's just ridiculous. Forget talent, relying on a group of 3 players that are injured on a regular basis is madness. 2 CBs need signing in the next winter and summer windows and we could do with moving Smalling and/or Evans on.

228~~~
I give up. Sell him.

229~~~
Atleast he's not getting injured 20 mins into the match. So hopefully we'd be able to plan what we going to do. 

Just have a worry because West Ham do have a few physical strikers.

230~~~
May as well play him anyways.....Not as if we're going to notice any difference

231~~~
No fecking way is he injured again...

We just can't catch a break with these glass-legged pricks.

232~~~
I fecking have enough of all of those injury prone CBs. Useless wankers!

233~~~
Not really sure why people are throwing personal insults around at Smalling et al. It's not like he's choosing to get injured.

234~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Silver linings and all eh?

I would wait for a more reliable source than Dailymail tbf. Are there any other reliable sources breaking out with this story?

235~~~
No, but finding ways to keep himself in better shape considering he's no mere rookie is not too much asked. We better start asking ourselves why our players struggle so much at taking care of themselves (diet, finding the right intensity, etc.) and avoid injuries.

236~~~
So is this injury legit? If so then we are in serious trouble this weekend.

237~~~
I honestly thought this was a joke when I heard the rumour earlier. I guess if he is injured again then Fletcher will have to play CB alongside Rojo.

238~~~
May aswell start the discussion early then so...

5 points from 6 games...Who would have thought that?!

239~~~
That would be a horrific disaster. Blind would have to play there (better option than Fletcher) but I have heard that he is not that great as a CB either.

240~~~
Maybe we'll hit them fast with 3 or 4 goals and then play 7-1-2 in the second half.

Blind and Rojo are both left footers, given LvG's nitpicky way I imagine he wouldn't play them together, plus Fletcher at CB would be better than at CM where he'd have to run and pass more.

241~~~
He'll get eaten physically.

242~~~
Who does that leave then, Fellaini?

243~~~
I don't know, is he even fit ? Not really looking forward to a match where West Ham will come to OT with some belief they'll win. I fecking hate West Ham and Allardyce even more.

244~~~
I think Fellaini declared himself fit last week, not sure if LvG agrees. West Ham are one of the worst sides we could be facing right now.

245~~~
Where are QPR when we need them <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> ?

246~~~
I'd have even settled for Newcastle or West Brom. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

247~~~
Wow this defensive issue is fast becoming an absolute detriment to our season.

248~~~
I don't know whether to laugh or cry. 

<img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

249~~~
Injured again FFS - Arsenal want him dont they? lets see if they will entertain a swap deal and bring home Welbz<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

250~~~
We knew that all our defenders were chronically injury prone in the summer. We should have acted on this and brought in reinforcements. 

In my opinion (and I said so at the time) this was higher priority than Falcao.

251~~~
I agree that the prority should have been to bring in a CB who does not get injured from looking at a football.
What is even the reasons for all this injuries.
The way they play? Do we rush them back to play to early? Is the training wrong?

We knew this, we knew they all would get injured, but we still just sat there.
In numbers we are covered at CB, but that does not help when non of them can play more than 3 weeks in a row(Bar maybe Blacket and Rojo, i dont know if they are injury phrone or not)

Carrick is going straight into the team as CB, when he returns from injury dossent he? Its going to be fantastic....

252~~~
I got slaughtered when I said that Rojo is not the answer for the defense. We don't need a defender with potential. We need a fecking Rio in his prime there whose able to paper the cracks and sort the defense single handidly.

253~~~
Any suggestions?

254~~~
Yes we needed a CB and I think they tried to sign CB's. Unfortunatley we also needed midfielders as well, which we have now addressed. He has given these men of glass their opportunity. Yet again all the CB's are injured, so in January Evans and Smalling have to be replaced. Jones, if they can get him to cut out the rash challenges might be salvaged. We all knew this was a big job and it appears Moyes pulled out of a deal for Garay last season, so that hasn't helped. One transfer window was never going to sort our problems, if we had signed CB's and were then not creating any scoring opportunities everyone would be moaning about the midfield. He can't win no matter what he does.

255~~~
Has anyone else heard the rumour, just mentioned by Jamie Jackson, on Talksport, that Smalling has picked up a thigh injury in training?

256~~~
Haven't heard it but it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.

257~~~
I'm just hoping that it's the usual ABU blather that Talkshite come out with.  But given the individual in question I reckon there could be some truth in it.

258~~~
Looks like he's injured according to a few on Twitter

259~~~
Let's wait until LVG confirms it. If it is true though, alongside Evans, Smalling and Jones we are in serious trouble. 

I guess attack will have to be the best form of defence.

260~~~
It was not meant as a criticism of Van Gaal, or Woodward for that matter. I think we did good this transfer window and we signed a guy who can play CB.

Its more an outburst of frustation of having to deal with these injuries year after year.

261~~~
IF true, have we got any one in the reserves? Thorpe? Can we recall Keane?

262~~~
We lost out on Benatia which is a shame.

Hummels is the obvious choice. Howedes would do very well with EPL. I also rate Subotic and Nastasic alot

263~~~
Thats it sell those three brittle cnuts ASAP and make sure they are triple bubble wrapped....feck

264~~~
Hummels tourettes strikes again. Better chance of Jesus coming

265~~~
I am aware that its difficult to lure him out of Germany. That's why I mentioned other options.

266~~~
Doubt it. Thorpe is the only half-plausible one in the U21s, I guess. None of first team defenders (youngsters I mean) who aren't on loan are natural CBs. Don't fancy Vermiljl or Janko in the middle. But maybe one of them can do a Blackett, who knows?

267~~~
Id go with this team

-----------------DDG---------------

Rafael------Thorpe---Rojo----Shaw

------------Blind----Carrick-----------

Valencia--------Herrera-----------Di Maria

------------------Rooney---------------------

268~~~
Im just annoyed that this wasnt dealt with in the summer. I suspect Giggsy bigged the remaining CB's up to LvG not telling him they were created out of paper mache and sticky back plastic

269~~~
Carrick still out remember. Why are people saying McNair over Thorpe on twitter?

270~~~
What exactly has Blackett done?

271~~~
Before LVG came along I thought Blackett's main position would be left back - but he's featured prominently for us in the middle.

272~~~
He probably got the chance because he was left footed. I don't know if Vermijl has played CB before, but even he was shifted across to play at RCB against MK Dons.

273~~~
If Carrick is out then bring Fletcher in or play Herrera in a deeper role with Rooney taking the AM role and Falcao as a lone striker. We need to bring some stability at the back. Once we have that, then we can start modifying the system slightly to make it more attacking minded.

Lets keep things simple. Stability first then once confidence start growing within our ranks then we can become more adventurous. I am sure that the likes of Herrera, Rooney and Di Maria can provide enough creativity and fire power to break West Ham.

274~~~
Stiff legs.....He's out due to stiff legs.....

A joke! An utter joke!

275~~~
Stiff legs for fecks sake <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what a waste of time he is.

276~~~
West Brom beat and outplayed us at OT last season <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

277~~~
He's going to look to the juice education to find a centre back.

278~~~
Worked out well in Milton Keynes

279~~~
I said for a centre back, not a team.

280~~~
Point still stands.

May as well play Smalling, even if he is injured. Not as if we'd notice the difference

281~~~
I wonder if he realises big opportunities are slipping through his fingers because of injuries.

282~~~
Probably, but what can he do?

283~~~
I wonder if he's pushing himself too hard to get back playing. Can do more harm than good.

284~~~
And make his injury worse.

285~~~
I wasn't overly serious btw....But, he's going to be injured again in a month so...

286~~~
Did Van Gaal actually say 'Smalling won't play on Saturday'?

Sounds like he just confirmed he was out of training, but that injury shouldn't keep him out.

287~~~
Not be such a pansy? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

288~~~
Smalling won't be here next summer I don't think. His limited technical ability and the fact he can't stay fit will see him go.

289~~~
Based on nothing but just an opinion, but I think he was rushed back. There is no way they would have envisaged using Smalling against Leicester. Although having said that they could have bought on Shaw and shifted Rojo and left Smalling....I don't know. Just unlucky I guess. Although something needs to happen with our three CBs, the fitness staff need to sort it out.

290~~~
I know, but they look worse this season. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

291~~~
Its not the fitness staff. Those three are just injury prone

292~~~
All I can do is laugh. 

Maybe he'd be a good player if it werent for all those injuries.

293~~~
He is a good player, but players need games to get up to their best. Therein lies the problem

294~~~
I just read the quotes and am thinking the same as you...

295~~~
I agree, when he started for us I said to myself he's gonna be very good, and I think he has it all to be a good CB, but unfortunately him playing out of position a lot and all the injuries didnt do him any good.

296~~~
Did he not say he only had one fit CB in Rojo?

297~~~
Overrated since day 1. He is not good enough for United. Neither is Evans. Jones has potential, but needs to play with his head a bit too.

298~~~
Finally a United fan waking up - us neutrals have been trying to tell you all this for ages.

299~~~
I have been awake for a long time.

300~~~
Go to sleep, you're drunk

Smalling is a very good out and out CB. He'd obviously look better next to a world class CB leading the defence next to him however

301~~~
He's clearly a better defender than Jones and Evans. Although Jones was looking better this season. They just need to stay fit. It's infuriating.

302~~~
All three are very good defenders, but each has their issues.

Evans can be very, very good alongside an authoritative partner but is hopeless at leading a defence. So he'll forever be a squad player at best. And of course, he's preposterously injury prone.

Smalling is the best pure defender at the club. He's a goliath in the air, but has limited technical ability and is, of course, injury prone.

Jones has so much potential it's ridiculous. It's easy to forget that he is just 22. Which is very young for a center back. He has played a variety of positions for us already and shown so much. He can definitely become world class, he just has to deal with (a) being injury prone due to rash challenges (b) using his head more, which will come with experience.

Evans should've been the natural successor to Ferdinand and Vidic should never have been allowed to leave. This season we'd be starting with Vidic and Evans at the back which I feel would have been the amongst the best pairings in the league. Over the next couple of seasons, Jones would have taken over Evans position and we'd have brought in an experienced replacement for Vidic.

Getting rid of Ferdinand, Vidic and Evra in one go was suicide. They had all declined significantly, but people underestimate the value of experience. It has a multiplying and calming effect on those around them.

As it stands now, Smalling and Jones is probably the best pairing we have at the club. I don't trust Evans at all unless he is with someone more experienced (which is transformative for him). Rojo is a completely unknown quantity at centre back. I do know I am not in a hurry to see him at left back again after the Leicester debacle.

Point is, everything has to go in context. Just because these players don't look too clever right now doesn't mean they aren't good or don't have value. Football is so often about partnerships rather than individuals, about systems rather than talent. Ferdinand and Vidic were excellent individual players but their real strength lay as a duo. Bruce and Pallister are an even better example of this. Two players who never particularly shone individually (Bruce was never even capped - unjustly IMO) but as a pairing they were amazing. 

We've had a lot of incredible strikers at the club, but have we ever had a better pairing than Yorke and Cole? We've certainly had better individuals. Veron was one of the most talented players to play for United in the last 25 years, but he could never strike up a proper understand with his midfield partners and was ultimately deemed surplus to requirements. Yet, who could argue that he wouldn't have walked into our team at any point in the last 5 years and instantly improved it? 

With the right partner and game time, I believe someone like Jones could go on to become one of our most distinguished defenders. His performances, like many others, have to be put into context of circumstance, experience and age.

303~~~
Will keane also talking about Chris Smalling in training, as Pereira did and as Welbz did, they've all said he is the toughest to play against in training.

304~~~
Evans stays injured and keeps getting chances at United

305~~~
Shame it's not the same during a proper game <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

306~~~
It basically is.

307~~~
How often do you see people get past him one on one? I almost laughed out loud once when Ribery were up against him one on one. The commentator went, "and now Ribery turns on his afterburners and, oh, Smalling has some pace too." He does't overcommit himself and doesn't make silly and unnecessary sliding tackles. He's also very strong so rarely gets outmuscled by strong opponents - Lukaku got nothing from him, but he toyed with both Jones and Evans in the same match.

308~~~
Chill guys, was more of a funny comment since he's not in his best form this season. I'm a Smalling fan myself actually

309~~~
Agree with all this. He is a physical beast. He needs to get a run with no injuries and try and improve the technical side of his game. I still believe it is Smalling ** though.

310~~~
Our least error prone defender. I think he is better than Jones who is simply too crazy to be a top defender at this point. Smalling is steady and despite the poor passing, should be a starter once fit.

311~~~
As a defender, he's comfortably better than Jones. Problem is, he basically shits himself anytime he has the ball.

312~~~
In theory, this should improve under van Gaal.

313~~~
Hopefully, he has to be fit though otherwise there's nothing anyone can do with him.

314~~~
Agreed. I still think he could be our best defender

315~~~
If fit, Smalling needs to play against Chelsea on Sunday. Don't care about his ball playing ability, need someone who can defend against the Chelsea forward line, especially Costa. Put Jones in there, and he will cost United points on Sunday.

316~~~
I still reckon Jones - Smalling could be seriously good. Nemanja wasn't the best at shifting the ball from the back, Rio had that duty and I can't see why it wont work for Smalling and Jones as well. Anyone got stats on the games these two have played together? I can't see it being that many, and that is the crux of the problem.

317~~~
I don't even think his composure on the ball (which is bad and clearly his weakest issue) is that much worse than Jones', anyway. I've always rated Smalling much higher and feel he should be our starting defender as he is our best.

318~~~
Is he fit yet, or not? I saw him on the training pics

319~~~
He must start on Sunday if he is fit. Chelsea are a bunch of giants, I would bring him into the defence and Fellaini into the midfield. We may really struggle with set-pieces otherwise.

320~~~
Agreed. We really lack height.

321~~~
Beast, rugby tackle on Ivanovic was a bit naughty, but that's the sort of thing Mourinho's centrebacks have been getting away for years with

322~~~
I could've sworn Ivanovic was manhandling him as well.

323~~~
Ivanovic gets away with that kinda shit everytime I watch him. Good defending.

324~~~
Covering for a dodgy partner, he's done very well like usual. He's even played some very nice passes into Van Persie's feet which is a bit surprising

It could have been a penalty on Ivanovic, although Rojo was doing exactly the same thing on his man right next to him. It could be argued that its the type of defending we havent been doing enough of without Vidic. Well in that instance both were being quite rough and luckily we got away with it

325~~~
He's our best defender, just needs to improve when he's on the ball.

326~~~
Said if before, and I'll keep on saying it, he's better then Jones.

327~~~
He handled the situation vs Willian brilliantly and has been very sharp, as soon as Drogba gets the ball he closes him down, this is the Smalling I like to see.

328~~~
Solid so far but lets see how he gets on in the second half. Thought Rojo was definitely the weaker of the two and more mistake prone. The aerial battle is Smallings bread and butter so going up against drugba might actually be better than say an aguero.

329~~~
Great performance by him.

Chelsea and Jamie Carragher can f'ck off about that incident. John Terry has made a career out of doing that and they made him club and country captain.

330~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sD68fuR9eH8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

If anyone remembers this, I recall Drogba doing the exact same thing to Wes Brown a few years back to let Terry score

331~~~
Quite pleased with how he's played.

332~~~
He never loses those duels against fast players - on a stretch he always catches them. Plus, his anticipation and reading of the game in those one on ones is sensational. Passing is much, much better today.

333~~~
Has the technique of a pub player

334~~~
I know he gets hate, but has he ever actually looked bad as a centre back at United.

We know he's not very good on the ball, but as a defender he's the best we've got and proven it in difficult situations. If only he could stay fit.

335~~~
He was very good on the ball today.

336~~~
With his passing today that seems a little out of place. He had some really sweet long range passes.

Also, what's with the hate? He was our best player today! Brilliant defensively and saved our ass a couple of times.

337~~~
Excellent game.

338~~~
As usual the fickle caf can change its mind on a player faster than Gerrard goes to ground when an opponent is within 10 meters.

In Smallings first season at the club he was heralded as the new Rio Ferdinand - a "Rolls Royce" of a defender.
Suddenly (and just to throw it out there - after having inconsistent gametime and being played out of position) he apparently has the technique of a pub player and we should be selling him.

A good performance today and he is our best defender again.

I am in the pro-Smalling camp. I think he and Jones complement each other well and should be our first choice partnership (as well as Englands, in a year or two). The both of them need regular gametime in their natural position (and to stay fit) however.

339~~~
MOTM in my opinion, and looked like a real leader at the back. He was incredibly vocal and organized the defence. Encouraging performance.

340~~~
Agreed. The only mistake I can remember he has made that cost us a goal was the title decider against City. Hasn't let us down in any big games that he has played.

341~~~
He can't pass for shit. But he's on another level defensively from Jones.

342~~~
Fairly solid defensively today. Looked more reliable than Rojo.

343~~~
Again, his passing today was very good - even sublime at times. So he can pass... people judge him too much from him playing at RB, which admittedly he doesn't have the close control to do well.

344~~~
He's okay when you give him 40 yards of space, but apply any pressure to him and he's terrible on the ball. Just smashes it.

345~~~
Our best defender by a mile. 

Sure he could be more composed on the ball, but defending is what counts first.

346~~~
Smalling >Jones

feck bringing the ball from the back. We need people who can defend.

347~~~
I agree with you on this, he has an awkward body position on the ball and that seems to give a false impression of his technique, now I'm not saying he's pirlo but he played some beautiful passes today.

348~~~
The best for a high line.

349~~~
Did well today, needs to keep these performances up.

350~~~
I noticed he played a couple of brilliant passes today which was a surprise. Good performance from him.

351~~~
Very good I thought. His strength and pace were exactly what we needed against Drogba and Hazard. Rojo made more mistakes than him out there but Smalling was alert to cover them up. His passing from the back was good today as well. He wasn't resorting to the aimless hoofing we seen from him in the past. Encouraging display, but just like our other defenders he is potentially brilliant if he stays fit.

352~~~
Just stay fit Chris. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

353~~~
Someone has formed their opinion, so no point in arguing.

354~~~
Hope he shut a few of his doubters wrong today
Thought he was our best defender overall

355~~~
He'd be my first defender on the teamsheet! I just don't think he's very good on the ball.

356~~~
It's just one big joke, Smalling was good on the ball today and this is not the first time, its pathetic.

357~~~
It takes very little to get excited by him only for him to get injured the next week and disappoints you.

358~~~
I think he's our best defender to be fair to him. Probably my man of the match, looked unfazed today. He had a strong and intelligent display, hopefully he can get better and kick on from here.

359~~~
I'm pleased with him, but ultimately this is what reality is.

360~~~
He just doesn't get beaten in 1v1 situations. I had the utmost confidence in him when Willian was running at him, as you rarely see him beaten and he has pace in abundance for a centre back.

He needs to start, as he's our best centre back and compliments Jones and Rojo far better than the two compliment each other.

361~~~

362~~~
I've always favoured Jones to partner Rojo, but that performance makes me want Smalling to be given a run of appearances. Any sort of consistency has to help. As long as some sort of CB partnership is formed.

363~~~
I'm really hoping his performance today will move him above Jones in the pecking order.

I honesty reckon we'd have lost with Jones at the back today.

364~~~
Van Gaal likes one left footed centre half, but if Smalling continues this form and Rojo keeps playing unstable, I can see Smalling with Jones or Evans making a very good pair.

Really enjoyed Smalling today.

365~~~
Again...

#SmallingPlusOne

366~~~
I thought he was excellent. If he could pass and probably more importantly stay fit we'd have no problems.

367~~~
Good game today. No issue with his passing.

368~~~
He is good when he has to defend except sometimes set piece marking and clumsy moments. Problem is when he has to pass and tbf he didn't have to do much of that in posession today or was pressed that much.

369~~~
Best CB today. And, as compared to Evans and Jones, was actually available to play.

370~~~
pick him above Jones please.

371~~~
Still shits himself when he has to take the initiative and carry it forward or pass it out but some of his last ditch defending saved us so fair play to him.

372~~~
I keep saying it, when it comes to pure defending, he's better than Jones. But Jones flies into tackle and charges about, so, people seem to rate him more. Also he passed the ball quite well [by his own standard] today. Injuries though remains a problem, I won't be surprised if he has picked up a niggle in this game, and Jones is back in next week, and the cycle continues <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

373~~~
And you like "whats up with those crappy displays dude". That was more like it.

374~~~
I still think Jones and Smalling could be a great centre back partnership if, by some miracle, they both manage to stay off the treatment table long enough to play matches together.

375~~~
Proves yet again how he is the best CB we have.

376~~~
Yeah, agreed actually. They complement each other decently and have a previous understanding too.

But cannot stay fit for long enough. Plus Van Gaal has a leftie rightie fetish now.

377~~~
He'd be great in a partnership with Evans if both could stay fit.

378~~~
He had a really good game today also I thought he looked quite composed going forward and made good low passes. He actually looked a class above Rojos.

379~~~
This is the issue though, a very brittle partnership.

380~~~
A couple of dodgy clearances to begin with but was more composed as the game went on, hope he manages to cement a place in the side and build a partnership with Rojo.

381~~~
It’s really impressive that he seems like one of those players who can start a game after a long absence and give a good shift. At the moment he’s the only CB that I’m confident with. Rojo scares the shite out of me.

382~~~
Good performance, he is much calmer than Jones and I thought he really shored things up in that back 4.

383~~~
He's an excellent defender just not a great footballer. Doesn't enjoy having the ball one bit and makes some gash clearances. However it's a small price to play when he defends really well so hopefully more of the same. Just desperately needs to stay fit.

384~~~
He is a great defender who still has more to show at United. People saying that we should sell him off when he gets injured should think again, at the very least he's very capable backup in CB.

Same goes for Jones, although I think Smalling's the better defender.

385~~~
We should sign Shawcross though because he is ex united and can play every game!

386~~~
I'm usually quite critical of him because I think his passing is often atrocious  for someone who plays at such a big club. He was good today though. No complaints.

387~~~
Smalling has good game,
But its just matter time he will injure again.

388~~~
Very good performance. A little rusty at times but you can't blame him for that.

389~~~
Quality game and an intelligent player. That crossfield ball to Di Maria(?) in the second half was class. His distribution all round was much improved compared to previous games.

390~~~
Sarcasm?

391~~~
There was one moment towards the end where he had the ball and was obviously looking for a pass, and I sighed and said, "don't try it Chris, just knock it short to someone who can actually find a team-mate with a pass"... and then he pinged a perfect crossfield ball straight to Di Maria's feet.

392~~~
We should go for Crouch as well, Robin's passed it.

393~~~
Please don't get injured, beast of a cb. Hope he gets an extended run in the team.

394~~~
This performance was brilliant but it will only do him any good if he can, somehow, make himself available for the next fifteen before breaking down again. This is a great opportunity for one of him, Jones and Evans because if they stay fit and perform to standard (who am I kidding) then there is a starting role waiting to be grabbed before we sign another centre back.

395~~~
He was great. Even his passing wasn't bad. There was a long diagonal ball he hit to Shaw that was sweet (I think it was Smalling anyway). Handled the 1v1 with Willian really well too and I was actually quite calm when I saw it was Smalling who was defending it. He's our best defender in the CB position. I'd start with him consistently. (please don't get injured).

396~~~
Once again, Smalling + 1 is the way forward. As I've said before he mirrors Rio in his ability to spot danger and position himself, but lacks the ability to calmly bring the ball out from the back. In that sense he's similar to Vidic. On the otherhand, Jones isn't as tactically aware as Smalling but is a no-nonsense all action defender like Vida, but with the ball playing ability of Rio. I'm sure if these two become injury free for a prolonged period and play together, they'll form a great partnership.

397~~~
I hope this performance can convince LvG to not give any thought of selling Smalling. 

I know LvG has million times more knowledge on judging players talent and potential than me, but I'd seriously questioning his management if he gives up on Smalling. 

Yeah, just another Smalling 'silly fanboy' speaking here.

398~~~
The thought of selling him to Arsenal, a la Welbeck, and watch him develop into one of the finest centre-backs in football, makes me feel ill.

Should get a run now having snuffed out the league's best team.

399~~~
I thought he'd be a complete disaster and Rojo and Rafael would have to bail him out. Glad to be wrong.

400~~~
His distribution was excellent against Chelsea. Maybe he's finally getting better with that.

401~~~
Ditto Evans and Jones.

402~~~
His performance today was excellent, can't remember him making any mistake at all. Great positioning, calm on the ball and some really good passes from the back, which surprised me most. 

He looks like our most natural CB. Not the most talented, but the most natural ...

403~~~
Needs to actually stay fit now. Until he can do that, then he'll get nowhere.

404~~~
He still scares the shit out of me, it's just that Rojo is even worse.

405~~~
I want to believe

So don't get yourself fecking injured again please.

406~~~
He looked pretty good, give him a run of matches and I'm sure he'll be the same player that awed us in his first year.

407~~~
You've done it now...

408~~~
Brilliant today. Our best centre half option at this moment in time.

409~~~
His pace and size really is hard to beat.

When Willian was going through 1 on 1 everybody feared the worst; but he just glided over and intercepted like Rio in his prime.

How anybody can say he isn't our best defender I have no idea.

410~~~
I still don't understand how Jones is more highly rated tbh.

411~~~
He's virtually unbeatable in a flat-out one-on-one. Welbeck mentioned this in an interview, also. I remember in pre-season (I know) but Sterling tried to take him with a burst of pace on the edge of the box but Smalling was more than quick enough and stopped it. I've said it so many times, but I don't think there's a CB in the league better at defending in a single one-on-one situtation against a forward.

412~~~
He looks so clumsy and nervy on the ball, but he is a talented defender. Its the same as with Jones, can he stay fit? He's a beast physically and 1 on 1 defensively he is quality. Just needs to be calmer when he has the ball, though there was nothing wrong with it today. He just doesn't instill confidence when passing it around.

413~~~
Anyone else think that we are much more solid and composed with Smalling in the side? Rio esque today. 
I think a lot of the criticism he got in the past was based on performances at right back, where he is quite simply tripe. 
Hopefully we keep the same side with Rooney involved and falcao in for januzaj!

414~~~
Feel much more comfortable with him defensively than with Jonesy in the side to be honest. Jones needs to calm the feck down <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

415~~~
I've always thought that the critisisms against him and especially his ability on the ball have been slightly ott. I can't remember the last time he was really poor for us. And I think his ability on the ball, while limited, has never been as bad as the general conception of it.

416~~~
Yep, the right back stint really left a sour memory to a lot of people, which was completely unfair really. Just because he has the physical attributes, it doesn't mean he will be good there. 

If he can just stay fit for a season it would make him so much more confident and better.

417~~~
Agreed. He played an absolute peach of a pass to Di Maria in the game, his issues are more composure and weak foot based, not on his actual passing ability.

418~~~
Smalling was brilliant today. Hopefully he can stay fit for a few more games so that we can go on a decent run.

419~~~
I've always thought he was very good but I won't let one good game convince me that he's our CB solution. If he can string 10+ fit and competent games together; Hallelujah, I'm a believer.

420~~~
When Willian went through, did anyone think that Smalling <i>wasn't</i> going to catch him?

421~~~
He simply needs to stay fit, which is obviously easier said than done.

As a pure defender he's fantastic, his passing and composure on the ball may be lacking but in terms of positioning and tackling and anticipation he's really good.

422~~~
Smalling tends to get bullied against lesser opposition who often have monster forwards. Funnily enough he seems to raise his game for bigger games. He needs to shout more. He needs to be a little more aggressive. But whether he can find consistency and stay fit remains to be seen

423~~~
I think he played two or three really penetrating balls to the front players today. Terrific performance defensively as well, other than the Ivanovic incident.

424~~~
His distribution was top notch against Chelsea. He didn't look clumsy even once. I remember an excellent long ball he played to Shaw right on the money. I think he'll build from this. We'll need a repeat performance against City

425~~~
Gave Rojo a right rollicking after he lost the ball to Willian for the one on one he saved.

426~~~
Yea but lets not forget missing Costa. So while it was a good game today was not the test it could be... Lets hope its the start of him being confident enough to play to his full potential for when Costa is there.

Purely on defending and natural positioning. I might argue McNair is more naturally gifted. But he was good today so lets not split hairs. Had a bumpy ride of late deserves his day in the sun. I'm happy for him

Totally agree with this but about all our defenders in general. They are only human and were severely criticized for the shambolic defending we have seen over the pat few months. All coming form mounting pressure of many bad displays where none of them shone and it becomes a vicious circle. They are at times too afraid to play ball in fear of messing up and being the one on the back page ridiculed from all sides. If we have any luck at all. Some of them will get a good run in the team and give us the solidity we know is there but could never just grasp it. A clean bill of health for a four or five games and we might get things even better.

427~~~
As I've said since his first season: give him 1 or 2 full seasons without any serious injuries, in the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>CB position</b>(!)</span>, and we have one of the best centerbacks in the world. I've always believed in Smalling, and I'll continue to do so.

Having said that, it's hopeless to improve when you're injured 50% of the time...

428~~~
Yeah, like I said, there was nothing wrong with it today at all, he just comes across as clumsy when he has the ball at his feet. More of just the feeling I get when he has the ball rather then anything.

429~~~
For me, he's comfortably better than Jones. I wouldn't even contemplate selling him, despite his injury record when Evans and Jones are both poor on that regard also and Smalling is our most naturally gifted defender with further scope for improvement.

430~~~
Immense today, but nothing we haven't already seen from him.

Needs to stay fit. If he wasn't so injury prone who knows how big a player for us he might have been by now?

431~~~
Forgot about him. I'd like to see them to get a run together. Both are just natural defenders with good heading, and might reduce that '10 cm' LvG talked about. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

432~~~
Soild game from him today, bar the wrestling in the box that the commentators kept harping on about.

Would really like to see him go the rest of the season injury free and show what he can do over a long period of time. He has always been the best defensivily of the trio, but was a bit lacking on the ball compared to them (why he was a horrible RB most of the time).

433~~~
Might be at the other end he meant....

434~~~
Because it's natural for people to rate a player who puts himself about more. Smalling is clearly the better defender, I don't have to worry about him being out of position anytime he plays, something Jones is guilty of all the time.

435~~~
I think it has to do with Phil Jones' more aggressive, no nonsense nature, he's the one who's going to produce the hard crunching tackles not Smalling, and therefore it becomes easier for people to identify that he's doing something. Where as Smalling is more of an interceptor, that reads the game and breaks up play and this is a lot more underrated, similarly to Carrick & Blind and this is something that is harder to identify in the heat of the moment, it's only really praised afterwards.
Plus like someone said - his RB days have erased a lot of people's memory of him when he first came here and partnered Vida/Evans and played excellently.

I've said before that Smalling is our best defender, and against a very good Chelsea side i'm glad he's reminded people of his quality.

436~~~
I have always said that he's our best defender. He was great yesterday, even his passing was good. Unlike Jones, he knows how to physically impose himself. Let's just hope he stays fit for gods sake!

437~~~
Was made easy for him but was a great piece of defending when he went one on one with Willian.

438~~~
There's more to it than that. Jones is much better on the ball too.

439~~~
Well said, I agree. Smalling is the pro-active guy, doing enough to prevent danger with his positioning and reading of the game (not world class in that matter, sure, but ahead of the rest of our CBs). Jones is reactive, the “last ditch” tackle guy.

At this point I can see a solid defence build around Smalling in the middle, I really rate him. Guys like Jones are needed too, but I don’t trust him (and Rojo).  

Jones is much better at bringing the ball out of the defence though.

440~~~
True that, but he does feck up a lot more. When Blind positions himself so close to the centre backs as he does, Smalling can easily find an output these days. I have to admit though, that every time Rojo gave the ball to Smalling, I was kind of like thinking "now why would you go and do THAT?". Funny thing is, Smalling's passing appeared better than that of Rojo, which was supposedly Rojo's biggest asset, along with his pace, I think.

441~~~
Smalling's better at those last ditch tackles as well, he just doesn't have to pull them off as often. He's a cleaner tackler than Jones or anyone else at the club. How many penalties has he given away for us? I can only remember the one at Stamford Bridge in his first season for a handball.

442~~~
So much confirmation bias with smalling. He was really solid and passed the ball v well. Yet all I read is how he was shaky in defense and terrible in the ball. He's a quality centre half. Just needs to stay fit

443~~~
Distribution from the back wasn't great yesterday, especially in the second half and Smalling was definitely one of the culprits for that.

444~~~
Distribution can suck on one. We didn't concede a goal as brainless as the second we conceded against West Brom and that is largely down to Smalling's ability to defend. If people seriously want us to finish inside the top four then the distribution conversation should be well down the list of complaints. Smalling is the best defender we've got and he proved that again yesterday. Fitness is the main issue going forward.

445~~~
I thought his distribution was much better yesterday especially in the second half. In the first, he kept in relatively simple, using Rojo or Rafael. In the second, he completed an excellent cross field ball, and some great lofted ball's into Fellaini and RvP that were much more than hoof's into the striker.

446~~~
Never shies away from a physical battle either.

447~~~
This.

United played the best side in the Premier League yesterday and we produced our best defensive performance by far. I thought that Rojo/Jones would have been our best central defensive partnership however, I stand corrected and admit I was wrong. Smalling/Rojo were immense. The whole back four produced some amazing moments and some great tackles and Shaw looked really good going forward. There was only one moment where I got nervous about conceding a goal when Willian was running through on goal and Smalling tackled him and passed the ball back to De Gea. 

LvG has found his back four now and should be reasonably happy with it.

448~~~
Yes, but that's only because Smalling is really bad on the ball.

449~~~
Is Jones actually good on the ball? Seems to me that all he does is pick the ball up and try to run through any player that comes in his way. I'd say when Smalling first joined he looked a lot more composed on the ball until we ruined his confidence by playing him at RB.

450~~~
I don't see Smalling's distribution to be that bad anyway. Sometimes his clearances can skew out for a throw in, but his forward passing always looks very good. Made some very sharp forward passes to the attackers yesterday. Even though his RB performances were a bit guff last season (and before), I think it's improved his dribbling, as he looks decent at bringing the ball out from the back into the midfield.

His pass completion % was very high considering the amount of passes he made and the amount of clearances he needed to get away too.

He's damn quick too, for a lad as big as he is.

451~~~
I agree with the statement that Smalling is better than Jones. SAF said he loved to defend. Jones is Mr Last Ditch, Smalling thinks beforehand and positions himself accordingly. Jones gets injured more often from his "car-crash" approach. Screw ball distribution - Smalling and Rojo passed between them until the Chelsea players came out, then Blind made himself available for a 10 yard pass. Blind received and away we went. I'd rather have a good defender who can actually defend first and foremost, than a "ball-playing centre-back". One swallow and all that - Smalling played really well yesterday, better than Rojo, who for me, the jury's still out. He needs more time to settle in.

452~~~
Smalling did well. 

Rojo made at least two mistakes which could very easily have led to goals. Hardly a stellar performance from him.

453~~~
It was definitely Smalling's best performance so far this season yesterday. Even on the ball he didn't look as full of panic as he usually does. There's no doubting his defensive capabilities and he rarely seems to get beaten one-on-one, even by the likes of Hazard.

It must be said though, that was an absolute stone-wall penalty on Ivanovic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. As long as he doesn't get into the habit of wrestling people to the ground in the box, I'm all for the occassional sneaky clothes-line if he gets away with it...

454~~~
Smalling has always been a competent, strong CB. I actually think he can become a world class CB if played in his best position consistently.

He has never been a RB and it has stunted his development. Keep him and Jones at CB and see how good they can become.

455~~~
Thought he was brilliant yesterday.

456~~~
Aren't you the least happy that Smalling was in fact able to wrestle Ivanovic into the ground? I'm proud of the lad <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

457~~~
Smalling and Rojo I think compliment each other well. Would like to see the pairing continue. Until one falls unfit or gets tired. 

Didnt think either were faultless yesterday. But I like both of them.

458~~~
LOL. Yeah, that is a big improvement for me. Due to his skinny stature, I've always thought he was liable to be bullied a bit. Taking down Ivanovic is definitely a good sign for me that he's building up the needed strength.

459~~~
me too, i've been saying this since we bought Rojo. Smalling and Rojo should be our CB pairing and they would complement each others style. If they can stay fit a form a partnership we will be solid. Both are good at defending, strong and are 2 fastest CB, we wont be beaten for pace. Rojo does need to settle in a bit more and next to a composed Smalling will bring the best out of him. Jones should be back up to the pair and Blackett and McNair as cover. As for Evans i think its time for him to find a new club.

460~~~
I've always been a massive Smalling fan - he was colossal in his first season here. If he can just stay clear of injuries now..

461~~~
First off I really rate Smalling and when he first came, for me he didnt put a foot wrong and was a huge surprise. Think Smalling has done what a few players do though when moving to a big club. Really concentrate and put over 100% in and it shows performances are good above expected and they continue to develop and they start to feel they are supposed to play at that level. When they feel comfortable that they can play at that level they take their foot off, and their performances slip. Coincide that with a few injuries due to requirements to play and train harder and increased pressure of starting 11 at a top club. This is what I believe happened to Smalling and to some extent Jones.

I think now its time for Smalling and he'd realise that now after injuries etc that he needs to get back to basics and at the moment has a real chance of cementing himself permanently in our starting 11.

462~~~
He was fantastic when Willian got the ball after the Rojo mistake. Really focussed, didn't panic and dealt with it perfectly - didn't jump in, stepped off him and let him advance while waiting for the right moment to break the attack up.

463~~~
He was quite yesterday, certainly one of the best centre-back performances from our players this year (though it's not saying much). Should keep his place and hopefully can get a run without injuries. He is our most solid defender, and I think if he got a run of games his touch/passing would get sharper too.

464~~~
If there is anybody to bring composure to our backline, I think Smalling is the one player who can do that.  He is calm in high pressure situations and his ability to communicate with other players and keep the backs organized is underrated.  He is not particularly great with the ball, but views of this might be exaggerated by all of the time he spent at RB, where Rafael is supposed to play as a pivot.  Smalling is actually pretty decent with the ball as a CB, where it's more about making the safer pass to start the buildup.

I think we may have hit upon our CB pairing yesterday.  Rojo can be sloppy in his play but he is generally OK and should be given a fair amount of time to settle into the team.  I already predicted on this board that Smalling, Jones, and Evans would be gone in a year or two because of their injury problems but if there is anybody on the current squad to replace some of Rio or Vidic's leadership (it is never going to be replaced completely), Smalling is the guy to do it.

465~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wmp0NHonLuk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Ignore the rest of the video which is probably shit and pointless for a defender, but at the start you can tell Owen rates pretty highly as a defender. Owen's someone who's been around and up against some good defenders in his time.

466~~~
The defence looked much better yesterday with Smalling there.  If he can keep fit he is a better centre back than the others.

467~~~
He isn't that good on the ball at all IMO and certainly not 'much better' than Smalling. You constantly see him dally in possession, even when he has acres of space to bring the ball forward or has several passing options around him. A better distributor yes, but someone who lacks in composure in possession just as much as Smalling does anyway. And Smalling is comfortably the better defender too.

468~~~
Not helped by Rojo's<i> Rio Hoof </i>(Aimless long balls)

469~~~
Sadly there is not much chance of that happening.

I would say Smalling and Jones are on the same level, neither are good enough to be automatic first choice and they would both have to go through an amazing metamorphosis to become the world class CB's we all want them to be.

470~~~
What a stupid little boy he is.

I hope he never plays for this club again.

471~~~
What the feck <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

472~~~
Absolute moron. fecking dick.

473~~~
I can't forgive him for that.

474~~~
Had enough of him. Two of the stupidest yellows I've ever seen.

475~~~
Idiot. The first booking was completely pointless, the second completely stupid. Dumb fecking cnut.

476~~~
Hes on a card for doing something equally stupid and then lunges in like that? So stupid its untrue

477~~~
That first yellow was the most retarded thing I have ever seen anyone do on a football pitch.

478~~~
Face it no matter what we have at the back they are all shit. Gut the lot of them.

479~~~
So stupid. Shouldn't be playing for us.

480~~~
Get rid of this piece of junk.

481~~~
Very stupid from him. I still hold hope that he's going to deliver on his potential, but it continues to look more and more unlikely as time goes on.

482~~~
I still have hope for Jones and Evans. Smalling i've never been confident over.

483~~~
Idiot.

To be fair to him though, the cretins in front of him (Valencia and Fellaini) were at fault as well.

484~~~
I don't believe there were rumours that Wenger wants him.

485~~~
About as clever as he looks. And an awful footballer too.

486~~~
One word, STUPID.

487~~~
Calm down people. I'm sure he regrets it more than any of you

488~~~
It was f*ucking inexcusable and there is absolutely no defending him. Well done, Smallinh. Idiot.

489~~~
Is there really a rule that forbids standing in front of the goalkeeper in open play though?

490~~~
What did he do to get the first yellow? Just woke up.

491~~~
Yes there is.

492~~~
As I have said on many occasions, he is just too stupid to be a first choice cb for us.

493~~~
Ok, thanks.

494~~~
I was thinking this too. I know you can't do it when inside the box, but once you are outside?

Stupid second tackle. Still think he's our best defender.

495~~~
And to think... I got a load of stick in the Match-Day thread for suggesting McNair should be starting ahead of him.

I love hindsight.

496~~~
Evans & Smalling will never be more than backup defenders, they don't have it in them (anymore in evans case) to be reliable as defenders.
Jones & Rojo is too early to say, Jones need to fix his bloody fitness or man-marking defensive midfielder is going to be the only thing he can do consistently.

Need.New.Defender.

497~~~
I'm sorry but did they tell him to go lunging in like that? No. 

He didnt have to run in like that just get close enough to stop the cross. Absolute idiot who has probably cost us the game

498~~~
Sums him up. Plays a blinder one week and the next either injured or rubbish.

499~~~
What a clown. Most of the time he is injured and then he does that...

500~~~
What a donkey.

501~~~
Sell him and Jones. Not a brain cell between the two of them.

Such idiocy and lack of talent (on Jones part mainly) should not be tolerated.

502~~~
Can someone please explain to me wtf he was trying to do for the first yellow card ? The second made more "sense" as he was covering for Valencia who made a dumb challenge.

503~~~
Regardless of the red, he isn't good enough for us.

He's not shit by any means and can be very good on his day. However a club with our aspirations should have someone with more quality than he is capable of as first choice CH. I have a similar opinion of Evans also tbh.

504~~~
Monumentally stupid for both yellows, just really really stupid.

505~~~
Idiot. Donkey.

506~~~
I said that too in the McNair thread. Smalling is rubbish.

507~~~
He was having a good game up to the sending off.

Really disappointed by him.

508~~~
If a player should be fined, this is a good time to fine him a week of his wages.

509~~~
FFS some of you knee jerkers. Getting a very stupid and costly red doesn't automatically mean you become shite the next week.

510~~~
I'm one of his biggest fans but two absolutely stupid decisions from him and it'll cost us.
But better defenders than him have been stupidly sent off, he'll learn from this experience as I hope LVG tears him a new one

511~~~
Infuriating. No other word for it.

Him and Jones must be some of the dumbest footballers this club has ever employed.

Van Gaal will rid this clown by next summer. Not good enough for this club.

512~~~
Are players fined for being sent off?

513~~~
Stupid. Both times. I've said it before, I won't be sad to see him go, with Blackett and McNair around. Has never looked comfortable in possession for Van Gaal anyway.

514~~~
Unlike him. Stupid first yellow but Valencia put him in a world of shit for that second one.

Let the kneejerking commence, however.

515~~~
Insane. Probably should have been taken off in favour of McNair after the firs yellow as he was always going to get sent off at some point after that.

516~~~
Utterly stupid stuff from him today, not an ounce of common sense.

517~~~
2nd yellow didn't make any sense considering he was on a yellow anyway and it was only Milner on his left side deep outside the box he was covering. Should have shepherded him or let him go deep.

518~~~
Absolutely thick as pig sh!t. Him and the other two blind mice are either always injured or thick. Maybe it's time to get rid of them.

519~~~
Dumb idiot first booking was stupid and the second he shouldn't have lunged in. What a moron.

He's probably lost this game for us now.

520~~~
Guy is an absolute moron. That first yellow card was just retarded. Absolutely retarded. Did he honestly think he wouldn't get booked for it? Dope. Then to go and lunge in when he hadn't got a hope of getting the ball? Terrible, just terrible. Not doing much to show me he should be a long term centre back, not when I think back to the likes of Bruce, Pallister, Stam, Ferdinand, Vidic. To that list you add Chris Smalling. I'm shaking my head ruefully here.

521~~~
Completely stupid first yellow. Why he did that, I will never know! Second one, Valencia out of position again, he comes round to cover. Stupid tackle and obvious second yellow. That stupid first yellow has cost him and now us.

522~~~
To be honest though, even if there wasn't then it would still be really stupid and unnecessary from him.

523~~~
Geez you guys sure love your knee jerk reactions.

524~~~
Two moronic yellow cards, but if we dropped every defender who has dropped a massive bollock this season we'd be starting our games with nine men. In other words, we either need to upgrade our defenders or our defenders need to upgrade their brains.

525~~~
Absolute idiot. If our injuries tod defenders ever stop, I hope he gets sold. Wasn't that great ever anyways.

526~~~
Does he has a brain?

527~~~
No idea which yellow made him look more dumb, the first one or the second one. Both yellows were fecking idiotic.

528~~~
that was really annoying

529~~~
It's why I wrote "sense" and not sense.

530~~~
O feck right off. Valencia to blame for the second?! Did he tell Smalling to launch himself in wildly like a twat through telepathy?!

No excuses for that challenge. He knew it as well, he's just an idiot.

531~~~
What makes it worse is he always looks so gormless. There is nothing at all going on inside his thick skull.

532~~~
Totally brainless.
What has Van Gaal has said before the match "We can't afford stupid red cards!!!!!"

I'm 100% sure Smalling will not be a United player at the start of the 2015-2016 season

Average, brainless and injury-prone

2 new CB's + Rojo, Blackett & McNair

Jones, Smalling and Evans can all go imo

533~~~
Who have said he went from brilliant to shit?
He went from not good enough to be a starter for a team aspiring to compete for titles, to showing he isn't smart enough to be a starter for a team aspiring to compete for titles.

534~~~
Both stupid but still our best natural CB

535~~~
Second yellow can happen but the first is totally inexcusable, wtf was he thinking so early in a derby, it was always going to be a guaranteed yellow. 


Knew the minute he got it he wouldn't finish the game.

536~~~
And to those of us who haven't thought he was good enough anyway? Is it still knee jerk? What is it exactly that makes him good enough? The 1 in 5 games where he actually looks good enough? His terrible passing? His terrible decision making? His terrible injury record?

537~~~
Up there with Thiago Silva moronic WC quarter-final.

538~~~
His first yellow was stupid, his second he was left with no choice after Valencia decided to lose the ball and expose him.

539~~~
First one was stupid from him, but I guess he took it for the team, but someone from attackers should be doing those things, not defenders.

Yeah, because he was sent off ten times for us in the past.

540~~~
Anyone saying this a knee-jerk reaction clearly hasn't been watching this dick for the last couple of seasons. 

He's not dependable in the slightest.

541~~~
I'm sure he feels worse than anyone about it. Van Gaal needs to have a chat with him, especially about the first yellow and then his recklessness of getting the 2nd one when he knew he was already on a first.

542~~~
Absolutely stupid from him today. No doubt he's f*cked us. 

We need Ed to splash the cash again in January. None of our centre-backs are near reliable enough.

543~~~
Read page ten of the thread, then read this one.

544~~~
No secret I absolutely love the man, but I must admit I was furious at his stupid first yellow.  I'm not sure if there was a quick counter on for City that he was trying to hold up, but it was a ridiculous decision. 

The second yellow I have no issue with. That's a standard yellow card for a defender that has happened and will happen millions of times. No defender should be pillaged for a late sliding tackle. 

The first card did him.

545~~~
I say it after the majority of games he plays for us, he just appears so gormless, clueless and clumsy particularly when he has the ball at his feet. 

No matter where the original mistake came from, that challenge was so stupid. The first yellow is the one which really got to me though.

546~~~
The 2nd yellow is much more forgivable. These things happen when you've been abandoned by your full back. But the first one. Why? That is always, always given as a yellow. You never get away with blocking the goalkeepers kick. Just brainless. I'm a big fan of Smalling, but he's quite probably lost us this game single handed.

We are in dire need of experience at the back. We are just absolutely wild defensively at the moment.

547~~~
What an absolute f*cking dickhead blocking the kick out. We all knew he was gonna get a yellow for it & that he wouldnt be able to make any cynical fouls for the rest of the match. Then he goes & gets a 2nd yellow. 

Is he on a bookie's payroll? Friggin looks like it!

548~~~
Thick c unt. I hope somebody leathers the twat at half time.

549~~~
The first yellow was clearly taking one for the team as we had defenders up for a corner and were incredibly suspect on the counter.

The second yellow he's covering Valencia on the right who isn't in position. However you just dont dive in like that on a yellow. Stupid mistake

Still our most solid CB but now another bunch of games where he's not playing. Brilliant

550~~~
Terrible way to get those cards. The first one was just plain stupid.

551~~~
Mad stuff.
First one, just get back to position. Hart isn't going to set an attack up from...a kick! There's 10 players behind you!

The second one, my word, it wasn't a last ditch challenge there, just let their twat have it and jockey,

Absolute killer, and the second half will be a sh!T game of damage limitation.

552~~~
Both cards were fecking stupid. I don't know why people are defending the second card.

553~~~
On the verge of giving up on him really. Just another in a long line of shit defending by the Jones/Evans/Smalling trio.

Literally does he have no brain? Getting the first yellow card was stupid enough..but the second wasn't even a last ditch tackle. milner was only crossing the fecking ball and its panic stations.

Honestly, I don't know if he has what it takes to make it as anything more than a squad player. Maybe with the departure of Fergie we really need to clean house and start all over.

554~~~
Don't forget Right back.

555~~~
I don't mind the sending off challenge. It was a bad decision to slide in, but it was part of a defensive play. He committed and was late, so be it. What I can't accept though was his first booking. Why did he have to do that? What was there to achieve? It was so early in a big game. You have a good hour to go where your team is playing one of the top sides in the league, and you put yourself at risk of a second yellow with basically an idiotic offense. Absolute knob he was this game.

556~~~
Holy feck, there are loads on here who overrate him then, in my opinion.

557~~~
Flip this Canary that first yellow was absolutely ridiculous so early in the match, I knew it was going to cost us, what an absolute idiot.

558~~~
I just don't know what he was thinking on both occasions. Really disappointing. It's a shame as we've been doing well.

559~~~
The first yellow was bad enough - the fact that he continued playing as if he wasn't already on a yellow makes it 10 x as bad.

560~~~
Moron

561~~~
Steady Johnny Bravo.

I'm right. This is unlike him. Stupid first yellow. The second one was also stupid, but the defending prior to it was utterly scandalous, as Sky Sports are dissecting right this second. As I said, a world of shit. 

Smalling only has himself to blame but it was also a culmination of dangerous defending on the right side of the park.

562~~~
Ssh, some people get angry when you suggest we need a new RB.

563~~~
That first one was not a yellow. The second was rather naive.

564~~~
It wasn't even subtle, or one he could pretend was accidental.

He'd simply put himself in the way on purpose.

Maybe he got a bit hyped up by the way the ref looked to be letting everything go.

565~~~
How is blocking a keeper taking a kick like that not a booking?
It's a booking every single time.

566~~~
FFS he was left exposed by Valencia, what did you expect him to do, let Milner get into the box?
He a good CB, these things happen and it doesn't help when you have idiots like Valencia playing as a RB. People need to stop over reacting. I'm disappointed that he will miss the next game, I wanted to see Smalling and Rojo partnership develop.
This forum is ridiculous at times, before his sending off he's the best CB we have and now not UTD quality again, you lot change faces every 2 mins. Calm down and stop the knee-jerking.

567~~~
Annoying….  Not good enough no matter how you look at it.  One of our most difficult games of the season and he does something like that.  Definitely should lose his spot.

568~~~
The only thing you can say is that it wasn't as stupid as the first.  Terrible defending, but that sort of thing does sometimes happen.  The first one is inexcusable, especially 20 minutes into the match.  

He can feck off as far as I'm concerned - nowhere near good enough to excuse that sort of performance.

569~~~
Of course the first one is a booking.

570~~~
An outstandingly thick 39 minutes. Leaving his team in an outrageous position, don't think we'll see much more of him for a while.

571~~~
You what?

Are you even watching the game?

572~~~
Not every single time, Balotelli got away with it yesterday. In fact the ref let play go.

No excuse for Smalling though. Pathetic player.

573~~~
Exactly. There is no way you can defend either card, definitely not the second.

574~~~
I can understand taking one for the team to prevent a counter if you are willing to have the  concentration of a rock for the next 60 minutes against the likes of Aguero.

575~~~
Last couple of seasons he didn't regularly play at CB and you're right he's terrible at RB

But his first season here and pretty much every time he's played at CB he's played well.

Most people reacting as though Vidic or Rio or any of our previous defenders never got a red card for us.

576~~~
Reactionary posting from his red aside, could be a decent defender if he had a brain.

But he doesn't. Liability, poor on set pieces and... well, I was going to say "not United quality", but there is no such thing anymore as no defender we have currently fits that description.

577~~~
Have they changed the rules or something?You certainly can't stand in front of a keeper and raise your leg to try block a kick out, nailed on yellow every single time. 

I wouldn't go as far as some are in this thread, but there's no defense for doing it.

578~~~
Not the first player to make a stupid and rash decision in a derby game and won't be the last.

579~~~
Tell me when, apart from the two cards he received he played badly?

580~~~
Exactly. The second one is even worse because he did that when already on a yellow card.

581~~~
Agreed. Its always a booking and Smalling knew that.

Therefore anyone who thinks Smalling just decided to do that for no reason needs their head checked. He knew it would be a booking so that City dont break when we have the likes of Valencia on the halfway line instead of a defender.

For all we know he's been asked to break up play if our set pieces break down with our 2 CBs in the box

582~~~
It wasn't even as if we had sh!Tloads of men caught out of position.

We had loads back, and it'd be one heck of a kick from Hart to put Aguero in.
Especially with no Dzeko to flick it on.

Utterly mental choice from Smalling. And to take Milner out, Milner! on the left wing.
What was Milner going to do, sprint away and put a perfect cross in?

It's Milner!

583~~~
The second was far worse mate. Milner was headed wide, not into the box. Even if he was, you don't fecking dive in when you're already on a yellow. It's basic intelligence.

584~~~
It's an open play the first one.. Absolutely nothing wrong about what Smalling is doing..

585~~~
Deserves to be benched for a few games at least after that pathetic first yellow from Smalling followed by the sending off. You can't be giving away cheap yellows in a game of this magnitude.

586~~~
Game just about sums him up really, talented, physical and completely thick. 

Doesn't have the mentality to ever be a top class defender.

587~~~
The funny part is that it is true in EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. Defending? Naive. Mental game? Naive. Thick describes Smalling the best today. 

Hopefully, this will be the spur to play Paddy McNair in every game from now on. Jones is too injury-prone. Smalling is thick. Evans... well he can be both injury-prone and thick. Deserves a second chance, but I'll put an intelligent and skilled youngster ahead three damaged goods.

588~~~
Lets hope so..

He's paid a kings ransom & he's always injured. Now he's added stupidity to the list. 

I dont rate him anyway - same as Jones. They are not Vida & Rio replacements & thats what we need..

589~~~
Was playing really good and then became an absolute idiot.

590~~~
You can't block the goalkeeper off. Everybody would just block the goalkeeper from kicking it every game if that was the case.

591~~~
It's going to be a horrible second half.

Bad enough that we're already a bit sh!T at the moment.
Bad enough that it's 10men, meaning utterly backs against the walls job with a dodgy defence anyway.

But now we've lost one of our 2 excellent headers of the ball, meaning someone like Carrick is going to have to pick up a giant.

592~~~
I say calmly that he should be punished in some way.

I don't want to see him in our shirt again also.

593~~~
1) I like how you have ignored the first yellow card which, to describe as stupid, would be too kind.

2) It would be better to go a goal down with the second half still to start than to go down to ten men. Again idiotic.

3) I hadn't realised that the forum, as a whole, had come to a consensus that Smalling is our best centre back. In actual fact, most of our defenders have received a lot of criticism so there is no knee jerking.

594~~~
So is Smalling shit again now after having a week of being our best CB? It can be hard to keep up sometimes...

595~~~
Incredibly stupid. Just underlines the fact we didn't sign a top defender in the summer. 

Now a draw is what we can hope for, which I doubt.

596~~~
His passin has been dodge..

597~~~
I think Van Gaal will have "buy top centre back" very firmly written in those notes.

he cannot for a moment be convinced that any of our current stable fit that description

598~~~
I really hope Van Gaal lays into him in the post-match interview. Players being that stupid shouldn't be protected.

Throw him under the bus.

(Not literally.)

599~~~
Typical isn't it. we were actually looking half decent at CB in this game and he goes and gets sent off. How many games does he miss now? Just 1 isn't it?

600~~~
At least there was a reason for what he was doing, even if he was doing it very badly.

The first one he might as well have saved his energy and just politely requested that he start the game on a yellow card.  He actually executed exactly what he was trying to, and the only possible outcome is a booking.  There was no potential benefit.

601~~~
That was his first very good match since months

He's average since 2 years

602~~~
Not much worse than the others in our team, and certainly doesn't mean he's a shit defender

603~~~
The difference between "being our best CB" and "being shit" is minimal. Just look at the rest of our defence. Morons and injury prones galore.

604~~~
The first one is an automatic yellow! He's an idiot.

605~~~
A bit uncharacteristic of Smalling. Usually comes across as a calm and intelligent chap. Dunno what got into his head today. Two really silly yellows.

606~~~
They were both yellows for different reasons obviously. He knew exactly what he was doing on the first one.

607~~~
We may not have any choice.

608~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

609~~~
Has he got twitter? Could get messy.

610~~~
He's cost us. City were there for the taking today.

611~~~
Yep, they've not been all that impressive. Perhaps they wouldn't have been so nervy without a lead, but this was certainly a winnable game if we hadn't been a man down.

612~~~
Cost us three points. Would have probably won with 11 men. Should be docked 3 months wages.

613~~~
? We were never going to win this one.

614~~~
With 11-men, there's a good chance we could have.

615~~~
Cheers Chris.

616~~~
Aye. We definitely had a great chance of winning today if it wasn't for his utter stupidity.

617~~~
Naah, City should be 2-0 up by half time, we didnt create one decent chance in the first half.

618~~~
I hope he gets sold for this.

619~~~
Does he feck.

620~~~
Don't Think he has the intelligence to remember a password.

621~~~
Hewent back to his pre Fulham days

622~~~
Yeah, they should have been, but they weren't. I'm not saying we would have won, but it was certainly a winnable game.

623~~~
feck right off smalling. I hope he gets sold. fecking idiot.

624~~~
He cost us the game. We'd have competed had we remained at 11 but his sending off broke our entire game plan.

625~~~
Could have sworn it was 0-0 at halftime...

626~~~
Along with Jones/Blackett? All have had terrible brainfarts.

627~~~
Based on what ? Didn't DDG save us several times before the red card ?

628~~~
What a fecking shame. Did well against Chelsea and was doing well against City before he decided to act like a complete idiot.

629~~~
he made a very silly mistake. think we would have won this otherwise.

but we did play well.

630~~~
City were there for the taking and a win today would have been a massive confidence boost for the team but it was all ruined by the stupidity of one man.

631~~~
Cheers lad your idiotic sending off cost us the win today.

Get rid in January never being good enough for United

632~~~
Yeah but they should be, we were quite lucky and City definitely the better/more dangerous team. Us keeping that useless possession doesnt make it a winnable game.

633~~~
Between him and Evans, I'm not sure who I want to see on the pitch less for us.  Put him as a waiter in the Red Cafe.

634~~~
Yes, but it was still 0-0. Again, I'm not saying we would've won, but we could have stood a better chance of doing so.

635~~~
Ultimately cost us the game. We arguably had a decent hold on the game before he went off and we weren't bad for the last quarter of the game either - which would have been a whole lost easier with 11.

Another defender having a shocker away from home and causing unnecessary problems.

At least they're pretty much all injured/suspended now. Carrick and McNair will probably be a better pairing for the foreseeable future.

636~~~
Big derby game, a rush of blood, and silly yellow cards. It happens when emotions run high. Positive is that we held off a potentially rampant City team to 1-0 and almost came back towards the end. Things are certainly looking up.

637~~~
And you would be right in doing so. I think we would have lost either way, Smalling's red card just made it obvious.

638~~~
Not to this extent. fecking idiotic for both yellow cards. You don't expect kids to do something that stupid. One of the most idiotic 2 yellow cards I've seen in my life, if not the worst.

639~~~
Stupid first yellow, correct second, so all in all a deserved and stupid sending off. The annoying part is that Balotelli does this every other match and never gets booked for it. Zabaleta should have had a second yellow, instead he doesn't get a yellow for that first offense, which was twice as bad as what Blind was similarly booked for. 

Uncharacteristic of Smalling this, so let's hope he doesn't commit to such stupid bookings again. He's been good lately, so it will be a loss. Both McNair and Carrick played very well though.

640~~~
See comments like this take away so much from what we actually did. LvG got it spot on by having Rooney drop into midfield. For the opening 20 City didnt know how to keep up and we should have been more threatening with our attacks (story of the season).

City didnt surrender possession because they wanted us to have it they tactically couldn't cope. After 20 min they were at home so its naive to think they wouldn't turn it on at some stage. IMO Smalling cost us today, 11vs11 i dont think they would have got that space on the right flank to pull it back for them to score.

641~~~
The first one was very stupid, really idiotic, the 2nd one, also stupid but not so.

642~~~
The second was just as bad. Sure it happens if you don't have a yellow but already being on a yellow, diving in like that in that situation? Just pure stupidity.

643~~~
He most likely single handedly cost us getting something out of that game.

644~~~
Been looking forward to this all week and this donkey not only fecks up potential points but the whole spectacle.

We was playing well up until his sending off.

645~~~
I've been thinking for a while we may need a blood sacrifice to sort out those defensive injuries, give the fecking idiot a spoon and let him do it himself I say.

646~~~
Its more believable that he got bribed/paid to do this instead of thinking a player at a top club can be this goddamn stupid

647~~~
That will significantly dent his career here. Not being knee jerk but the defenders at the club are walking a tight rope.....

648~~~
Dock him 2 weeks wages for poor performance
Dock him 2 weeks wages for poor conduct

649~~~
I can't believe that there's still some posters that can see him reaching that very early potential. It's just not going to happen, he's regressed and is a complete liability now.

650~~~
We should have bit Wenger's hand off.

651~~~
Livid at him right now. It's a big derby game. It calls for cool heads and composure. He showed none of that and he directly cost us the game today. There was no need for that first yellow. Surely he had the common sense to realise what it could lead to? He was gonna have to put himself into more challenges in the rest of the game and give the ref decisions to make.

But i'm sure he'll feeling worse than any of us right now. Luckily for him we're losing central defenders all over the place. He has a chance to get back in the team and earn some redemption. A good performance last week has been forgotten due to his horror show now. He's gotta give thanks to our other players and especially De Gea for giving us a fighting chance at points we had no right to.

652~~~
Another 2 weeks for being fleeced by James fecking Milner. That itself is a bookable offence.

653~~~
And use it to compensate every United fan who paid to watch the game.

654~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> how is that even possible to be done for pace by Milner?

655~~~
That's Smalling all over. He IS a talented lad but he doesn't have the concentration to play at the top level. Be surprised if we see him start another game this season. Brainfart extraordinaire.

656~~~
He's not shit - he's just aint got a patch on Rio or Vida & thats the standard we need..

As for today - he cost us any chance we had of giving City a game right to the end & winning it. But in saying that, we did very well in tryin to get the equalizer, only for Di Maria piss-poor crosses from set-pieces. Fellaini had a great opportunity also..

657~~~
Stupid mistakes. The knee jerk reactions will want him gone but he is our best defender IMO. Made an uncharacteristic mistake and unfortunately it will cost him dearly I imagine.

658~~~
He has better concentration than any of our other CBs. You can count the number of times he's let us down on 2 fingers, unfortunately one of them is today so here come the hysterical posts

At RB he's made mistakes, at CB he makes less than any of our other options

659~~~
The only 2 cb's I have any faith in are Evans and Rojo. We should just cut our losses on Jones and Smalling, both are too rash and haven't got a brain cell between the two of them.

660~~~
The second yellow was even stupider than the first one.

661~~~
I'm one of Smalling's bigger fans but two braindead moments have cost us. There's just no excuse. Not unlucky, just fecking idiotic. Fuming with him.

662~~~
He's fecking 25 and still cannot get his shite together. 2 yellows within 10 minutes is so fecking dumb.

663~~~
Two stupid yellows.

664~~~
I can't wait to see him and his "dog ate my bollocks" face out of the club soon enough. How do you manage to be brain dead twice in 30 mins?

665~~~
Get Smalling, Jones and Evans out of the club. Another week, and I'm saying it yet again

666~~~
Evans?? He has had at least 3 brainfarts this season, same category of the other two.

667~~~
I hope he comes out and apologises for that first yellow card. Utterly stupid and let the side down.

668~~~
I think back to the derby game in February 2011. Memorable most of all for Rooney's scissor kick winner. But Chris Smalling started that day as well, and I remember being hugely impressed by him. Didn't put a foot wrong, and looked a real prospect.

In 2011/12, I also remember him being comfortably better than Jones as a centre half.

May well have cost us the game today, but let's not write him off just yet. Still has the makings of a good Premiership defender, and could easily go on to be as good as or better than a Gary Cahill (currently getting games for a brilliant Chelsea side).

669~~~
Let us down today. Sheer stupidity. Real lack of intelligence and couldn't control his emotions at all.

Cost us the match. Simple as that.

670~~~
He's a complete clown..

Not the first time he's done something stupid, on or off the pitch. 

The stories about LVG willing to let either him or Jones go to Arsenal in pre season, shows that they are walking a tightrope as it is. Utterly stupid to do be doing that

671~~~
Evans has proven himself at the highest level, if he's match-fit he is our best cb in my opinion.

672~~~
And he has also proven that he isn't leader and that he needs one next to him, he has been comfortably worse than Smalling. This is Smalling first major failure as a match, Evans has had 2/3 of them at least this season.

673~~~
His challenge might have been understandable had it been 0-0 after 80 mins but in the first half it was ridiculous.

674~~~
The story was that he was completely <i>unwilling </i>to do that, actually.

675~~~
Wasn't the sending off the first in his career?

676~~~
Isn't it his first ever red card?

It was stupid but like rooney a few weeks ago our players really do get destroyed on here at times

677~~~
He's hasnt even played a game & a half to remotely call it "lately" for Christ sake man. 

What Smalling did today, is the type of shit that players do when they're on a bookies payroll.

678~~~
Evans can pass and control the ball, something that Smalling struggles with. I've seen Evans looking dominant in CL latter stages against sophisticated teams like Mourinho's Inter, Smalling on the other hand, well you can tell he was playing non-league football a few years ago.

679~~~
I read that he was willing to do it but, Jones and Smalling didn't wanna move.

Either way, it changes nothing. The defenders have been walking a tightrope, with the exception of Rojo, all season. What he was doing today, I'll never know.

There is quite literally no decent excuse for it

680~~~
No chance. The 2nd was a genuine challenge for the ball, and he'd been sold up the river by Valencia running after anything that moves. It was late and clumsy, but it was a dangerous attack. They were in behind us.

The first was utterly needless, and is something a player is always booked for. No player ever gets away with it, so why even try?

681~~~
Yeah, he was a beast on the ball 2012/2013, but this season he has been just as bad with the ball as Smalling, especially vs Dons/Burnley, but to be fair, that's my least worry, I want defenders who are reliable defensively, it seems none of them are capable of doing that except Shaw.

682~~~
They friggin deserve to be destroyed by that fans man. We're up against it this season, so when our players get sent off needlessly - they let the team down & the game plan goes out the window. This season is crucial for us.

Its not on & they deserve all the grief they get as far as i'm concerned. We could have won today with 11 men on the field..

683~~~
It is, that's why it's so frustrating. He's went out and put himself in the spotlight as some kind of glaring example of our defensive woes, when he is actually the best at defending of all our central defenders. He's picked a right game to do this in, and what's more, this could end up going some way in defining the length of his United career. which is sad. 

Some of the reaction in here is pathetic though. Pretending as if today is the norm with Smalling isn't fair at all. He'll be more pissed off than us, I can assure you. So, so unlike him.

684~~~
If we can ever get Evans match-fit again I think we have a first choice CB to play alongside Rojo that wont let you down. We certainly need to strengthen in Jan though as it seems we can't keep any of them fit.

685~~~
Not defending Smalling, it was a really stupid thing to get booked for, but Balotelli got away with it yesterday.

686~~~
Brain dead for both yellows but still the best CB we have. Insane decision for both yellows though, a single neuron should have told him not to do what he did on either occasion, he must have billions in that head of his.

687~~~
Spot on!

Smalling is a panicker on the ball & he makes easy passes look hard work most of the time.

688~~~
He was a bit further away from the keeper though, wasn't he?

689~~~
Exactly, how can he get back in form if he doesnt play more than 4 consecutive matches? We have the most unreliable defenders in the league, when they are in form they are class, just like Smalling last week, but then he does things like this,there is just no stability. If it isnt a brainfart, someone will get injured.

690~~~
Smalling's the best CB we have? 

Carricks the best CB we have!

691~~~
I think we can write him off. Maybe one of those players that could have developed better if had played the last few years at a lesser club, who knows. I don't think he has a strong enough mentality for this club, and takes the fact he is a Manchester United player for granted.

692~~~
Looking at it positively, we will certainly strengthen and when we're in a position to put out a solid cb pairing we are going to be a force to be reckoned with.

693~~~
Our biggest game of the season so far, coming after a poor start but with recent signs of better things to come, and he commits two stupid acts within the first 40 minutes to get himself a needless and completely avoidable red card, subsequently cancelling out a promising start to the game. He let his team down, ultimately cost us the game and ruined what was looking to be a good performance and match. He deserves to be criticised for his stupidity.

694~~~
If he's the best at defending, how come we if anything looked more secure with Carrick and McNair back there, even with a player less!

695~~~
Speaks volumes about our options atm but yes, he is. Talking from a purely defensive POV btw, his work with the ball isnt upto scratch but defensively, he's sound. Shocking 2 moments today but doesnt change that fact.

696~~~
This lad is finished at this club. I fully expect him replaced and gone in January.

697~~~
1) didn't need to say it, its a yellow card, he's not the only defender or player to get a yellow card for that

2) in that case, defenders shouldnt defender just in case they get sent off

3) instead of knee-jerking spend some time reading the forum.

When he comes back in the team and starts playing well, you'll all be praising him and saying hes the best CB in the world as you do with all utd players when it suits you.
If its wrong to defend a utd player then I'll take it on the chin. Its his second start this season and I'm not surprised that he's not at his very best. As I have said before, I'd like Smalling and Rojo to form a partnership at it will take time for that to happen.

698~~~
After he took those 2 yellow cards (stark raving bonkers!), Louis would get my vote if he takes Smalling in his office later today and bluntly tells him that it is the very last game he will ever have at United. I'm totally fed up with Smalling; today was the straw that breaks the camel's back. Send him to the dogs already.

699~~~
Evans is injured for half a season - every season. He's at best a semi-utility player for that reason - we cant count on him being fit. Even when he is fit - he gets injured in no time & is out for weeks or months..

We cant rely on our CB's. We need a complete overhaul of the injury-proners. They're not payin their way..

700~~~
Ship him to sunderland in january

701~~~
Didn't Balotelli get away with it yesterday? Not that important though. I'm actually stunned by Smalling's stupidity, and combined with his constant under-performing, I wouldn't be against LvG getting rid at the end of the season. He is such a clumsy footballer and fills his team mates and especially David de Gea with everything else but confidence.

702~~~
The sooner we replace the central defence options of Smalling, Jones and Evans the better. They're just not up to scratch. 

Blackett, McNair to bring on and a couple of proven CB's. With Rojo as back up/utility.

703~~~
Please no Blackett.

704~~~
McNair made a crucial mistake that lead to a City chance which could've been a goal, and his positioning wasn't the best IIRC Zabaleta/Navas took him out of position on a couple of occasions near the 6 yard box.

I think it was Carrick's calming influence and experience that made the difference overall.

705~~~
He looks like he's on easy street imo..

706~~~
I've never been a fan and don't get how anyone could see him as our best CB. Today was inexcusable, and I'd sleep better if he never played for us again.

707~~~
Well unlike you I'm not basing my assessment off of one game. Smalling generally defends better than Jones, Evans and, from what I've seen so far, Rojo. Today aside, certainly more positionally aware and sensible.

708~~~
Apparently so. Saw an interview where he said he did well enough for his A levels to get into University. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

709~~~
1) The amount of players that get a yellow card for something as idiotic as that per season could probably be counted on one hand so don't brush it off, as if it is nothing.

2) There is a slight difference between a player being on a yellow card and not. It may be a bit too subtle for yourself though.

3) Only certified idiots will claim Smalling is or could be the centre back in the world. If you can provide examples of your ridiculous claims, then I will apologise.

710~~~
To be fair, any idiot can get into university these days.

711~~~
Agree with this.

712~~~
I hope he never plays a game for United ever again, should be made an example of how not to defend.  Major problem is that we can't drop him to the reserves because our defenders are made of fecking glass.

713~~~
If you think Smalling has ever developed beyond "has potential" than I'd say you're kidding yourself.

Has all the attributes, but has never kicked on.
Same with Jones.

Evans I've never been comfortable with due to his lack of real physicality. Whatever anyone says, you need more strength and heading ability than him, as our most successful combos have shown, Bruce-Pally, Johnsen-Stam, Vidic-Ferdinand. All of them very strong physically.

714~~~
The idea that Smalling should be sold is moronic. That said he let us down badly today.

715~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I think common-sense is the main issue here though man..

As i said before - Smalling's behaviour today was consistent with a player on a bookie's payroll. Of course i aint sayin he is, but thats the type of shit players do to get sent off - easy / no-brainer yellows etc..

716~~~
Not sold, slain, skinned and mounted outside OT as a lesson to others.

717~~~
Yeah you're right man - he needs to be shot instead <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

718~~~

719~~~
Like your style man.. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

720~~~
Is Chris Smalling trying to sabotage his Man Utd career? He has a very good outing against Chelsea and then loses his head the week later. You simply don't know what to expect from Smalling and that is something managers hate. Coaches like to know they can count on their players, especially in the big games. Smalling put a massive question mark in Van Gaal's mind today, not due to lack of footballing ability, but a brain fart (I refer to the first booking) that was totally inexplicable. As a centre back up against Aguero you don't give away a cheap yellow early in the game, its silly to put yourself in that position. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

721~~~
That first yellow was just baffling and the second was a massive brain-fart. Disappointed as I think we might have been able to come away with something from the match with 11 men. Still think he is a good defender and has a future at the club but really needs to buckle down and start showing it.

722~~~
So every player that got silly red card should never play for United again. Hmm..

723~~~
There's silly and down right stupid, not even the red but the first yellow.

724~~~
It's a stupid risk to take. Well, Balotelli isn't the brightest around but he is a forward so at the very least I can see him trying it. But defenders tend to run a higher chance of getting yellows as it is, so to put yourself at risk of a yellow for such a stupid offense is simply unnecessary. Fine if RVP/Di Maria/Januzaj etc do it, they can refrain from tackles rest of the game. But Smalling's a defender, what gave him the wildest thought that it was a good idea? I just can't understand.

725~~~
Rooney was even sillier with a straight red.

726~~~
An example of how not to defend? Smalling gets criticised for his passing and injury record but his actual defending is excellent. Losing the head once today doesn't change that.

727~~~
Rinse, repeat...

728~~~
This will be forgotten for a long time now. Hopefully he gets back into the team though because he is our best CB.

729~~~
I think Van Gaal is telling our defenders to block the keeper if they get the ball from corners. They were doing it against Chelsea and a few others this season. If I'm right, then he can't really be blamed for the first yellow.

730~~~
Im basically withholding judgement on Smalling, Jones and Evans till christmas minimum.
I was hoping for the first 2 to kick on, form a good partnership and put a run of games together. I was hoping evans would stay fit and continue showing good composure on the ball.

Atm my biggest issue is how often they're available but they haven't been covering themselves in glory when they have been available.
I'd buy a right sided cb in january anyway. I hope one of them sorts out their fitness issues but we cant really rely on the fitness of any of them so 
... one kind of needs to go for someone who'll be available week in, week out.

Smalling has been quite good defensively when available though.
Today was stupid, which is a pity, as its not something i'd normally associate with him.

731~~~
That's hardly an achievement nowadays, I imagine Tevez might have got a place on clearing.

732~~~
I wonder if Jones, Evans or Rafael made the same mistake how many would react the same.

733~~~
It's disappointing for Smalling and I am sure he is gutted. Quite uncharacteristic for him, after a couple of good showings recently.

Fortunately LVG probably isn't quite as knee-jerk as most fans and will have a chat with him I am sure. Still our best CB for me.

734~~~
It would be the same. Looking like more and more have little faith in any of them, whether it's injuries or ability, unless you are Irish and Evans will get some leeway.

735~~~
Looks like today it was time for him to do something stupid. The amount of mistakes in this formation begs for clear out and serious investment.

736~~~
Football smart ≠ Academically smart. Hell, put Neil DeGrasse Tyson on the pitch and he'd look pretty thick.

737~~~
A defender should never be doing it. He should be busting his ass to get back in position.

If Van Persie or a winger picked up a cheap yellow for doing it I wouldn't be too bothered.

738~~~
I'm not quite as sure
Evans made a crucial error that was directly responsible for a goal by MK Dons and while a lot of people reacted badly (myself included) the reaction to Smalling's red card seems worse? Plus he's just looked terrible in recent games.
I mean some people are genuinely saying Smalling shouldn't wear the shirt again? It's baffling.
Jones has made quite a few mistakes in his time for us but he's generally seen as the better defender.

And of course Rafa is loved (quite rightly) so I cant see it for him either.

739~~~
I get the impression that patience is running thin with all of the defenders who have been in the first team squad for several seasons, whether it be due to injuries, stupid errors or a combination of the two.

740~~~
He was a huge laugh but this knee jerk is just ridiculous, never that Evans/Jones get so much criticism after a huge brainfart or two.

741~~~
Oh definitely, this is a crucial season for all of them, LVG isn't the type to stand for complacency.
I just get the feeling that the other 3 have more margin for error than Smalling - I could be wrong.

742~~~
Never heard Evans or Jones get as much criticism? They've had worse, especially  Evans.

743~~~
Naah 99% here wants him gone by January.

744~~~
If it's not Jones fecking up it's this clown. Both not good enough and sincerely hope they are  shown the door at the end of the season.

745~~~
Louis van Gaal said he did not see the first yellow card but thinks the second yellow card was stupid on Smalling's part. 

Wait until he sees the first yellow card.

746~~~
That's so worrying and disturbing at the same time because you are probably right.

747~~~
What's more annoying about the 1st yellow, is that Joe Hart is shit at kicking. It had more chance of being booted out of play than reaching a City player.

748~~~
I think both him and Jones are running out of time. Can't keep using the excuse that they're young and developing. He'll stay until we can buy someone better, but for me there's no chance he'll cement a place as a first choice centre half for us.

749~~~
He saw it, he just used that as a reason not to answer it I'd imagine.

750~~~
And in the 5 or 6 seconds he waited for Hart to kick it he could have been back 50 yards down the field and in position.

751~~~
You'd have thought so but then, why is it particularly the Centre Backs that are doing it? Surely that's an instruction.

Perhaps the thinking is that there are others closer to our box that can fill in whilst the defender, who was up for the corner, can slow down the play.

752~~~
There's no denying defenders will make mistakes Vidic and Ferdinand made their fair share, but the key to being a good defender is consistency, top defenders play well game after game. Smalling and Jones will have 1 or 2 good games then be absolute shite, we been putting that down to inexperience but enough is enough they have been around the first team for several years now and should be playing to a high level. Imo they are mid table PL league defenders not CL quality, they have to be replaced.

753~~~
Jones it would be perfectly in line with his stupidity. Rafa loses the rag now and again I suppose, so not out of the question.

I'd be surprised with Evans to be fair. Usually gets sent off for a last-man challenge.

754~~~
Smalling cost us the game today, in my opinion, and I'm furious with him. But I'm apprehensive to overly criticise him, simply because I believe we can't rely on any of our senior centre-backs, they're all liabilities.

755~~~
I'd love to know Fergie's thoughts at the moment.

Considering he spoke about Smalling - Evans being the next successful CB pair for the club for years to come following the CL Final in 2011.

And then calling Phil Jones as potentially the "best player this club has ever had".

All three are playing their way towards the exit door if they don't step up.

756~~~
Rio and Vidic were special players but if we're to have Smalling and defenders like Jones and Evans making as many dumb mistakes in a month as they did in 2 or 3 seasons, that won't cut it if we're going to be contenders again.

Today was just completely idiotic from him.  This wasn't a young back like McNair or Blackett who did this, this is a 24 year old who has started in CL knockout matches and for England.  He was finally getting his chance to secure a place in the lineup after the Chelsea match (in which I think he was excellent) and pulls stupid shit like this...

There's always some kind of nonsense going on amongst the backs, injuries, stupid fouls, freezing up when under attack etc. and I'm damn sick of it.

757~~~
I donno how Jones has, whenever hes played i've thought we've looked solid because of it

758~~~
With Jones it's more his style. He's too reckless, bordering on foolish as he goes for tackles and challenges.

759~~~
As I said a about a few weeks ago, I'd ship Smalling at the end of next season, and give a season to Evans and Jones.

Their injury record and under par performances shouldn't get them a place in this team.

Too many stupid mistakes, can't pass. A real limited defender.

760~~~
Smalling and Jones have had plenty of chances. I like them and it's tough, but I'm afraid we can't put up with their inconsistencies. They start one game and they play ok, then they get injured. Or they have a good game one week and the next a complete brain fart. We obviously cannot trust them so I would get rid of at least one in January and get an experienced CB in. It's too much now with them, we simply cannot afford this and their performance just negates any good work the rest of the team does. It's depressing.

761~~~
See second goal against West Brom.

762~~~
You're right

763~~~
It was his first game back in a while and he made a decision to press the midfield. I didnt think it was stupid maybe he was a bit rusty. Why Rojo/Rafael didnt try to cover is another question.

764~~~
That's the problem we are always making excuses for them.

765~~~
Why Sunderland? I would ship to QPR and let him hit relegation there.

Players and coaches turning against him. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/><img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/><img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

766~~~
Dont see anyone making excuses for Smalling but i guess its a matter of opinion. For most of the West Brom game i thought he did well, but for that one mistake which i put down to him being rusty

767~~~
Throwing himself like he did when on a yellow was asking for the ref to send him off. The first card, I don't even understand wtf he was trying to do.

768~~~
How does a facial expression convey that?!

769~~~
Neither of those cards were the type of challenges I'd expect Smalling to make. It was just a really weird red for him to get. He's still head and shoulders above the other centre backs in the squad right now.

770~~~

771~~~
Fixed that for you. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

772~~~
Think you are spot on. If it was a recurring theme with him, I could accept and understand the knee-jerk reactions, but people are going way over the top here. Silly place at times.

773~~~
Yeah, I was wondering that too..

774~~~
That's all true and kneejerk reactions are inevitable but yet again if he doesnt get a stupid red which he doesnt so often he gets injured himself every few games.

775~~~
Uncharacteristic mistake from Smalling today. On another day he wouldn't just stood Milner up, but he had a rush of blood and dived in.

776~~~
I hope he slapped him let alone gave him some poxy face.

777~~~
I disagree it's knee jerk. I think a lot of people have had enough of the mediocre central defenders we had in line to replace Rio and Vidic, and I think the lack of quality of all three has been clear for a long time. I think this latest incident is just the latest thing that has underwhelmed me about Smalling. I have been saying for a long time he isn't up to scratch, because he isn't.

Can you honestly see him becoming the next Rio or Vidic? Honestly, after all this time? Same goes for Evans, and to a lesser degree Jones.

The answer is no if you're honest. So what are they still doing here?

778~~~
He makes a mistake and his head is gone. That is the Smalling i know. In this case he went for a stupid tackle. His nervousness costs him every time. We really need to sell some of our defenders at the end of the season. Guy is 25, plays like a teenager. Shaw looks miles ahead of him in terms of intelligence.

779~~~
Do you actually remember Vidic and Ferdinand when they were 24/25? They were far from the finished article. Smalling's still young enough for a CB and his weaknesses are things that can easily be improved. I think you are being far too harsh on him.

780~~~
The tackle wasn't the problem, the stupid yellow card for getting in front of the keeper was. I agree that Smalling is incredibly imature on the pitch, but Shaw is not a good example. Shaw constantly loses position because he tries to recover the ball when he has no chance to win the tackle. The problem is we don't have anyone smart in any defensive position.

781~~~
If our defenders aren't getting injured, they seem to be doing well and finding other ways to miss games.

782~~~
He might have cost us the game today, but he's still our best CB imo.

783~~~
Just finished the match.....shocking from Smalling..hes played enough matches to know better...no excuses today.

784~~~
Smalling was a frickin' idiot whilst on a yellow, but does anyone actually know why he was booked for the first one? I saw exactly the same thing happen last weekend and that ref just had a quiet word with the player.

Is it actually an offense to stand 5 yards from a goalkeeper when he is kicking it out of his hands?

785~~~
Dunno, all our senior centre-backs are at a similar level, none are reliable, unfortunately.

786~~~
This. He's a very good centre half. Today was very out of character. Im completely shocked about it. I hope he goes straight back into the side after his suspension.  He's the only one we have who I actually trust to defend properly.

787~~~
Why are some focussing on the tackle that got him sent off, and not the ridiculous decision to get what was always going to be a booking, for a brain dead block for the goal kick in the 20th minute or so. What's even more astonishing is that despite the obvious yellow he would receive, he decided (as he had enough time to process this) that it was worth it to halt the play and play 70 minutes against possibly the best striker in the world, with a yellow to his name. 

Its  not the first time he's cost us at the Etihad either, as I recall him being at fault for Kompanys header in the decisive 1-0 loss. You can excuse mistakes from youngsters, but this guy is an experienced defender now and he hasn't stepped up, and I expect him to be shipped out.

788~~~
Classy <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

789~~~
Really don't know why anyone is bothering to defend him. Under LvG who likes a CB good on the ball his time here is done now. Forget about him.

790~~~
Hardly. By the time he was 23 Rio was Leeds captain. By the time he came to us at 24 he was the most expensive defender in the country. And he settled in pretty quickly if memory serves.

Vida was 24 when he came to us and within a year was a shoe-in alongside Rio. Smalling is now 25 and has shown little sign he is anywhere near their level – particularly in terms of mental strength and leadership. How you can say he is I have no idea. I would also say more or less the same for Evans, with perhaps giving Jones more slack because he still has a year or so on them.

791~~~
I disagree about Ferdinand, he only really came good once Vidic joined and they built a settled partnership, IMO. I thought before that he was always liable to make a mistake.

I agree about Smalling's mental strength but that's something that can be improved with experience so it isn't something that worries me too much. I don't think Smalling has to be a leader, not every CB is so why does it matter if his leadership skills aren't like theirs were? He's good at reading the game, fast, strong and good in the air. They're most of the important attributes a CB needs.

792~~~
It's too bad but we have to stick with him. It's not like he is the next Baresi or something but the alternative is that we go through another massive transition in defense if we go by some of the suggestions in this forum. Sell/replace Rafael, Evans, Jones and Smalling after we just lost 3 of our most experienced defenders last season?

I'm not saying we should blindly ignore our problems at the back and just stick with our injury-prone and shoddy defense but we don't exactly need to go for a massive overhaul either. Right now Smalling is the best central defender we have, at least for me, and we should stick by him. Ideally I wouldn't mind if we brought in a top-notch CB (not that there are many viable ones out there anyway) and 2 full backs as cover for Shaw and Rafael. I think it would be more sensible if we stuck with most of our current centre-backs and cut one or two of them (if McNair/Blackett show that they can make the step up) loose at most. It could be anyone from Smalling/Jones/Evans tbh but I think Smalling has the best chance at making it here out of the trio. 

It's subjective and it's not clear-cut who is our best centre-back and has the best chance of making it here, among those trio and Rojo is just settling in for now. Who knows how our defense will line up 2-3 years from now. I just hope we don't have to go through another destabilizing transition and make over in defense or that we might come to regret letting one of our defenders go too soon.

793~~~
Probably because his passing has been more accurate than any of our other CBs this season

Its true thats an area of his game that isnt brilliant, but until we find a better defender who is also better on the ball you make do with what you have.

He's more reliable, more consistant than our other CBs and the other Cbs get away with poor distribution when he doesn't.

He shot himself in the foot today though after his injuries this season.

794~~~
I am very sorry for him. He was very good against Chelsea and he was actually very good till the stupid mistake.

He had to cover for Valencia (who was horrible the whole time) all the time, that's where the foul came from, he didn't make mistakes before and then that (actually if the referee had kept the criteria where he did not give Clichy and Zabaleta yellow cards, he could have gone away with it).

He is a better CB than any of other CB's but he just has to many injury problems and today this.

I really hope that he is back in the side after the CP game.

And LVG.... Why doesn't he comment RVP and his shit play? He just says that he is fit, even if he plays like shit. Rooney got against the playmaker role and he can't do it, it should be clear by now, but he still got the praise for running a lot and defensive work, but we have Blind and Fellaini for that, Rooney needs to do something upfront (like Herrera does, very good going forward and back). In two biggest games till now ADM was bad (I can image what abouse would have Nani got), but still no real criticism of that.

But my biggest problem with LVG is RVP, who is just not good enough right now and should not be playing. All the other players contribute to something, but not RVP (OK he scored against Chelsea), but he is safe, while LVG only attacks young players.

795~~~
Played well before getting the insane yellow. The 2nd is the kind of thing that happens when Valencia is at right back and a winger is running hard at the box with the ball. 

The loss is basically entirely his fault, but I came out of the game more convinced that he should be the starting RCB for the next little while at least. We need to stop conceding so much and he's our best overall defender there. Not a good passer but Blind and Rafael as the 2 nearest players will help with that.

796~~~
The first yellow card annoys me everytime I think about it, it was akin to Rooney's versus West Ham in terms of how needless it was. So many men back and Hart was just punting it, it's baffling.

797~~~
I really hope we go all out and get two starting XI quality centre backs over the next two windows then get rid of Jones, Smalling and Evans.

798~~~
On reflection after emotions running high during the match the decision to block the keeper was not the smartest of choices.

799~~~
I wouldn't be against that either but I can't think of two quality centre backs that we would be able to sign.

800~~~
Do we really need amazing CB's to replace the average and injury prone lot we have?

An average CB that stayed fit and built a partnership would be better for us right now.

801~~~
Cost us the game today. We had a few shakey moments early on but generally controlled the ball very well and matched City in general. And then Chris smalling goes ahead and does something utterly daft and after that it was just damagw control really.

802~~~
Do you have anyone in mind? Please don't say someone like Shawcross.

803~~~
Still can't believe the two bookings he picked up completely idiotic. The sort of thing you see at pub level!

804~~~
G
What was the point of the first one? Shouldn't he be running back to get in a defensive position? fecking hell, our defenders are daft.

805~~~
If he stayed fit and built a partnership we'd be better off. Smalling, Jones and Evans have never been considered world class and have shown top form in fits and spurts. That's not good enough.

806~~~
Unbelievably naive block the first one then move on. Don't stand and let Joe "head the ref" Hart kick it off you and get booked you idiot! That reeks of inexperience and then diving in once you've been booked for the 2nd booking reeks of inexperience also! Holly feck not happy with him today!

807~~~
Poor today but still our best natural defender. We look better for his pace and strength imo.

That said, in the side that LVG is cultivating, with CBs having so much of the ball, I don't really think he's ideal. Annoying that our best defender is our worst ball player.

808~~~
Inexperience? He's not some kid, he's been in the Prem long enough for that to not be any excuse.

809~~~
Think you are misreading my tone Hed Z I'm having a go at him as he is not inexperienced! So we agree <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

810~~~
Fair enough.

811~~~
Stupidity for the first yellow, reckless decision making for the 2nd, the key problem being both these traits are exactly what you hope defenders <b>do not</b> possess.  Without a doubt, his sending off cost us the game.

That being said, he remains a talented defender still with abit more potential to fulfil before he reaches his maximum capacity.  I don't agree at all with posters saying he should never play again, nor that he should be sold .... he simply had a nightmare, it happens  ... with Rooney once a season, Rafael cost us a few seasons back vs Munich in the CL, there are many examples.

Given our defensive situation, there is no good from throwing him under the bus or disowning him.   We desperately need him to stay fit til January and put together a string of performances.  He is very capable, he simply needs to acquire consistency; in form and concentration.

Im hoping Van Gaal plays him as soon as his suspension is over and Smalling learns from this and kicks on.  Who knows, maybe it will be the making of him.

812~~~
With our injuries I don't think he has a choice, lucky for Smalling

813~~~
Honestly, I can see Smalling becoming a class act. At his prime, Rio was arguably the best and most complete centre back I've seen, so I doubt that he can emulate that class. I don't really see any centre backs at the moment who are there. On a good day, Kompany is thereabouts, but ultimately lacks a little pace in comparison and has plenty of brainfarts. 

Smalling doesn't make all that many mistakes; subsequently, I think you are far too harsh on him. As a centre back, he has mostly produced quality appearances with assured defending but ultimately lacking in finesse, compared to the likes of Rio. Compared to Vidic, on the other hand, I would say that Smalling's ball playing attributes are at least on par to what Vidic could produce when he came to United, and he did improve his game considerably during his stay; there is little to suggest that Smalling cannot do the same. 

His red card isn't typical for Smalling, and thus we shouldn't be too harsh on him for that. It was a terrible tackle and a stupid first yellow; he can really do little but apologize for that. 

Why does it go for a lesser degree for Jones than for Smalling, btw? Jones makes many more silly mistakes than what Smalling does and is often prone to brainfarts, unlike Smalling who is mostly solid in his defending. That's where your agenda shines through; you criticize Smalling for things that he rarely does wrong and lets Jones have a free pass. I agree on Evans though; he has too many mistakes in him for my liking, even though he is very competent on the ball.

814~~~
Great post, mate! 100% agree.

815~~~
Cost us the game today with 2 stupid mistakes (first one especially). It's bad enough losing a man but to do so in such a ridiculous manner is hard to take.

816~~~
Regardless of his idiotic performance today, the writing is on the wall for him. He'll be gone by summer.

817~~~
Agreed, he'll be gone next summer and he won't be the only defender at this club that we'll be saying that about. This, hot on the heels of his disastrous performance at Leicester (admittedly he wasn't alone that day), and it doesn't bode well for Smalling.

Not consistent enough, both in fitness and quality, to be a top defender in my opinion.

818~~~
Only an idiot would sell our best defender.

819~~~
Really disappointed that he didn't build on that Chelsea performance because he needed to, imo. I would give him until January 2016, he and Jones, to see if he can turn his United career around.

820~~~
too much common sense.

he made a couple of mistakes...and yes. it did cost us the match. but sell him?

van Gaal fortunately is not an idiot.

821~~~
Agreed. And if, for some idiotic reason, we do sell him, it better not be to a direct rival.

822~~~
Sell evans before smalling.

823~~~
I can see why people want to persevere with him. Personally, I've lost patience myself but I totally agree with not selling him to a direct rival. Wenger has always been a fan and would be sniffing round him if he's available. Just like with Welbeck, it's not a good idea to sell him to Arsenal in my opinion.

824~~~
I don't know what he was thinking with the first booking. There was no other outcome to what he was doing than a yellow card, its infuriating.

825~~~
He's probably one of my favourite players at the club, and I am losing patience myself. But that's all relative to injuries, nothing else. I would be more than willing to let any of our senior CB's depart (bar Rojo, of course), provided we replace them aptly at this point.

826~~~
Smalling our best defender? Deary fecking me. I know we aren't blessed with the greatest of choice but he's nowhere near Evans - and even he isn't up to standard.

827~~~
When he got that first yellow card, I said to myself "this is like the stupidest way to get a yellow, especially for a defender". Did not surprise me at all that he made another brain dead decision to slide tackle Milner and get that second yellow. I'm not going to be as dramatic as some people here have been, in regards to his future at the club, but there should be serious consequences for what he cost us today. He shouldn't be involved in the starting lineup for a while, providing that we have other, healthy centerbacks to take his place. But knowing our luck with injuries, that's basically impossible, and we'll be forced to play Smalling again. Unless Smalling gets injured himself in training again, which may be the most likely outcome.

828~~~
I don't see a best defender at the club. That's the problem. I'd play Jones as much as possible (if that will ever amount to a good run, given his injury record) as he's probably got a higher ceiling for development. 

But our best defender? We don't have one. We've got players who sometimes play well and sometimes play terrible. We really do not have a solid and reliable defender.

829~~~
Tackle for the 2nd yellow looks worse every time you see it.

830~~~
He should be sacked!!  I hope Paddy McNair can seize this opportunity

831~~~
That's true. He was feck-up prone. The difference, however, is that Rio's talent was unquestionable to a degree Smalling's simply isn't. With Rio it was a matter of ironing out some creases here and there before he could emerge as a world beater - with Smalling it still remains very much unclear whether he will actually cut the mustard for a club like United.

And then there's the general defensive situation. Smalling's creases wouldn't have worried me at all if we didn't have to rely on him - as in, him being spoken of as our best CB, which sadly ain't far from the truth.

832~~~
Completely agree.

833~~~
If there is one of our young CBs who can be material for LVG to turn into the next Holger Badstuber (pre-injury), I would say play him on as long as Smalling is off the pitch. I'm sure LVG disowned somebody to make the space for Badstuber, so it's not impossible to do it again.

There's no such thing as a best defender right now, so I wouldn't mind letting the McNairs, the Thorpes and the Blacketts of this world taking more game time. It should be quite a strong message for the likes of Evans, jones and Smalling to take.

834~~~
Tbh we're arguing over who's the least rubbish. That's not how it should be at Utd and it's been like this for too long now. I think all three ultimately need to go unless there is a sudden step up in composure, footballing intelligence and confidence on the ball. And I don't see that happening any time soon. McNair already looks a better player to me. And Blackett too. But obviously we need experience to go with them. 

I'm not sure that Jones does make more silly mistakes than Smalling though. I would say they're on a par for heart-in-mouth moments. I also wasn't criticising Smalling just for today – as I have said. And I wasn't letting Jones have a free pass at all, only in that he is younger than the other two. That said, I think all Jones needs to sort is his panicky rashness. Whether he ever can is my doubt about him. I think Smalling is far more limited as a player and there doesn't seem to be any progression.

835~~~
Really stupid from him today. I do like him though, so hopefully he is back in the team soon.

836~~~
Absolute idiot today, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. This is the first time he's made that big of a feck up. Vidic made a few.

837~~~
This Jones/ Smalling who's the best/ least shit argument is nonsense. We're all only guessing. Until this surreal rollercoaster ride of injury and suspension ceases and we actually get to see them get 5 or 6 games under their belt, I feel like we're only making up their attributes at this stage. I can't remember what they're like. If it wasn't for the faces, I don't think I'd remember what Phil <i>looks</i> like. Mental stuff.

838~~~
Thing is, it's not just the red card that is Smalling's problem. He gets injured far too often, much like Rafael, Evans and Jones. We can't rely on any of them. Our defense gets rotated practically every match and we can't get a stable back 4 or anything. All of them are also prone to lapses in judgment. When Smalling gets his chance to impress, what does he do? Gets sent off in the most ridiculous manner. Ignore his late tackle that led to his second yellow, wtf was the first yellow about? What the hell was he thinking there? As soon as he got that first yellow, I had the feeling that he would get sent off.

You can't do these things in such an important match and you definetly can't do them when you're facing players like Aguero.

I say - sell the entire defense or use them as squad players at most. They are all too unreliable and that's what pisses me off. Sure, Valencia might be shit when he plays, but at least you can count on him to play when you want him to play. I prefer that than to wonder when is going to get injured again.

Edit: Smalling basically cost us the match. I really think we could have gotten at least a draw out of there, but...

839~~~
I have a question. I'm not defending Smalling here by the way, I think he was very foolish today but under what rule was the first booking? I'm not criticising the ref I genuinely don't know the rule. I mean it's not a dead ball. The Goalie has to get rid of the ball. Why does Smalling have to get out of his way. Why is he allowed have <i>effectively</i> a free kick just because he caught the ball?

840~~~
Smallin has been judged a bit harshly , in fact I think some of the criticism is a bit over the top. Both yellows were deserved but I understand why he was sucked in for the second one. Milner was not fully in contol of the ball and has seemingly pushed the ball to far. I think he thought he had a chance to win that 50/50 ball. Milner was just a bit quicker. A deserved yellow card but quite understandable!

841~~~
I think people are much more upset about the first yellow card.

842~~~
Under Law 12, you cannot prevent a keeper from releasing the ball from his hands. But the law doesn't seem to imply it's an automatic yellow.

843~~~
Cool. Good to know.

844~~~
Even so, he knew he was on a yellow. Thus he should have known better than anyone that he had to be even more careful and be sure at 110% that he can make a play without risking another card.

845~~~
both yellows were absolutely brain-dead. he's let everybody down today.

846~~~
I saw Balotelli do the same thing in the Newcastle game and he didn't get booked or even give a free kick away. Not that that really matters because it was dumb by Smalling. It's frustrating that he has done this because he really could have cemented his spot in the side. Hopefully he gets another chance.

847~~~
Yep, it was really, really stupid of him. Something I'd expect Jones to do before Smalling.

848~~~
Basically true. Sometimes I keep asking myself how some players can still be as braindead as they were when they first joined in.

849~~~
People need to lay off Chris Smalling. Does any United fan really think he needs to be slagged off more after getting fair criticism but more so attacked nastily for what were two costly mistakes?

I feel sorry for the lad - all hyped up about the game, wanted to show how much he cared about the derby and make his presence felt and did that silly thing against Joe Hart. But the ref was an idiot and I question his motive behind the yellow card for that offence. He should have been ticked off, not shown the yellow.

If the ref had been consistent in the first half it might have been understandable but blatantly ignoring attacks on Van Persie under the guise of tackling was unforgiveable. In derbies usually the refs are even-handed and understand that there are going to be some rash challenges. But this jerk decided to make an example of Chris Smalling while Aguero's dangerous actions were yellow card offences.

United fans usually don't hate on their players,let's not do it with a young lad who would have benefited from a mentor such as Rio playing alongside him.

We miss Rio - as Paolo Maldini showed for years you don't need to keep up your youthful quickness if your footballing brain has that predictive ability. I note that when QPR didn't have him on the pitch against Liverpool they did two horrendous own goals. We should have kept Rio.

850~~~
What? QPR didn't have him on the pitch against Liverpool because they had dropped him due to how poor he has been. Leaving Ferdinand and Vidic go was definitely the right decision, trusting three injury prone players to stay fit for the full season was the mistake that the club made.

851~~~
Only just found out that this guy cost 10 million quid. Unbelievable... what have your scouts been doing these past years?

852~~~
He can play. I think he's our best CB personally. One bad error (probably the only one he has ever made) doesn't change that.

853~~~
I hope Van Gaal fines him his wages for the week he can't play for us, but then he goes straight back in the side. 

He needs to understand how stupid that was and how it cost us the game, but there's no sense freezing him out for an extended period and LVG showing confidence in him might be what he needs to kick on for us.

854~~~
Yes and in Rio's absence two QPR defenders, one of whom was veteran Richard Dunne, made atrocious schoolboy mistakes that gave Liverpool 2 goals and the match. One shocking own goal happens but then another comes along to gift a struggling, useless Liverpool points they couldn't have deserved less.

Rio was speedy until the last few years of his time at United but he always relied more on keeping calm and predicting accurately what was going to happen. Lack of experienced defenders who have done it all is United's problem at the moment and more so somebody like Rio who would mentor Smalling if he were still at United.

855~~~
I'd like Smalling to apologise to the fans and offer the fine himself. But yes, I'd like him to get back in the team.

856~~~
He doesn't actually prevent the keeper releasing the ball is the thing.

If you are standing inside the box (which is illegal on a GK) trying to block the keepers kick then I can understand it being a foul (although the same sort of thing happens on virtually every FK)... If you are outside of the box then I fail to see how it is a foul. How far outside the box must you then be for it not to be considered a block?

Like the Balotelli one, he didn't get booked or penalised and rightly so for me. If you are outside of the box and not allowed inside, it isn't difficult for a keeper to avoid hitting the ball at you.

857~~~
I really want to be measured in my response to Smalling but he was a complete idiot today.  I won't argue he cost us the game, but such an argument would not be unreasonable.

For me, McNair has already shown he's the better defender, even if he drifted off Aguero on the goal.

858~~~
People calling for him to never play for United again. Bit of an overreaction?

859~~~
OTT, Rooney got sent off for a stupid tackle as well and they calling for his head, it all changed after a week as it usually does with fickle fans.

860~~~
Didn't vidic score an OG in his first game.

The merits of Smalling aside, we're lacking a solid experienced back line.

Smalling and another solid CB could work... Rojo ain't a CB, shaw is young, and Valencia ain't a RB. What are we playing at?

We've got a McLaren F1 with space saver wheels.

861~~~
Absolutely crazy. McNair, who has played three matches, has shown to be a better defender than Smalling? Someone who has international caps and CL experience.

862~~~
Yes overreaction (because we probably need him if others are injured again)

But to be honest he's table position 6-10th place level (Everton, Southampton, Hull), too many times injured, brainless and not a LVG type of defender (He isn't good enough on the ball)

863~~~
Just saw the game. Absolute stupidity. I was lost for words when I saw the second foul. You don't go lunging in like that when you're already on a yellow; especially one that could've been avoided in the first place. Result was up for grabs but he sealed it. Idiot.

864~~~
He's better than Jones.

865~~~
First yellows was just stupid. He should have never been there or even looking to block the kick. Second yellow I can kinda understand as he was drawn in by the City players' poor touch. Not the brightest idea to be diving in though when you are already on a yellow. Understandably a few over the top reactions from some fans, as much of the blame for the lose falls on him, but he is still one of our better CB and probably deserves to be a starter based on his ability. I wouldn't mind seeing him get dropped for an extra game after his suspension is over to make a point, but after that he should be straight back in the team.

866~~~
He's been fine/good this season, and similar with a higher performance ceiling last season. He does push boundaries sometimes but this bout of silliness should really be looked at in isolation. Shame, considering he'd been our best defender of late.

867~~~
Rooney got sent off in the 76th minute or so and as stupid as that was, we were already leading and we did not lose points. This moron got himself sent off for 2 stupidly mind numbing cards within the span of 10 mins and before half time, costing us the game. Big difference between the two. I'm still fuming at the sight of his stupid face.

868~~~
Rooney his tackle was so stupid, that it cost us/him 3 matches, just as stupid as Smalling his red card, the Rooney tackle is one of the dumbest I have seen.

869~~~
Both were stupid and I just think this one was worse. Leaving your team short of a man for 60+ minutes of a derby game away is just a cardinal sin, no matter how anyone spins it.

870~~~
Smalling has regressed after having done well in his first two seasons. Perhaps the riches and lifestyle has got to his head, and no longer seems to have the hunger and drive. Really needs a hard kick up the arse.

871~~~
I think it was obvious in the derby that Chris Smalling has hunger and drive.

He didn't make those two costly mistakes because he hasn't any drive or doesn't care - he made them because he cared a lot and was keen to make an impact. He did - in the worst way - but it's unfair to label his actions in the way you have.

872~~~
Must also come under delaying the restart of play. Given keepers have an informal period of time in which they have to release the ball delaying it must be an infringement. Ungentlemanly conduct or something

873~~~
No. It was clear what Rooney was trying to do he just got the timing wrong. It was an attempt to take one for the team gone wrong, and understandable too given how we'd been caught on the break the week before at Leicester. What Smalling did yesterday I just cannot understand. Still. Neither booking. One of the most pointless united sendings off surely. Idiot.

874~~~
Some of the comments in here are asylum-worthy. 

Smalling's ace, despite the idiocy of yesterday's bookings. Fairly pissed off with Oliver, too, for allowing Zabaleta a free pass on his <i>identical</i> challenge on van Persie not ten minutes beforehand. 

Genuine lolz.

875~~~
Well let me ask you a question, Do you honestly believe this 'ace' Smalling is at the level he should be by now? He joined the club in 2010, and while I think he has obviously got better with experience, he is no where near the level he should be at now. Jones is going exactly the same way, and we just cannot afford to carry these passengers any longer, If I was Van Gaal i'd keep one of Jones, Evans or Smalling as cover and get rid of the other 2. We need more reliability and to be truly honest, Accomplished defenders.

876~~~
Would just like to add that I don't think it's fair to compare Smalling to Rooney or Vidic...the latter two have proven themselves over long and distinguished careers at the club and have led our team to trophies on numerous occasions. Smalling has been here for 4 years, and it's precisely because of his experience at the club and at the international level that more is expected out of him but he has not consistently delivered the goods, and on occasion even makes major mistakes.

Even against Chelsea, Smalling was getting caught out on several occasions. Not saying Smalling should be sacked because of his performance against City, but as a whole, I really don't think he is good enough to be leading our back line and don't think he ever will be (compare him at 24 to Rio or Vidic at 24).

877~~~
Or perhaps Ferguson decimated his confidence during the most crucial period of player development. Laughable management and I was saying this years back. To this day, I still can't believe the stupidity of such an intelligent to bloke to allow the very same thing he let happen to the midfield, happen to the defence. I'm losing faith in the developing youth argument. It's just bullshit. We're better off just buying ready made stars because the last few years suggest to me that we just aren't willing to give the imports the games they need to actually develop. I've said it before, but Raphael Varane snubbing us for Madrid is the best career move I've seen in a while and that is a sad reality. Rio would probably still be here and ahead of him now had Ferguson not packed in.

878~~~
Smalling deserves all the stick he gets for what he did yesterday. Of course, this one game has feck all to do with how good he actually is and whether he does or does not have a future at United. Bit weird (but depressingly predictable) that so many have leaped from being angry at the red card to drawing far-reaching conclusions on his abilities as a footballer based on a couple of moments of madness.

879~~~
I’m fed up with Smalling. He was ver very good during his second season with us playing as a right back, but since, he’s been awfull. Playing few games, being overrated by most in England, just because he’s English. He’s an absolute nightmare at the back, and will never be the next Rio Ferdinand.

The guys is in his 5th season with us and still considered as a rookie. But that’s only because we can’t trust him. He had a good game against Chelsea because Drogba didn’t offered much, but when Hazard came to him, he destroyed him…

We all know how a dumbass he’s when he enters a pitch, but yesterday was the culmination of it….He’s an athlete it’s true, he’s damn fast and his very good at defensive header, but with the ball, his intelligence, his positional… he’s such a clown.

To be fair with the rest of the group, the club and his own philosophy, Van Gaal should get rid of him rather than later. And it’s the same for Jones also. Those two have been touted as the next England captains, but only on FIFA.

LVG sacked Welbz and Clev without feeling because he thought at the time that they weren’t good enough for him, and they won’t be useful this season… What about Smalling and co?  He should sell them and buy fit defenders even less “talented” because they’re not good enough to play for us

Mr Smalling, you’re a fool, good night haha

880~~~
I have to agree.

881~~~
If he is a clown then Rojo, Jones and the rest must be much, much worse.

882~~~
I rate Rojo even lesser than Smalling. Regarding Jones, his headless game is causing his troubles, but Smalling... I can't

883~~~
Bullshit.

884~~~
Rooney's red was far earlier than that, we were hanging on for nearly all the second half because of it.

885~~~
I was seething yesterday but since now I have cooled off, I think that was a totally uncharacteristic couple of yellow cards for Smalling. He is not at all like that so I will give him the benefit of doubt. Hope he gets the chance to acquit himself soon.

886~~~
I feel the same way. It was stupid but if anything it will stop him from doing such a stupid thing again in the future. I believe in him as a defender.

887~~~
Pretty much. I have seen far worse and stupid red cards from United players in the past than this. Surely it did put us on the backfoot for the rest of the match but one mistake (or 2 in this case) does not make a defender bad.

888~~~
Giving him a fine won't do it, he's not living in poverty. If it mean't he, his wife and his kids couldn't eat for a few days then perhaps he would learn his lesson but essentially it just means his bank statement will have 50k less added to the pile of cash already in there.

20 lashes and then we put it behind us.

889~~~
The worst thing was blocking Joe Hart. If it was the last 10 minutes or something fair enough, but doing it that early was just needless. I knew from then on he would have to be very careful. 

It's a shame as I really like him as a defender, he was solid against Chelsea and then tarnishes himself with doing something like that. He has obviously annoyed LVG too, so that doesn't sit well for him.

He will no doubt know he has made a massive mistake anyway, so there's no need to keep harping on about it.

890~~~
Huge mistake and very silly. Doesn't make him a shite footballer like some of the knee-jerkers in here will have you believe, I actually felt a run of games could see him step up a level as he looked decent (not world class) against Chelsea.

He'll learn from it. For me the biggest concern with him and Jones is fitness rather than potential ability.

891~~~
That was weird, if I had to line up our defender in order of the most likely to do such stupid things he would be the last. As annoying as it was, I still believe in him.

892~~~
Not even this ..... how many people were calling for Vidic's head every time he got a red card vs a rival of ours?

893~~~

894~~~
In the heat of the match, it's understandable that people were pissed off with Smalling. They were both pretty idiotic bookings and certainly dimished our chances of getting anything from the game and put a spanner in the works of our growing progression. However, I do think he's been one of our betters players this season so far when he has played and it was pretty uncharateristic of him. I'm sure he was pissed off with himself and disappointed and since he is young, I'm sure he will learn from it.

895~~~
Not really the day for Virgin to be mocking anyone about one way trips...

896~~~
Was a huge fan of his back in 2011 but he has gone backwards if anything. Strange how there is such a split view on who is our best defender but Smalling has done nothing for the past 2 seasons to suggest he is good enough. The sad thing is neither has Jones, and Evans can't keep fit and hasn't looked good since 12/13, so worrying.

897~~~
I was surprised at his stupidity. It was very uncharacteristic, his disciplinary record for us exemplary to be fair to him.

898~~~
We have more than enough defenders, but when 4 of them are effectively part timers due to their injuries, we suffer miserably by keeping them.  I think its time to flog Smalling and Evans or Jones, and bring in a world class centre back or two, and a good natural rightback in.

899~~~
That is so true. Tweet them that back!

900~~~
Very very annoying display from Smalling. He made himself look a real twa* in that game. Needs to man-up and mature quickly, or be shipped out and replaced.

901~~~
I don't tweet. You can have that one for free!

902~~~
Exactly, yet going by some of the posts here you'd think he was constantly rash and getting himself sent off.

He's usually a solid defender with limited ability on the ball and an annoying habit of being injured. He's rarely let us down, unless being injured somehow counts, and so these calls to get rid are mostly knee jerk nonsense. I'm pretty sure if you went back a week or so in this thread you had everyone saying how great he was, and our best defender etc.

903~~~
For the second, It's as if he forgot he was on a yellow. For the first, it's as if he forgot he was a centre back.

904~~~
Smalling and Jones are in a league of stupidity of their own. Don't even start dragging the other centre backs in with them two idiots.

905~~~
Evans has probably made more stupid mistakes than Smalling has for us. Rojo and Blackett have both also made a couple of brainfarts in their few appearances.

906~~~
Smalling is far from stupid.

907~~~
Well in the real world we deal with evidence.

908~~~
It was uncharacteristic from Smalling.

909~~~
A couple silly mistakes in one game (be it a huge derby) doesn't suddenly make the player shit. The comments I'm seeing in this thread are embarrassing.

910~~~
Smalling needs to learn from this and put it behind him - if he doesn't he'll end up being an absolute liability like Rafael, i cringe every-time that boy gets a yellow card.

911~~~
Silly mistake or no silly mistake.....brainless or no brainless...Smalling is here in his 5th season and is average

912~~~
I understand people critising Smalling after his performance and his mistakes, as LvG pointed politely out, weren't the smartest decisions. I understand people being angry and in some way he was at fault for losing the derby, because already struggling with many injuries at the back, we didn't really have any decent defender to bring on and will be struggling even more in the coming weeks with Rojos injury and Smalling being suspended. But we also shouldn't just judge him just on that performance. Last week he played a really good game against Chelsea and clearly showed that he is able to play on that high level. 

He will learn from his mistakes and considering how big of a game it was, I don't think he will do anything that stupid again in the future.

913~~~
Everyone is pissed at him at rightly so. But some of the comments are even more ridiculous than Smalling yesterday.

I cant believe I have to defend Smalling here after yesterdays game but he's certainly a quality defender

914~~~
We are saying the same about Jones and his injuries. He doesn't learn. He was reckless in his Blackburn days and is still reckless in October/November 2014.

915~~~
I don't think that's really applicable to Jones though - the deda that he causes his own injuries is way overblown.  Yes, his style of play makes them more likely than some other players, much the same could probably be said for Robbo and a lot of other great players.  But at the end of the day it's a combination of being easily injured (which may be a problem that hinders his United career, but is one that he can't help) or unlucky.  I for one wouldn't want him to try and change how he plays.

916~~~
How many mistakes like that did Smalling make then? 

You can argue that he has some flaws in his game or made some mistakes in certain games, but I wouldn't count him to the players who get sent off for making stupid decisions. 

The Jones comparison is not the best to be honest and also implying that he or they 'doesn't learn'. I certainly noticed that Smalling looked far more comfortable on the ball and distributed it better, so it looks like he learned in that department of his game.

917~~~
I wasn't happy with Smalling but, in retrospect, allowances must be made. We did not have a recognised right back which means that our central defenders were being dragged out wide. Jones, had he played, might well have made the same error. The first yellow was stupid, the second born of desperation.

918~~~
Idiotic bookings for Smalling when he should have known better. Worrying thing is, he's not the only one. United players are getting bookings for stupid fouls and stuff this year. Players need to learn very quickly that taking a booking should be the last resort, staying on the pitch and helping your team needs to come first.

919~~~
I don't see why Smalling was even given a yellow for the first incident. You see players doing that all the time. Samuel Eto'o did it a lot last season playing for Chelsea and he wasn't yellow carded once.

920~~~
That should kill any discussion from now on. When there's no or very little progress going into a 5th season, that's usually more than enough to cut all ties with a player.

921~~~
I have to agree to be honest. There was huge potential there when he arrived and there still is huge potential. I just don't think he has the capacity or body to recognise it which means it's absolutely pointless sticking with him.

922~~~
Can say the same about Jones, even if he's younger. No progression whatsoever

923~~~
Meh, we had Nani and Anderson for ever it seems and there was always this 'potential' argued upon. fwiw, I still have a little belief that Smalling will come good.

924~~~
The problem for Smalling is yes! he has been here 5 seasons and is not a youngster anymore, but due to SAF playing him (plus Jones) out of position in the later years...this is in fact his first season as a CB.

I fear for all three of Evans/Smalling/Jones because LVG doesn't have any attachment to them so poor performances like Saturday will be what he judges Smalling on and not what he did 5 years ago in a Fulham shirt etc.

925~~~
Send that 12 year old looking piece of garbage back to the 3rd division where he came from and where he belongs before he causes another catastrophe. I'm getting really fed up with his sad face walking down the side line.

926~~~
This is beyond childish.

927~~~
You've got to ask yourself why he played them there. It was clearly for their development as much as "because we didn't have another backup RB." He felt they couldn't be trusted just yet so he stuck with Rio and Vida even while they were declining, although their decline steepened rapidly when he left. If they proved themselves more and had a steeper learning curve he would have trusted them at CB far more often just like he did with Evans when he was younger. Evans as a 19-24 year old performed at a far more consistent and higher level than either of them did.

928~~~
Talk about being childish, this has to be 1 of the worst comments ive seen on the forum.
FYI that's the first time Smalling has been sent off in 151 appearances. He has never has a straight red in his career. That was his <b>first</b> red card.

929~~~
Aye. And I have to admit that I'm picking up some Nani/Ando/Clev vibes from these defenders of ours. Unfair, probably - but there you go.

930~~~
I'd agree with that, definitely. Also, Evans' peak thus far was significantly higher than anything Smalling or Jones have shown. The fact is that Evans looked like he was right on the verge of becoming a top CB at one time.

It can all be explained (away) if one makes an effort, of course. Injuries, never getting a good run of games, being played out of position, etc. You can only persist with these explanations for so long, though, before they start looking like mere excuses.

And, yes - Fergie often purposely played youngsters out of position (within reason - a CB getting games at fullback in order to gain experience and develop his game is hardly unheard of, and shouldn't be detrimental to his development).

931~~~
Biggest problem  for me is the whole playing people out of position. This is why I thought Smalling and Jones should have been loaned out if we were not going to phase out Rio and Vidic. Injuries didnt help but I think we didnt make use of the loan system well enough for these two. I actually think Evans should have been out on loan for another year too.

Given CBs can last until their mid 30s, and most go into their prime around 29 or so, I think its obvious why they havent developed. Players need to play consistently as well in their own position. (and stay injury free)

932~~~
Smalling will be 25 in a few weeks. Time to sell him. Sometimes good and sometimes bad, but the guy will never be good enough. I always felt that Jones is the better defender, i still think he is. I dont know why people say it is overreaction, i always said he isnt good enough. If Fletcher and Cleverley arent good enough, Smalling isnt too. Just because some have high expectations or see something in him that others dont, it doesnt mean he should be given time. Next year the same things will happen again with Smalling, brainfarts and injuries. No, he had enough time, just like all the other players we sold and werent good enough. Time to get our money back.

933~~~
I was as frustrated as anyone at that red card, however some of the reactions from people on here (and our fans in general) is very disappointing and hugely exaggerated. He is nowhere near the type of liability that people are making out. Some seem to have convinced themselves that he's a red card waiting to happen - well, that was his first sending off in professional football to my knowledge (which is quite impressive for a young CB though he chose the worst possible time to get hist first red).

934~~~
Has he said what he was thinking regarding the first booking? Was it a case of him thinking we were on the attack and lost the ball into Harts hand and had to stop a counter? I couldnt quite see it as it looked like we were 4-2 advantage at the back anyway. 

I agree that a lot of the reactions to him have been exaggerated and disappointing. Some even saying he should never ever play for us again. Its as if hes the first person to ever do something like that.

935~~~
Jones is a brainless defender who only acts on instinct, we spent 18M on him too! Either we've failed to develop these players properly or they're just not good enough. Evans should be first to go. Enough is enough

936~~~
I don't believe anyone is suggesting that Smalling would now be a World Class CB if he hadn't been played out of position so often.

I just hope the development of McNair and Blackett is handled differently to that of Smalling and Jones.

<a class="username" data-user="26997, @Sylar" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26997/">@Sylar</a> I agree, and thankfully Blind hasn't been moved around in the same manner. 

Let players sink or swim in their preferred positions! if the team has no room to blood a youngster then loan them out.

937~~~
The last sentence is what I think a lot of people would probably agree with <a class="username" data-user="81376, @RuudTom83" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81376/">@RuudTom83</a> 

It could be argued we havent "properly" developed Evans, Smalling, Jones, Oshea, Cleverley, Welbeck, Macheda.

Some have even argued Rooney (and theres a case for that but I guess his development was sacrificed to get the best out of Ronaldo). Probably for another thread, but given how most if not all of them started, and how theyre looking, it seems like wasted talent due to injuries, playing out of position, not playing at all, bad loan spells.

938~~~
Yeah, well that's just silly - and isn't supported by the facts at all. The problem clearly is not that he's a red card waiting to happen. The frustration on display is more general, I think, at least the frustration of more reasonable fans. It's the fact that we don't have a set of defenders we can rely upon - and Smalling's brain fart sort of underlines that.

939~~~
Not that it's much of a defence but I think yesterday was a bit of a one off from Smalling. His error yesterday wasn't bad defending but 2 acts of stupidity. I don't recall him having many braindead moments during his time here.

940~~~
With all due respect, that red card was, as the old saying says, the straw that broke the camel's back. He will be 25 soon, so there's not much hope nor room for improvement left if he is still average at that age, and you combine that red card to all the poor performances he accumulated over the last few years (even without a red card).

941~~~
He's better than average defensively. A lot of those poor performances came when he was playing as a RB. As a CB he has been quite good.

942~~~
This whole "playing out of position" thing is one of the most ridiculous things this forum has came out with during the past five years.

Lot of players have switched positions and adopted different roles through their carrers without that being detrimental to their development as players or their importance in a system.

943~~~
According to who? Rio Ferdinand wasn't exactly the best defender in England at the age of 25, he was clumsy and did a lof of mistakes during his first years with us, just from 2006 he became the defender we needed.

944~~~
You forgot one detail: he was already Leeds United's captain by that age. At that time when Leeds were still respectable as a team, he had already shown that he was capable of picking himself up. Into his third season with United (2004-05), he earned enough credentials to wear the armband a few times when Roy Keane was deemed not fit enough to play. I just never saw that ability of picking oneself up with Smalling and I don't think we ever will.

945~~~
Wasn't on here yesterday and kind of glad, because I can only imagine the shit Smalling received. Admittedly, a lot of criticism is deserved, it was as stupid a sending off as you will see but at the end of the day, he has made a mistake, that's all. He hasn't cost our season, he hasn't disgraced the club like some want to believe.

For me, it shouldn't be a debate about his future. The Jones, Evans, Smalling debate goes around in circles and is a never ending debate. It changes on every performance. Last week Smalling was at the top of the trio with a good performance against Chelsea, now he is at the bottom of the list with the send off against City.

As stupid as it was and as disappointed as I am with him, he will have my full support the next time he plays for us, something I worry he won't have by many judging by the reaction.

946~~~
That doesn't mean we should expect it from all players.

947~~~
Agree, when he's played centrehalf this season, he's usually been our best defender. Seems the lad is this seasons whipping boy. Yep made a mistake & first red card of his United career, in a game we would most likely have lost even if it ended 11 v 11, but let that not stop the critics spouting the same bile over & over again. Sack Fergie, sell Giggs brigade is out in full force!

948~~~
I can remember Rio moving into CDM position and being gash & getting a red card. 

I think you're failing to grasp at how many players simply cannot perform to usual levels if "shoved out on the wing". Yes a select few can play numerous role. The vast majority are specialists in their position & it affects their performances if they swap roles. Rooney is a prime example, can do ok on the wing & ok in midfield but he's simply a better striker. Smalling is a very good central defender & should be used as such, I don't see Van Gaal playing him out of position and obviously rates him or he'd be lining up for La Arse....

949~~~
I have a question...why exactly do many United fans call Smalling dumb? I personally think it stems from his costume 'incident' but how does this transfer over to football intelligence (it doesn't)? And also, is there any other negative publicity he generated off the field besides the costume thing?

950~~~
For that matter he was often solid enough in a purely defensive sense at RB too. He's not easy to get past - very good in that sense, nobody will deny that. The problem is that he needs to develop his game beyond the pure brick wall quality - which is great in itself, but simply not enough for a top player in this day and age.

951~~~
Absolutely. It is rarely a problem at all if the player in question is good enough. It's a matter of developing your game, improving your understanding, etc. That was always Fergie's idea, at least - and it's hardly madness if you ask me.

952~~~
How to dribble like Smalling:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsgHjB9r6l4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

953~~~
Is he back from suspension for the Arsenal game?

954~~~
Should be - he only got a one match ban.

955~~~
Yep I'd assume he'll be available and starting.

956~~~
And he should start against Arsenal.  If he manages to get back from International duty fit, he will be our best fit defender.  The red was a silly mistake but his first red for United I think, regardless, he isn't the first player to have made a mistake that has cost us - and won't be the last.
His pace will be needed against a pacey Arsenal side.

957~~~
Nice boost for Arsenal.

958~~~
Would be if we sold him to them like they wanted

959~~~
Then it would be a nice boost for us!

960~~~
First red in his career I believe.

Silly mistake, one that the fans need to get over.

961~~~
Overrated and injury prone, sell him in the summer.

962~~~
Not a lesson he'll ever forget and overall when fit he's played well as a CB, so will be a welcome return especially if it means Carrick is able to fill in for Blind.

963~~~
Paul Scholes was a striker. He was moved in CM and he went on with his job to become the best in England's CM of his generation. Pirlo did the same in Italy. The likes of Mattheus and Rijkaard move from midfield to defense.

We defend players too much these days. Instead of saying that Smalling should thank his lucky stars from moving from non league to Manchester United in such a short period of time we blame SAF for playing him in a slightly different position. Guess what? The CB role is a hell of a risky job and one mistake can ruin a player's confidence. Moving defenders a full back role is a decent way to give young defenders some football time without putting them under so much pressure. If Smalling had gone confused between defending as right back and defending as central back then maybe he should have never left Maidstone United in the first place.

964~~~
The players you mention are all pretty special footballers in their own right.  Not every footballer is as versatile as them.  The full back and centre back positions at a top level club are very, very different.  Many may be able to play both positions but clearly Smalling isn't that adaptable, to say he should be back in the conference because of it is horseshit.

965~~~
Poor logic comparisons. Those players were moved to other roles primarily because it was felt they would excel in the new roles. As you said, CB is a risky and important position - a mistake at CB is far more costly than in other areas of the pitch usually. 

Its not about "being confused between defending as RB and CB", its about getting actual first team football experience in the CB position. Do you seriously expect a player who has rarely and irregularly played at CB over the past 3 years, to instantly become consistent and experienced in that position? It just doesnt work. There is no doubt for me that by playing the likes of Jones and Smalling out of position he has hampered their development - we should have phased out Rio/Vidic earlier, and/or sent the youngsters on loan to a club where they would be getting regular gametime at CB.

966~~~
Was absolutely furious with Smalling after his stupid sending off, but he is still the best central defender we have. Need to start him against Arsenal along with Thorpe. McNair has looked good, but Thorpe is the more experienced and better defender.

967~~~
The key words that keep popping up in this thread are 'when fit.'  The main problem is that he usually isn't.

968~~~
Not really. Pirlo's career wasn't that great prior to him being moved in CM. Same as Scholes. He was considered as a promising player however he was moved in CM because they were question marks whether he had the physique to play upfront or not. Both Scholes and Pirlo took a rather challenging situation, they made the best out of it and guess what, they became special players in their own right.

969~~~
They took the role for numerous reasons, which include technical characteristics (Pirlo wasn't really doing well upfront), physique (Scholes was considered too small to lead the line) or age was catching up. It was a matter of either adapting to this new role or risk not playing at top level anymore. Guess what? They took the challenge, they settled down immediately and became legends

Smalling has been at the club for 3 years, getting regular football at one of the finest clubs in the world. He worked alongside some of the very best defenders in the world. Is that so nerve wracking for poor Smalling to shift a couple of meters in the center?

970~~~
Smalling is a natural centre back who was better defensively at right back than Rafael's usual standard. He is our best option defensively regardless of the injury situation and we should all be happy to have him available against Arsenal. Selecting him after two errors of judgement is a vote of confidence that I'm confident he will be worthy of.

971~~~
Whilst I wouldn't go so far as to say he is better than Rafael at RB, I would agree that he is our best CB when fit. A mistake is a mistake and there are plenty of times when our CB's had to foul players and take yellows and reds because the fullbacks lost their man. We gave away so many pens in Evra's last year because he'd lose his man and force the CB to act. Smalling had to make the choice do I go in and risk another yellow or let him come in and possible score? He made the wrong choice, obviously, but it does not mean he's a bad player...

972~~~
The comparisons really just dont stick. We are talking about young players who are expected to become good CBs in the future, not being given gametime in that position, and then being expected to walk straight into that position with no inconsistencies or mistakes.
Smalling in particular, has (until the City game) been one of our most consistent players - the City game was the first red card of his career, yet straight away the armchair fans jump on his back proclaiming that he has been average for years. He has been average playing at RB - yet we continued to play him there even though it was not working (to an extent)?

Again we arent talking about an established player being moved FROM their "natural" position, or an older player re-defining themselves a-la Giggs, we are talking about a youngster whose natural position was agreed to be at CB, and instead of being played there, they were played at RB, at a time in their career where they need to get regular gametime in order to develop.

Your comment about <i>"shift a couple of meters in the center"</i> is shockingly ignorant as well. Do you really think there is no difference in playing at CB and FB, at a club like United? Our FBs have always been an integral part of our attack, providing width and overlapping with wingers. Not quite the same.

973~~~
What if we moved Vidic to right back, do you think he'd do a good job? Or manage to improve overall so when he's moved to centerhalf he looks natural and ready?

Sometimes players are only really right for one position.

974~~~
If we then moved Vidic back in CB would he become shite because he hasn't played as a CB for some time?

975~~~
I'm sorry but any young player whose development is hindered by being played out of position as he's coming through, isn't going to make it at the top level - it should be a good opportunity to develop new skills. Having said that, I don't think Smalling's done here by any means. Still a good defender in there waiting to come out.

976~~~
I really don't like Smalling, if he's the best we've got then we're fecked, would rather flog him when we finally get some reinforcements in, for me Jones is the best we have.

Don't think Van Gaal really likes the look of Thorpe, is a bit sad that he hasn't been given a chance really.

977~~~
I am not referring about his performance. I am talking about the concept that just because a player may not have played as much as he did in his natural role then that alone would sort of ruin him or keep him back from developing. It doesn't work that way. There had been a number of quality managers who moved their young defenders around through the years. Maldini was supposed to be a CB (a role which he still covered magnificently). He was moved as LB because of his young age then back to CB. It didn't hurt him one bit. Same as Giuseppe Bergomi who flirted from CB to RB. Do you think that the likes of SAF and Sacchi were shocking ignorant too or was SAF aiming to ruin poor little Smalling career for good?

And 'moving a few meters in the center' was exactly what Smalling did. He was never expected to play as the typical full back who ran up and down the flank creating chances, delivering crosses and causing problems to the opponents defense. No one expected him to be an Evra, a Maldini, a Zanetti or even a Gaz for all that matter. He was mainly just a CB playing on the right ie focusing on the defending part of the game. If shit hits fan Rio and Vidic would cover up for him. Not to forget Valencia whose pretty sound in defense too. I don't know what you think but I think that's one hell of opportunity for a young CB to learn from the best in a safe and relatively pressure free environment.

978~~~
Your point of view on this is just weird.

At any level of pretty much any sport, most players will take time in a certain position to be called truly proficient at it even if they've already been playing a similar one. Smalling in his time at CB has shown a lot more games than not that he is a quality CB and with benefit of more games there, could continue to improve though.

The red card against City though had nothing to do with being poor or due to lack of experience - it was a day of sheer stupidity, something even the best in the world have had.

The only thing to be concerned about is if he has the mental fortitude to put it behind him as a one off, as everyone here should be and move on.

979~~~
My point is that a CB's development won't stall just because he had been moved to fullback to gain first team experience. Actually it would be much worse off if he didn't play at all and with Rio/Vidic in their prime that's exactly what would have happened if SAF saw him as just a CB

980~~~
My god, I agree with devilish.

981~~~
Me too.

The only way playing matches out of position could significantly hinder any footballers development would be if that was the only time they played football. Smalling will have been intensively coached and trained in central defence throughout his United career, where he was only ever an injury or two away from first choice from that position.

982~~~
O'Shea and Brown rarely had a settled position at United, being shunted from fullback to CB and to CM at times in O'shea's case never stopped them delivering at a respectably high level for us.

983~~~
Well we appear to have reached an impassé then.

I for one think that if you take a young CB with potential, dont play them regularly at CB for a few years, then put them at CB without anyone with any experience alongside them, that they are going to make mistakes and at times, struggle.

Your examples all seem to be cases of existing players who HAVE played their natural positions (or what was seen as their natural position at the time) being moved to a secondary position - not a young, developing player NOT being played in their natural position, but rather their secondary position, then being expected to fit straight in in the primary position with no sort of transition.

Again I will refer you to the context - we had an established partnership of Rio and Vidic, both of whom were getting old. It was expected by lots of fans that Smalling and Jones would be the natural replacements. Therefore the simple thing to do is to phase in the youngsters, give them gametime playing alongside a veteran, especially in the easier fixtures. If they need to cover at RB now and then, so be it, but you give them gametime in the position you are expected them to end up playing, you give them a chance to understand the position in our team, and you partner them with an experienced player who can guide and instruct them. It isnt rocket science. Unfortunately, in SAFs final season(s) and Moyes' season, we did not do this, and suddenly both Rio and Vidic are gone and Smalling and Jones are expected to immediately replace them. Doesnt sound viable to me.

I take it that your views on Jones are identical, as he has stagnated in much the same way, and (in my opinion) as a result of the same issues as with Smalling (ie being played out of position when developing)?

984~~~
Aren't you a funny fecker! Disregarding his brainfarts against City, he's been very solid defensively this season. Against Chelsea, his passing was even good-ish.

985~~~
If it's been done in his early years as a senior player, then it's certainly possible.

Smalling simply never got the chance to mature enough as a centerhalf. If he had, then moving him to right back and then back to centerhalf shouldn't have made a big difference. But being moved in his formative years in the seniors is another story. Same goes for other defenders who have the build and abilities of a centerhalf and not a fullback.

Playing as right back was probably better for Smalling than not playing at all. But it might not have been the optimal thing he needed in order to fulfill his potential in the center.

986~~~
While Young and Anderson are most likely done in this club, it's a time of defining moments for Smalling in Manchester United.

Perfect chance for him to prove something as Van Gaal planning serious reforms in this club.

987~~~
Thanks man. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>He's been solid defensively? He's had one good performance and that was against Chelsea, he cost us the points against City, was poor against Leicester when he came on and before that I think he played in our defeat to Swansea and 30 minutes vs Sunderland if I am not mistaken, so I don't see any particularly solid performances this season at all barring one. Him, Evans and Jones have been given more than enough time to cut out the idiocy and get toughened up, all 3 are liabilities to getting a settled back 4 which is vital.

988~~~
Smalling so far has delivered very good performances at CB and at RB he has always been good defensively, just hasn't offered a lot going forward except for perhaps right at the start - which IMO is reason he kept getting put at RB because he didn't start off half bad going forward, just progressively got worse in that department for some reason.

His problem more than anything is staying fit than not getting enough time as CB.

989~~~
I think he had/has fragile confidence anyway. Putting him at right back and thrusting the ball to him as he stood isolated on the byline just made it even worse.

However, you'd think it's still better than not playing at all. I guess it's on an individual by individual basis.

990~~~
I generally agree with devilish but imo all the good training in the world can't make up for the experience that is gained from playing week in and week out. I believe that this is the key factor for any player to reach his full potential.

The CB position is very difficult because almost all the time the direction of the ball is in favor of the attacker and the CB actually has to defend the space behind his back. So, good positioning and the ability to read the game and the opponent's off the ball movement from his deeper position are essential for any good CB. Imho you need gaming experience (unless you are Maldini) to develop this ability and this is why we still see CBs way beyond their 30's who have lost their pace but still manage to be competitive at top level. 

I believe our CBs are good players, Smalling included. But good doesn't necessarily mean good enough for United. It's an interesting season we're going through with all three of our most experienced defenders out of the club. Smalling and all the others must cease the opportunity and show that they can lead the defense. I really like the fact that LvG has mentioned that he plans to use Smalling and Jones as CBs, they need that to build some confidence. Just look how confident Shaw looks on the pitch after having played two full seasons at LB for Southampton. By the end of the season we'll know if we're going to be looking for new defenders in the transfer market.

991~~~
I totally agree, and i would add players like Abidal, Thuram, Henry, Desailly or even Iniesta. In a way playing out of position developed other qualities in them.

992~~~
Just a waste of time talking about his potential. If he's constantly injured, how can we expect him to improve. I really don't think United will have the patience to keep waiting for players like Evans, Smalling, Jones on a regular basis. It's not their fault of course, it just part of football but right now we need progression rather than stagnation and if it means cutting your losses and brining someone more able, then so be it.

993~~~
Him and Jones have the talent i think, it's just a gamble for the club as to whether we get to see it. I remember Rio having issues with injuries early on (albeit he was much more talented and 3 times as costly) but he ultimately grew out of it until well into his thirties. Him and Jones were not only meant to take the baton from Rio and Vidic, they were supposed to usurp them. But as it was they were still lining up together in their mid-thirties against Sunderland at the end of last season, and here we are with a void to fill. If we're keeping one/both we will need to sign another.

994~~~
Was he really played as a RB though? Was he expected to run up and down the flanks, causing damage to the opponent's defense while keeping an eye to the defensive side of the game? In my opinion Smalling was expected to be a more of a right sided center back. He focused more in the defensive part of the game and he did that knowing that if he committed any mistakes then probably Vidic, Rio or Valencia will cover his arse. 

This tactic (ie moving a CB to other positions) has been around for longer then we think and had been instrumental in developing some of the greatest CBs around including Chiellini, Desailly and Thuram. It didn't hurt them one bit. CB is one hell of a stressful job and a bad game can cause repercussions which can even ruin someone's career (ex Prunier or Stepanovs). Would you put a CB who had less then 20 games at EPL level with the rest played at non league level in such stressful situation?

995~~~
But Fergie did! When Smalling came in 2011 he played a lot of games at CB because, if I remember correctly, Rio had his back issues and missed a lot of games whilst Evans had a tough season. That was his best season for us and a lot of posters had him earmarked as Rio's eventual replacement as the ball playing CB, hard as it may be to believe right now. Remembering the player he was in that season I think it's easy to argue that the RB experiment didn't work out as well as we wanted. I still have high hopes for him though and that Chelsea display a few weeks back shows that all is not lost with him, the challenge with them as a trio is that they will never be fit enough to have that run of matches to build on and it's now in our best interests to get rid of two from that lot and replace them with more reliable players

996~~~
Smalling is already good enough imo. He just needs to stay fit for 30+ games a season. People underrate him because he looked uncomfortable at full back. He's always played well at centre back.

If he does stay fit and gets a run of games at CB he will make a lot of people in this thread look very stupid.

997~~~
Look, injuries have probably played a bigger role in Smalling's stalled career. As far as positioning, the answer is - maybe. But mentioning all those names who gained by playing at full back is meaningless. Some players can be more versatile, some cannot. It doesn't mean they can't be brilliant in one role whoch is the thing that counts.

998~~~
Its really not a question of versatility. Its about giving young CBs the experience they need without risking having them making those catastrophic mistakes which may cost their respective club some important honors or/and impact their confidence.

Regarding your first part. I can't really pinpoint why Smalling's career stalled or/and if it will be back on track anytime soon. The truth is that young defenders are unpredictable. I've lost count of how many Italian young defenders were hailed the new Maldini. Even our own SAF made a Hansen like argument once when he said that if Rio is worth 18m then Wes is worth 30m. It didn't really worked that way isn't it?

999~~~
That's true. Sometimes players - centerhalves or in other positions - just stall for whatever reason. John O'Shea and Phil Neville looked like world beaters early on, but never became the players many thought they could. Funnily enough some would say it was moving them between positions that did it, though I think they were moved after they already struggled to build on the platform they got as full backs.

1000~~~
I kind of agree with you. I don't think playing Smalling at RB should hamper him all that much. What he should have gained was more composure on the ball in tight situations and better short passing, although probably losing some long range passing in the process. It may even have helped with his acceleration as he was forced to go toe to toe with speedy wingers.

I'm not even sure he's stalled at all. I think he's still a very good defender, but he rarely has five games in a row due to injuries or a major brain feck-up. Let's hope he can stay injury free for the next ten matches and judge him then. If he doesn't improve or show consistency by January, then even I'm starting to think that we might need someone else.

1001~~~
If ever United needed Smalling to stay injury free it is NOW! I pray he can have a mini run in the team at least before his next spell out injured.

1002~~~
Yeah I remember me likening young OShea with Thuram once. How wrong I was....<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Also it seem that defenders are taking more time to mature. In Baresi/Maldini time they would reach a level of consistency at age 20. By the time Vidic/Rio came to scene it became 25 and nowadays you can barely find U30 defenders whom you're absolutely sure that he'll be consistency good, week in week out. The era of Vidic, Terry, Puyol, Rio and co is phasing out and those taunted to replace them such as Pique.  Bonucci, Ranocchia and Evans had sort of dissapointed.

I fear that with so many rules around things are getting more difficult for defenders to do their job. I've recently watched the Gentile-Maradona duel during the World cup of 82. Most of the things Gentile did to keep the Argentinian at bay would earn him a straight red.

1003~~~
He's our best out and out defender. So glad he's available for this game

1004~~~
Some interesting observations and well founded conclusions here. I feel the next generation of CBs is going to be much better. We already have youngsters like Verane, Marquinhos, Mangala, Zouma, Papadopoulos, Eder Balanta, Laporte, Rudiger, Doria, Stefano Denswil all U-21s and part of the first team setup at thier clubs already.

1005~~~
He's played in 30 or more games in three of his 4 completed seasons with us. The other, 2012-13, he had fewer appearances mainly due to Rafael and Rio's unexpected good health and the need to share the chances that were available with Jones. I agree with your main thesis - he's already a very accomplished CB and is likely to get better with more consistent playing time. 

As far as his "brain farts" in the City game are concerned - I have a somewhat contrarian view. Blocking Hart's clearance was a necessary act - it prevented a possible 1 on 1 for Aguero with the defense stranded upfield. Having said that, he was badly let down by the players who should have been making sure that Hart didn't get into position to make a quick kick. What he did was no different from a midfielder grabbing an opponent to slow down the transition after a turnover - we'd all say "good foul, he took one for the team" when the inevitable booking happened. (In summary, he did what he did because he is smart, not because he is stupid.) Which makes him unlucky that Valencia and Januzaj would blow their defensive duties a few minutes later and leave him having to try to clean up the mess. His tackle was obviously a misjudgement - who would have thought Milner was that fast - but it's nothing that we didn't see Vidic do innumerable times. The question is, what was his alternative - Milner was either through on the keeper or laying the ball back for an onrushing Aguero, either way a probable goal. So, overall, I'm more of the "sh!t happens" school of thought rather than the "let's tar and feather him and ride him out of town on a rail" school.

1006~~~
How about do some defending. Smalling is quick, Milner wasn't about to play the ball first time.
It's a harsh critism, but Smalling is a very good defender 1 on 1, make Milner beat you. Its a thing with most EPL grown defenders though, they go to ground far too quickly, how about stand the attacker up and make him try and beat you 1 on 1.

1007~~~
He made the challenge because he saw Milner commit a heavy touch and overestimated his own reach in the spur of the moment. If that were not the case, he wouldn't have gone overboard trying to obstruct the City man. With the angle he was confronting Milner at, it was unlikely he could adjust his course efficiently enough and stand him up at the byline.

1008~~~
I think that's right. The other point is that this way he's committing the indiscretion (if that's what it turns out to be - as indeed it did) outside the penalty area. If he tries to adjust course at that speed he's likely to finish up barging the player in the box - there's really no way to slow down to get into 1 on 1 mode without Milner being straight past because he's got a much better angle into the box.

[Edit: The bottom line is that Smalling should probably have been better off busting a gut to get to the near post rather than trying to intercept the man - but without 20-20 hindsight I can't see many defenders doing that (and I'm not sure I want them playing for me if they do).]

1009~~~
I try to see the positive of most players that pull on the United shirt but, those 2 yellows were just daft and no one else but, his own fault.

The first, he wasn't looking to stop a 1 on 1, he was just ambling back and lazily got in the way, it wasn't like he rushed to stop the kick.

The 2nd - any players already on a yellow is going to not rush in if they are thinking, he could have stopped earlier and stood him up but, he just went balls to the wall at Milner. Knowing he was on a yellow he should from the start not to go in the way he did. Both just dumb dumb mistakes but, he will have learned and it's a matter of him now not letting them play on his mind when he steps out for United again.

1010~~~
I think you could make a case for any of our 3 senior CB's with that claim, they are all much of a muchness in quality.

1011~~~
He clearly did it because himself and Rojo were both well out of position

1012~~~
What on earth is a out and out defender? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1013~~~
We need Smalling at his best on Saturday, big, strong and consistent! I hope we can count on him. It's time for him to stake his place in the team for good or be gone in the Summer.

1014~~~
Someone measured on their defending, not their passing or how popular you are

1015~~~
How did he do for England?

1016~~~
Well they conceded one goal which Smalling couldn't really do anything about, so defensively he was solid (I want to say "as usual"...). Didn't look entirely confident in possession I thought, couple of misplaced passes but nothing risky that really gave an opportunity to Scotland.

I would say it is a game he can build on for the Arsenal game for sure.

1017~~~
Ah okay. Good to hear I guess.

1018~~~
Yup, Robertson had a sweet long shot that Smalling couldn't really do much about. The fact that, from what I read, he appeared untroubled, otherwise, and escaped injury means that we won't be that lightweight in defence, at least.

1019~~~
Out-and-out means outright, utter, absolute. In this case i'm saying Smalling is our most natural defender.

1020~~~
I don't see how it refers to popularity at all, it means the first part, a defender who is good at defending but poor on the ball.

1021~~~
I think he'll be alright if we have Blind/Carrick in front of him.

1022~~~
Could be more to it also. Some claim that Vidic was the better out-and-out defender of him and Rio, but that Rio's technique, pace, athleticism and passing made him a better CB still.

1023~~~
Rio was a better defender than Vidic. He could tackle, head, great positionally and rarely made an actual mistake. He literally had no weakness from around 07 to 10 maybe 11.

He went about 8 months (29 full games, over 4000mins of football) without commuting a foul. For a defender that is just ridiculous and tells you everything about his defending ability.

1024~~~
Preaching to the choir, mate. I think Rio is the best and most complete CB I've seen, but there are still quite a few who argue that Vidic, or Terry for that matter, were better at the defending bits like tackle and heading the ball. Imo, that's probably down to them making more sliding tackles. Vidic and Terry were better in the air, especially in attack, but Rio was much, much better at positioning and awareness defensively.

Not committing to any fouls does tell a lot about him; he rarely had to make a tackle as he just simply intercepted the ball. Either he let the attacker run into space only to gobble up that space with a few long strides of his to nick the ball away, or he would get ahead of them or just shield the ball out. I also think his understanding with VDS in particular was outstanding.

Smalling has many of Rio's attributes, but he lacks his composure on the ball and his passing abilities, and he's just not as good on any of the other attributes either - still that doesn't make him bad at any rate. (he's better in the air)

1025~~~
haha was also asking this question.

if anything like it used to be then we'll have smalling back on form for 2 or 3 games, and then finally he is our best defender again, and got....ermmm injured again(hope not)

1026~~~
Aye, I wasn't arguing, just backing up your point. Obviously the records are shared (IMO) between Rio, Vida and VDS but also the fullbacks and Carrick but I keep meaning to pull them all up: the clean sheets, the UCL home defensive record ect ect. So much is said of Barcelona's midfield and Madrids attack it's a travesty that United's defence of 07-11 isn't remembered the same way.

1027~~~
No chance was Vidic better than Rio.

1028~~~
Both Vidic and Rio were commanding in different ways IMO - Vidic just needed to look at the opponent but Rio exuded a calm superiority. We have neither in our current defence!

I agree that defence was brilliant all round. It seems like an eternity ago now.

1029~~~
That's true. United's defense all round in that period was immense. Rio and Vidic were terrific, but as you said, the fullbacks were too. Evra was at his peak, and at that time, he was truly outstanding - brilliant in attack and solid in defense. Neville was mostly solid without having the extreme abilities of Evra. Didn't Brown also fare pretty well for a season or so as fullback?

Carrick got unnoticed by pretty much everyone, even United supporters. I think it was Scholes who praised him, but in his usual manner; it was said with four words or so, so few actually took notice.

1030~~~
2007/2008 double season was a rock at the back.

1031~~~
I remember Brown's performance against Barca in the semi final!! Him, rio and vidic were immense! Never seen a better defensive performance since! God I miss those days!

1032~~~
I look back back on that defence with far more appreciation than I do of the attacking days of Rooney, Ronaldo, Tevez et al. They were names on paper that excelled as individuals. Our defense was a cohesive unit of world class players. 

Also: Ferdinand's peak for us > Ronaldo's peak for us. 

And: despite Terry being recognised with the awards, Ferdinand at his best was two or three levels above him in quality and performance at their best.

1033~~~
Rio better than Vidic? Rio better than Ronaldo? Wow. Just wow.

Between Stam leaving and Vidic joining/settling the United defence was very poor. It was poor again when Vidic injured his knee and poor since he left.

Evans, Smalling and Jones looked excellent next to Vidic. All looked significantly worse next to anyone else. You could also say the same for Rio (he looked significantly better playing next to Vidic). He was incredibly talented but was unreliable and error prone. It was no surprise that Fergie quickly shelved his plans to make him captain.

I honestly don't think Rio is in Vidic's league.

1034~~~
Put that defense with De Gea and Shaw we would not concede at all.

1035~~~
Rio is the most technically gifted defender Manchester United has ever had. He's on the level of Nesta, Maldini and other great italian defenders.

Vidic was very good, but based his game a lot on positioning, strength, speed, he was the perfect complement to Ferdinand.

Terry does'nt come close.

1036~~~
One might argue that Rio's contribution to the team was at least as important as that of Ronaldo. Our defense back then was brilliant, no doubt. The team was of course also brilliant. 

I always thought Rio was better than Terry. Terry would always be exposed by quick and tricky players. I still remember Torres' first match against United when the commentator said "and now Torres is going to show what he is made of with his tremendous pace" and then Rio just comes in and destroys him for pace and strength - those were the days.

1037~~~
Never ever?!

1038~~~
I also prefer Vidic but to say Rio is not in Vidic's league is wrong, imo they were the best defenders of the PL era you could make a case for either being better to be honest, not that much between them.

1039~~~
Really? Rio was not made captain because at that time he started to suffer too many injuries; Ferguson wanted someone who played more or less every match as captain. 

Vidic was also made twice the player he was because of Rio, no doubt. He struggled with certain players, even at his prime. Rio didn't.

1040~~~
No, it would be awesome! We might need Gandalf in the middle, but why not, eh?

1041~~~
As good as de Gea is, I would say van der Sar was the superior goalkeeper at the time and Evra was comfortably a level above what Shaw is currently.

1042~~~
Except anyone who could header.

1043~~~
Great post. The gif below is a great example of Smalling's positional awareness and his speed. This is the reason why, like Rio, Smalling is our least error prone CB among himself, Evans and Jones. He's a great marker who im yet to see get skinned by any player

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/smalling1es8t.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/smalling1es8t.gif"/>

1044~~~
No doubt about it, in fact that defence of O'shea/Brown, Rio, Vidic, Evra and VDS hold a record of less goals conceded over a period of time from the 08/09 season if I'm not wrong.

1045~~~
I agree with both of these statements.
Rio is criminally underrated in my opinion, technically gifted - great positional strength and read the game excellently.
Different type of defender to Vidic of course, but I much prefer watching Rio's game.

1046~~~
Top post. I would add, re the bold part, that composure on the ball and passing are both very confidence based abilities. I think Smalling can improve this part of his game as his confidence grows. Problem is I can't see him growing in confidence until he can put a strong run of games together, which won't be happening unless he can turn his injury record around.

1047~~~
This was one of my strongest memories from that game. I was in the Stretford end and when Willian charged forward I was really impressed with the way Smalling immediately sprung into action, backing off and matching Willian for speed before waiting for the right time to take the ball off him.

1048~~~
Extremely harsh on Van Der Sar. I don't see how De Gea (at his current level) would be an improvement on Van Der Sar. He's not even on his level, let alone an improvement. 
Arguably Shaw is better one-on-one in the challenge than Evra, but he's clearly not at his level yet as a full back.

Not sure how you can claim they'd be improvements on that defence, if that's what you're implying.

1049~~~
He had a very solid game against Chelsea, also held Rojo's hands while doing it. How some people think he should be sold as early as January is beyond my understanding.

1050~~~
fecking baffling isn't it. Good performance against Arsenal and everyone will act as though they never said a bad word about him... Until the next poor game at which point he should be sold again.

1051~~~
The thing I will add about Smalling (after all the Rio comparisons on this/last page) is that when he joined the club he was actually regarded as being very good on the ball (hence the Rio comparisons). The U-Turn from that into him being technically deficient and incapable of a 5 yard pass is astounding. Based on the early performances though, Smalling obviously has it in his locker to pass the ball well and be pretty comfortable in possession - a few consistent games to build his confidence and I imagine that side of him will re-emerge.

1052~~~
It wasn't just with us, though. His reputation with being good on the ball was going on since he first came up at Maidstone. He was never your typical old-school English defender who was poor on the ball. Of course, I don't think he can handle receiving the ball in tight spaces as he often did as a full back, but as a central defender, when he'd have that bit more space and time on the ball, Smalling's been fairly good with his passing. His issues have only been with his long balls, but I'm sure that he'd perform fewer long balls, particularly with Carrick and/or Blind looking to support him.

1053~~~
Thanks mate!

That piece of defending by Smalling there is pure world class. Willian is very, very fast but doesn't stand a change, even when you can see that he tries a simple hit and run move. Also, the way Smalling stands him off forcing him out wide instead of directly at goal is great.

1054~~~
Thanks. I too think he can improve. I doubt he'll ever reach Rio's levels, but he does have other abilities like his heading ability which I would place above Rio. Smalling isn't poor on the ball, just awkward.

1055~~~
You're absolutely right. His average pass completion this season is almost 90%. Thats higher than anyone else on the team.

1056~~~
You're spot on! Most of our other CBs would have probably panicked. I can see Jones handling it differently and attempting one of his last ditch tackles, probably getting a red and conceding a penalty. Smalling didn't get enough praise for this, yet Jones got a lot of praise for a last ditch tackle against Swansea, for keeping the score down in a game we lost anyway. If Willian scored from that chance we would've certainly lost, and Rojo would've been the next scapegoat.

1057~~~
With Smalling, it isn't the talent that is in doubt. It's his lack of being able to string a few games together without getting injured or his general lackadaisical or stupidity on the ball. He isn't exactly great passing the ball out and doesn't look particularly comfortable on the ball either, but he's a great defender when he's actually on form. I just wish he can show that promise once more as he's 25 now and is surely running out of time at United.

1058~~~
Echo the second bolded statement, and for me that's why he won't last too long once we get defensive reinforcements in, half the time he looks like he about to fall over the ball, or play a stupid pass, and he just doesn't seem to be improving with this either.

Yes he can head the ball, and is quick but that's not enough long term.

1059~~~
I'm a massive Smalling fan, and I really hope he'll be able to string together quite a few matches now.

1060~~~
I've been critical of his technique on the ball but that's quality defending. 

Also, wtf was Rojo trying to do?

1061~~~
Initially, when I first saw this during the match, I was thinking that Willian screwed up a great opportunity to get through (I still gave Smalling credit, but I thought it was more of an error from Willian than brilliant defending from Smalling).

However, having watched this wonderful GIF many times, I have to say, this is all Smalling and zero Willian's mistake. He did amazingly well to stop a very tricky and dangerous dribbler. He never looked fazed and seemed like he was in perfect control. I also imagined that, if Evans was back there, he would most likely have been beaten by Willian, whilst Jones may have made a rash challenge.

1062~~~
Rojo was real nervy against Chelsea. His passing was all over the place.

1063~~~
You're spot on my friend. Any of our other CBs would've been raped by Willian. Dare I say Vidic probably would've too because he always struggled with pacy players (Torres 1v1 on two occasions springs to mind). Rio in his prime would've done exactly what Smalling did

1064~~~
Agreed, Rio was the master of showing players outside and then beating them to the ball and it looks like Smalling has a knack for it too.

1065~~~
Glad Smalling will be back (please don't get injured before then). Our best CB IMO. Needs to put in a good performance to make-up for his silly red though.

1066~~~
He owes us a good game after his f*ck up against City.

1067~~~
He doesn't owe us anything. Defenders mistime challenges now and again - sometimes they get red cards. In his 4 completed seasons Smalling got 4 yellows and no reds; Vidic, in the same time period, got 13 yellows and 3 reds; Evans 10 and 2; Rio (mister never gets booked) got 6 yellows; and in just 3 seasons Jones accumulated 15 yellows. Defenders get booked and sometimes sent off (even Rio got sent off once, years ago). Smalling is better than most in that regard.

1068~~~
That's some good defending right there!

1069~~~
Yeah, but he still f*cked us against City.

1070~~~
Just like Evans did a few seasons back and Vidic did serially against Liverpool. Sh!t happens, get over it.

1071~~~
It's refreshing to see people accepting that he had a shocker against City but is still essentially a good defender who should be starting. Normally on the Caf he'd be the antichrist for at least three months.

I suppose injury crises make realists of us all.

1072~~~
You appear to be the one more concerned with his sending off versus City. All I said was that he owes us a good performance, I'm sure van Gaal feels similarly.

1073~~~
I was wondering about the stats on this so thanks for that. Doesnt entirely surprise me and reinforces the belief that what happened against City was an abberation - unfortunate and foolish, and with the above in mind I have no doubt he will learn from it and make sure it doesnt happen again.

You could see as soon as he got up from the tackle on Milner that he realised he was off, and you could see the disappointment and feeling that he had let the team down. Like I said, I suspect Smalling will try even harder now to stay disciplined. A hard lesson to learn, but a very valuable one for him I reckon.

1074~~~
You're right. Defenders will make mistakes. What's harder to forgive is an actual pathetic overall display like Evans against MK Dons

1075~~~
That's where we'll see how he does mentally coming back. He knows he messed up like you said but, can very well fall into a too cautious frame of mind which can be equally costly down the road. The good in a way is this is his first time he's really messed up big that we've never had to question how he deals with adversity.

1076~~~
Yeah. But you can prove anything with statistics, even the truth.

I could happily have crucified him after the City match, but I've gotten over it now and am willing to give him another chance. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1077~~~
Yeah its a possibility, but Smalling has always struck me as an intelligent lad. The sending off against City was so out of character for him. I am confident that he will bounce back stronger.

1078~~~
Won't get into whether he owes us or not but It wasn't that he got sent off but more how his 2 yellow's were both utterly stupid and preventable too which cost us a Major game by reducing us to 10 men early.

And just getting a yellow card as long as you don't get a red until the last few minutes maybe is fine. Dunno why you are listing that.

1079~~~
He's fit for Saturday, right?

1080~~~
I think he's good enough for a place at the club, but he picks up to many niggles to be dependable and the new face of our backline..

1081~~~
Yep

1082~~~
At this point, yes. There is still time though...

1083~~~
It's day by day isn't it?.

Whenever i see a players thread at the top of the home page these days i fear the worst.

1084~~~
Why does the official site mention that he is still suspended? Another gaff?

1085~~~
Thiago Silva did the same stupid thing in QF World Cup nonetheless, stupidly blocking Gk taking a goalkick, thus rendering him playing in the SF. And he's one of the best CB in the world. As a poster said, footballer: shit happens.

1086~~~
Rio would have been captain instead of Gary Neville if he'd shown the leadership qualities. He and Rooney were clearly signed with the intention of being future leaders of the club. Neither showed the appropriate credentials under Fergie to be made permanent captain.

Who did Vidic struggle against? He had one poor game against Torres of which a ridiculous amount was made because it was so unusual. Rio struggled against any physical player. Players like Drogba, Ferguson, Kevin Davies, Andy Carroll, Crouch, etc. always caused him problems but were rarely a threat vs United when Vidic played. Even Messi beat him in the air to score in the CL final.

As for Vidic being made twice the player he was because of Rio? Look at how well the Vidic/Evans partnership performed. Now look at how well Evans has played since Vidic left. When you have a really top class defence you never worry when the opposition attack. That was the case when Vidic played. When he didn't the general feeling was bricking it every time the opposition crossed the half way line.

I've not been on here long but I am genuinely surprised at how highly rated Rio is here.

1087~~~
I don't think this is true. I remember Messi's header being uncontested.

1088~~~
Exactly. Rio completely lost him. I don't mean he out jumped him. Just that he scored with a header when Rio was "picking him up".

1089~~~
He is solid mates, by far the best CB we have.

1090~~~
Pretty much saved a goal on his own with that tackle on Welbeck. He really is faster than he looks isn't he!

1091~~~
Outstanding at the back today, particularly in the 2nd half. In the first half De Gea saved us multiple times, in the second half Smalling did

He made 16 clearances today. 16! 5 interceptions, 1 tackle, 1 blocked shot and won the ball in aerial duels 4 times

1092~~~
Agree but we need someone along side him who is even better.

1093~~~
That's the Smalling we like to see.

1094~~~
Fantastic. Covered for both McNair and Blackett, both of whom looked out of their depth.

1095~~~
Not surprising that he was solid today. Blackett and McNair are inexperienced (though McNair did well) so the pressure was all on Smalling to not only put in a good shift himself, but organise the other two in a different formation with no proper FBs.

1096~~~
Great performance. Credit to him.

1097~~~
Performing so well in a chaotic match is good, but he's not shown earlier or today that he's 1st choice quality.
Could still be, but we need someone who is now, not in a couple of years.

1098~~~
Played very well today, great for the young lads to look up too.really chuffed for him after all the recent criticism.

1099~~~
Where as we saw the worst of Smalling against City, today he showed his absolute best. He was a giant there today, and his pace against Welbeck 1 on 1 shows exactly what he can do. He was the difference today IMO.

1100~~~
While our defence was weak at the start, he was generally solid throughout. Big improvement from him.

1101~~~
Same as the Chelsea game, superb. He is the best of the injury three of Jones, Evans, himself.

1102~~~
That second half performance was massive. One of the best I've seen from him.

1103~~~
Not? He is far ahead Jones and Evans.

1104~~~
Now like... As in today? 

As in the match he just played? 

Where he was the best CB on the pitch and probably our best player?

1105~~~
When you have to defend like this he's pretty good.

When he gets on the ball he's limited and invites pressure.

1106~~~
welbeck made him look like the second coming of Paul McGrath! jokes aside, he is our best CB by a country mile when fit and on form.

1107~~~
Did well and was as solid as can be under the circumstances.

Lets face it though, we were all over the place at the back for most of the match until our lucky goal.

Credit to the young defenders for almost keeping a clean sheet though. Amazing what a little confidence or luck can do. You could just see the difference in our defending and approach.

1108~~~
Did really well. Happy birthday.

1109~~~
I think Smalling and McNair could be our best partnership for now. I want them to play until we sign a couple of top class CBs.

1110~~~
Back to his more usual level of performance today. Really excellent centre half, and for both United and England's best centre half.

#SmallingPlusOne (or two, on occasions).

1111~~~
Surprisingly super game by Smalling. Kept covering for the terrible Blackett and saved a certain goal!

1112~~~
Him and Young MOTM. Crazy.

1113~~~
I do hope the haters get off his back now, he really is our best defender.

1114~~~
And people still think Jones is better.

1115~~~
Beast. Hopefully it will mean a break from hearing people explaining why they trust Blacket and McNair more or why he should be sold. Carried them through the game today. 

It would also be nice if people would just accept him for the excellent defender he is and stop nitpicking cos he's not fecking Pirlo. He's as good on the ball as Vidic was. That should be enough imo. Outstanding performance today.

1116~~~
Arguably.
And non of those, including Smalling is good enough at the moment if we were aiming to challenge for the title.
The board here is still not in agreement on who out of Jones, Smalling and Evans is the best, you saying he is far ahead of the other two just doesn't seem right at all.

Best player?
You didn't notice the keeper who had to save the defenses arse so many times?
As in this match, where he played with two youngsters who are only in the team because we're having serious injury problems?
Smalling did well today, but he hasn't showed that he is be a world class centre-back, which is what we should be aiming at having.


If Van Gaal wants to give them time then i'm all for it, they can become good enough to challenge for the title as key-members of the squad, but at the moment none of our defenders are at that level.

1117~~~
I don't get how anyone can fail to see how good Ferdinand was. Get some videos of him at his best and educate yourself.

1118~~~
The keeper who will be dissappointed by the goal he conceeded?

Smalling doesnt need to be a world class CB. He just needs one next to him. He can be an almost world class out and out defender as long as the guy next to him is a good defender and can play the ball as well

1119~~~
I think Jones at his best is out best defender. But I rate Smalling too. Very happy with his performance today

1120~~~
If he stays fit there's hope for him at United. 
The best CB we have right now.

1121~~~
Are you freaking serious?
He conceeded? The whole team conceeded. It wasn't Arsenal vs De Gea (though it looked like it on multiple occassions), and if so you should really put some blame on the 3 centre-backs & 2 wing-backs supposed to defend him.
It was a good shot by Giroud which De Gea almost had. 

And thats really besides the point. De Gea saved what, 5-6 goals (exaggeration maybe) today and you chose to rate smalling over him today based on the fact that one of shitloads of chances went in?

Evans have proven that he can be a "good enough defender" if put next to a world class one before, just for your information.
Jones also have put in great shifts. There really isn't much separating them except for their different strengths and weaknesses.

1122~~~
There are not many better defenders around when it come to stopping the other teams from scoring. He dominates strikers in the air and on the ground. He's not a graceful footballer but defensively he's very sound. He will be a world class defender and an ok footballer. That's what Vidic was and it seemed to work out fine for him. Smalling is substance over style imo which works against him in today's game where defenders who can't defend get big names and reputations.

1123~~~
Its not besides the point, it is the point. It was the one dissappointing thing about his performances, which lets other people into the reckoning for man of the match. If he deals with the shot he's nailed on like you suggest. He didnt and will feel that having got his hand to a shot that wasnt right in the corner, he could have done more

As for Evans, yes he was able to be carried by a Rio or Vidic near their best holding his hand. Smalling doesnt need that. He just needs someone as good as he is, but better at using the ball

Smalling's current performances are better than Evans ever were

1124~~~
This is so true. Had a good game vs. Chelsea, now a great game vs. Arsenal, very happy for him.

1125~~~
He really did look like the most experienced CB we had out there tonight. Led by example and dealt with everything they threw at us. It's amazing how quickly opinions change. A few games ago they wanted him gone for good. Now he's gone from zero to hero again. 

We've seen good performances from him before but the most important for him is to sustain it. He is potentially a fixture in our starting 11 if he keeps his concentration and eradicates those brain farts he has.

1126~~~
Great performance from Smalling. This is the sort of performance he is capable of if he can stay fit. Now we need to get another center back to pair up with.

1127~~~
I've been very critical of him this season but that was much better today. Took responsibility back there with two youngsters alongside him and the tackle on Welbeck was an excellent bit of defending.

1128~~~
His defending in the second half was excellent.

However, his inablity to cope with any sort of pressure when in possesion is still a big worry. Even worse is his passing. Anything other than the simple obvious pass is beyond him. This is a huge weakness for the whole team as it stops us from controlling the ball and our build-up play becomes non-existent. Doesnt matter how good you are at defending if you keep giving it away its going to keep coming back and hurt you eventually.

1129~~~
He was solid today but I'm still far from convinced he's a top CB for us long term.

1130~~~
Was worried that sending off against City would affect him because it was just so uncharacteristic. But he's easily the most talented defender at the club.

1131~~~
He's just so good at not being beaten by pacey forwards. Must be an absolute cnut in training to try to get past.

1132~~~
He was very good today but his passing is still a mess. In the last five minutes when Carrick moved to CB you could immediately see how Carrick could use his let foot to make a simple pass rather than shift his whole body around like Smalling does. Also he is 25 now and playing with the two kids he needed to show more authority and calm them down a bit in the first half hour. Overall though he did very well.

1133~~~
I think Welbeck himself said that when he was here, and that he was glad he doesn't have to play against him. Physically he's got everything.

1134~~~
That's the Smalling I know. Thought he was great today. 

Anyone got a GIF of when Welbeck was running through on goal and Smalling made a vital tackle? It was near the closing stages of the game, IIRC.

1135~~~
<i>"I would have to say Chris Smalling is the most difficult to get past in training. He’s one of our fastest players and can rival most of the forwards for pace.</i>

<i>"He also reads the game really well and is always in the right place at the right time, clearing up any danger.</i>

<i>"I’m just glad that I get to play with him for both United and England. I’d hate to play against him!"</i>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/04/08/welbeck-says-chris-smalling-is-the-toughest-manchester-united-de/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014...malling-is-the-toughest-manchester-united-de/</a>

1136~~~
Vida was also very poor at distributing the ball under pressure, he'd opt to smash it out of play most times. His saving grace was that he had Rio next to him who could shift it.

1137~~~
If only.

Pretty sure those asking for him to be sold a week or two ago still want him sold. Today's very good performance, and any performance any footballer could ever give probably wont change that. He's not fancy enough, he's Chris Smalling so they'd prefer someone else

1138~~~
I'm one of his biggest critics but he was superb today.

1139~~~
The thing is he can't run out of position and go do Blackett's job on the left. Thats not how it works. Thats how people get free time in our box for easy goals

The nervous defending was with the kids, not with Smalling.

1140~~~
Light in the tunnel for Chris.

He wants to play in United and he showed that today.

1141~~~
He was quality today, showed good leadership skills as well, seemed to be commanding McNair and Blackett at times. Obviously people raise question marks about his ability on the ball but I don't really care about that aslong as he can defend first and foremost. The distribution was difficult from the back tonight due to the 3 at the back, in a flat back four, it is much simpler to give it to your other CB or full-back but in a 3 there's less room and sometimes they have to make difficult passes which is why LvG must favour that sort of personnel.

1142~~~
Is it me or whenever we've played the 3 man defence so far the central defender has looked the best ? Atleast defensively.

Maybe barring 1 game.

1143~~~
Welbeck said he was the toughest CB to play against in training. You might want to consider a username change!

1144~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/smallingw5z8e.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/smallingw5z8e.gif"/>

1145~~~
Super defensive play. Seems incapable of taking any responsibility when he's in possession, instead putting Blackett and McNair in awkward situations.

1146~~~
Imperious second half... but then he's more then capable of performances like this, he just needs to be consistent.

1147~~~
The broken record carries on. Defending generally spot on, but really fails when bringing it out. 

Can't fault him today overall. Second half he absolutely dominated Welbeck.

1148~~~
He still showed a lot more composure than Smalling does imo. He was a good decion maker under pressure and new when to take the safe option ....but only as a last resort. Smalling takes the safe option 9 times out of 10.

But your right its about finding a balance I suppose and his partners today didnt help at all. Felt like none of them completed a single pass between them in the first half.

1149~~~
Very hard to be consistent when you're injured all the time and in and out of the team with different partners. But none of that is really his fault. I think that again, he showed he's our best defender. Just needs to stay fit and cement his place, which unfortunately seems a pretty tall order

1150~~~
There's no question that he's not good on the ball, but we could have minimised the effects of that weakness by playing a proper midfield in front of him instead of an extra CB next to him. Add Herrera as another high-energy midfielder always looking for the ball and there's always going to be an extra person for Smalling to distribute the ball to when he's in possession.

1151~~~
He was immense in my eyes! Give him a an extended run without injuries, and I'm certain that he'll nail that right CB spot.

1152~~~
Great to see him come back from his moment of idiocy the other week. Some United fans wanted him out then, for shame!

I believe in him bigtime. Reminds me of Pally.

1153~~~
Glad to see him bounce back from the City match, when he was slated by many including me.

His abilities to defend are without doubt.  We always knew he had them.

The main issue is fitness.  Will he be able to play a long stretch without getting hurt?  I hope he will but I just don't see that happening with the way things are at United these days.

1154~~~
I thought the same, always very good.

Still, think that Smalling is our best CB and really i think that defensively he can become WC. His distribution isn't the best, but i still think that his abilities as a defender are superior than what we could get with someone who can play, but can't defend that much (which strangely is very popular today and people often start talking about superior defenders even if they are actually average).

1155~~~
Was really good, really solid. He owed us a good performance and he delivered. If he can keep fit (fingers crossed) he will do well here I think. Handled Welbeck comfortably. He never gets flustered and handles everything really well. Our best CB atm.

1156~~~
Yeah but he's shit and we should sign Shawcross.

1157~~~
After the first 20 or so minutes I can only think of one time where Welbeck got in behind him and was able get a knock back header uncontested. Did good other then that, still a bit shit on the ball though.

1158~~~
Hopefully he can build on this and not get injured

1159~~~
Funny reading comments of people who had a different view of him as a player after the City match.

1160~~~
He's good in the penalty area and excellent at defending large spaces when the other team counters.

1161~~~
Good on youtube is he? That's exactly the way to evaluate how good someone is - watch some selected highlights of them at their best.

1162~~~
Weird comment. He didn't mention youtube or highlights.

When did you start watching United, out of interest? I've never seen anyone who didn't rate Rio before.

1163~~~
A clumsy, awful footballer but an athlete.

He's exceptionally quick and that'll get him out of trouble to a point. He does have somewhat of a brain though, at least, compared to the rest of our godawful defenders so perhaps there's something there.

1164~~~
I swear he was class on the ball when we signed him but how can it go from one extreme to the other? Like when Rooney was shit at heading for about 6 years, then went world class at it for a season, then went back to being shit.

1165~~~
He was never "class", but he didn't look nervous when he turned up at United. I think he made some passing mistakes, most likely when we shunted him to fullback that shook his confidence and made him hesitate with each pass. When you're a young player who hasnt made mistakes and has no idea about responsibility, you show no fear.

1166~~~
He said to watch some videos of his best bits to educate myself. I've watched Ferdinand play for United for years. How would watching some highlight videos change my opinion?

I've been watching United since the mid 80s. I didn't say I don't rate Ferdinand. I was referring to comments that said he was better than Vidic and bizarrely Ronaldo and previous ones that mentioned he was the best defender in the world. He was a quality defender but Vidic was clearly far superior.

Twice in my time watching United has a defender been signed that transformed the defence into a formidable one. Those defenders were Stam and Vidic.

1167~~~
Always a big fan of Smalling. When we signed him, he went through a period where he looked very assured and even composed on the ball - as natural a Rio replacement as were likely to find. (Funnily - Varane reminds me of Smalling first couple seasons with is). I thought Smalling was that good.

Injuries, the lack of game time at cb, being played out of position has probably stalled both him and Jones. I really do hope he puts a consistent, injury free run together. Its time for both him and Jones to start fulfilling their promise.

1168~~~
Rio Ferdinand was the best centre back in the world when he was in his prime. I don't think many people would argue against that.

1169~~~
Who said anything about youtube? Go watch some full matches. The only way you wouldn't think Rio was exceptional is if you didn't watch him play enough.

1170~~~
Clearly far superior? You been watching the games pissed?

1171~~~
Unfortunately many would.

Of the two different playing styles, generally people appreciate the hard hitting defender (Vidic) more than the game reading, technical defender (Rio)
Hence why people say Jones is better than Smalling.

1172~~~
Vidic did indeed transform our defence, but it helped that he had Ferdinand, Evra and VDS alongside him. The only reason you see him as the part that transformed the defence is because of the timing of his purchase. I doubt he would have 'transformed' our defence playing alongside Blanc, Silvestre and Barthez. Similarly, if Ferdinand was the last piece of the puzzle in a backline consisting of Vidic, Evra and VDS, he'd probably be getting the credit for transforming our defence. Both were absolutely immense, and I genuinely couldn't say which one was better for us.

1173~~~
I find it weird that people say being shunted to RB screwed his passing ability over. The 11/12 season he was very solid at RB, tore a good few teams apart with Valencia he did. The problem is his appearance. People look at him and then instantly decide everything he does is clumsy because he looks like a mong. The same happened with Cleverley and the way he struck a ball.

1174~~~
The only problem outside of his injury record, is that he seems to become easily nervous.

1175~~~
Yeah, I suppose that's right. I guess Rio's going to be a bit underrated for many, due to his interests outside of football too.

1176~~~
My favourite United player of the current bunch.

Love him immensely.

1177~~~
His passing was once again not half as shite as being said on here.

1178~~~
He was (rightly) slated after the City game, so it's only fair we praise him for a great performance yesterday. 

Ignoring the horror show against City, he'd been our best CB by a mile this season, which made the calls for him to be fecked off at the end of the season a bit laughable.

1179~~~
Are you seriously suggesting that Smalling is better than Rio?  Wow.

1180~~~
He was very good yesterday and marshalled the kids well.

1181~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Great game from him.

1182~~~
He just meant watch him in his prime, not neccessarily his 'best bits' or highlights as you read it. Probably because he assumed you'd never seen Ferdinand in that period given your bizarre opinion on him.

1183~~~
In such matches Smalling will succeed al day, his best performances seem to come vs the top clubs (except vs City last time), against Bayern he was great last season, and I remember playing City some years ago and he just destroyed Tevez. He is so aware of everything, quick to react, can block, can clear the ball, can head it away, in such matches I trust him. When we just defend and hoof the ball away.

1184~~~
So he's an awful footballer, yet a current England international player who plays for Manchester United? Doesn't really make sense, how can he be awful? I think you need to reassess what an awful footballer is. 
If he's awful what does that make you? if comparing footballing ability...

1185~~~
It's the Smalling boom-bust cycle.

Goes from 'best young defender in the league' to 'disaster waiting to happen' from game to game.

Needs to find consistency. Encouraging signs.

1186~~~
That shitty volley in the first half still cracks me up, that was horrible.

1187~~~
I just don't get tired of watching this. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1188~~~
I still want to see him and Jones have a run of games together, because I honestly think they can become a really good partnership. Thing is, Van Gaal likes left footed players playing left centre back.

1189~~~
<i>That </i>is not the sign of a clumsy footballer. How many times have we seen defenders up against such a pacy attacker like Welbeck and mistiming that last ditch tackle? He has shown moments of being unstoppable in one on one situations, corners etc. , something which goes down to him being a strong defender, not just an athlete.

1190~~~
He's an awful footballer as in he cannot kick it to save his life, his technique is appalling, his passing is disgustingly bad and he panics in possession, that's what I mean by he's an awful footballer. I'd wager if it was me versus him in a game of crossbar challenge I'd win because he's that bad at the basic idea of kicking a football. I am utterly shite though.

What he is though, is an athlete that can get himself out of situations by being really, really quick. If you're quicker than your opponents then you've got a much better chance to get to the ball before them and therefore not look quite so bad at the game as you actually are. If you've got a knack for spotting danger too which I suppose he does then you can be a decent defender.

Not many central defenders are actually good footballers, same with goalkeepers. They don't have to be as long as they can get something in the way to stop an attacker.

1191~~~
What good is that when they've all been an absolute horror show? Well, McNair has been fine...

1192~~~
So we can just get a random fast guy and put him at the back? We might play di Maria CB if the injuries continue then.... Smalling is much more than an athlete.

1193~~~
Great 2nd half performance but the whole back 4 (in fact everyone except De Gea) were absolutely shocking in the first half. 

He's a good defender but I doesn't fill me with confidence when in possession, and a lot of our problems yesterday stemmed from the back 4 being shaky on the ball and giving the ball straight to Arsenal. McNair and Blackett were both guilty of this

1194~~~
That's a lot of exaggeration and also, too simplistic a concept of defending. I'll give you that Smalling's technique is very average and so he's poor on the ball. Smalling has performed generally well at CB, just I would prefer a first team CB at Man United to be at a much higher level still.

1195~~~
A great defender. Not a good passer of the ball, but can tackle and has positional sense. His primary job is to defend and stop the other team from shooting and scoring. So what if he can't pass. He'll do for me. Vilified for his rashness against City. For me, he's better than car-crash-last-minute Phil Jones.

1196~~~
As most people know, Smalling's off the ball work (tackling- City aside, heading, blocking and chasing back to stop chances) has always been decent. It's whether he has the passing and distribution out from the back, which is also very important. All three of our centre backs were careless in giving the ball away in the first half and against better strikers than Welbeck such as Costa and Aguero we'll be made to pay.

1197~~~
Its always been far more than decent. Its been nearly as good as the best group of CBs in the league

1198~~~
He was consistantly our best CB last season. He's one of our only remaining CBs who have had a period of consistancy (the other being Evans, and we're talking years ago and before lots of injuries and poor performances) although his injury early in the season and then the sending off disrupted that for him

1199~~~
He wasn't that good at the beginning of the season either before his first injury.

I'd say Jones has been best especially in a back 3 he was great but his last performance in between 2 injuries at West Brom is clouding people's judgement and his error was much less so than Smalling's.


Edit - Well you could say Mcnair is in contention too. I'd have him above Smalling too.

1200~~~
The passing discussion is a tedious one. We could really do with finishing top four this season and the less goals we concede the better chance of that we have. It verges on a non-issue given some of the defending we've seen from our lot so far. For now, just defend well and worry about the fancy shite after. Smalling did that yesterday.

1201~~~
Chris Smalling  went out to face Arsenal with a cloud over his head as well as questions of the United team in general, and he demonstrated why he belongs to United. I am so glad LVG kept faith in him.

We don't need fancy passers in our defenders although some past ones notably Rio were great ball playing defenders. Chris stuck to his job and faced down the naysayers. Good luck to the lad. I especially liked the way he kept up the talk as United need more communication on the pitch.

1202~~~
Definitely our best CB, IMO. It doesn't bother me that he's not great with the ball, his defending is very good and that should be what he's judged on.

1203~~~
What I find odd about the caf is the implication seems to be that City was more of a typical Smalling performance than Arsenal.

That is craziness. His Arsenal performance was pretty much how he plays for us when he plays at centre half.

1204~~~
This may seem weird but I don't even remember him playing yesterday.

1205~~~
Exactly. Apart from that game, (which was more poor decision making than actual poor defending) I can't remember a bad game he's had at CB in a while.

1206~~~
Please please please keep performing like that Smalling! I am usually a big Smalling critic but he is slowly winning me over, against Chelsea and Arsenal he's been very good.

He was brilliant against Arsenal, was always alert and marshalled the defence well like he should being a senior CB. He is also very rapid which is a very good quality to have as Attackers hate playing against fast centre backs. He knows he can cement his position in the team now and if he keeps playing like that then good on him.

1207~~~
Only thing that has stopped him is injuries to himself and Rafael. I hope he can stay fit now because it's his position to take.

1208~~~
So great, he is our best cb. Can he even play 20 games a season?

1209~~~
I do think that the Arsenal game was ideal for him. I think he's a lot better when he has less time to think. He was just being asked to defend, which is his strength. When he has time I feel that's when's more likely to make a mistake. We were under pressure at the back for a large chunk of the game, so there was very little time to become complacent. 

I'm seeing the same trait in Blackett too. He's a dawdler when he has time on the ball, and it's got him into trouble a few times already this season.

1210~~~
These mistakes you speak of, how many have you even seen him make in 4 years here?

1211~~~
Watched the game again and Smalling didnt put a foot wrong.. Great sign after a terrible game vs City..

1212~~~
Does anyone else find that opposition or neutral fans' opinion of him is that he is terrible? Find it strange myself as if you were to base your opinion of him solely on defending then he is solid.

1213~~~
Yes, but I think that's mainly because they either have seen him play at RB, or just see highlights and remember all the bad points rather than the good.

I think if you watch Utd regularly, you know on Smalling's best form he is a monster. It just depends whether he remembers his brain or not too the match <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1214~~~
One of the most bias posts I've ever read on here! 
Complete load of tosh!

1215~~~
Basically a good, smart defender. Fewest cards among our CBs for his time at United. (One red in his career - admittedly badly timed.) When he came to United his passing was excellent - no reason why he couldn't get back to that standard with some consistent game time. Hopefully he has now established himself and will continue to grow in the position.

1216~~~
No. Where on earth did you get that from?

1217~~~
To add to this, there was nothing wrong with his actual performance against City. He made a stupid mistake and a bad tackle, otherwise he was solid.

1218~~~
Get in. Kept the move alive with a decent header and then got his shot on target. Not the prettiest but a goal

1219~~~
Massively improved on the ball it seems.

1220~~~
Almost got a 2nd

1221~~~
It's inevitable that he gets injured. Unfortunately this is how the world works.

1222~~~
Puskas nominee.

1223~~~
He is playing with confidence, which comes from a manager having some faith in him and playing him in his preferred position. Pleased for him.

1224~~~
Bringing the ball out of the defence very well so far

1225~~~
Class so far.

1226~~~
he's had an excellent half. Confident on the ball, pushing forward to help the attack at the right times and getting in good positions in the box. Of course, he hasn't been challenged defensively which is likely why his overall performance looks so good this far

1227~~~
Turned into a beast for this game

1228~~~
Now this is the Chris Smalling I remember from his first season here. Absolute monster.

Rojo might as well pull up a chair, make himself a cup of tea, and just relax for the second half. Chris has got this.

1229~~~
What the hell has happened to Smalling. He suddenly looks like Rio Ferdinand circa 2003.

1230~~~
Forget scoring, this is the best I've seen him play in a long long time. He's actually confident carrying the ball out and starting attacks.

You might think defending is the only thing that matters, but when your CB is setting the tone of the game from the back like this, it helps so much.

1231~~~
Attacking the space more than Herrera and Mata.

If this was NBA he would be Charles Barkley in his golden era. Unstoppable.

1232~~~
He's coming through the midfield with the ball like a CM would do, showing he is actually competent on the ball. Great game from him.

1233~~~
Must have had a come to Jesus meeting after that City game. Really was the lowest point of his career. Looked great since then, oddly.

1234~~~
He's quality. Easily our best centre back.

1235~~~
Go on Big Chris.

1236~~~
Hasn't had anything to do defensively but has driven the ball out of the back really well and distributed it with confidence, real air of authority about him right now.

1237~~~
He was excellent against Chelsea as well. The city was the exception not the rule - it was his first sending off for us in 4 years.

1238~~~
What a difference 3 games make in the caf, eh?

1239~~~
Our best CB last season, our best CB this season. 

Nothing strange. People are just too quick to write him off when he has 1 bad game

1240~~~
Smalling-bauer.

1241~~~
You can tell Van Gaal's got him working on the ball and his distribution. Looks a lot more comfortable. His defending has never been an issue, in my opinion.

1242~~~
He's a good player, the overreaction after that City game was funny. I've always rated him above Jones.His weak point was always his inability to keep or pass the ball, but he's done that very well in this game.

1243~~~
lovely long pass to Young

1244~~~
Been saying it for ages, but he's the most natural CB we have at the club. His reading of the game is fantastic, he's got a good range of passing (at CB not at RB) and he'll only get better and better in the coming years.

1245~~~
Plays brilliantly, reward him with sending him to right back

erm...

dont be surprised if it all goes wrong now

1246~~~
He fecked up in the City game, but the sheer hatred and knee jerking that came his way was ridiculous. He's always a fecking solid defender.

1247~~~
Said it before and i'll say it again, he's our best CB - compliments Rojo very well too.
Brilliant game from him today.

1248~~~
Good display and also did well bringing the ball out

1249~~~
Never bothered at all. Imperious today.

1250~~~
I like what I've seen from him the last few games. Like it a lot. Responded fantastically to the post City criticism. Dare I say he looks like a leader there at the back. Him and Rojo could potentially be a good partnership. Rojo with that bit of an edge to him and Smalling taking the leading role along with the pace to cover for times when Rojo is over zealous.

1251~~~
If Evans gets back to form they would make a quality pair. Only seen Rojo so far this season and the WC so unsure if I'd have him ahead of Jones/Evans.

1252~~~
He's got a wonderful first touch. Always seems to take the ball away from the pressing attacker with it, never puts himself in trouble. His passing isn't fantastic but that's one aspect of his technical game that is top notch.

1253~~~
Smallingbauer

1254~~~
Terrific response since the City game. Excellent against Arsenal and Hull. Long may it continue.

1255~~~
Keeps proving the doubters wrong. Silly mistakes against City aside, he's been our best defender by a mile.

He and Rojo should be our starting CB partnership from now on.

1256~~~
...and half the place wanted him sold....

he's brilliant.

we look solid at the back.

1257~~~
Looked like he got his confidence back on the ball. Was very good taking it out of the back today and making simple passes. 

A very assured defender. Please stay fit.

1258~~~
Another top performance.

Carried on his industrious form from the Arsenal game.

Starting to show some real conviction and leadership.

1259~~~
I liked his reading of the game today, made very few tackles, just came out and plucked the ball before it reached the striker, now that he has put up some semblance of game time i expect an injury against Stoke.

1260~~~
Maybe in this match... anyway it was always his passing which was always underated and his first touch was always horrible. He was very good today dragging the ball forward but we need to wait on him and see if he doesnt do any stupid mistake like against city or any laps of concentration will come because that is what hes got problem with. Anyway he has got all the attributes to be our best defender. I loved how he sprinted back and gave no chance to aluko or whoever was chasing the ball from haull same happend to willian against chelsea... I like him he needs to stay fit

1261~~~
#Smallingbauer

#SmallingPlusOne

Am I doing this hashtag thing right? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1262~~~
Another excellent performance from him today. He frustrates me sometimes like in the Derby game or the occasional clanger that he has but I really do like him a lot. I always have. I see more in him than I do in Jones and I really liked the pairing of him and Rojo today. I hope LVG sticks with that now that Smalling can stay fit because that could be a great partnership. And when Rafael and Shaw come back that could really turn into a really solid back 4. We just need to get them fit and keep them fit!!

1263~~~
Was excellent I thought. Re-affirmed his position as our best CB again. Is so calm and composed defensively and he added more to his attacking game which was good to see. Definitely #SmallingPlusOne

1264~~~
Hilarious thread.

One mistake and he's crap and should be sold. A good game at home to a team with less than 30% possession and he's the best defender at the club and a cross between Beckenbauer and Ferdinand.

The thread sums him up really. Needs more consistency.

1265~~~
To be fair, this one is true. Pretty obviously our best CB at the moment.

1266~~~
This has been true for a while now. And I, along with many others, have been consistent in saying that.

1267~~~
I agree and I think LVG rates him as the best too. He needs to display it consistently over a period of time though.

1268~~~
True. But this season is the first real chance he's ever had to do that. Until now, however well he was playing he'd be dropped as soon as Rio and Vidic were both fit.

He will never be a brilliant ball-playing defender. But he's made significant strides in that area since coming to us (not long out of non-league football, remember). And more importantly with every game he seems more aware of his own weaknesses and how to work around them.

1269~~~
A lot of folk seem to bang on about how terrible he is with the ball, and it makes it seem like he is a Sunday League clogger. I feel like I'm watching a different player, because I just don't see it. I think he's definitely better than Vidic was at bringing the ball forward, and I'd rather see Smalling running with the ball and playing a pass than Jones, to be honest.

His RB performances in the last 2/3 seasons were fairly poor overall, considering he's just not a RB, but I always thought he showed good touch and dribbling in a lot of cases when he did play there.

He always seemed capable of stuff like this to take on his man, as well as his pace:
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/i7ld8qZDy2kHi.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/i7ld8qZDy2kHi.gif"/> 

I also remember in the Community Shield against City when he sold Kolarov with a ripping Cruyff Turn right on the byline. Silky.

He misplaces the occasional pass, but so does Juan Mata. He seems much more comfortable bringing the ball over the halfway line than Vidic or Rio (in his later years) ever did. He's pretty good at it.

1270~~~
I think he's sort of inconsistent with the ball. He's capable of some nice touches, and when he's confident he has decent close control. But he often panics when he comes under pressure and becomes very clumsy.

His passing is similar. He can produce a decent midfield-splitting ball when it's on. But his aerial long passes, which he used to attempt with maddening frequency, are uniformly awful. It used to seem like he watched Rio, with his beautiful long diagonals and balls over the top, and was trying really hard to do the same thing but without the ability.

1271~~~
He's bounced back really well since the game against City. Arsenal and yesterday's performances he was absolutely outstanding. Confidence is a wonderful thing and he's also shown really good character to have picked himself up after what was possibly the worst possible thing he could have done in the eyes of the fans. Hope he carries on this good form.

1272~~~
Any .gif of his multiple headings? His determination to get first to the ball, and got it out of danger area are simply majestic.

1273~~~
His attitude after the City match has been fantastic, still maintain that he's our best defender, just needs to sort out his injury record. Smalling plus one!

1274~~~
Am i right in thinking neither he nor Rojo were injured yesterday?

1275~~~
Rebounded pretty well from that disaster at city. Made a couple of Phil Jones like runs into midfield today. Good to see that bit of confidence from him.

1276~~~
Correct. Now wrap them in cotton wool until the Stoke match!

1277~~~
Yep. Before the season i thought this would be our first choice pairing, hope they both start the next one. LvG said himself he wants consistency with the defence, and where we are now is no small feat compared to the injury free defences (and other areas for that matter) of the other top 3.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He had fantastic game ytd but that 3 header thing is a bit daft. Hull had two men free in the box with him out of it. It could have gone wrong.

1280~~~
I agree with everything you've said there except at the end of the Fergie era it was really Vidic and Evans that were first choice.

I think the way Moyes handled the centre backs was his biggest failing at United. Vidic and Rio left in the name of "transition" yet Smalling and Jones played far too many games in other positions and Evans managed to be less established at the end of his reign than he was at the start. No matter who the manager was going to be this season, they would start the season with zero established centre backs.

It's a big challenge but also a big opportunity for all of them. They deserve the chance to succeed or fail. I hope the fans are patient with them. Hopefully at least Smalling and Jones can step up.

1281~~~
You make an excellent point about centre backs last season. 

Moyes knew full well that Rio and Vida were leaving, he should have been making far more of an effort to bring Jones, Smalling and Evand though than he was.

1282~~~
After his stupidity against City a few weeks back he looks like he's turned a corner. Good display against Arsenal and even better performance yesterday.

1283~~~
After the City game if you scroll back you'll see I didn't give a shit, I wanted him gone to punish stupidity which may have been a <i>slight </i>over reaction but the emotions were high due to the opposition and he effectively cost us the game. BUT there's light at the end of the tunnel, since then he was immense vs Arsenal coming out with unbelievable stats (literally) and yesterday he decided he was Beckenbauer or a more suited Rio. Although it was ''only'' Hull, he put in the perfect performance both defending and bombing foward, could of had another goal too! 

He's clawing his way back onto my good list.

1284~~~
It's not the thread to get into a Moyes discussion but one of my biggest bugbears was the excuse of transition being used. In truth, he hadn't even started. If Smalling & Jones played at centre half every week and that was costing games at least it was a means to an end. This season was going to be the transition season (where players would turn over and you would expect a dip). I shudder to think where that would have taken the club.

1285~~~
He was absolutely superb yesterday. He's got to produce that standard now over a significant number of games. Now's his chance and hopefully he stays fit to give him the opportunity to do so.

1286~~~
Hull didn't put up much of a challenge, but he was outstanding yesterday. Definition of composure. 

I didn't jump on his back after the City game because I knew (as some others on here too) he was much better than that.

1287~~~
Said many times that I think he is not just United's, but also England's best centre half. 

Unbeatable more often than not. 

You know the hashtag by now!

1288~~~
Don't know if he is better than Cahill, but in this form he is way better than Jagielka !

1289~~~
Very good in the last two games, will need to be again on Tuesday as Stoke will be much more dangerous than Hull and I still think rojo hasn't settled yet.

1290~~~
Have maintained it for a while, easily our best CB. People just went mentally overboard after the City nonsense.

1291~~~
Yesterday, He was good at the things he is normally bad at. Distrubution and composure.

1292~~~
He's the one consistant CB we have. Thats been the main feature of his time since he joined. He had 1 bad game

1293~~~
He was stupid in the City game no question, but before and after that he's been consistently very good for us this season. He's looking like the player that kept Tevez tucked in his pocket shortly after joining. No stupid injuries and no daft suspensions and we'll see the best of him.

1294~~~
I don't disagree with you. I don't mean consistency in his level of performance. What he needs is consistency of position and to be consistently fit. IMHO the reason he isn't already established as a first choice centre back is due to not being able to do either. Performing to a consistent standard is great but if you miss the next game through injury or move to right back you will not establish yourself in the side. I really hope he can string a long sequence of consecutive games together now.

1295~~~
Still think we should?

1296~~~
I couldn't believe I was watching Chris Smalling on Saturday

1297~~~
I think that was his best performance since his breakthrough season in 2010-11 where I remember watching him and thinking we have the next England captain on our hands. Very promising.

1298~~~
Well he's made Garth Crook's team of the week. He must be made up

1299~~~
I'm sure I can list several performances of a similar standard since then. He is usually very good. Very good in Munich last season I reckon. And I think the 2-3 win in Persie's first season was another top game. Remember him stopping two certain goals from Dzeko and Aguero.

I think he is defensively as good as almost any centre-half out there, honestly.

1300~~~
Always said this. Also a lot of people he has played against said he is one of the hardest defenders to get past. He can combine pace on the turn with the ability to defend which is rare in a defender as well as being great in the air and at getting his foot in at the right time. One on one he's pretty much unbeatable. 

Some people feel he's not good based on his performances at RB or because he's not amazing on the ball. I don't care too much for that, he doesn't need to be spraying the balls 30yards to feet aslong as he can defend. Or they see Jones throwing himself into challenges or blocking the ball heroically and decide that is how a defender should defend. Most great defenders hardly need to do this due to good positioning in the initial phase to negate the danger. Players like Jones will get praise for a last ditch tackle while someone like Smalling will sense the danger 20 yards further up the pitch and make a simple interception that may not look as good.

This may seem slightly harsh on Jones as I feel he can also develop into a good defender but he's quite raw in terms of natural defending.

1301~~~
Now that we actually have a midfield, our CBs shouldnt be required to play constant, raking 50 yard passes either.

1302~~~
Agree with all of that. As the founder of the #SmallingPlusOne petition, it is no secret of my views on the man. That said, I do think you have been a bit harsh on Jones though. I think injuries are much more of a hinderance than any ability deficit. He started the season very well, and while not as strong in the air as Smalling, he is also close to unbeatable on the deck in an one-on-one I'd say. I still (just about), hold out hope for Smalling and Jones forming a top partnership. Evans, I'd have no issue with us selling however.

1303~~~
Smalling got four yellows in his first four seasons with us (that's fewer than Rio). Jones got 15 in his first three. In terms of positioning and technique, as a defender Smalling is light years ahead of Jones. It's also worth remembering that, when he joined United, Smalling's distribution was excellent - the idea that he can't pass, or that he has a limited range, is quite a recent development - possibly related to his time at RB.

1304~~~
I've been a massive fan of Smalling since he first joined us. We've been saying this for quite some time, but if just his injuries will clear up then he's going to become the first defender to go on the team sheet.

1305~~~
He's doing great, but what happens with Evans and Jones? My fear is LVG will drop him once Evans retains match fitness.

1306~~~
Evans is nowhere near Smalling, he hasnt been defending properly since SAF.

1307~~~
So far not a chance, mate. Physicality is what LVG will be looking for in upcoming transfer windows.

Smalling has height and mobility taken straight from NBA in the 90's not to mention that he's finally catching miraculous form. I think we're gonna rely on that plus Jonny is almost non-existent this season but they will probably rotate at some point anyway, especially in two matches a week dynamic and also when FA Cup will fully kick in.

So far Rojo and Smalling looks almost like a monster combo.

1308~~~
I agree, but Evans always seems to retain his place when he's fit. We'll see what happens, but Smalling and Rojo should be our starting CBs

1309~~~
I still believe he's our best defensive player, just frustrating he's injury prone and it's obvious his footballing development was at a low level when he was younger.

1310~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B33fRn3IUAA69I0.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B33fRn3IUAA69I0.png"/>

1311~~~
Sure as hell hope not, at least with evans. Evans will have to wait for someone to get injured to get his chance as he was awful when he did play. Jones was at least decent when he did play, so which ever of those 2 are fit should start.

1312~~~
Smalling has some impressive numbers

1313~~~
Smalling is our best defender. He's rapid as well, against Arsenal, Welbeck got a yard on him but he made it up in no time. Like others have said it's his distribution which really lets him down and it's very noticeable against teams who sit back and allow him the ball.

1314~~~
Yeah but he looks stupid so how can he be a good footballer? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1315~~~
I think his distribution has improved this season. He just needs to stay fit and he'll easily be our most reliable CB.

1316~~~
Indeed. Send him back to Maidstone!

1317~~~
I see what you're saying, but for me Smalling's performance against City was an anomaly. I don't think he's turned a corner as such. He's incredibly solid most of the time, just picked a terrible game to make some truly moronic decisions. He was good before the City game, he'll be good for the rest of the season.

1318~~~
I've never really understood why he gets so much stick. 

If he wasn't injury prone he'd be the best defender in the league by now imo.

1319~~~
Highest pass completion, and a good amount of them also go forward (70%). I think the distribution argument is a bit outdated, this season his distribution has massively improved.

1320~~~
His distribution will keep improving - Van Gaal will make sure of it. Strangely enough, playing at right back probably helped him take the ball forward. Seems extremely confident taking the ball into midfield. 

He's always been a complete tank defensively though and I just hope he can stay fit. Ridiculously talented defender.

1321~~~
not with his clumsy control that led to the equaliser

1322~~~
Been impressed with him tonight. Looked a lot more composed, dealt with Diouf well and been decent in the air. Just looked all around more confident. Certainly not a flawless performance but a lot better.

1323~~~
Eh? That was a tackle.

1324~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You are why we can't have nice things

1325~~~
Another great performance by him, the goal wasnt his fault even one but, just unfortunate. His distribution was perfect.

1326~~~
Another top performance keeping another pacey and strong forward at bay. Things got a little hazy in the last 4 minutes, but he did very well overall. My MOTM (ignoring Young and De Gea's brillance at the end) and his composure was fantastic.

1327~~~
Class again. MotM for me.

1328~~~
He's brilliant.

1329~~~
Absolutely fantastic performance today. I can't say much now as I'm still shaking.

1330~~~
Dealt really well with a tough opponent in Diouf. Good to see him full of confidence.

1331~~~
I don't recognize him. Van Gaal reprogrammed him completely.

Even passing looks better and more precise.

1332~~~
Another monster display. Thats two in a row.

Nothing beats him in the air.

1333~~~
agree 100%

1334~~~
Massive fan of Smalling so I'll get a little picky. He's jumping under the ball way too much for my liking. Needs to work on his timing because, when he does, he'll be largely unbeatable in the air.

1335~~~
He'll only get better.

1336~~~
3 in a row surely? (Arsenal away).

1337~~~
Noticed this too, it has declined a bit it seems, he has always been an aerial beast.

1338~~~
I've not seen him look this confident since 2010/11 times, looking very assured.

1339~~~
Good performance again, long may it continue.

1340~~~
I also gave him MoTM, great performance and looks much more composed on the ball recently.

1341~~~
Is this the point where we can say that he turned the corner? I think he did. excellent game.

1342~~~
Very true!

1343~~~
He's making me eat my words after the City game, he maybe no where near world class yet but that wasn't far away from being a world class performance.

1344~~~
Him and Rojo looked as though they're building a nice understanding. Both played with real confidence tonight. Save about 5 minutes of the entire game, we looked totally comfortable defensively.

1345~~~
He was excellent against Cheslea, fecked up huge vs City and since he has come back he has looked to make himself the CB boss and is doing a fine job.

1346~~~
He was basically playing close to this before the City game.

1347~~~
He was immense tonight against giants. Shame he's going to get injured now that Evans is due back.

1348~~~
Excellent tonight. Desperately hope, for once, he keeps fit.

1349~~~
Man, this guy, I dunno what to think... Immense defender but at times also a shocking footballer. There are times that he can't seem to do the simple things like control the ball properly. Probably down to the fact that he didn't have professional coaching until he was 20, I'm sure he will improve.

Great performance form him today, tho.

1350~~~
He plays with such urgence, really great to see and looks like a leader.

1351~~~
No. Smalling's lack of technique on the ball has never been decisively costly like Vidic's. He gets a lot of undue stick for it here probably because of his frame and the way he looks on the ball. He's sound enough to be a top centre half.

1352~~~
Hope he keeps its up, playing fantastic right now

1353~~~
He was my MOTM. Was close between him and Dave but Smalling gave Diouf nothing all night. Unlucky with the goal as he couldn't sort his feet out. Our best defender though.

1354~~~
Looking like the player we have been expecting him to be for years,since the city game... just hope i don't jinx it

1355~~~
Fantastic response from him since the City game, exactly the reaction you would hope to see. In Jones' and Evans' absence he is emerging as the leader at the back.

1356~~~
yes he is but still his height and spring makes it up for him. He is best in the air because of his spring. His best highlight was when he saved us in 85th minute when Crouch was approaching to the box and there was a wicked cross bent to the box from their wide player I believe arnautovic..

1357~~~
Is that your nickname for Ashley Young? You couldn't seriously think De Gea was almost the best player on the pitch. Surely?

1358~~~
Young was close too, I just forgot to mention him. I gave them all 8s.

1359~~~
He's top drawer, if he could just stay fit!

Brilliant form since the red card.

1360~~~
If he stays fit, I see no reason why he can't become one of the best centre backs in the league. 

Another great display from him tonight.

1361~~~
Seems weird to say he has so much potential but he really does. If he could just stay fit and injury free... he has everything you'd want.. bar the personality. He needs to develop a rock solid mentality to be the player he can be.. his natural talent is incredible.

1362~~~
He's probably our best natural centre back but it's the brain farts and injuries that keep detailing his career. If he could curb that for at least an entire season (or the rest of this one at least), then you can see him becoming an integral part of our future defence.

1363~~~
He has only had the one I think, to be fair.

1364~~~
He's had plenty of them in his time at United which is what I think is being referred to.

1365~~~
On-field ones? Such as?

1366~~~
Brain farts? That's not Smalling's game.

1367~~~
You're spot on there, but it really shouldn't be that way. It's the nature of the game nowadays to write players off before they're even in their mid 20s but the fact is that at 25 Smalling is still pretty young for a centre half at this level. Not everyone is Rio Ferdinand, most top class centre halves don't build top class reputations until they're in late 20s. 

I thought he was brilliant today yet again.

1368~~~
Excellent performance, dominant and confident.

1369~~~
Actually, the match v.s Citeh seems to be the only match where he suffered a brain fart.

1370~~~
What has LVG done to him! How the feck is he looking so good?

Have always rated Jones & Evans above him, but he's put in two awesome performances, back to back. Today's was top drawer - the only vine I have against him is that he needs to be more aggressive with attackers when he is outside the box. But a MOTM performance for me today.

1371~~~
Great performance yesterday. 

Thought he was an absolute fecking animal all game long. 

Hope he stays fit, as I think he's been/has the potential to be our best defender for quite some time.

1372~~~
He's fantastic. Always had the attributes to put in these kinds of displays. Needs to stay healthy now and avoid going back to square one.

1373~~~
Such an accomplished display, both with and without the ball. Lets hope this form continues through this run of fixtures.

1374~~~
He reminds me a little of Des Walker. Excellent defender, quick, strong, good in the air... not great on the ball but with the right partner, will be brilliant.

He's also started to look a danger in the opposition area as well which is always nice. If he can stay injury-free I can see him being close to the team of the year come May. Terry and Cahill might have it sewn up but Big Chris can go close.

1375~~~
What happened to the bumbling "get the ball away from me" defender. It ridiculous what a lack of composure does to him. Look at him now.

1376~~~
He's been one of our best players of late. I can't really find an attacker that causes him much problems. The big and strong ones struggle against him due to his size, strength and leap. The quick ones are emberrassed for pace time and time again, and he rarely falls for dribbles one on one. He can switch off at times, but that rarely happens these days. 

I think he has improved his passing and technique as well, and he has become more of a threat in the opposition box - could have had a goal yesterday in fact.

1377~~~
I still have I absolutely no idea which rubbish Chris Smalling everyone claims they have been watching over the last few years to be honest.

1378~~~
I didnt see the game last night but pleased to see Smalling seems to have continued his good form. Always been a fan of his, plus I have him in my fantasy draft.

1379~~~
At RB maybe, but how many CB's can just play fullback like that?

1380~~~
Examples of these 'many' brainfarts or recant your statements. Evans is mr Brainfart when it comes to our CBs. Even Jones has had more in the center of defence. Smalling seldom makes unforced errors.

1381~~~
Say what you will about young Chris but i feel a lot more assured when a cross comes in if he's in the defence, if he (like others have said) can stay fit and develope his concentration and decision making he can still be a good first team player for us

1382~~~
There are so many created falsified statements about Smalling that it's quite amusing. Some said he was too slow (!), some said he was too poor on one on ones and some claimed he was too poor in the air. Now they claim he's prone to brainfarts. Neither of these arguments hold any truth. He is prone to injuries and is no RB, which has caused some to believe that he isn't as good as he is. 

The only argument that is unfortunately partly true is that his distribution and his technique needs working, but it has improved as of late. Neither Vidic nor Terry are/were brilliant with the ball, but few would claim they are poor players.

1383~~~
What's wrong with his decision making?

1384~~~
I feel its lacking at time, prob due to being played out of position in previous years and a lack of a proper established run at cb

I don't see this as a major critisim, young defensive players (and goal keepers) often aren't consistent due to this, something that comes with experience

1385~~~
Exactly, we should never right off a center back before he is 27, before that they are just baby CBs, a real center back is an experienced one.
Smalling is still young, he can still achieve all his potential.

1386~~~
You're too right. The funny thing is people want to believe these statements so badly. It baffles. Smalling never gets beat for pace and so far i've never seen him lose in a 1v1. Even Welbeck said he was the toughest player to play against in training.

1387~~~
Brain fart was maybe an exaggeration but the notion he doesn't make unforced errors is not true. He's been way too lax on the ball in the past. He's been guilty of mispassing the ball and giving the ball away far too often which more often than not, we've gotten away with, but his passing and distribution was certainly something that was a problem of his. He's done well this season to rectify it though. 

Get rid of this and his injuries and he's halfway there to being a titan at the back for us.

1388~~~
Indeed. His distribution has been better this season. He has the best pass completion for a CB in the league right now, alongside Kompany at 89.9%

1389~~~
Usually when people talk about unforced errors from a CB they mean defending. Because thats the be all and end all of their job.

Thats where Smalling has been our most consistant and has been found wanting least of our CBs

Yes on the ball he's made some poor choices, but ultimately he just needs to do the basics with the ball and he seems to have already rectified that judging by the previous matches

1390~~~
I really couldn't care less how Smalling is on the ball. He can defend and defend very well. I'll take that for now and the signs are he's regaining his composure on the ball so it's all good.

1391~~~
Exactly. It's funny, he's defending no better than he has done on many occasions in the past, yet people are getting all excited because he has launched few 50-yarders out to Young.

Fitness has been his issue. If and when he stays fit then he's the first defender on the team sheet.

1392~~~
Rojo, Jones and Smalling (apart from the terrible display against City) have impressed me so far this season. All they need to do is stay fit. Even McNair and Blackett did well mostly. Been a little disappointed by Evans so far though, will be interesting to see who plays when all CBs are fit (should that ever happen).

1393~~~
I'd suspect that Evans is on a tight-rope, especially with us constantly being linked with another CB. I would think that McNair and/or Blackett will go on loan next season.

1394~~~
I think Evans has been quite comfortably our worst defender this season. Smalling, Rojo, Jones and Blackett have been quality most of the time but also pretty poor in some games. McNair has really impressed me throughout. Played 4, won 4 with him in the side.

1395~~~
While his flat out defending is top of the list in terms of importance, his ability on the ball is also very important in the way LVG wants the team playing. If he is losing the ball or punting because he is dawdling then that puts the team under far more pressure. At the level United want to be playing, the CB have to have very good ability on the ball along with being defensively sound.

The broken record is that if Smalling can stay fit - he'll come good on both. He is already very good defensively and for being good on the ball, that will take more confidence and playing consistency.

1396~~~
I remember the night after the City game. Insane this place was regarding him. Have maintained for a while, easily our best CB. Just needs to work on his game on the ball.

1397~~~
For me the only thing he needs is a good injury-free run in the team. He's becoming more vocal which is good but I'd like to see him become more of a leader which will come with experience.

1398~~~
Very few defenders in recent times fit your bill. Even absolutely top CBs like Vida or Terry were far from very good on the ball. Its a good trait to have and as you said, given how LVG wants us to play, important as well but very good ability on the ball will always be just a bonus, the most important thing is to be top class defensively and Smalling is easily our best in that regard.

1399~~~
No doubt it's rare to find both but, that doesn't mean we should be satisfied if we only get very good defensively. Also, to me being good on the ball doesn't mean being able to launch 50 yard balls but, to be able to handle being pressured, carrying the ball out the back when need be and play good short to medium passes out the back. As for Smalling, from the off I've always thought he will be a player once he plays consistently will fit the bill of being good on the ball as a CB and he is already showing good signs of it.

1400~~~
One definitely cant be a liability with the ball, I was referring more to you saying it was essential to be very good with the ball for a club like ours. Too high an expectation imo. Not referring to Smalling here, in general. 

Thankfully, we have LVG now. If they dont improve under him, they never will, in this regard.

1401~~~
Sell him.

Who's the person beside him? It's not Fletch, is it?

1405~~~
Well, shit, it's still better than his previous bomber-jäger outfit.

<a class="username" data-user="66486, @Crackers" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66486/">@Crackers</a> could be Lindegaard.

1406~~~
I am going to re-state what I said earlier - having an actual midfield helps the CBs distribution dramatically.

In previous seasons there have been loads of times every single game where I saw one of the CBs have the ball and nobody from midfield would show for it - meaning the only option was a sideways pass or lumping it forwards. You cannot build from the back under those conditions.

People saying that Smalling doesnt fit LVGs style have it completely wrong. The fact that now we have players dropping back and giving the defenders options for who to pass to, benefits Smalling immensely. He isnt that bad on the ball anyway - it was a confidence issue. The stats show that Smalling has the joint highest passing completion in the league so far for a CB, so 'nuff said.

1407~~~
You are so very right. It's the same reason why Rio suddenly became shit with the ball - there were no options to pass to. Rio did state that Moyes wanted him to hoof the ball forward. Obviously, that doesn't really suit our team. Having Herrera, Mata and Carrick providing passing options dramatically improve our passing from the back.

1408~~~
It looks like Amos or one of Smalling's personal mates to me. Fletcher doesn't seem like a party animal going to these sorts of things when he has a family to take care of.

1409~~~
It's Amos.

1410~~~
That looks like Amos to me.

Are you gay?? The girl beside Amos is more important!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Much better.

1419~~~
I've lost 200 quids tonight on football betting....i'm in bad mood <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> (fecking Dortmund and Hartlepool)

1420~~~
Injured again. No matter how talented he is, he should be on his way out soon alongside the usual culprits if he doesn't get his injury problems out of the way. Unlucky but that's the way it should be.

1421~~~
Lol, of course.

1422~~~
What happened to him? I couldn't see due to my shite stream.

1423~~~
looked like a injury to the abductor muscle... hopefully is not serious.

1424~~~
That looked bad, how many weeks could a injury like that be keeping him out for?

1425~~~
Did his groin. His muscles must be made of spit and brown paper. Ridiculous.

1426~~~
Someone somewhere has voodoo dolls of Smalling, Evans and Jones and a lot of spare time.

1427~~~
ffs dont start with those!

1428~~~
Brilliant, we've looked so much assured with him in our team and now we're back to square one

1429~~~
Not to worry, we have Rojo, McNair, and Evans with Jones back in training.

1430~~~
lol the timing roul

1431~~~
Seriously? Ugh.

1432~~~
Sums up his United career, complete waste of time relying on players like him.

1433~~~
I'm sure defensive injuries will even themselves out over the course of the season - didn't Chelsea lose Cahill for 45 minutes recently?

1434~~~
I'm the biggest Smalling fan, but if you cant stay fit, you simply have to go after a while.

1435~~~
I don't care if they aren't world class, we need a center half in Jan. Cannot rely on him no matter his potential.

1436~~~
So predictable.

1437~~~
On a positive note, this injury must mean Jones is back to full fitness.

Hurrah!

1438~~~
Anymore injuries this season, and he's had his chips IMO.

1439~~~
Injured again unbelievable.

1440~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Just simply... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1441~~~
I've given up. I genuinely thought our defenders would stay fit and step up to the plate after years of playing out of position and not all that often this season. I was completely wrong. We need quality reinforcements as soon as January.

1442~~~
Just came in to say that I remember someone making this prediction. Made me laugh when it happened.

1443~~~
Had few good games and showed some promise but inevitably gets injured, same story with jones, evans and smalling, it's just boring now and needs to be rectified by two new signings. We look a complete mess at the back and the next few games suddenly look a lot harder.

1444~~~
The core of most SAF sides was a stable center back pairing. Smalling probably won't ever be able to form part of one.

1445~~~
What else to expect of smalling and jones. They have a good run of form then get injured. What a difference our defense looked when he went off though. Him and jones clearly have ability but if they can't stay fit it's just going to be difficult for them to progress.

1446~~~
Massive loss IMO. His pace and power have bailed out our defence a lot this season, barring City. Evans doesn't have the same presence, he's smaller, not as quick and looks less assured. Its thrown the whole back line out of whack losing Smalling. Couldn't believe it when he went down after nothing more than a slip.

1447~~~
Can anyone say they were surprised to see Smalling go off injured? Seeing our defenders go off injured has become the norm now, and I fully expected this to happen before the match, and that's probably the worst thing about it all.

1448~~~
Defence went to shit without him (though the system was failing too).

Hopefully not serious.

1449~~~
Hope he's back against liverpool, Smalling is our best defender. Can't fathom what his body is made of though, his record is appaling.

1450~~~
Did his injury look serious? I didn't see it.

1451~~~
Looked like a groin strain. Probably out for 2-4 weeks.

1452~~~
So whats the news?

1453~~~
I was telling a work colleague earlier today about us having 40+ injuries this season and he thought I was over-exaggerating...

Surely we're on 45+ injuries now? An injury every 4/5 days.

It's ridiculous.

1454~~~
We shat the bed without him. It's only typical that he was going to get injured after 3 really good games.

1455~~~
Hope it's nothing bad. We badly need him

1456~~~
Van Gaal said he'll be back as soon as one of Rojo or Evans injure themselves.

1457~~~
And here I was thinking he had turned a page, alas as soon as Evans got fit it was Smalling's turn. We desperately need one good defender next month if we want to consolidate our position.

1458~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1459~~~
If Smalling doesn't make it at United, it's because of his injuries. So fecking gutted for him.

1460~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1461~~~
Was thinking.. "Smalling looks our best defender now, so confident and someone to potentially build the defence around... but he's injured so often that you can't rel..."
5mins later...Injured.

Waste of time, we need 2 CB's brought in over the next 2 transfer windows.

1462~~~
Its got to the point with him and Jones where I can't even bring myself to be annoyed.

Its just so fecking predictable.

1463~~~
Badly missed his presence at the back once he came off. Evans really needs a run of games to be fit in the first team before he's anywhere near being reliable at the back and McNair got exposed because Soton closed him down quickly from the start, forced him to make mistakes and lose his cool!

1464~~~
I'm there with you. I think he's brilliant, when fit, but United cannot keep hoping for him to stay fit. Hopefully it's not something that will keep him out of play for long. He's so important for us now; just look at how we struggled in the air after he came off, and his ability to read the game is also unparalleled in our squad (bar Carrick).

1465~~~
It's all too predictable yea, you knew he'd go down.. maybe not today but within 2-3 more games, you'd bet your house on it
but personally still ended up swearing lividly at the tele.

1466~~~
Fact is that Evans lacks the physical presence of Smalling and that is something we miss without him. We lost too many duels today.

1467~~~
When was the last time when he was fit enough for more than 5 games at a stretch? 

Good defender, horrible injury record. I don't know how long can we keep waiting for him to get over his injury issues.

1468~~~
I figure till the end of the season personally.
We should really be trying to pick up a cb in january because the 3 of them are made of glass.
Any that dont stay fit for the rest of the season replace.

Good defender, its a pity.

1469~~~
Up until this season his fitness was better than Evans or Jones, which isnt saying much but the answer is last season. Last season he was fit for more than 5 in a row

1470~~~
We can make do with revolving defenders for the remainder of this year, then buy a very good CM in the summer. Smalling, Evans, Jones, Rojo, McNair, and Carrick are more than capable of carrying the water until then.

1471~~~
We just can't keep any of these defenders fit can we?

1472~~~
Really hope he's back in time for the scousers. Deluded, I know but we need all we can against the irrepressible Lambert.

1473~~~
Showed again why he is our best defender. We were an absolute rabble without him. As soon as he went off all composure was lost. Hopefully the injury is not too bad. You could see the disappointment in his face because he was just starting to put some games together. Really, really unfortunate.

1474~~~
Johnny Evans is back, Smalling breaks down. Jones gets back and Evans is done. Rinse and Repeat.

1475~~~
Why is it when one of our returning defenders is on the bench then the one starting gets injured? No doubt Jones will be on the bench next game and Rojo will get injured.

Damn you <a class="username" data-user="74684, @Red Katie" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74684/">@Red Katie</a>

1476~~~
Get rid of him, Jones and Evans.

Don't care if he has potential, or quality. Useless if he can't stay fit.

Said before the season started that it was ludicrous to base your defence on them three with their histories, it's proven to be true.

1477~~~
And then buy THREE new defenders we have to integrate into the squad? Do you even? I don't even...

1478~~~
Wouldnt be surprised if he left and never got an injury again. Its not just him though is it? With the number of injuries that our players keep getting, rather than the players, something deeper should be looked at. Training? Food habits? Anything else? Must be something.

Also thought he was looking our best CB the last few games and it was nice to see him CB rather than RB.

1479~~~
Losing my patience with him. It's even more frustrating after his recent form. Looked so much more solid with him in the team.

1480~~~
That's what I keep thinking will happen too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1481~~~
He looked absolutely destroyed when he went off.

1482~~~
You could tell he was completely gutted and thinking some of the same thoughts as are being shared on this board.  

He knew he'd be out for a bit and was clearly disappointed.

1483~~~
He's probably our best center half which doesn't say much...we just can't rely on jones, evans or smalling long term.....I'm sure LVG will splash the cash in january if the right player becomes available but I don't think anyone will be available then

1484~~~
A shame for Smalling as he's actually looked quite decent of late. The trouble is that, yet again, his quality is secondary to his inability to stay fit. The same applies to Evans, Jones and Rafael. We can't go on with having one hobble into the treatment room just as one hobbles out and playing with converted wingers as fullbacks.

All of them out of contract in summer 2016. I reckon they have about nine months to convince van Gaal they can stay fit or they'll be moved on.

1485~~~
He's been very good recently, and has given our defence a look of solidity and confidence.

Really annoyed and frustrated he's out again, hope it isn't for very long.

1486~~~
We've got money to burn, go mad.

Three new defenders to integrate into the squad or three players who take it in turns to be fit and are error prone when they come back every single time. I think I'd take a chance on the three new ones. Smalling, Jones and Evans have had far too many.

1487~~~
He was good against Chelsea, Arsenal, Hull and Stoke but once again his body just gives out on him, it's like we need to send him back to the factory as we got sent a faulty Smalling.

1488~~~
You just know if we sell him that he'd be fit constantly for his new team.

1489~~~
So why are you losing patience if as you say, he's been in good form lately ?

1490~~~
The useless Sky interviewer didn't ask about Smalling, did LVG say anything in the postmatch presser?

1491~~~
Some form of muscle tear that will be assessed tomorrow.

1492~~~
Well what's new with smalling? We need to have an injury prediction thread for smalling, Jones and Evans - how many matches will they last before injury strikes again.

1493~~~
At what point do you give up on him.

Very good player when fit and has a run of matches, but you can't keep hoping that he stays fit.

I'd say the same goes for Rafael and Evans.

1494~~~
We have a Jones, Smalling and Evans injured thread. Thats enough

1495~~~
Well certainly not before Jones or Evans who are injured just as often and aren't as good when they do play.

1496~~~
The sad thing is, I wasn't even surprised one bit that this happened. Of course an injury would follow after a string of good performances.

1497~~~
The fact that the cycle that he's been  in good form and injured happen again?

1498~~~
just a matter of time, nothing surprising here..

the story of chris smalling. decent for 4 or 5 games and look set to be our long term CB before injuring himself and out for a couple of months or so.

1499~~~
Ah right, fingers crossed it's nothing serious...

1500~~~
Such a shame. Think Smalling and jones for that matter have it in them to become top class center backs, just I doubt either will ever get there because they are crocks. Always get injured. Nobody can say that Smalling picking up an injury was unexpected, I was surprised he managed to go a month without picking one up really. He was doing well and I'm gutted for him, but there has to be a point where you cut your losses. This season should be the last chance for all 3 of them.

1501~~~
Sell him and Evans. No point waiting around for them anymore. We need players that are going to actually play every week and it's starting to be pretty obvious we'll never get that with these two. Jones is still young enough to turn it around while we hopefully get some experience and leadership in the squad.

I do like Smalling as a player, it just isn't really paying off to rely on him anymore.

1502~~~
You've got to feel for him. He was visibly distraught as he left the pitch. He'd been playing superbly and that injury surely means we won't see him again in 2014.

With the current run of form and the gap closing to Chelsea and City I was starting to think that United still had a chance to win the league this season. After seeing how bad the defence was after he went off I have now dismissed those thoughts.

1503~~~
I fear his great future is slowly receding into the past. Pity-but no reason to hold on to him if he can't stay fit.

1504~~~
He needs to stop getting injured ffs. 

He was getting into a good run of form as well, which can't be said of Evans or Rojo.

1505~~~
I was totally gutted when he went off injured. Evans was utter shit

1506~~~
Whats the word on the injury?

1507~~~
His last 2 injuries have happened without any real contact, he looks such a strong athlete but his muscles seem fragile.

1508~~~
I was gutted but not surprised. You always felt even in the last game that it could happen any second, or between games we'd hear that he's now on crutches for some reason.

1509~~~
He's so unlucky with injuries. The pain on his face made me feel sorry for him.

1510~~~
LVG needs to sign a world class CB next summer, and i expect the team to challenge for the tittle by then. unfortunately there are not many out there but someone like godin, eventhough in his late 20's and is going to cost us pretty lot, should be our target.

no matter how good and talented chris smalling is,he is going to spend half of the full season on the treatment table. and i can say the same about jones and evans.

time to get ruthless by offloading at least one of smalling, jones or evans. at this rate i'll probably say evans should be off.

new CB, rojo, smalling and jones sounds fine to me. plus we still got mcnair and blackett. smalling and jones can still take their turn with injuries though.

1511~~~
Congratulations to Chris Smalling who wins this week's Manchester United injury raffle! Who will be the next winner in the Liverpool match?

1512~~~
He had a groin injury earlier in the season as well no? Then he just pulls up after nothing, 10 minutes into the game. That's surely something to do with the warm up?

1513~~~
Keeps getting injured, there's no point being in good form for 3/4 games if you're going to miss the next 6.

1514~~~
Sigh...

1515~~~
He injured himself while walking. Slapstick stuff.

His form has been very good, but yesterday was proof that we should ditch him and probably the likes of Evans and Jones too.

What's the point in having players who destabilise everything by continually picking up absurd injuries during games? We were quite comfortable yesterday up until Smalling's injury and then things went tits up.

1516~~~
I absolutely agree. Being able to stay fit is an important part of a player's make-up.

1517~~~
Overly harsh assessment - he just looked like a player who has been out injured for ages.

1518~~~
Gutted that hes injured. Been really enjoying him and Rojo together lately.

1519~~~
At what point do we give up on almost all of our defenders? There's a reason we struggle to say "he's definitely our best defender/CB" because no-one seems to be able to play a few matches on the trot without getting injured. Add to that we have Kamikaze Jones who seems to enjoy to injure the rest of his team mates in addition to every part of his own body. Rafael, Jones, Evans and Smalling all has the potential to be a certain starter for United but this has been going on for a few years now. I'm about to give up on all of them. Too tired of having to say "can't wait til Rafa/Evans/Smalling/Jones is back, he's our best in that position". Is this the main reason for us struggling to go through the transition from Rio/Vidic/Evra to a new, solid back four seamlessly? They are all useful when fit but we can't keep up with this unstable defence. It's the 2nd or 3rd season in row now that he haven't had a stable back four.

1520~~~
He's so unlucky. Please don't become our Diaby.

1521~~~
Just like Jones, Evans and Rafael, can't be relied on and should be shipped out.

Same old.

1522~~~
Problem is we seem to be rushing back players in order to patch up gaping holes in the squad. Someone like Smalling needs to be brought back slowly and until his muscles are completely healed and at full natch fitness. Something isn't right with the way we bring players back into the team.

1523~~~
Let's just hope he's back for the Liverpool game. He's currently the only defender where I am not worried when he plays

1524~~~
If the injury records of Rafael/Jones/Smalling/Evans don't improve for the remainder of the season, they should be worried about their futures at the club.

1525~~~
Gutted about this one. Will be a big loss.

He was starting to put together some very good performances.

1526~~~
He clearly knows better than anyone how significant any injuries are at this point in his career. You just have to look at his reaction to see how absolutely gutted he was. He had the chance, and was on course, to completely nail down a CB position and now he has to go through it all over again.

1527~~~
Defender almost def now coming in Jan window. The CB can't play 2 games without being injured. It's like they are made of tissue paper.

1528~~~
He's the last CB at the club I'd get rid of. When he's fit he's a sure thing unlike the rest, and it's not as if most of them can stay fit for a period of time.

1529~~~
I'm purely speculating on the basis that if it wasn't serious he would have made an effort to play on. I actually have no idea!

1530~~~
A muscle tear I think. Assessed tomorrow (whenever that is in the U.K - probably today?)

1531~~~
Yeah, sometime today. If it's a muscle tear we won't be seeing him until the new year. Shame really with the intense fixture list coming up.

1532~~~
Eughhh it never ends does it. Getting tired of this now. Whatever the issue, it needs sorting - be it the players themselves (sell them), the coaches (sack them) or the facilities (change them)

Same thing has been happening under SAF, Moyes and now LvG so it must be something that has been there all along. How is that Chelsea can play 6 out of the 11 players in EVERY match and yet we can barely go one game without picking up at least one injury? It beggars belief at this stage

1533~~~
Someone mentioned how Chelsea's training sessions are not that intense (!!!) and how Chelsea are yet drilled to win games before the 70th minute. Whoever is the fool at United who suggests to always use a more intense approach in training should be sacked. I strongly suspect Tony Strudwick to have a huge role in our injury mess.

1534~~~
Same with me. His injury record has been terrible this season but its still marginally better than jones or evans isn't it?
I'd start shipping them out more or less now though, or the end of the season i guess, its one thing having 1 injury prone defender but we've got too many.

1535~~~
Actually came back from his ban and proved he has quality and then this.. feck sake.

1536~~~
a few good performances and another injury - I'd agree ship him out based on being unavailable but Jones, Evans and Rafael are exactly the same for the last 18 months and longer in Jones/Rafael case - Even Shaw has been injured more than he's been available

something clearly not right

1537~~~
Is there any news on him? Did LVG say anything after the match?

1538~~~
Dailymail said this: "Manchester United centre back Chris Smalling will be assessed on Tuesday after sustaining a suspected muscle tear against Southampton."

1539~~~
Muscle tear. That doesn't sound good..

1540~~~
But Shaw's last injury is an impact injury, so we can't really count that.

1541~~~
Potentially a top defender but there's no point in having someone you can only rely on for a few consecutive games. The same goes for Jones, Evans and Rafael, if they don't prove themselves by the end of the season then I'd get rid of all the brittle feckers.

1542~~~
Doesn't sound promising.

1543~~~
Feck sake, this musical chairs' game Evans, Smalling and Jones seem to be playing is starting to get on my tits.

1544~~~
Any news on him or do we have to wait until the press conference?

1545~~~
All these player performance threads can be answered in one word..... "mixed"

1546~~~
He's kind of turning into a Wes Brown...great when playing, talented, but maybe out more than not. I'd keep him. We could certainly do with Wes at the moment. Apparently he's been playing very well...

1547~~~
He'd be part of my first choice defence, but a run of games is never a serious option unfortunately.

1548~~~
I wouldn't ship him out but I would like us to look at their contact. Smalling and Jones are good players on their day and it's a real shame we'll probably never seem them blossom. If it continues, they should be on a pay as you play until they prove they can stay fit. Evans? Not overly convinced, the best thing about him is his wife <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Hopefully smallings injury is nothing major. Hopefully.

1549~~~
Chris Smalling is out until Christmas with the injury he suffered in Manchester United's win over Southampton.

Smalling came off after 18 minutes <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/southampton-1-2-manchester-united-robin-4769942" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the 2-1 win at the St Mary's Stadium</a> amid fears he could he facing a lengthy spell out with the muscle tear

But a scan has revealed the injury is not as bad as first feared, although Smalling will miss the next fortnight

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chris-smalling-out-until-christmas-4782367" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chris-smalling-out-until-christmas-4782367</a>

1550~~~
It's only starting? You are a patient man.

1551~~~
A shame. He's looked good with Rojo and I don't think we were troubled much while he was on the pitch. Disappointing but not surprising and two weeks isn't bad but will mean he'll most likely miss our next 3 games; Liverpool (h), Villa (a), Newcastle (h).

1552~~~
Two weeks isn't bad, expected him to be out for a month at least.

1553~~~
Hopefully it's not a Gary Neville 2 weeks.

1554~~~
I don't understand how someone can be out for two weeks if LvG requires a player to train for a minimum of two weeks after an injury before being considered for the squad. I assume he won't train for at least a week because of the injury-which means he will be out for a minimum of three weeks. Or do I not understand the philosophy.

1555~~~
We don't have much choice, plus I think that they do a fitness test and if they make it.... And for CBs it's easier to make ti, the for FBs, wingers and so.

1556~~~
Think he only meant that for longer term injuries. Both Shaw and Carrick picked up knocks for the national team a month ago and came back the next weekend to play (same with di Maria). It's only when a player is out after bigger injuries, like blind, falcao, evans, whoever else.

1557~~~
I don't think a player has to train two weeks before he's available for match again if he's out with a injury just for 10-14 days like Smalling

1558~~~
Rooney didn't at least.

1559~~~
Not this again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I really hope we do not rush Smalling back. 

Hopefully we sign one centre back during Jan window now and then decide which one(s) to offload in summer.

1560~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I think one thing we can be sure of is nobody will be rushed back with LvG as manager given his stringent guidelines. It's a real shame for Smalling, you could see how gutted he was. Despite the City fubar he has had a run of decent games at CB and was showing some leadership qualities.

1561~~~
Ahh-thanks. That makes sense.

1562~~~
2 weeks isn't too bad. 
Hopefully its the last injury this season.

1563~~~
Yeah the same will go for Di Maria i think

1564~~~
Such a pisstake, though 2 weeks ain't bad. Only troubling game would be Liverpool at home, he'll miss Villa away then hopefully he'll be back for two tough games against Newcastle and Spurs on the 26th and the 28th respectively.

1565~~~
2 weeks isnt that bad but he'll probably get injured 2 or 3 times or more till the end of the season.

1566~~~
Thank God its only two weeks. Im relieved

1567~~~
Good to see him back, hope he starts against Stoke as neither Evans or McNair are filling me with confidence right now.

1568~~~
Good run out today, so happy to see him back again.

1569~~~
Just needs to stay fit and play like he was before his injury.

1570~~~
I think he has what it takes to be one of our best defenders, if he can just stay fit, and get a good run of games, but therein lies the problem of course, ever since we've bought him, he was either injured or playing out of position

1571~~~
He's already our best defender and if you look at more than 1 season, he's stayed fit more than Jones or Evans.

1572~~~
Happy to see him back. Made some important tackles at the back. He and Shaw didn't do well for the goal, mind you.

1573~~~
Solid so far. Never will be great on the ball but at least he looks confident and solid at the back unlike Evans.

1574~~~
Good to have him back, he's our best CB IMO.

1575~~~
Yeah, bar the communication mishap for the corner Smalling has been the best CB yet again.

1576~~~
Been impressed with him since last season. He has the level required of a Man Utd defender, but injuries are a Big problem for him.

He should always start when fit, question is who should partner him, i am not sure if Rojo is good enough but we shall see after this season.

1577~~~
He is a clueless player, a real danger.

1578~~~
What?

1579~~~
Don't think its been one of his better performances. Fairly solid, but he's capable of being much better and completely dominating the box against even someone as big as Crouch.

1580~~~
The only one in our 5-man defense who wasn't a garbage.

1581~~~
He should have done better for Stokes goal, unlucky not to give a penalty away and should have done better when Crouch hit the post with a header. None or our defenders can be proud of their individual performances today but I'd have him down as being the poorest of the lot.

1582~~~
Clear as day, he's assigned to mark Diouf all game. For the first goal, Crouch was out of 'danger' area, and as the main CB, you don't go that far out of the center area. It is the duty of other players.

That 'penalty' claim was from a header 1 meter away.

That Crouch header that hit the post, maybe he could do better, but it was a back header that would be a wonderful goal if it went in.

1583~~~
Solid today and might have got away with a penalty decision.

We did a decent job against what is always a tough stoke side to play. Smalling really led the way in terms of being strong and physical.

1584~~~
The only one of the 3 senior CB's that has really looked like he has a shot here in the last 5 months IMO.

1585~~~
Had some very good tackles in the match, struggled with Crouch a bit but that's not a shame. Is way ahead of dumb and dumber. His distribution was solid.

1586~~~
Our best CB, which doesn't say much. But, he's the only one CB that I don't panick when someone is near him, neither expect him to make many mistakes.

He will be here next season. Not sure for the other two.

1587~~~
Handball aside, he was decent. Best of our defenders.

1588~~~
I hope he's doing double yoga sessions...

1589~~~
I thought he played well beside the penalty.
He should know better than to have his arms raised in that position, we were lucky to get away with it.
Its the kind of stupid mistake that i wouldn't normally expect from him but between this and the city game its becoming a bit of a worrying habit.
He'd still be my first choice cb out of what we have despite that.

The way jones just hulk smashes into a challenge every so often injuring himself half the time is getting old. 
When hes paying attention hes a good defender, hes quick which helps cover his mistakes most of the time. But i just dont trust him to pay attention all that often.
And while he <i>should</i> be good at bringing the ball out of defence he always bloody overruns it and gives it away making him completely rubbish at it because he loses it that way 4/5 times a match.

I thought evans was our best defender last season but the last month or two of last season and all of this hes been hopeless.
I suppose giving one ridiculously good chance away is an improvement over the mk dons farce but hes been really poor for a while now.

Smalling is pretty faultless defensively imo.
Hes weak on the ball but he knows that and he works around it. He looks awkward but he doesn't give it away to be fair to him.
Evans, Rojo and Jones are all more talented but all have been trying too hard and forcing stupid passes, putting them and the rest of the defence under pressure

1590~~~
I thought Jones and Shaw were the ones who didn't do their jobs there.

1591~~~
I'm going to set up a shrine to pray for Chris Smalling's ongoing fitness, because without him I'd have blood pressure problems every time the opposition go forward. He's our only center back where I feel confident when the balls nearby. The others I'm just waiting for the inevitable feck up.

1592~~~
He's a proper defender, very solid. He has completely showed he's better than the other two.

1593~~~
Of our defenders, I like Smalling most (of the ones that were on the pitch today). Today's performance was quite decent, and his drive to keep doing better impresses me. 

Still think he and Rojo are our best combo for Centre Backs. Evans constantly makes me fearful and Jones is quite good but sometimes has brainfarts.

1594~~~
He's a terrible defender. I can't believe people are praising him after that game.
Still looks as clueless as he did when he first came here.

1595~~~
Sorry but that's just complete rubbish. Yes he looks a bit clumsy but he's a very good defender on the floor and the air. Our best defender by far.

1596~~~
Surprised to see that he's the second highest on the man of the match poll (unless the posters who voted are wumming). He really struggled today and couldn't cope with Crouch or Diouf. He seemed rather flustered every time the ball was in our box and could've given away a penalty.

1597~~~
There is just one clueless person here, and that's you. Embarassing post, you probably dont even watch United as he is by far the best CB United got.

1598~~~
Our 4th best defender after Jones, Evans and McNair.

And Evans plays his worst season for United.

1599~~~
That pretty much means nothing nowadays. But agree that he is playing well (although not even near the standard of a top CB).

1600~~~
Smalling has been very impressive this season. He doesn't get bullied anymore by giant opposition strikers. There could be a really top defender in him if he can stay injury free and keeps improving. Jones has been good too even if he's still getting used to being out on the right. Evans just isn't up to it though even if he has some good performances in him

1601~~~
So, how is he supposed to be playing to be near the standard of top CB? Look at his whole season, how do TOP CBs play compared to him?

1602~~~
Well Rojo and Jones have been decent at least, saying someone is better than Evans means nothing tho. And isnt he? He has been class pure defensively, hardly making any mistakes in that aspect, and his distribution has massively improved, not hoofing any more, trying forward passes, bursting forward, had a brainfart vs City and a half one today, what should he to, to be near that standard? Probably change his name in Hummels, who has been way less than him this season, yet we like to pay big money for him.

1603~~~
Significantly better than he is doing. Being better than Jones and Evans doesn't mean much (especially with Evans' form).

I am a fan of Smalling and rate him significantly higher than our other 3 CB, but I don't think that he has progressed much since his debut season with us (2010-2011).

1604~~~
Our defense looks so much more solid with him than without him. That is a trademark of a top class CB. His runs through the middle are starting to win me over as well. His strength and pace are vital if we want to continue with a 3-5-2 formation. If only he could stay fit...

1605~~~
He has shown improvement since that City game - more composure and looks more assured going into tackles.

1606~~~
He was brilliant against Chelsea, which was before the City game, then against Arsenal, and later on. He is actually playing really well, like at the beginning of his United career, but the rest of the defenders just isn't helping (even if Jones is doing OK, but is doing stupid fouls).

Yes, he didn't progress as much, but this season he is getting better and better. Even last season, he was very good (the Hull game was bad) and probably our best CB (I am not talking about his games as FB), the games against Bayern were almost perfection.

1607~~~
Probably because we decided to feck with him and waste him for the next 3 years (+ injuries), rather than actually let him develop properly in his actual position.

1608~~~
I prefer McNair

1609~~~
Really? On what basis...

1610~~~
He had a decent game, but I don't think it was up there with his best performances. He looked nervous every time a ball was launched into the box, and even though he dealt with Stoke's attacks well, he didn't seem comfortable enough dealing with the height and aggression of Stoke's players at times, particularly in set pieces.

He already is good at imposing himself against physical, aggressive players, but Crouch shouldn't really fluster Smalling. Cahill and Terry were comfortable at dealing with him for the whole 90 minutes. Smalling, whilst having dealt with Crouch well, didn't really dominate him.

1611~~~
Yep, basically sums up what I think. It was decent but quite a bit below his own standard.

1612~~~
Smalling had to do it on his own, and making Diouf two, whilst dumb and dumber just did nothing all match, and even then, he had some very good tackles, just before half time, 2 blocks which prevented danger. He didnt hoof the ball like Evans, was calm when he got the ball. Was solid, Crouch is one hard guy to deal with, his height advantage is unreal.

1613~~~
I wouldn't say Smalling was carrying Evans and Jones. Jones was defensively good bar the defensive mistake that led to Stoke's goal, and even though Jones conceded several fouls, he actually had a good match for me. Evans looked unsettled throughout the match, and he made it tougher for Smalling and Jones as a result. Even then, Evans wasn't a liability, defensively; he did struggle against Diouf and Walters at times, but he wasn't horrible.

Overall, Smalling was solid, but he wasn't dominant. When you look at how Terry and Cahill dominated Crouch and Walters, you would expect Smalling to keep Crouch quiet and be comfortable. He did keep Crouch quiet for much of the match, but I never found Smalling to be comfortable. Maybe the injury layoff might have something to do with that, but then again, the conditions were also tough to play in.

1614~~~
How often were Cahill and Terry attacked, and how often were we attacked?

People seem to ignore that.

1615~~~
I watched the first half, and Stoke were quite often playing long balls forward to Crouch with Arnautovic frequently crossing the ball into the box. They attacked against Chelsea the same way they attacked against us. Both of us dealt with their attacks and almost nullified them. The difference, however, was that we didn't look comfortable, defensively, against them whenever they launched the ball in, whilst Chelsea did. When Stoke put up a physical challenge, Chelsea did as well; we, however, didn't really (only Jones and Smalling had a go; the rest wilted and caused us to be put under more pressure, resulting in more discomfort for Smalling and Jones).

I have never said that Smalling performed badly. In fact, I've frequently mentioned that he dealt with Stoke's attacks well. However, he didn't look as comfortable as he did against Chelsea, Stoke at home, Southampton before the injury, etc. That's expected; it's his first start back from injury in tough playing conditions in a team that didn't impose itself upon Stoke City today.

1616~~~
I understand what you said, it's just that I can understand why Smalling didn't look comfortable, as there aren't many of our players who really help. Chelsea has Matic, Ivanović (full back, but great at jumping), while our midfield doesn't really help and we are not able to take the ball from our goal.

Stoke always attacks the same way, but in the second half, till the last 10 minutes, they were just having an attack, after attack, and we didn't do anything and not just high balls, but a lot went through wingers, which makes it harder.

I get what you're saying, I got the same feeling, but just wanna say that I think that we should look for reasons in other positions.

1617~~~
"I don't agree with your opinion so you must not have watched the game" is a response used exclusively by 12 year old fan boys to defend their favourite players. 
The reason we won't challenge for the title this year & the reason we're not going to be one of the top teams in Europe for a while is because we have players like Chris Smalling playing for us.

1618~~~
You do know that we've become champions twice while Smalling was playing at the club?  Probably not as you barely watch United. It's just an bizarre statement again, so City wont challenge for the title because they got Mangala en Demichelis? Didnt Liverpool challenge for the title with those abysmal defenders? We have won numerous titles with bloody Evans, what are you tossing lad?

1619~~~
No, its because we have clowns like Evans

1621~~~
some serious wumming going on in this thread.

1622~~~
I think you've had a few too many margaritas.

1623~~~
So we shouldn't be worried that we have rubbish defenders because Liverpool nearly won the league last year with bad defenders? 
Smalling was a bit-part player when we won the league.

Evans playing poorly doesn't make Smalling any better.

1624~~~
Smalling is the better defender. Its clear as night and day

<a class="username" data-user="66250, @Dr Baltar" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66250/">@Dr Baltar</a> I meant Smalling is better. Just noticed and corrected it

1625~~~
looked very solid and experienced. shows how much confidence he out of the blue gained. I am almost starting to think that he could become top CB as he is maybe the most athletic CB I have ever seen, this guy could play any sport with his body stature, could actually wrestle as he is very strong, absolute top class in the air. We will forgive him his lost aerial challenge with Crouch on the front post which was obviously as difficult as it gets.. underrated with ball at his feet as he is good technically even with not best first touch, good reading of the game, good aggresivity. hopefully he stays fit as I want really to see him becoming the leagues star..

1626~~~
Very good post

1627~~~
Today was a tough assignment marking Crouch and Diouf and he stood up to it well. A few dodgy moments which could have been more costly. In this type of game you need someone who can defend and he can do it all day.  Just as well that he got the nod over McNair, who would not have been a good match up with Crouch and Diouf. The back line needs him as he is the only solid central defender we have.

1628~~~
Are you high?

1629~~~
I think if we pair him with a top shelf CB like godin our back line would improve immeasurably.

1630~~~
Fair enough, Smalling didn't (and doesn't) get as much support as Terry and Cahill do, and it's what makes them look better than they really are.

1631~~~
Of all our defenders (bar Rojo because he's too new), he's definitely the one I'd say is the best defender of the lot and the one I'd trust the most to defend properly. Jones is the one I'd say has the most all round ability but still doesn't show enough intelligence. Evans has regressed into complete mediocrity. 

I'd go with a back 2 of two of Rojo, Smalling and Jones week in week out.

1632~~~
Dr Baltar being the main culprit.

1633~~~
He has played well this season but yesterday he was at fault for the goal, lost Crouch who hit the post and should have given away a penalty. Not a good performance from any of the defenders but the conditions didn't help. We did well to get out with a draw considering how bad the back 3 were.

1634~~~
Actually he did well aside from losing Crouch for the first header and getting away with the handball. Those two things are obviously important and detract from his performance so overall it wasn't quite a good performance, but his defensive work was still the best of our back 3 by a distance. He didn't struggle, he simply made a mistake with Crouch on the set piece and his hand was a bit too high when blocking one shot.

1635~~~
That's ridiculous. McNair is a not very good PL centre-half who happens to be 19.

The 'senior' defenders we love to criticise in Smalling, Jones and Evans were all quite a bit better when they broke through at 19/20 to me. McNair may become a top defender one day, but I can't help think all this praise being lavished on him is setting people up for disppointment if/when he turns out to be average - because he hasn't actually shown that much yet in my view.

The gap between Smalling and McNair is huge. If you would have rather McNair played against Stoke away than Chris Smalling then, you come across as one of those irrational/romantic type fans IMO.

1636~~~
It's a real shame that we couldn't have retained Vidic or Rio. Not saying they'd have played every week but these young CB's lack of experience is being exposed  and this is having a massive impact on their confidence. Smalling can go on to be a very good utd player.

1637~~~
We need to keep him fit. He's our best defender currently. And pair him with either Jones or Rojo. Keep Evans far away from the starting team as possible.

1638~~~
You lot are deluded. He hasn't even started half of our games this year & in the games when he has started or played a significant amount of time our results have been poor.

Other than Evans' mistake yesterday most of Stoke's chances came from his inability to mark Crouch properly once during the whole game.

Crouch had a free-header for the first goal because Smalling followed the wrong player.
Crouch hit the post because Smalling gave away a stupid free-kick & then didn't challenge properly when the free-kick was played in.
Crouch should have had a penalty because Smalling didn't mark him properly & handballed it instead.


....ignore all of that though. Let's all just say Smalling's brilliant because that's the general opinion.

1639~~~
Yep, I think Smalling is good enough to be a starter for a top team as long as he has a good, experienced CB next to him. I don't think he's ready yet to be the leader of a defence, although he is getting better at it.

1640~~~
One thing that needs to be said. Samlling plays at the easiest postion in this 352 formation.

Jones and Evans have it much harder in this formation.

1641~~~
This.

1642~~~
Slightly easier, but it's not like they do so much more. The compensation comes with being the one who is normally leading the line and ensuring the three are in sync.

1643~~~
Or he plays there because he has better reading of the game compared to the others, just saying

1644~~~
My comment was not meant to be a dig at Smalling.

Your comment is irrelevant though.

1645~~~
Owen really seems to dislike Smalling on the commentary <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1646~~~
Not particularly good today but the best of the CB's overall, looked annoyed with himself at times. LvG needs to realize the limitations of our CB's when it comes to bringing the ball out.

1647~~~
I just can't have this guy, these games against lesser opposition seem to expose his limitations even more, yes you can't deny he can tackle, has pace, and can head the ball, but his distribution is shocking for this level, he looks completely lost when he moves up with the ball and tries to play a forward pass, and at best looks awkward and uncomfortable playing his favoured sideways, or backward passes, the only time he looks comfortable kicking the ball is when he's booting it out.

For me Jones is way ahead of him, and the fact he could be considered our 2-3 rd best CB is sad indictment of where we are in this situation just now.

1648~~~
I honestly thought he was the best out of a very, very bad bunch. He defended competently and didn't do much wrong... was also probably the only player on our team to not be constantly bullied.

1649~~~
He did ok. Evans and Jones have also been shaky with their distribution this season. Smalling has actually been the more consistent passer.

1650~~~
You gotta learn not to mind every silly Smalling basher, he takes one lesser match to reclaim something about Smallings distribution, while it has been decent to okay generally.

1651~~~
He pisses all over Jones and all the other jokes we have at the club playing centre half at the main role of a centre back - defending.

1652~~~
He's right though. His passing was atrocious. Even when it reached the target it was almost always hit too hard or just off-target enough to make them break their stride. Can't remember the phrase Owen used. "no pass consideration"?

Whatever, he was spot on. The look of disgust Mata gave Smalling after brilliantly trapping a pass cannoned at his knees from 10 yards away spoke volumes.

1653~~~
Shitty with the ball at his feet sady. Same goes for McNair.
Smalling's at least great defensively though.

1654~~~
Smalling is twice the defender Evans has become.

1655~~~
Indeed

1656~~~
Really? Maybe i've just got some sort of strange issue with him and blank out the good passes he makes, but for me he is a terrible passer, and so damm awkward, and unconvincing with it.

Jones with a run of games will prove he's better, Evans has lost the plot, Rojo i'm unsure about just yet, and it's a harsh to judge Blackett, and Mcnair just yet, so Smalling is probably our second best CB just now I'll concede that, but that doesn't make him a 'United quality' player.

1657~~~
If you're talking about me I've had issues with him many times before.

1658~~~
Don't know your record mate, what O've noticed is that Loublaze has probably had the most Smalling/Evans discussions in the whole Caf, while the most of them are unneccasary, if someone tells you Smalling is slow, or that his distribution has been shit generally this season, he has to know that it's not worth discussing. It's everybody's right to have an own opinion, but people just talking nonsense, should be ignored.

1659~~~
Have to agree to disagree on this one, he is not United quality and when the real deal comes in he will be gone.

1660~~~
Very good at taking the ball off other people. Very bad at giving the ball to other people.

1661~~~
He'd be the last CB to leave.

1662~~~
Owen was spot on about Smalling's passing unfortunately.

He's a very good defender but it's a major weakness to the whole teams ability to control a game when someone with such limited passing is in our spine.

1663~~~
Jones is brainless, and I don't know if you can coach that.

1664~~~
Sounds like Evans, the second part only!

1665~~~
Evans the first, Smalling the second, Rojo the third, and Jones the last (of the established CB's) imho.

1666~~~
Defensively solid as usual. As for his ball distribution, everyone would struggle when there's a lack of movement ahead of you (probably down to 352). When we went to the diamond, Smalling, along with our other players in the back four, all improved on the ball.

1667~~~
Evans has obviously been poor recently but as I've said in the Evans thread, I think it's largely confidence related with him. He played a great cross field ball today, but then the next minute he'll play the worst back pass you've ever seen.

Of course it doesn't help that our center backs are seeing a lot more of the ball than they used to (well, pre-Moyes anyway). Obviously they had fewer opportunities to feck up when the ball was up the other end of the field for the majority of the game.

1668~~~
Naah, Blackett, Evans, McNair were all brilliant on the ball, almost everg pass reached, they didnt hoof it, played some Xavi'esque long balls, werent shaky under positions and dribbled in midfield like Verthongen used to, not down to the system mate. Where since the WC, neither the Dutch nor the United defenders distributed the ball well.

1669~~~
On this season, not a chance. He's been by far the most consistent out of our CBs.

1670~~~
Anyone that reckons Jones defends better than Smalling mustn't have played the game in their life.

The passing discussion is simply nonsense on the basis we've got players posing as central defenders that can't even head the ball or position themselves on the right side of the field.

1671~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

No matter how much Smalling improves on the ball, because people have preconceived views on him, they will always talk about his ball distribution when he misplaces a pass.

1672~~~
It's not just based on this season though tbf., he's always been awful with his distribution, it just hasn't improved.

1673~~~
He's quite evidently a good centre back.

Also there is no facet of inherent defending that Jones trumps Smalling.

1674~~~
I guess we'll agree to disagree then. I think the pure fact that Smalling is a smarter defender than Jones is gives him the edge. Jones is far more rash in his decision making, if you exclude that momentary lapse vs City then Smalling is a good decision maker.

And to deny Smalling is a good CB is, well, very positive thinking of you.

1675~~~
Eh? What's any of that got to do with discussing Chris Smalling's performance in possession?

1676~~~
Nonsense. Jones has been injured a lot of times through his own carelessness. Even Fergie mentioned this before. Smalling is by far our most natural defender. Evans is the most skilled on the ball (midfield past and all in the youth ranks) but he's always got an error in him and hes the most mentally and physically weak, slowest to boot (McNair is just as slow). Jones can be a good CB if he starts using his brain more. How many penalties has Jones given away since last season?

1677~~~
Yes I was wrong to use the word good, he is clearly good in the grand scheme of things, he is just not good enough for United....... but perhaps he can improve yet! there something positive from me,

1678~~~
If he isn't, then surely Rojo and Phil Jones aren't?

1679~~~
The post was more of  a criticism of the larger discussion surrounding our centre half's and their distribution. The importance with which people view it baffles me, particulary when we have problems far greater than that of passing, most noticeably a terrible inability to head the ball when faced with crosses into the box. 

I struggle to care too much about the odd dodgy Smalling pass when I see such glaring issues elsewhere, albeit on an individual basis I do acknowledge it's an area in which Smalling would ideally improve, albeit not something I think would ever hold him, or us, back if he were to remain fit, grow in confidence and play regular football.

In short, I just want to see my defenders defend.

1680~~~
We are absolutely desperate for a top CB with some leadership quality. If we were able to get somebody in the mould of Godin, Ceillini, Thiago silva (not in the slightest saying it would be cheap or easy) it almost wouldnt matter which of Smalling, Rojo or jones we pair them with as they would improve 10 fold like we've seen with cahil from terry. and all our defenders with vidic or ferdinand in previous years.

1681~~~
I think the distribution cliché is pretty hilarious, as every other CB we have shits themselves just a smidge less, if not just the same, as Smalling on the ball.

1682~~~
None of our defenders are comfortable in the 3-5-2 formation, even Shaw and Rafael looked lost at times. It felt like we were playing 5-3-2 at times in the first half, there was no movement, no positioning and no fluency from anywhere on the field to help the defence out.
The defensive players shouldn't be getting the amount of abuse they are getting on here, it's the system that's causing the mistakes and slow, monotonous build up play that has clearly been the instructions from LVG.
Again our forward play was non existent, Falcao and Wilson were isolated from the rest of the team and created very little, Mata had to go searching for the ball and at times looked like he was playing upfront, Herrera got dispossessed countless times putting added pressure on the defence and enough has been said about Fletcher already. Rooney didn't know where he was supposed to be and at times, in truth I forgot he was on the pitch. But yet again we are all slagging off the defence when our 'attackers' caused Yeovil little to no issues (until they got tired)

1683~~~
Yup. This really is an issue that has gone unnoticed a lot. I hope simply having Di Maria in the side will rectify a lot of that.

1684~~~
Defending comes before being a good passer for a centerback. He hoofed alot of balls that never hit their target and i was frustrated with that too, but as said above me, the lack of movement is more of a problem here.

Only injuries are holding Smalling back from being a top defender, that's my opinion though.

1685~~~
I'm of the firm opinion Jones will be if he can just stay injury free, Rojo tbh i've no idea yet.

1686~~~
This "passing doesn't matter, so long as he can defend" stuff is really missing the point. Sloppy passing out of defence created nearly all the situations that needed defending!

Rafael bust his cheekbone heading a corner that came directly from Smalling putting McNair under pressure with a horrible pass back down the right touchline. Good defending by Rafael but I'm sure he'd rather not have had to do it.

1687~~~
Are you just talking about this match or? Because over the season, Smalling has had a higher pass completion than Jones, Evans and Rojo.

1688~~~
I'm not saying passing doesn't matter, but the situation you are talking about is a issue caused more by the fear we have in our defence. He was playing with 2 youngsters in a system that doesn't fit our defenders at all, while also having Fletcher infront of him who lost the ball several times, not really a good cocktail.

1689~~~
But it's not like he's the only one doing this. In fact, people purposely highlight this because unlike our other CB's, he has nothing else to be criticised upon.

1690~~~
Too right

1691~~~
The whole team struggled to pass the ball today, not just Smalling. Perhaps the playing surface didn't help. His passing has generally been fine this season.

1692~~~
The passing from our CBs has been poor, but is only part of the issue. Our midfielders do not show for the ball well enough (Rooney and Mata are the worst for this, Herrera isnt much better) meaning our CBs have very few options for easy passes.

Secondly as has been mentioned, we sacrifice a lot in the team to be able to field the likes of Falcao, RVP, Mata, Rooney and Di Maria - supposedly world class attacking players, yet we have not looked threatening at all in the last few games.

1693~~~
He is indeed brainless, and I think he's past the point where you could coach intelligence, considering he already thinks he's the future captain and constantly tells everyone else what to do. Great physique, I can see why he was in advance of his age group, but now's the time to sell and get what we can for him.

1694~~~
Caught ball watching for the best Yeovil chance of the game but pretty solid as usual in that aspect. We just can't afford to have players at the back who need to be full of confidence to play football. Must improve that side of his game quickly

1695~~~
Slightly harsh I think. As the chance came from a crazy backwards header by Evans and really caught out everyone.

1696~~~
it's the clumsiness in a way how he controls the ball and how he looks like doing so and generally quite poor to average first touch which let him down at times but apart that his passing is all good. If you want to blame defenders for hoofing the ball, blame the system and lack of movement anywhere near the player. Everyone does the hoofing. Even someone like Hummels would be considered poor passer here after some games in this team form..

1697~~~
I thought Smalling was our best CB yesterday, not that the others set the bench mark very high. I don't think any of our defenders are that comfortable playing 3 at the back. When we were, Smalling looked shaky. But once we switched to 4 at the back, he started to look a whole lot more solid and like he knew what he was doing.

Right now I don't think any of our CB are suited to playing 3 at the back. Whether that is down to a lack of football intelligence to adjust to the different style or communication issues due to no real leader amongst them I don't know. But I'd much rather us go to a more traditional 4 at the back and have a defensive midfielder like Carrick dropping back to pick up the ball instead of the current set up.

1698~~~
It flicked off Evans head and Smalling + another had no idea where the striker was. Luckily he was shit or its 1-0.

1699~~~
I agree it was poor defending from Smalling but no one (including the striker) expected how awful that header Evans would have being.

1700~~~
McNair I believe.

1701~~~
Yes it was McNair. Either way theres no way a striker should be getting that space in the box whether it came of Evans or not. You must know where the attacker is AND cover any potential mistakes. It's the kind of pathetic defending we've seen for well over 12 months now.

1702~~~
Indeed.

1703~~~
It's not Evans' fault. He's in a good position a couple of yards from the attacker. Unless (and I very much doubt this) he got a big clear shout from Smalling to leave it, he's not at fault. The other 2 are, they have much longer to react and deal with it.

1704~~~
He dos the job for us and it our best defender.

I think he works best with Rojo as they can cover for each others deficiencies in their games.

1705~~~
I hear a lot about how Rojo and Smalling compliment eachother, but I'm not sure what exactly Rojo brings to the partnership that is such a significant contrast to Smalling.

1706~~~
Rojo imo can step up and itercept more, and he can pass the ball better.

We also did look more stable when they were together.

1707~~~
You cant blame that Yeovil chance on Smalling or any other defender except Evans

1708~~~
If you watch it again Smalling see's that the ball is drifting over Evans' head and gets himself in a perfect position to deal with the ball. Evans' flick on wrong foots him and puts the ball directly into the strikers path. 

I agree that McNair should probably be tighter to the striker in that instance, though.

1709~~~
The midfield is still a mess until thats sorted teams who press us will cause us problems opposition coaches use this as there first line strategy against us.

1710~~~
In a back four. 

Coincidence?

1711~~~
This is being overlooked time and time again, how anyone can say anyone of our centre backs has looked comfortable in a back 3 is beyond me.

1712~~~
Smalling put in the best individual defensive performance of this season in a back 3 - against Arsenal. Though admittedly we probably wouldn't have needed to do that much defending if it wasn't for the stupid formation in the first place. So I do think you have a point, the formation does invite excessive pressure on the center backs - which in turn result in the mistakes.

1713~~~
That's exactly my point. He's only thinking about the ball as he drifts over there. Lack of communication at the very least

1714~~~
I think Smalling and Jones (who are both very athletic, decent defenders) can look quite good in a back three, <span style="text-decoration: underline">when they're not in possession</span>. Loads of last-ditch defending required, which can make them look good. Just like all our other central defenders, though, they look pants on the ball. It's not really their fault. They're seeing far too much of the ball and when you use a system that gives your least skilful players the most time on the ball, chances are they'll lose the ball a lot.

Evans is a slightly more considered defender, who usually relies on clever positioning and anticipation. Of course, that all goes to shite when all of our defenders are being asked to play a formation with which they're clearly not comfortable. Not to mention the fact our line-up changes, game to game, so there's no chance of any kind of partnership or understanding starting to develop. So he's bound to suffer more than most from the dreaded 352 and the constant chopping and changing at the back.

I like Smalling. If we can find him the right partner and play a consistent shape and team selection at the back he could become a really top centre-half. Based on the season so far, though, I won't hold my breath.

1715~~~
Eh? If Evans doesn't try and flick that on Smalling is clearing that all day. 

Yes they could have communicated better but it happened very quickly. It is schoolboy defending by Evans though, you never flick a header backwards like that to your own goal. IMO you are better letting it go for the keeper to collect.

1716~~~
You don't actually think he did that deliberately?

1717~~~
This. Smalling has been our best CB, when fit, this season. Can't see how anyone can debate that. Hoofing is frustrating, but they're ALL guilty of it. End of.

1718~~~
It was more a reaction sure, but they are the types of thing we keep making mistakes in. If you are having to jump and lean backwards to contact a ball it's only ever going back towards your goal. He would have been better to duck and let Smalling or De Gea deal with it. 

It's just painful to watch how our defense are never on the same wavelength. Only Smalling and Rojo seemed to have any idea how to play together.

1719~~~
What? He didn't flick it backwards on purpose obviously. He's just reaching for it as its come to him quickly.

Edit: just seen the post above. That's completely insane. Ducking under the ball?

1720~~~
Or he could have got a shout from a player who was in a perfect position to not only deal with the threat but deal with it comfortably.

1721~~~
I agree if he doesn't get a shout (we don't actually know if he did or not) then he cannot leave it, he doesn't have eyes in the back of his head.

1722~~~
Why is it insane? he had a team mate better positioned behind him and a goalkeeper. Instead he tries to do the most pathetic header in the world and ends up nearly costing us a goal.
How do we know he didn't?.

1723~~~
We don't.Bbut the reaction of Smalling afterwards would suggest he didn't give a shout, obviousley we wont know for sure. At the end of the day it was a defensive error.

1724~~~
Why hasn't the defender behind him called him then? Why hasn't Smalling or McNair picked up the attacker? You don't duck under the ball unless you're 100% sure nothing's behind him. Evans has had a crap season but he's guilty of not being an inch taller in that incident.

1725~~~
Smalling is actually in the correct position there, we just don't know whether he gave Evans the call or not.

1726~~~
I think it's possible to overanalyse an incident... 

Even if Smalling did shout,  the ball was whipped in so quickly Evans would have had milliseconds to make a snap decision. I can't blame him for trying to get a touch on it and I can't blame Smalling for moving into position to cover for Evans not getting a touch. The fact it fell perfectly to the strikers feet was pure luck, as was the way he fluffed his shot.

1727~~~
I think this is fair. Smalling was well positioned for the original ball, the deflection completely wrong footed him. Evans couldnt afford to risk leaving it I think, its just one of those things.

1728~~~
Yep, I guess it's just how our luck has been going.

1729~~~
Correct. The attempts to find something to blame Smalling for in this instance speak volumes about the agendas of those posting.

1730~~~
Yes you may be right but Smalling should be better than this by now, he's been with us ages now. 

Of the other established players we have Rojo needs time to bed in especially as he's barely played, Evans seems to have completely lost the plot and needs to go, and Jones has barely played but  at least has plenty to work with, and is more versatile too.

1731~~~
You keep saying this for Jones but Smalling has shown far more to 'work with', i.e, he can actually defend and not brainlessly charge into challenges. There are many, many, inadequacies that need to be vanquished from Jones' game. I personally see very little potential in the player.

1732~~~
I know maybe i've got some sort of weird crush on the guy but I just think he has the potential to go on to be a great CB, I envisage him paired with a Hummels, or Godin type player and just think all will be well with the world, Smalling on the other hand just infuriates me.

I will admit though there could be something in the fact he hasn't played too much recently, ie if he doesn't play he can't look crap, but seriously I still hark back to his performance at the Bernabeu, and some his usual body before brain challenges (which I will admit is half his problem at times), add into the mix that Fergie thought he could one of our best ever players and i'm still smitten, time, and actual playing may well dim this view..........only time will tell I suppose.

1733~~~
If I remember properly, I think that the ball was falling so that the opponents player would have got there first and Smalling actually wanted to defend that so actually Evans had to try to get the ball and didn't get to it properly, so he made it worse, but I wouldn't blame anyone to much.

I would say that the whole defense made a mistake, but also no one made one (could compare it to my profession - I am a medical doctor and sometimes the diagnosis is wrong, because you have to wait for results of the tests 2-3 days to be ready and in the meantime you have to treat the patient according to the symptoms and "percentages" and sometimes you are just wrong, but you can't really be blamed for it).

Now about the ball playing problem. We do have problems there, but it has a lot to do with the midfield. Look at all other teams who play with lots of passing, the midfield is running the show and they don't, like in our case, 3 of 4 balls play back to the defenders. They usually don't play with 2 strikers because then they loose the numbers, which they need to keep the ball. Look at Pep, he even tried to play with only 3 defenders (the WBs were more wingers and not FBs), or he decided to play midfielders at the back, to have a better control, as it is very hard to find a very good ball playing defender, or plays with a false nine.....

What do we have? 2 strikers, a forward as a midfielder and ACM, di Maria who is very direct, Fellaini who just can't play as a proper CM as he doesn't know how, his movement is really bad, while Blind and Herrera missed a lot of games, Carrick is 33 and can't play to many games, Fletcher just lost it all.... So, we usually have ONE proper midfielder and we play with only 3 midfielders (2 of them aren't really CMs) so instead to increase the numbers to be able to compensate their technical flaws, we actually decrease the number of midfielders and make it even harder.

So how do we expect that our defenders lead the game, especially in this formation.

1734~~~
I've seen people blame this entirely on Smalling in other forums and call me biased for not doing so.

1735~~~
I am surprised that he got only 6% when voting our best player of the game. He was absolutely dominating the game at the back but a little hesitation cost us a goal in the end. I am not sure if it was entirely his fault. He was just there and three players around Tadic or whoever it was were watching him go through the middle and didn't make a tackle. H was chasing him from the back and in the box it is always wise to be cautious well maybe not this time.. my MOTM btw

1736~~~
He is a good defender but for a three man centre back you need the one in the middle to be better passer than he he is. Hopefully this'll be the end of 5-3-2 and this problem disappears.

1737~~~
I thought he defended excellently today. He perhaps could have dealt with the situation leading to the goal more convincingly but he was more or less a one man back line once we made the changes.

1738~~~
His passing was pretty good today, much better than Carrick's.

1739~~~
Agree, been your best defender this season. Really stepped up with Vidic's departure.

1740~~~
He's a proper CB, playing him as a #3 is not a good idea, just let him focus on what he does best and stop asking him to try and start our attacks from defense.

1741~~~
I thought he was our best player and had a very good game. He was solid, initiated attacks and won a lot of duels.

1742~~~
He still fired a really hard pass to Di Maria that he mis-controlled and set Southampton on an attack. Michael Owen says that Smalling has no 'pass appreciation', that was an example of it, leathering in a really hard pass to your teammate in an area of the pitch where you really don't want to lose the ball.

1743~~~
Generally played well but I felt he was most at fault for their goal. Opting to put pressure on the player with the ball, from a weird angle, instead of tracking Pelle once he got up off the floor, was a strange decision, and ultimately one that cost us. If Smalling had been goal-side then Blackett could have moved across but since he wasn't, Blackett had to stay in his position, leaving Pelle free to accept the pass and strike the post, which created chaos as De Gea was getting up off the floor when they scored.

1744~~~
He was great, again... so he'll get injured soon.

1745~~~
But these mistakes were allowed as other players should have stopped the attack (that's the point of 3 man defense, one makes pressure, the other just pick up the ball), as we had more players. I think it was Blackett's fault, as he stayed to narrow.

1746~~~
No doubt about it.

1747~~~
He was very good although his love for tugging shirts is a bit worrying. Another ref would have given a penalty for that today.

1748~~~
I don't know he looked for long parts of the game like a disaster waiting to happen. He is an excellent defender on his day but then again he has these days where he looks so hasty and loses the ball in dangerous situations which force him to make a dangerous tackling. I'm still convinced he's got it in him to be a great defender if he can manage to stay fit for a few seasons but atm there is still too much light and shadow for him to really call him a great defender.

1749~~~
Defended well but was poor on the ball, some heavy touches bringing it out and some poor passes.

1750~~~
Great defensively but poor on the ball as usual. I think he looked a bit better next to Blind though, who can actually pick out a forward pass. With Evans it's more likely to come back along the back 3, increasing the chances of one of them fecking up all the time.

1751~~~
ok game. Defensively he did well. Needs to stop pulling and holding the players every time. His ball to Jones in the second half was as bad as you see. Dont know why some say his distribution was good, he looked nervous every time he ran with the ball or when pressured. Shaky at times.

1752~~~
Every defender in the league does it. I'd look beyond the Sky agenda.

1753~~~
I wish he'd cut the shirt pulling nonsense in the box. There's no need for that, he's as strong and tall as anyone is, let alone Pelle.

1754~~~
His dribbling and passing is so erratic. Sometimes he makes some great powerful runs with the ball, and plays some nice passes. At other times, he looks like when I play FIFA and I hold down sprint for one stride too many and he runs into a crowd of opponents. Perhaps that's an improvement on the past couple of seasons when he looked like he had two left feet and the first touch of a trampoline.

He's still quality though. One of the most underrated players around IMO. I don't think anyone but United fans would give him a 2nd glance.

1755~~~
Reminds me of what Skrtl does, always vulnerable of giving a penalty away. Will happen soon enough if it continues.

1756~~~
Yep and I've hated the tw*t for that.

1757~~~
He is terrible with the ball at his feet which is strange because when he was signed he was portrayed as being a young Rio Ferdinand, classy on the ball and carries it out of the defence with minimal fuss. He's not any of that, his touch is heavy, he always over plays the ball and gives it away or has to make a clumsy tackle to compensate for his error.

1758~~~
I think he's most culpable for the goal.  He had an opportunity to assert himself when they crept into the box, he should've come across and broken up the attack.  What is he doing standing there, looking for offside?  I've backed him for a long time but there are moments like this when I feel he's not cut out to be here.

1759~~~
Dominant as usual today. Defended well and bullied Pelle, at times. Don't know why Van Gaal doesn't trust (if that is the case) him and Jones in a back four.

1760~~~
I still think he's our best central-defender, but the way Sky were highlighting the shirt-pulling makes it inevitable he'll start conceding penalties sooner rather later, certainly after all was said about the Chelsea game. The media will latch onto this hard.

1761~~~
I wouldn't take too much notice of what Owen has to say. He's not going to finish the game with 100% pass completion, its not perfect but its a hell of a lot better than last season.

1762~~~
Really good today. Thought the whole defence played well

1763~~~
He does it nearly every game. Owen mentioned after he did it to Mata in a previous game. Luckily Mata had the ability to control it under pressure but if he hadn't the opposition would have been in like today. I agree with Owen, you can't be a top class centre back doing that every game.

Smalling is a Tottenham level player for me, a Euro Cup player if you like.

1764~~~
The refs are gonna take notice of all those replays of him tearing the shirt of his man's back at every corner. There will be penalties.

1765~~~
They all do it though.

1766~~~
The thing is, he doesnt do it everygame and that's not the criteria of a top class defender.

1767~~~
Are any of them top class defenders?

1768~~~
Ramos, Pepe, Silva etc.

1769~~~
Bollocks will they. Every defender in the premier league has done it for years and nothing ever happens. 

Thought Smallings passing was also very good today. People criticise him for his distribution usually but he looked composed and made great forward passes regularly.

1770~~~
What, they all leather passes to players in dangerous positions?

1771~~~
Have done yeah. Also push, shove, and grab peoples shirts.

1772~~~
Owen's point is that he doesn't weight his passes properly. Owen has played with him too.

1773~~~
He was good today. We didn't lose today due to poor defending. No shots at old Trafford is the problem. .

1774~~~
Smalling's not ideal, but at the moment I rate him higher than Evans or Jones, so maybe he's the wrong target to bash.

1775~~~
His lack of technical ability is laughable at times

1776~~~
Skrtel seems to keep getting away with it. It happens at every corner in every match in every division tbf.

1777~~~
I thought him and Jones were excellent today. Actually the entire back 5 was very good and we looked very solid defensively for the first time in eons against a good side.

Ofcourse Van Gaal had to feck it up by briniging in Blackett and rearranging the defense.

1778~~~
Was solid today, impressive from the big fella.

1779~~~
are you really picking one bad pass? his passing was very good, played a lot of nice balls through the middle and was quite effective in starting our attacks by doing so let alone his surging runs. One over hit pass doesn't change it. Carrick does it also these driven passes and sometimes hits it too hard too but is obviously better as he is ball palying midfielder and one of the best at it. Smalling is top defender doing his defensive work and everything else is a bonus. I think he matched carrick or was even better than him against soton.. 

great and underrated performance for me, he was man of the match

1780~~~
what are you actually on about, you are right with his first touch which is not the best but once he carries the ball out of defense he doesn't lose it today it was a great example. Yes you are right he once had one heavy touch so had to make strong tackle which he won but apart that he was brilliant. This can be easily overlooked but still there will be some people like you who will make it as the biggest mistake in the world and make him look bad. Was MOTM won so many challenges and handled ball well. If you are criticising his one or two mistakes then critisice every player for everything also so I guess you must be all over the forum. I am actually happy and uite confident when he has got the ball. Sometimes he had no choice than going out of defense with the ball at his feat as there is walking carrick who can't play at the top tempo and is not as much available as we wanted. Once we start playing ith back 4 and some players who actually use their legs like Herrera, di María in midfield this will not be needed but it is a bonus when defender does it.

You are completely wrong with what you said

1781~~~
I've not a clue who was at fault for the goal, but thought our entire defense was a shambles after the substitutions. I couldn't tell who played where at all. I reckon our players probably could, but I still suspect the goal might have been a result of post-subs chaos.

Furthermore, it's pretty obvious that we should play four at the back and that Smalling should be the first name on the sheet there.

1782~~~
I agree. He committed himself and missed when Pelle touched the ball on before Pelle fell over, then was holding his arms up trying not to foul while not pressuring Tadic who fed in Pelle who was free after Blackett had to cover the space that Smalling had left behind.

It was just a shambles of a goal to give away.

1783~~~
Dropping Smalling for Evans, for an away match against a physical striker, is just a criminal decision.

1784~~~
Ridiculous isn't it? That is one shocking decision!

1785~~~
He was on the original team sheet though, has he actually been dropped? Or is he injured?

1786~~~
Why's he on the bench?

1787~~~
No idea, but the original team sheet, he was in the lineup.

From bbc:

<b>
Manchester United</b> have recalled Radamel Falcao after leaving him out of the squad for last week's defeat by Southampton. He comes in in place of the injured Robin van Persie while Marcos Rojo is in for Luke Shaw and,<b> in a change to the initial team sheet, Jonny Evans is in for Chris Smalling.</b>

1788~~~
I can only guess that Smalling suddenly felt a bit unwell or a minor niggle and LVG thought he would be better off with Evans in the starting lineup.

1789~~~
I suppose he picked up an injury again. He was fit for a few matches so it's time for him to get injured again...

1790~~~
Did we ever find out why he was dropped on Saturday?

If he wasn't injured then the only explanation I can think of is that LVG blamed him for the Southampton goal and thats why he was dropped (along with Blackett?). Does smack of cutting off your nose to spite your face though, when the player coming in is Johnny Evans.

1791~~~
I'd hazard a guess that he was dropped. Why else would he be on the bench?

1792~~~
Yeah, thats seems the obvious answer. I really hope it was just a one off.

1793~~~
Seems harsh to drop him for a mistake just because it led to a goal when Evans has had numerous mistakes that could easily have led to a goal but somehow didn't. It was Evans that played Sterling through which drew that great save from de Cat.

1794~~~
Evans has given away a chance almost every game he's played. He also did it in the 19th minute against PR

1795~~~
Get a feeling that he's not rated at all by LVG. I have nothing to base that on, as I said, its just a feeling.

1796~~~
Read in some match review that the kit man messed up the team sheet and included Evans instead of Smalling.

1797~~~
Why does the threadmark say QPR 0-0 Man Utd?

1798~~~
The threadmark was made when it was still 0-0.

1799~~~
So it wasn't a case of him picking up a slight knock or feeling unwell or whatever in the warm up? It'd be pretty baffling if he's fallen behind Evans in LVG's pecking order, hopefully it was just a one-off.

1800~~~
Personally, I think Smalling is rated far higher in here than he is outside the Caf. This isn’t a dig by the way, I feel he has played slightly above average this season, which is something when you consider our defensive woes this season.

However, I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest if he was the first player out the door in the summer (<i>No I don’t think he or any of our CB’s should be sold</i>) He doesn’t seem to be suited to a LVG team, I wasn’t surprised at all that he was dropped, my only surprise was we went three at the back again.

1801~~~
above average for crap is still crap. none of the three , joni evans , phil  gurning man  jones , nor mr smalling i presume , should be in the side next year.

they should be at mid table teams which is where united will be if they stay. sell them for funds to buy one good cb.

1802~~~
So, van Gaal says he is injured for tomorrow. I think this is the first time I am glad he is injured, because that probably means van Gaal didn't pick him last week just because he was injured, and not because he thought Evans, Jones or Rojo are better.

1803~~~
Ffs

1804~~~
What?

1805~~~
He'll be sold in the summer, along with Evans. I think LvG might keep Jones around for another year.

1806~~~
Amar is glad Smalling was probably on the bench last week only because of injury, and not because Van Gaal rates the others more than Smalling.
Yeah, starting to think this too tbh. I'd be disappointed as I do think Smalling is really good when fit.

1807~~~
It could be repeated 100 times and I'd still have no idea how he can be glad a player is injured.

1808~~~
So he <i>WAS </i>injured last week?

God this is confusing.

1809~~~
Bad news that.

A back 4 of Rafael, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw has the potential to at least be top 4 standard.

1810~~~
If in doubt, assume all our defenders are injured. That way you'll usually be fairly close to the truth.

1811~~~
Umm.. That makes no sense at all. Why would he have been on the bench last week if he was sufficiently injured at the time to keep him out of our squad a week later?

1812~~~
Increasingly looking that way. I said before the start of the season, to much derision, that Evans Jones and Smalling would all be out the door by next year. In hindsight a tad extreme but I reckon Jones will get a stay of execution for another year purely on the basis that we can't safely ship out 3 centre backs at once.

We are so past the point of no return with the above and Rafael.

1813~~~
Its quite simply. He's not literally happy Smalling's injured. Just that it confirms Evans started ahead of him because of injury and not because Van Gaal rates him higher which is a relief.

1814~~~
It confirms nothing.

1815~~~
Yeah, bad choice of word there. Doesnt confirm anything but Smalling being on the bench was a sign he was fit when he could have been injured even then. That said, as Pogue pointed out, weird that he made the bench then and is out now totally. Or was it a last minute change where the 2 were swapped? I dont even remember with all the shite that goes on with us and injuries.

1816~~~
Smalling was in the initial starting line up. Then it was changed. Sometime earlier in the week a story came out that it was because the kit man fecked up.

1817~~~
If Smalling was originally in the starting 11, and 18 man squad, then if he became injured he was, in effect, 'substituted' before the start of the match.  Evans goes in to the starting 11 and Smalling sits the game out on the bench, but is not actually fit to play.

1818~~~
Indeed, to me everything suggests that LVG has no idea what his best backline is,  having Smalling and Evans out is a burden as it leaves us with no experienced CBs to call on when Jones gets injured,  it's something we need to sort out fast. . 
I feel the only one defender he trusts at this moment in time is Rojo, and its easy to understand why, although he is as capable as any as making a mistake but he is also the only player who has a viable excuse.

1819~~~
So he was injured in the warm-up. Definitely possible for a man of such rugged health.

1820~~~
Do you really believe that?

1821~~~
A trust not shared by many fans.

I hate three at the back as much as the next man but the injury prone bunch of eejits Van Gaal is having to constantly rotate in and out of the team does make me have a bit of sympathy for his safety first approach.

1822~~~
Then why have him on the bench?

1823~~~
Indeed.

1824~~~
If he's in the match-day squad, where else would he sit? Not as though you can get someone else in to take his place.

1825~~~
Classic: Smalling injured himself in warm-ups, and the injured player's replacement (Evans) injured himself in the game.

1826~~~
Cheers. Makes sense now why he was on the bench and completely out now.

I think Rojo and Smalling are definitely the top 2 choices. The 3rd would be Jones but all 3 are barely fit together.

For all the hue and cry about the 3-5-2, I cant see it changing till the summer when we buy another CB.

1827~~~
The kit-man story? Not really. I think he got injured in the warm up.

1828~~~
Are you sure? I've always assumed you could. Thats a complete guess though. 
However there was no mention of him getting injured in the warm up . I think it's a simple case of a player being dropped to the bech.

1829~~~
Sounds about right <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1830~~~
You know I'm not actually 100% sure. I <i>think</i> that you submit a match-day squad in advance and cannot change it on the day. Could be wrong though.

Didn't someone else get injured in a warm-up earlier this season? (no great surprise with the bunch of fairies in our squad!) If I could remember the incident I could check whether they made the bench or not.

1831~~~
Why is Rojo allowed an excuse??? What is his excuse???  I have read some bizaare posts in my short time here but jesus........what are you talking about?

1832~~~
Think there are usually a few back up players there in case of an injury, and then someone gets drafted into the squad?

1833~~~
Surely you can work out what he means?

1834~~~
Lets me see,  first season in a new team,  in a new league in a different country and can't speak English.

1835~~~
team mates, league, location and language has got absolutley nothing to do with passing the ball to the opposition or any other individual mistake.

1836~~~
Of course it does. They're humans, not robots.

1837~~~
ok then...so when if Falcao misses a sitter it because he's playing in a new team, in a new country.
Perhaps Di Maria's god awful corners and free kicks can be attributed to him not speaking english??

What a load of rubbish

1838~~~
And you think my post was bizzare?

1839~~~
I can tell you're going to be a sterling addition to the United forums.

1840~~~
Have you watched much football over the years?

Have you ever noticed that some new signings find life a bit tricky in the first few months in a new league, then improve a lot in second and subsequent seasons?

Have you heard of a left back called Patrice Evra? A central defender called Nemanja Vidic?

Is any of this ringing any bells at all?

1841~~~
Of course, they took 6 months or so to adapt to the pace and physicality of our league.  Thats fine.  I can except that.  To be honest i dont think Rojo has shown had that problem.  He's very physical.  Evans aside pace and strength isnt a problem for us.  The problem is distribution, composure and bringing the ball out of defence.  The only thing i can really complain about with Rojo is i am not overley confident, or to qoute the the post i picked upon "trust" Rojo when he's in possession.  There is no excuse for giving the ball away needlessly.

1842~~~
Yeah, well we're not far off in our opinions then. I'm not convinced by Rojo yet at all. I think it's fair to reserve judgement for now though. Let's not forget Paddy Evra looked absolutely <i>diabolical</i> in his first few months at United. When a player is settling in and adapting his game to a new league, it can fall apart completely.

1843~~~
Take it like this, I would take Smalling suffering minor injury(it's happening all the time anyway) when we have easy run than having manager who thinks Evans, Jones and Rojo deserve to start ahead of him. 



That was my worry too, but I hoped there was some valid explanation(as you said, he was injured in the warm up, right?).



<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1844~~~
I dont disagree. 

Evra looked poor as managers where overloading on him and telling wingers and full backs to get at him.  Equally, teams where hanging up balls to the far post with centre forwards peeling off onto him.

Vidic suffered with the pace and quite ironically with aggression and physicallity.  I remeber Jermaine Defoe of all players basically "ruffing him up" at White Heart Lane.  I havent seen that problem in Rojo and I dont think we will.  The language certainly isnt a problem with him, he's the most vocal player on the field!!

Id compare Rojo very much to Gabby Heinze, he enjoys that aggression and physicallity.  Like Heinze his problem is when he has time and space on the ball.  My original point was giving away possession uneccesarily is not excusable, regardles of where you where born, where you are playing or what language you speak.

Evra and Vidic's settling in period was excusable, their problems was the culture shock of English football.  Thankfully, I dont believe that to be a problem with Rojo.

Personally i would like us to revert to the 4 at the back and pair Carrick with Rojo and have Blind protecting infront.  Its the closest we have to the silk / steel combination that qaulity centre back partnerships have.  Having carrick there will allow Rojo to be aggressive and attack the ball.  It'll also provide him with an easy go to pass!

1845~~~
That makes no sense whatsoever. This site can be strange at times.

Smalling having an injury changes nothing, the manager isn't going to suddenly trust him any more now that he's picked up another injury. If anything it's going to put him further down the pecking order, especially if Jones and Rojo have a good game in his absence.

For those that think Smalling is going to survive here, getting injured (again) is the worst thing that could happen.

1846~~~
It seems like you are the only one who doesn't get what I was trying to say since few other people too tried to explain my post, so the only one who is strange is you.

I am talking about last game, I like it more that he wasn't picked because he was injured rather than dropped for no reason for other three.

1847~~~
What you’re trying to say is that you’re glad Smalling is currently injured as it somehow confirms in your eyes that LVG rates him higher than the rest of our defenders.

You have no idea if he was dropped or injured, why would he named on the bench if he was injured? Why didn’t he come on for Evans when he came off injured? Why was there no mention of him getting injured in the warm up? Why was there no mention of it on MUTV or during todays press conferance? It’s much more likely that he was dropped. Saying that, unless we hear from within the Club why he was on the bench then we can only guess.

1848~~~
Please tell me you are just kidding me. It's not even hard to understand, everybody got it from the first post,.

1849~~~
I give up.

1850~~~
Admittedly a game to look good in given the level of opposition but he did exactly that. Looked comfortable, stepped up well, played the ball positively out of the back line and generally put in a good shift tonight.

1851~~~
I think his tendency to switch off will cost us more points in the future. I really don't think he's a United quality CB.

1852~~~
Yeah, he let a Cambridge player get in when he was ball watching tonight. At one point he followed the ball out to left back when Rojo was already dealing with it and a Cambridge player was in space where he should have been. Then he had that awful pass straight to the opposition.

1853~~~
Our best centre back imo

1854~~~
Would you be unhappy to see any of them replaced?

1855~~~
Easily our best CB. The only one we have who takes charge and deals with the problem instead of fannying about. His passing ability is coming back but he needs someone next to him who can play the ball because currently, he's the one tasked with it.

1856~~~
That pass near the end is the kind of shit our cb's need to cut out. Its just sloppy and stupid.

1857~~~
Thought he looked good, though it was only Cambridge. He and Rojo are by far our best CB partnership at the moment.

1858~~~
Jones and Evans can be replaced but Rojo and Smalling are worth a run imo

1859~~~
I love his little jaunts out of defence where he forgets he's Chris Smalling and thinks he's Lionel Messi - only to realise he's not Lionel Messi and is, in fact, Chris Smalling - promptly shit himself, pass/get rid/lose the ball ASAP and leg it back to defence in the hope that no one will notice...

1860~~~
it was sloppy and stupid, I think it was a lack of concentration, we lead 3:0 home so I guess it was nothing serious. Rooney made terrible mistake also as well as Blind in the opening minutes.. He is our best center back, absolutely dominating there

1861~~~
so is not Rooney and Blind who made the same costly mistakes. He will be fine, better than Jones and Evans together

1862~~~
He is better at distributing the ball than Jones. He's better than Jones in every way actually.

1863~~~
Jones does that far more frequently.

1864~~~
I'm starting to think this too. Smalling gets a lot of flack for his own ball prowess, and his lapses - but really, is Jones any better in either regard?

Plus Smalling has the pace, height, and isn't quite as much of a reckless fanny... now, if only he could take a corner.

1865~~~
But there's something charming when Smalling does it. When Jones does it I'm just worried about the safety of everyone on the pitch.

1866~~~
Pair him up with Rojo and we have our starting CB partnership for the rest of the season. I hope we don't get rid of him.

Btw, he almost had a successful through ball to Di Maria(?) in the first half that was lovely. I think he's getting more confident for each passing game he plays.

1867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Jones sorts of hovers around a little longer. It's a sort of, 'so... do I get involved in the attack now?'

1868~~~
He's better than Jones, simple as. Smalling--Rojo for the rest of the season please..

1869~~~
I agree just need Smalling to stay injury free.

1870~~~
Both are prone to brainfarts, but somehow Smalling is having far less. I still think both are very good backup players, so is Evans. We need at least one CB (ideally two) who are better than them to strongly challenge for the title and Europe at the same time. We are not consistently solid enough with Smalling/Jones/Evans in the side.

1871~~~
Same thing as Jones against Leicester, solid for the bulk of the match and then loses concentration, does something sloppy and the opposition get a chance, we were 3 up in both matches so it wasn't costly, but it's still an issue.

1872~~~
Promising to see him try a clever long through ball to Di Maria around a CB. Didn't come off, but I didn't think he had that in him, creatively.

1873~~~
Far too clumsy in my opinion. Was always hopeful that Smalling and Jones would step up to be our next great centre-back pairing, but it hasn't happened. At ages 25 and 22, respectively, they can't be ruled out completely, but I don't think they've done enough to convince anyone they are United quality.

Too many errors, too many injuries, poor distribution from the back, poor communication at times, and for big centre backs, nowhere near enough goals either.

1874~~~
Jones has a permanent ridiculous look on his face. It doesn't help to breed confidence.

1875~~~
I think Jones will surprise a lot of people. He's much younger and still has a lot of rough edges but has a good chance of developing into a class centre-half. Smalling is slightly more assured right now but still a good bit short of the level required. He also has less time on his side in terms of potential for improvement but will hopefully get there too.

Obviously, for either of the above to happen the pair of them will need limbs that are not made of of balsa wood and crepe paper. Which is the really big worry here. Far more than the occasional brainfart.

1876~~~
thought he did well from november onwards, until his recent injuries of course. a bit surprise he was on the bench over the last few weeks with jones getting the nod.

kind of agree it should be smalling-rojo at the moment. not saying jones has been bad, but smalling is probably one of our better performer whenever he is fit.

about the occasional brainfart, every single of our centre back is prone to that. the difference is evans probably does it more often than others.

1877~~~
I thought he was our worst defender yesterday. Sloppy at times and gave the ball away far to many times. I reckon he will be gone in the summer.

1878~~~
The bold part is just ridiculous, which isn't surprise considering you obviously hate Smalling. 

He was our third best passer yesterday only behind Evans and Mata(actually on par with Mata). He misplaced just three passes out of 62, and only one was bad, other two were actually very creative from him, something which he was actually excellent yesterday, much better than his partner Evans who was happy to play it safe all the time. Apart from that mistake(which he corrected btw just few seconds after with help of Blind), his passing was spot on yesterday, he played some diagonal creative passes, and one or two through balls too, I think he even created one chance carrying the ball  out of defence.

If you hate him at least watch the game and blame him for the Cambridge's first chance of the game when they hit the post(which wasn't just his mistake btw, but he was off anyway, so he could have prevented it).

1879~~~
I stopped reading after the "you obviously hate Smalling"  bit.

1880~~~
None of them are a patch on Pally. He was fantastic at it.

1881~~~
Of course you did, you are just the worst, I have no idea why I am even responding to you, same thing happened last time we were discussing Smalling.

1882~~~
What same thing? 
Just because I  have a differing opinion to you I am "just the worst"?   Smalling seems to be highly rated on the Caf,  outside of it, not so much.  It was only last season that many on here wanted rid of him,  now he seems to be the saviour,  one even said he had a better 18 months than Hummels FFS
He's a good defender, who gets injured alot,  he's been dropped for the last two Premiership games and for me I don't think he is in LVGs short term let alone long term plans. 
People see what they want to see,  thats very evident in the  case of Smalling.

1883~~~
No, because that wasn't an opinion, it was just your average lazy post on Smalling's distribution which isn't true for yesterday's game because his distribution was very good. As I proved with facts, he was far from bad with the ball, and didn't lose the ball too much as you said he did. But go on, keep talking about Smalling's future and whatnot, as long as you keep ignoring the things you said.

1884~~~
Not much I disagree with here. However, that's a massive tangent to the original point. You said Smalling was sloppy in posession yesterday, Amar showed you a stat to say he had the joint second best completion in the game, which points to your observation being wrong. 

Totally take on board stats don't show everything (a pass blasted at someone's face would be sucessful for example) but at least argue the point instead of making it about something else.

1885~~~
Not his biggest fan but thought he did fine last night.  He didn't really have a lot to do defensively, but when he was given the ball he pushed it forward and looked for a useful pass, which I think made the game much less frustrating to watch than the last Cambridge encounter.

1886~~~
Facts  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
His passing may have got to the intended target on most occasions but he has a terrible habbit of over or under hitting the ball, unfortunatley (or fortunatley in Smallings case) stats dno't show that.
As I said he was our worst defensive player,  and he was.  McNair,  Rojo and Evans all played better than him.

1887~~~
Yeah this always makes me laugh.  It is clearly something that is being worked on though.  Fair play to him for trying to implement it on the field though.

Its good to see our players being coached to improve.  Its been missing for a while now, since Quiroz leaving perhaps.  I havent seen individual improvement (De Gea aside) since Ronaldo.

Smalling is behind anyway in this type of development not ocming through a professional club background.  Then knocked further back with injury and Fergie / Moyes playing him right back.

I like Smalling and I think LVG likes Smalling.  I still hold out hope that LVG can make Smalling into the player we need.

1888~~~
Thought he was excellent last night.

A few brain farts but it was his first start since returning from injury iirc.

1889~~~
Very good performance, should start ahead of Jones, imo.

1890~~~
Agree. I think he has more composure than Jones. I think he is better when he has Rojo next to him.

1891~~~
Only just watched the match and thought he was good. Obviously had the one error but he should be ahead of Jones atm. Smaling/Rojo is still my best CB pairing.

1892~~~
It's amazing how this sort of statement would be worded differently by many others if it was Jones.

1893~~~
Yep.  Smalling was our worst defensive player on Tuesday night.  He wasnt bad but he wasn't great either.  As I said previously,  he seems to be rated far higher on the caf than outside of it.

1894~~~
Jones does seem to get shorter shrift, for some reason. His error against Leicester was under far more pressure than Smalling's colossal boo boo against Cambridge but seems to have rewritten his whole performance as being poor on redcafe, when he was actually fairly solid. In contrast, Smalling's error is being glossed over as one of those things.

1895~~~
I will add some balance. Don't like Smalling. Not good enough.

1896~~~
Although I agree that he's our best defender, its stupid mistakes like that, that's going to hold him back (alongside the injuries obviously).

Him and Jones need to cut this sort of nonsense out.

1897~~~
From James Wilson interview:

1898~~~
I always thought that Smalling is one of our fastest players, but I'm more surprised that ADM is not on it (he at least is one of the fastest with the ball though) and even more surprised that Shaw is mentioned

1899~~~
I remember earlier in this thread a few months ago arguing with someone about Smalling, who claimed he was one of the slowest players in the squad. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1900~~~
Here it is, back on page 5. Ah memories.

1901~~~
Pretty unpopular opinion, but to each their own. 

Do you rate our other CBs over him or do you think they're all useless?

I think Smalling is comfortably the most well-rounded CB we have and is easily the most consistent. Can't say the same about Jones or Evans this season. Though McNair has been pretty solid in the games he's played, I think.

1902~~~
Smalling's overall athleticism is brilliant, in my opinion.

It's one of the reasons he's playing at such a high level considering he had next to no youth development in contrast to his peers.

1903~~~
Wouldn't surprise me. When Rojo made that mistake against Chelsea, Smalling tracked back on Willian incredibly quickly.

1904~~~
He's a bit of a freak really. Someone of his size really doesn't have any right to have his acceleration/speed.

1905~~~
Personally I think more people rate Jones, he's the no nonsense, hard tackling defender and that style is generally appreciated by all. Only recently have people began to rate Smalling more on here.

They're both excellent defenders and I hope we don't sell either, but I think Smalling's reading of the game is better, and his physicality is very impressive also.

1906~~~
Not particularly. When I watch him he never inspires me with much confidence. Although most of our defenders make me feel like a mistake can happy at any instant I often see Smalling inviting unnecessary pressure on himself (through his own play) and also bring pressure onto the team (liable to giving away cheap freekicks as he often will put his hands into the back of an opponent or by grabbing their shirt).

1907~~~
Oh yes, he's a fantastic athlete. I still have very high hopes for him.

1908~~~
That was me. 

You can only judge what you see, over the last 18 months i have seen chris smalling put in better performances at centre half than i have Matts Hummels.

I stand by that statement.  Everytime i have seen Hummels he's been average at best.  Smalling has had some average games, some poor games.  But he's also had some very good games and that combined with his height, pace and age give me hope that LVG can develop him and allow him to fullfill his potential.

If your the Hummels expert........tell me half a dozen games in the last 18 months where Hummels has looked good?  I'll watch em

1909~~~
The world cup ??

1910~~~
our lass could have played centre half for germany and they'd have won it.  He never had a good game at the world cup.  When asked to defend he was ran ragged.

1911~~~
On the contrary though, Jones has been hyped a lot more than Smalling, so I think if you don't rate Jones, it's very easy to disregard anything good he's doing in the game and focus on the one mistake he may have made. I think even if someone doesn't rate Smalling, their opinions towards him are less extreme, and are probably more welcoming to any encouraging signs in his performance.

Anyway, I think it's a common misconception that Jones reads the game poorly. There's a method to his madness, and he wins an extraordinary amount of balls by getting tight to his man and intercepting. His "the balls is going to go there" is fine. It's more his decision making; "am I going to get to the ball in time" that is the issue. Due to his eagerness, the answer to this question in Phil Jones' mind is yes the vast majority of the time which is why he gets caught out occasionally, but it's the trait of a 22 year old centre half.

He's also extremely good at covering his centre back partner and sweeping up, and his positioning in our own box is exceptional. The one weakness I see with Jones is his awareness of runs in behind when the opposition attacks down our right hand side. He struggles to pick up runners that make diagonal runs in behind his left shoulder, and he needs to learn to drop and receiver the striker, rather than relying on his CB partner to cover everything behind him.

In regards to Smalling, I've been happy with his contributions since the City game. I think he had a poor year for most of the last calendar year, partly down to injuries and the pressure of being picked for the World Cup, but he's been putting in encouraging performances ever since the Arsenal game.

1912~~~
Smalling was largely good under Moyes. In fact he's had a very decent 17 or so months barring injury problems.

1913~~~
So Hummels in a good system can work out ? He played very well in the World Cup. He was great in the quarter final and the final.

Hummels in a better team than Dortmund will be fantastic again.  

By the same logic, put Smalling in the current Dortmund defense and I'm willing to bet he is not going to play well.

1914~~~
We will have to agree to disagree on that.

The other thing about Hummels which is a major worry for me, Jonny Evans is more robust!!!  Hummels is your stereotypical glass back.

The type of centre half we need is a John Terry type defender.  Organiser, brave, experianced and will throw himself infront of a bus.  Hummels appears like he's frightened to mess his hair up never mind get his shorts dirty.

In summary.  I am not impressed / convinced hummels would improve our team

1915~~~
I can see where you are coming from, even if we don't agree. 

Out of curiosity, what do you think of Jones ? I think he suits the Terry role you talk about, apart from the experience part obviously.

1916~~~
I think there was no reason to drop Smalling after his recent outstanding performances. Van Gaal once confirmed he had a knock so hopefully it's the case because for me he would start any day ahead of any of our center backs, just make Smalling and Rojo the main center back pair and rotate Jones with Rojo or here and there Smalling. His pace is amazing still remember how he deleted Willian trying to break on goal on the halfway line. Chris the rocket came and end of chance for Chelsea and Willian. That was so good..

1917~~~
Did the same to Welbeck as well against Arsenal. 

He's actually one of the few defenders I enjoy watching defend because of how good he is in those situations. Iirc he's only ever given away penalty so far in his utd career which was in his first season and one sending off, which was extremely uncharacteristic. Plus the fact that he is such a clean tackler when he commits, makes him a favourite against most players in those situations.

1918~~~
You missed out a very important few words, "in your opinion". As who was the best of the defenders is subjective. As you appear to have stated this as a fact. 
For me Smalling had a good game, as he usually does. He's very consistant & gets overly criticised on here.

1919~~~
Isn't that what discussing players form is? It's all about opinions, I thought that was pretty obvious.

1920~~~
Yup. He has been our best CB for a while now. At RB it was torture, though.

1921~~~
Where have I said I'm an expert on Hummels?

1922~~~
You didn't say "in my opinion" <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/><img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1923~~~
I only speak in fact.

1924~~~
Seems everybody's opinions in here are facts.

1925~~~
Great game for Smalling the other day. Dominant in the air, as usual, and his distribution on the ball was very good too. I guess it's him and Jones competing for the RCB role, while Rojo and Evans compete for LCB.

1926~~~
That's Rojo's position to lose, in my opinion. Evans has been so underwhelming this season.

1927~~~
Bit of a one sided battle that tbh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1928~~~
Maybe you missed my point, as I'm missing yours.
And no it's not all about opinions, as facts should always have a part in any discussion.

1929~~~
When discussing someone's form it's all about opinions, facts don't come into it as a players form and ability is simply to hard to prove as fact. For example, stats can be used to back up your opinion but stats don't paint the entire picture, they can be misleading and give a false impression on a players form.
If a forward has a really poor game but scores a last minute winner the opinion on him will change massively, likewise if a defender is having a fantastic game but makes an error that results in a conceded goal, he will go from fantastic to shit in a matter of seconds.
For me, Rojo is our best defender, for others Smalling, who I think is overrated on here, again, that's down to my opinion.
By the way I think Smalling is a good defender but I reckon he's not in LVG plans.

1930~~~
Why not? He's been very good this season outside of injuries and that City game. He's been much better than Evans who looks more in danger of leaving this club before any other CB

1931~~~
I don't know to be honest, it's just a feeling I have, nothing more.
He has been better than Evans I agree, but not as good as Jones or Rojo. Smalling was dropped (he wasn't injured) for the last couple of games, considering the importance of those games can't be a good sign. As I said it's nothing more than a feeling, in truth,  with the exception of Rojo I don't think any of our CBs are safe.

1932~~~
I don't think any of them are 100% save for Rojo simply because he's LVG's signing. If Rojo was as bad as Evans he'd still be assured of at least one more season. I wouldn't look much into Smalling being dropped for Jones. Smalling was doing well until he got injured. Jones came in and did a good job and LVG had no reason to drop him for a player working his way back to fitness. Now that Smalling is fully fit LVG will have a selection headache because Smalling and Rojo are clearly United's best pairing in a back four, they were immense during the balk of our winning run.

1933~~~
Haha. I expect Evans to be replaced by an LCB next season; preferably Hummels.

1934~~~
Not sure this is right. He must have had a knock against QPR when he was swapped for Evans after the warm up. Evans himself got injured that game and we moved to a back 4. Jones and Rojo kept their place in the games that followed when we continued with a 4.

1935~~~
I've heard this from posters several times now, but where has this theory that he was injured in the warm up come from? There was no mention of it from LVG before or after the match or from any media outlet from what I can tell. Further, if he was injured why would he be on the bench?
If I've missed something then I apologise.

1936~~~
Because he was in the submitted starting lineup and then wasnt its a fair assumption that he picked up a niggle in the warmup.

1937~~~
That doesn't answer the question as to why he was on the bench. If your injured your injured.
Edit: it's much more likely that the wrong information was given out in the first instance in regards to the starting 11

1938~~~
Probably a minor niggle that they didn't wanna risk unless in the case of emergency

1939~~~
Does that sound like something LVG would do? We had McNair on the bench and Carrick and Blind starting which is more than enough cover. He was dropped, it's that simple IMO.

1940~~~
Does it sound more plausible that someone as meticulous as Van Gaal after preparing his side all week for a game and deciding on his starting 11 would have a last minute change of heart after his team has been named and decide that he wants to play the struggling Evans instead of Chris Smalling despite Smalling being 100% fit.

1941~~~
He got injured in QPR warmup, was not ready for Cambridge and then Jones continued to play against Leicester because he was doing alright.

1942~~~
At a Q&A for manutd.com both Young and Wilson said Shaw and Smalling were the fastest players at the club. Wilson and Young also got a mention, from both. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1943~~~
Heck I remembered the papers and fans writing off Jaap Stam in his 1st half season at Man Utd, saying that he's a flop for the then transfer-record sum of money that Man Utd paid for him.

1944~~~
ok maybe you havent but you rediculed my statement that smalling has put in better performances in the last 18 months.  If you think that is totally incorrect you most have seen Hummels play really well quite often???  Or are you just basing your opinion of Hummels being better on the fact the media say we want him for £35m and in thruth you have never seen him play for dortmund in the last 18 months?

1945~~~
Hummels won the World Cup in what is a fantastic German team, on the other hand Smalling can't get into a shit England team that walked away from the World Cup bottom of the group with 1 point.


Yes his standards have slipped this season but that's to be expect given his injuries and the shit form of his team. A quick google brings up that last season when he played in the team they averaged 2.4 points per game and 1.4 when he didn't. They also conceded a goal every 95 minutes with him in the team and 65 when he wasn't.

Put it this way, if Hummels was to go on general sale the majority of big Clubs would be interested and he would have anywhere between £30-40 million price tag, Chris Smalling on the other hand, at best £10-15 million. Or ask any football fan anywhere who they would rather have in their team and I’m certain the result would be a landslide in favour of Hummels. You really have red tinted glasses on if you think Smalling has had a better 18 months than Hummels.

1946~~~
You say he’s meticulous yet claim he would put an injured player on the bench?

1947~~~
It was an away game, he'd bought a set number of players in our match-day squad. Where else would Smalling sit other than on the bench?

1948~~~
You don’t think he would bring additional players in case a player(s) got injured pre match?

1949~~~
Team success means nothing on personal performances.  United have have won league titles with players putting in poor performances.

I honestly couldnt care less about stats......you can find stats that show most players to be world beaters and then another set of stats show them to be non league players.

Also this general sale nonsense......again, who cares.  We would never have got £10m had Michael Carrick gone on general sale, he couldnt get in the england side for Gareth Barry.  However, over the last 7 years there arent many, if any of the same type of player that Carrick is that i would rather have.  If you said to the majority "who would you rather have Michael Carrick or Johnny Foreigner" then the majority on here would prefer carrick replaced by J. Foreigner for £40m.  Even though he isnt a better footballer, they have barley seen him play but just because he has a better sounding name and the media, football manager etc says he's brilliant.

We will have to agree to disagree on this as once again i will reaffirm that i have seen Chris Smalling but in considerably better performances than Matts Hummels in the last 18 months.  Of course my viewing of hummels has been limited but everytime ive seen him he looks slow, clumbersome and an average at best defender - i think Owen Hargreaves said similar recently and he probs see's more german football than me.

Also....smalling isnt allowed the excuse of injuries and shit form of the team so nor should Hummels.  In fact you kind of rubbish your own argument with that statement.........he won the world cup in an excellant germany team but he hasnt been good when dortmund have been rubbish!  Makes him sound a passenger.......we have plenty of them....we need a leader

1950~~~
I don't think so, no.

1951~~~
Team success means nothing? Come on FFS, each players contributes to the team’s success, the fact that Hummels can get into the best international team in the World should tell you all you need to know. Smalling can’t even get into the England side on a permanent basis.

I agree with you about stats, they can be misleading and very rarely tell the full story on a player’s performance or ability, but the difference between points scored and goals conceded when Hummels plays can’t be ignored.

You seem to be dismissing everything as nonsense, you don’t think a player’s value should be considered when discussing each players worth to the team? How exactly? How else do you value a players worth other than his performances on the pitch?

1952~~~
Well thats some shit management right there.

1953~~~
Not really, no. I mean, where do you draw the line? Bring down a match-day squad, plus one spare player for each of them in case one of them gets a niggle walking off the bus?

The way I understand it works would be that you bring a squad of fully fit players. On the very rare occasion one of them breaks down in the warm-up, you'll have enough depth in that squad to cope.

1954~~~
Of course not, but it would be a sensible thing to do to have two or three players on standby. Say our front two was Rooney and RVP with Falcao on the bench, any manager worth his salt would have another forward on standby (in case RVP, Rooney or Falcao got injured pre match) Same can be said for the back four, or midfield. I’d be very surprised if this wasn’t the case, especially when you take into account our injury record.

1955~~~
Aren't the 18 players already submitted, at the time of the warm up ?

1956~~~
I think you can alter it in case of an injury.

1957~~~
Have you been watching The Good Wife?

1958~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1959~~~
I've heard of players being put on the bench plenty of times for away games having not been in the 18. From the little I know we bring a squad of 18 with a player or two on standy?

1960~~~
So I checked:
Now, you need to have the right player.

1961~~~
Ahead of who?  Per Mertasacker?  Arbeloa plays for the best club side in Europe does that make him a fantastic right back?

The fact Hummels plays for Germany but Smalling does not play for England doesnt mean a thing.  Its like saying Stoke beat city, we beat stoke and so we are better than city.

I dont know how many times i need to say this but if he has been so good please just give me a couple of examples of when he has excelled and put in a top qaulity defensive display?  I'll admitt i dont see much of him.  I watched in the Wrold Cup....never once did i think "wow - he's fantastic".  I have seen him a few times over the last few seasons in the champions league against City, Arsenal, Madrid and Munich..........each time i thought he was quite poor.

I agree with you that head to head....one or the other....most people would pick Hummels over Smalling.  100% agree.  But it wouldnt be based on anything other than hype.  If we are all honest, nobody has seen much of him.

I remember watching him in the Euro's 2.5 years ago and thought he looked fantastic.  He had a couple of really good games and looked quick.  When i see him now though he always looks heavy and awkward. 

I dismissed some of your points as nonsense as they dont back up your arguement.  Im talking about personal performances and your talking about collective achievments.

1962~~~
There's no point discussing this further.

1963~~~
There isnt because its quite clear you cant give me one example of a top qaulity hummels performance in the last 18 months.

You have even been on google looking for back up and you still cant find any.

Hummels form over the last 18 months (when he's not injured that is) has been average at best.

1964~~~
Are you for real <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1965~~~
I'll ask again....give me a couple of examples of qaulity performances.

All i hear with Hummels is the press talking about him.  I dont believe United have ever been to watch him?  I think it was actually Van Gaal that let him go from Bayern.

He's the captain and "dominant" centre back of the team rock bottom of the German league.  Have you seen some of the complete and utter sh1te in that league?  He clearly cant be playing all that well can he?

1966~~~
Now I just think you're trolling, did you watch the World Cup? Chris Smalling better than Hummels, I can’t even begin to imagine how red your tinted glasses are.

1967~~~
He hasn't been at his best recently, but he is certainly better than Smalling, we shouldn't even be questioning that.

 Any Dortmund fans out there who can enlighten us on his recent form?

1968~~~
Every single Germany game yes.  He was average.  He got turned and ran into the channels quite often and really struggled for pace in those situations. 

I remember it was even highlighted by BBC how teams where looking to isolate him.  Lavenzzi in the final certainly did.

Did you watch the world cup?  If so in which of Germany's games did hummels defend really well?

You have offered up a rubbish example because they hardly had to defend the entire tournement. 

I also remember him crucning David Luiz in a great 50/50 against Brazil.  Thats about it.

Germany where comfortably the best team in the tournement and dominated possession everygame, he / they where never tested

1969~~~
Why shouldnt we??? We are talking about splurging £40million on a player who alot of pundits etc are unsure about and who is centre half of the worst team in germany and who isnt playing all that well. 

I would expect a £40m sining to be comfortably better than chris smalling if like getsme says smalling is valued at around £12m.

Its perfectly reasonable to expect him to be better

1970~~~
Your basing his last 18 months form on the reputation he built for his form 3 season ago.

1971~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93416, @jojose" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93416/">@jojose</a> i think you are exaggerating a bit. Hummels is better than Smalling, he played 2-3 years on a level Smalling dreams of. Just because he had a bad year, doesnt mean suddenly that Smalling is better. He surely had some good games last year too, watch some CL games of Dortmund and you will find some good performances i am sure.

1972~~~
i didnt say Smalling was a better player.  I said he's put in better performances over the last 18 months.

You seem to agree with my view of Hummels....he had a couple of very good seasons 2-3 years ago.  Over the last 18 months he hasnt been all that.  You have agreed with exactly what i have said.

1973~~~
You Sir, are a wind up merchant, not a very good one I might add.

From what I can remember he got into the team of the tournament at the World Cup, most pundits (<i>in the UK anyway</i>) had him in the team of the tournament. He played all the games in the World Cup and I think they kept clean sheets in more than half the games, his best game was against France in which he was outstanding (<i>I think he scored the winner as well</i>) He wasn’t great in the Final, it was probably his worst game, therefore he must be shit (<i>am I doing this right</i>)

1974~~~
yup just for the fact that i rate Hummels higher. I would buy him for 30m or whatever it is. I am not a big fan of Smalling, even though he had some good performances. I would take Hummels in a heartbeat, especially because we need a ball playing defender for van Gaals philosophy. But to say Smalling is better becuse he had better 18 months? is just wrong. We ended up 7th place last year, Smalling surely wasnt outstanding.

1975~~~
Falcao has perfomed at a level 99% of strikers in world football can only dream of....he plays for Manchester United....doesnt mean his form in the last year has been bteer than.....???? Herry Kane for example

1976~~~
Didnt say that......said he's put in
Fair enough.......we'll agree to disagree.

I havent seen Hummels put in a qaulity defensive performance for a good while.

I think he's slow and not a great defender.

I'll say now that if he comes to the premier league - he'l struggle massivley.

1977~~~
Dortmund are bottom.....of a league very thin on qaulity.

1978~~~
No. But Smalling didnt perform on the level of Harry Kane. I dont know how this discussion came up, but it is not Hummels or Smalling. They can both play together. Hummels has all the time and ability to be world class again, Falcao had a bad injury. 

I just dont trust Smalling to be consistently good enough over a season or more. 

Getsme is right, he had a great game against France. You just have 2 arguments, he is slow and you havent seen a good game of him in the last 18 months. But our scouts have, otherwise we wouldnt be in for him. Hummels is slow, but Vidic wasnt fast either. It is nothing new that he isnt fast, we know that already. Van Gaal still wants him. Didnt you want someone like Terry, obviously for other qualities, but he is slow too.

1979~~~
thats the sort of argumentation you use.

1980~~~
Again??? are you again agreeing with me in saying that Hummels has perhaps gone back over???

I think thats a fairly good argument.  Its also 100% factual.

Our scouts having watched him and been impressed, us been in for him and Van Gaal wanted him.......i dont think any of that is factual is it?

Vidic wasnt fast but a vidic and a terry would through themselves infront of a bus.  They are old school defenders.  Hummels is nothing like those too.  Hummels is the silk to a vidic/terry's steel.

Unfortunatley for hummels i think he's lost a fair bit of pace, 2-3 years ago whilst he maybe wasnt lightening he was quick enough.  He now looks very slow.  Maybe injury maybe down to bulk.

Your right i do think we need a Terry type player.  In the way he leads and organises.  I dont see Hummels as a leader or an organiser.

1981~~~
I can't believe im a having a discussion about Chris Smalling being better than Mats Hummels. RAWK better look out.

1982~~~
I'll say it one last time!!!!

I have seen Chris Smalling put in better performances in the last 18 months than Matts Hummels.  I dont think Matts Hummels has been great for a season or two.  He's done nothing recently to convince me that he would improve us.

If you want to evaluate him on his form 3 seasons ago and that he plays for Germany thats fair enough.  We can only judge what we see.

Unfortunatley....alot of people on here dont see......and judge on FM ratings.

May i ask how many times you have seen him for Dortmund this season?  or even 2014 calender year?

1983~~~
It's a line from the show.

1984~~~
You’ve already said you haven’t seen him play much over the last few years yet claim he is shit, that he was shit at the World Cup (even though he got into the team of the tournament) admit that the large majority of fans would pick Hummels over Smalling (but they’re all brainwashed right, in fact everybody is but you) I gave you stats which proved that the team conceded less goals and gained more points when he played which you brushed off. You're a troll, and a pretty obvious one

I’ve seen them play 9 or 10 times in the league and each Champions league game

1985~~~
Ah ok. Na, I was just taking the piss out of <a class="username" data-user="56337, @Red_toad" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56337/">@Red_toad</a> a wee bit.

1986~~~
I don't think that playing or not playing for England should mean anything.

Carrick couldn't get into the team, while he was the most consistent player in the most successful team in England and SAF couldn't imagine playing without him.

They even managed to put Scholes on the left wing, so the more popular players could play in the middle.

While Spain had the domination in world football they have always mentioned 2 players who they would have like in their team and this two were Scholer and Carrick, but Carrick again couldn't get into the England team as he wasn't attractive enough.

I am sorry, but the English national team is a joke, or let's better say it's a joke how it's run. The best team in the country is constantly using one player and isn't even thinking of replacing him, he starts most of the games and he still doesn't have his place in the national team. It can only be called a joke.

It even doesn't matter who is better in the last 18 months, Smalling or Hummels, but Smalling is a better defender then Jagielka and Cahill (we have seen the job these two have done in the WC) and him not playing is just because he is a Man Utd player and after Rio and Vidić no one is so good. Put him into Everton and let him perform at the same level, everyone would be screaming about the next WC defender England is getting.

So, trying to make a point and using the England national team as an example just can't have any real value.

1987~~~
Smalling is quite obviously a quality defender. We just need ti have someone next to him that complements him and then we'd be on to a winner. I'd say a defender like Hummels would complement him very well in all honesty and if the opportunity to get him is there we should perhaps look into it. The only problem with the German is that he's one to keep the medical staff busy all year round and that has been going on for a bit of time. I do think though that getting in someone like Stones would be a better cheaper option.

1988~~~
Problem with Hummels is that he is very expensive and wouldn't improve us from the beginning. We have all seen his form for most of the season (and longer). So we would have to wait and see how it will work. It is a possibility that it works brilliantly, but it's a risk (I know there is always a risk, but here from the start we would have to accept that he will have problems from the start and we have to hope that the dip in form is just temporary), so why give that much money, when in the last two seasons he isn't worth even close to it (35+ mil is a lot of money)? In that case we can also wait and see if Rojo improves properly, or if Smalling and Jones can stay fit and if Evans can find his old form which is more than enough for back up.

1989~~~
Nice try, could do better 3 out of 10.
Heartens me you can hold a grudge. Keep on keepin on bro <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1990~~~
With Rojo's improvement I'd like to see him and Smalling together for a long run of games to see how convincing they are as a partnership.

1991~~~
Too right. Hummels being this super world class defender is a fvcking myth. Hargreaves has a point. People are fooled by his ability on the ball. This season even his passing has gone to shit and he's been cursed by Dortmund fans. I watched their last game against Augsburg and Hummels was one of the worst players on the pitch. He looked nervy and was caught ball watching a few times. Its pretty much been the story of his season. The only game where he actually looked like himself was against Hoffenheim (this was one of only two games where Dortmund have kept a clean sheet in the league if im correct, Hummels didn't play the other game). <a class="username" data-user="71720, @Getsme" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/71720/">@Getsme</a> seems to be perma-camped in this thread these days being passive aggressive in his efforts to discredit Smalling since Evans is having such a poor season

1992~~~
Hold a grudge? The feck you on about?

1993~~~
Discredit Smalling? By saying he's not as good as Hummels, have a word with yourself.

1994~~~
I'm with you on this Ekeke. Rojo and Smalling look the real deal imo. All this talk about improving our defence when the solution might be staring us in the face. Their form will be helped by a new right back and Shaw playing consistently.

1995~~~
Getsme is best ignored in this thread. There are people who don't rate Smalling, but at least they explain why, Getsme's opinion is just based on what he thinks will happen with Smalling in the future based on his worst games for United(because I am not sure he even watches some games before expressing opinion on Smalling's performances, he is just repeating the usual stuff he thinks is wrong with Smalling when describing his performance).

1996~~~
You’re right but I that’s because Jones does mistakes a lot more often than Smalling. I wouldn’t say Smalling is error-prone at all. His passing has improved, and the defensive part of his game is excellent. He gives away the ball at times but IMO he can be excused for doing that (and any other CB for that matter) as we’re implementing brand new system which involves our defenders much more. He’s a very good defender and great athlete. Jones does more mistakes, and I believe he can be very good CB too, just he’s not there yet. IMO Jones does a lot of those last-ditch tackles, so he looks effective. But Smalling is more of a proactive defender, and I prefer those.

I thought Smalling is excellent at that? I mean, how many times has he given away a freekick or PK for that? 

A class: Smalling, Rojo
B class: Jones
C class: Evans (not sure what happened to him but I don't trust him)

1997~~~
Oh don't you worry your head about it.

1998~~~
I'll try not to.

1999~~~
What are you on about? The majority of my posts in here has been a discussion with a poster who claims Smalling is better than Hummels.

2000~~~
<i>Mmmm</i> Julianna Marguiles <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>...........Ahem, I hope Smalling starts against West Ham, of our two RCB's he gives me the most confidence and was doing quite well until he picked up another little injury, he really needs to shake that or it's going to hold him back.

2001~~~
Well hopefully we'll see. Individually they've shown themselves to be our most reliable defensively, if they can keep it up or do even better together then I'm all for it. Jones is making more defensive mistakes than Rojo at present

2002~~~
Jones against Cambridge was shocking, I don't think I've ever seen him play as bad. For me Rojo is growing in confidence with every game he plays. At the moment I feel it's Rojo + 1 (if we stick to a back four of course)

2003~~~
Yep agree and if Smalling can keep fit I can see him becoming a beast for us. I had high hope for Jones but doubts have crept in regarding him.

2004~~~
Hopefully a Smalling - Rojo partnership this afternoon. I think they compliment oneanother well.

2005~~~
Tomorrow. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2006~~~
Excellent that works out nicely. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2007~~~
It seems the most hardcore Evans lovers automatically don't rate Smalling. Im noticing this a lot this season.

2008~~~
I used to be "Evans lover", but I am not blind (OK, I have always rated Smalling more) and I can see how bad he is performing this season.

2009~~~
Could be, but I am not sure why, I rated Evans quite highly and I still think he can be good but it's really not that hard to admit that he is terrible this year.

2010~~~
Evans has never been a fighter like Terry, nor did he ever possess the athleticism of Rio. However, he struck a nice balance at his very best and made some very good runs forward. This season, he seems timid both in defense and going forward. Good squad option, but I fear he's not United quality as a starter.

2011~~~
Not sure of mentioned here already, but he's our fastest player via GPS tracking technology (or something like that) according to Wilson. Quite unexpected.

2012~~~
I take it this is a lazy dig at me? What a strange view you have on supporting a team, do you really believe it's one or the other? Go team Evans yeahhhhh <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2013~~~
Unexpected? Have you ever seen someone beat him on pace? Even Sterling/Ribery/Agbonlahor couldnt get past him on his pace, one of the fastest defenders in the game.

2014~~~
Yup. Welbeck said something similar whilst he was still here.

2015~~~
Example of his pace from this season:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/smalling1es8t.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/smalling1es8t.gif"/>

Willian didn't stand a chance as soon as it turned into a foot race. Excellent bit of composure before that as well just standing off and forcing him to commit.

2016~~~
I think his speed is the reason he was the preferred choice to play in the centre of a back three.

2017~~~
Willian is fast, but once Smalling started sprinting it wasn't a contest.

2018~~~
That and his aerial dominance.

2019~~~
That was a truly stunning piece of defending. So many defenders would have been caught for pace and would have ended up committing themselves to a tackle. Reminded me of Rio in his prime.

2020~~~
Really rate him now, as mentioned already no one beats him in a foot race and he's just as dominant in the air. His passing has improved massively this season as well and he has cut out the silly errors. I'm go as far to say he's currently England's best centre back.

2021~~~
This was also pre-season and probably to a lesser extent, but further proof of his pace.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://shrani.si/f/1H/Sw/4K0tyBNO/smalling.gif" src="http://shrani.si/f/1H/Sw/4K0tyBNO/smalling.gif"/>

2022~~~
Cheers for that. I've been trying to find this GIF for ages. And that's for anyone who doubts his acceleration. He really is a freakishly good athlete.

2023~~~
"England's best defender"

Caf average rating: 5.7

2024~~~
Smalling is our best centre back imo. He is ace in 1vs1 situations and is fast as hell. Our best header of the ball aswell.

2025~~~
I'm sure that it's because of the game against City.

2026~~~
Call it what you want, its an observation and you know its true (for you personally).  I've noticed it in other people too. You're passive aggressive about it though.

2027~~~
As someone said, definitely the cause of the City game. People went into meltdown after that and he no doubt got some very low ratings.

2028~~~
1.9 average rating for that game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2029~~~
Jones in again today. Looks like he's definatly first choice ahead of Smalling.

Can't say I'm happy about that.

2030~~~
Looks to have lost the battle, dont agree with it.

2031~~~
He's shit everytime he plays...

2032~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2033~~~
Heh

2034~~~
I'm confused about why he lost his place. It's not like Jones has been remarkable or anything. Strange.

2035~~~
Looks like Smalling won't be solving Arsenal's defensive problems next season. He will be getting paid by them though.

2036~~~
Has nothing to do with LvG prefer Jones over Smalling, Jones just carry on from where he left. We have won with him so why change, that would be unfair...

2037~~~
Smallings injury has knocked him down the pecking order.

2038~~~
This isn't the Phil Jones thread...

2039~~~
Hmm...

2040~~~
I'm a little worried with him not playing today, I think he's a lot more suited to dealing with someone like Sakho than Jones is.

2041~~~
This...and that's how it should go. It was like the Fellaini/Herrera situation before.

2042~~~
Passive aggressive. Ok then.

2043~~~
Lost the battle! Lost his place! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Everything is so black and white these days, I'd hardly say anyone in defense is guaranteed a place, maybe Rojo is the exception but all the rest have been changed regularly. I doubt Smalling not starting today has any great meaning on his future etc.

2044~~~
There are many more parameters than footballing ability taken into account for a coach to make a decision like this (as in terms of football there isn't a big gap between Smalling and Jones). Maybe LVG appreciates Jones' attitude or something else different. My point is that it's not a shocking decision because they're at the same level basically.

2045~~~
Some people do not want to accept it but, it just seems obvious that Van Gaal rates Jones over Smalling and that Jones/Rojo is his first choice CB pair.

2046~~~
Sakho and Valencia are constantly getting the better of Jones/Rojo in one-on-ones with their pace and trickery. If only we had a defender adept at dealing with that sort of stuff...

2047~~~
A fair number of players have taken a while to get back into the team after being out with injuries this season. LVG seems to take things slow with them.

Having said that, Jones and Rojo seem to be his kind of CBs - wanting to make things happen and get forward, but not doing a convincing job defending their goalkeeper.

2048~~~
Yep

2049~~~
Explain how?

2050~~~
Man of the match today. Did nothing wrong.

2051~~~
Solid.

2052~~~
Should have started.

2053~~~
I dont remember West Ham having a single attack or chance after Solid Chris came on.

Seriously though, he should have started.

2054~~~
We suffered under long balls and free kicks all night. No doubt having Smalling and Fellaini in the team would have helped endlessly. Maybe Carroll not starting swung their decision, but I think Smalling is better on the ground and in the air than Jones anyway.

2055~~~
Never once said he was shit.  Said numerous times that his form has been average over the last 18 months - when ive seen him.  Admittedley thats not as much as your claiming

2056~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

and yes, on the serious note he should have started.

2057~~~
Without him in defence, we've no one to actually win headers... which - above everything else - should be a huge reason for his continued inclusion.

2058~~~
If LVG sells him to Arsenal I'll be livid.

2059~~~
Will go mental to see him get sold and then suddenly be able to stay fit.

2060~~~
I doubt Arsenal will want him now.

2061~~~
I'd still prefer him to Jones

2062~~~
Its Rojo plus one. Smalling's injury set him back because Jones did well in his place. Smalling will now get his chance either in the league game on Wednesday or in the FA cup next Monday. Evans is not favored.

2063~~~
Will people finally accept that LVG currently sees him as fourth choice CB.

2064~~~
It's fecking ridiculous that he sees Jones and Evans ahead of Smalling. Simply baffling.

2065~~~
Evans was chosen ahead of him because of his ability to use his left foot...

2066~~~
It's baffling, but theres about 5 others baffling squad decisions he makes weekly so I've lost interest.

2067~~~
If Jones was injured or suspended I think Smalling would be more likely to replace him, not Evans.

 Can't conclusively say he's 4th choice.

2068~~~
I don't think Van Gaal necessarily rates Evans more than Smalling, he's just in ahead of him because he's more comfortable on that side than Smalling is. Jones is definitely ahead of him in the pecking order now though.

2069~~~
Great, we'll see Jones make brainfarts every week for several years.

2070~~~
Evans on the left is understandable. Jones ahead of Smalling I don't understand though. They are not even in the same category for me.

2071~~~
That's fair, however it wouldn't surprise me if he picked McNair over Smalling. I've said it before in here, but I dont think LVG rates Smalling for whatever reason.

2072~~~
Not only is he the best 1 on 1 defender we have, he is also the only one who takes charge of a situation. Jones and Evans feck about leaving it to each other. So disappointed.

2073~~~
It is starting to look that way, unfortunately.

2074~~~
I don't think he sees Evans ahead of Smalling. Smalling would be playing if he had a left foot.

2075~~~
our best defender can't get a game. Shocking.

2076~~~
Our best midfielder cant either.

And our best striker is playing in midfield.

#Philosophy

2077~~~
Jones is younger and much better on the ball. Been up and down this season (as has everyone) but definitely has more potential than Smalling.

2078~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

This place, honestly. It's a fecking mad-house..:

2079~~~
Who do you think I was talking about?
I regard Herrera as our best all-round, central midfielder (note this is different to "attacking midfielder" or "defensive midfielder").

Blind and Carrick are DMs, good at what they do but limited. Di Maria is for me an attacking midfielder, not a true CM, and whilst I like Fellaini he is definitely not an all-rounder.

2080~~~
Smalling's the new Herrera.

2081~~~
We don't really have a 'best' midfielder to be fair.

2082~~~
I disagree about that. Jones is definitely better on the ball but the difference isn't as big as some claim. And even if Jones has more potential (don't think that's true but it's a matter of opinion) Smalling is much better right now.

2083~~~
Where do you see Jones' potential? He's younger but his tactical incompetence, rashness isnt something he's going to loose soon enough imo, while Smalling is already a very good defender, whose main point of development should come with staying fit.

2084~~~
It is like Michael Owen always says about Smalling, he has no pass appreciation, he rifles in really hard passes at the wrong time on a regular basis. It isn't just about getting the ball to your man. I have mentioned this before on here and been told not to listen to Owen, which I find odd as he is a former top level footballer who has played the game actually with Chris Smalling!

2085~~~
Smallings biggest weakness is his passing, he often over or under hits the ball, I feel this is the reason LVG sees Jones as the better player.

2086~~~
Jones is only 22. That's very young for a CB. He'll improve a lot in the next few years. Smalling will too but - at 25 - by not as much. Plus rashness and tactical appreciation improve a lot with age. Weight of pass, not so much. 

The big question about both of them is injuries.

2087~~~
Completely disagree about Jones being clearly superior on the ball. Smalling has improved considerably in this regard - even though he is still a bit of a liability - but there really isn't much between the two at all. In fact, I'd say Smalling now has better composure and ability to bring the ball forward than Jones who often relinquishes possession when he's looking for a pass after driving forward.

And Smalling's significantly better when it comes to pure defending. Isn't even close IMO.

2088~~~
That was a while ago. I believe LvG makes them practice that area a lot more than any previous manager.

I get your point. However, do you think Jones is that much better to justify playing him instead of Smalling? Because I wouldn’t call any of them a good passer.

2089~~~
I'd say Jones is the better passer, but on a bad day he couldnt pass to a barn door

2090~~~
Smalling is not fourth choice. Jones, although people keep putting him down, is on a good run of games, which is why Smalling is out of the team. Maybe if Smalling could stay fit, he wouldn't have found himself out of the team in the first place. 

Evans is starting tonight because our choices at left centre back (LCB) are Evans and Rojo, and seeing as Rojo is at left back tonight, Evans will start.

How difficult is it?

2091~~~
Fair enough, but I think passing ability is much easier developed, in training for exanple. Smalling has already massively improved in that aspect this season, but learning to read the game, not make rash challenges, tactical awareness and purely preventing stupidity, will take years I think.

2092~~~
Heh. Last sentence wasn't an edit, honest!

FFS...

2093~~~
Yeah boy!

2094~~~
After the discussion we just had, I find that whole situation and his goal quite funny!

2095~~~
Nice one <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>

2096~~~
It was funny but doesn't change any of the substance of what we were talking about.

2097~~~
Terrible marking there, it has to be said.

2098~~~
That bit of defending from "our best defender" is a lot less funny.

2099~~~
Terrible defending by him.

2100~~~
Yep. Lost him.

2101~~~
Is it possible to hide the threadmarks and twitter feed during games? It updates so quick and with the stream it sucks to get the news before it happens on the stream..

2102~~~
Thing is, we don't have a "our best defender". All are pretty ok but not much else

2103~~~
Yep, caught ball watching. Needs to be far more aware of his man in that situation.

2104~~~
Possibly the worst bit of centre back play all season. He was miles off.

2105~~~
That title goes to Evans mate.

2106~~~
Where was Evans and Rojo for the goal?

2107~~~
Had no idea where the ball <b>or</b> his man was. Ridiculous.

In other news, my god we're awful aren't we?

2108~~~
Ironically the defense has gone to absolute shit since Jones has gone off.

2109~~~
Marking their men. Like Smalling should have been. But wasn't.

2110~~~
Yep, we were defensively perfect for the 2 minutes he was on the pitch.

2111~~~
We weren't much cop when he was still on the pitch, to be fair.

2112~~~
He made 2 comical mistakes in the first two minutes.

2113~~~
Are you accusing me of having a pro Phil Jones agenda?

2114~~~
It turns out Valencia is our best defender to be honest.

2115~~~
No.

2116~~~
It turns out that we don't have good defenders full stop.

2117~~~
Gotta be Shaw, hqant put a foot wrong defensively, that penalty vs everton was undeserved.

2118~~~
I think he is.

2119~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2120~~~
That would be Luke Shaw by a considerable margin.

2121~~~
So why was Di Maria in the left back position?

2122~~~
Ings is roasting him at the moment.

2123~~~
Hehe.

2124~~~
Beast ! Smallingbauer ; p

2125~~~
His worst defensive performance in ages but he's still winning us the match <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2126~~~
Sell him, useless

Oh that was last week. And the week before. And the week before.

Give him a new contract

2127~~~
Dont know whether to laugh or cry that Chris Smalling is our goal machine.

2128~~~
One of the worst defensive halves of football in recent memory but he is putting our superstars strikers to shame!

2129~~~
Always said he's the one to start ahead of Jones with Rojo. Shame that LVG was too thick to notice it as well and Smalling is saving his sorry ass right now.

Just a goal behind Falcao now by the way, come on Chris, you can do it.

2130~~~
Jokes when Chris Smalling plays upfront next week.

2131~~~
I always thought he had tremendous attributes for scoring goals with his head. Two good headers from him, but shaky defensively.

2132~~~
He's been so bad in defence, but has scored twice. It about sums up our team tonight.

2133~~~
This is probably the worst I've seen him defend but still two goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2134~~~
Mwaaah, has been suspect defensively. His worst defensive performance I remember from him. Unless your sarcastic.

2135~~~
Michael Jordan in flight !

2136~~~
Not really, I do rate Smalling higher than Jones.

Agree with you that we're all over the place with everything by the way, including defense <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2137~~~
He's been absolutely terrible. Get the feck in though. Two big goals.

2138~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> somehow I laughed hard.

2139~~~
Two great headers from Chris.

2140~~~
Agreed. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2141~~~
Has to go down as one of the best jinxes in recent memory.

2142~~~
He's been awful minus the goals.

2143~~~
Always thought he was a shit defender and now I know why, it turns out he's a fecking brilliant forward.

2144~~~
Anyone would look terrible coming on as a sub to play alongside Jonny Evans in this form

2145~~~
Really typical of you to say that ! One poor performance and shit immediately.

2146~~~
If I were Falcao and RVP I'd be shitting it so he doesn't take their spot up front next match to be fair.

2147~~~
That bit where's he's calling De Gea 30 yards out of his goal to deal with the ball when he has a defender on his back <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> 
He shows no leadership or brains. He needs to take charge there. And hes done that a few times this season.

2148~~~
Him and Evans are dipshits. Don't they communicate when they going for a ball. Few times both went for headers, when our so called midfielders were challenging for them.

And that situation with De Gea. That should be his to clear.

2149~~~
Play him upfront! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2150~~~
On a serious note, someone needs to have a word with him at half time. Was awful defensively.

2151~~~
It was a joke FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
It wouldnt surpise me. It's not like LVG hasnt made some odd decisions this season.

2152~~~
Why would they? They are playing bad for a while now and are still allowed 90 minutes every time.

2153~~~
Involved in all 3 goals........

2154~~~
I don't even know what to think. Great for scoring two goals but feck me Ings is abolutely rinsing him. Don't think he has been first to one ball.

2155~~~
Two good goals, can't defend.

2156~~~
The way we are set up I actually feel for our defence, even for Evans.

2157~~~
Yeah, him and Evans haven't been great to put it kindly, but they're getting no protection.

Another mistake from Smalling there.

2158~~~
Sub him, what a terrible defensive performance

2159~~~
He's getting a hat-trick today.

2160~~~
That would be the most mixed performance ever. His best performance but also his worst.

2161~~~
Great recovery after that comical mistake 2nd half. Cleared every ball in his space.

2162~~~
I hope they don't drug test him after this game, because he was on some strong stuff in that first 50 minutes. Seems to have worn off.

2163~~~
Thought he was very bad tonight. What's even more worrying, is that I also though he was a best defender.

2164~~~
Our entire defense was terrible. He recovered from it late in the second half. His tackle and drive forward to start a counter attack was pure sex

2165~~~
Weird game from him. Two goals, some dodgy moments at the back but also some very good headed clearances. There was a spell where he was heading out everything that came in, reminded me of Vidic.

He has a nasty shirt pulling habit at corners though and he needs to stop because one day it will cost us.

2166~~~
Pretty much this. It was as bad as i've seen him defending at times when he's usually pretty reliable but was a beast for while too getting his head on everything.

Gonna give him the benefit of the doubt and put it down to having to play alongside Jonny Evans.

2167~~~
Great in the air at both ends tonight and his surge at the end was him smelling that hat-trick. Some defensive lapses though but given the disaster show that Evans and Rojo were to the left of him I am going to cut him a modicum of slack.

2168~~~
It's crazy to give him MoTM. Yes he scored 2 goals, but was guilty for one. Di Maria and Herrera were better. 

However, how to rate a CB that can't defend but scores 2 goals I don't know.

2169~~~
Two goals and decent second half. During the horrible first half, he wasn't good at all but still one of our better players.

2170~~~
Lél

2171~~~
He wasn't at fault for the first. He gambled Ings would continue his run to the near post and got stuffed by a good ball and good movement. Rojo and the completely absent Evans were more at fault even if Smalling was closer.

2172~~~
Hard to blame him for the goal, but his overall defending was shit. Saying that he played better when Burnley tired.

2173~~~
Only because he scored two goals, as well as have a very improved second half. First half was a shambles.

2174~~~
I know, but I'm sure other defenders have scored 2 goals in a game before within that time period.

2175~~~
He was a liability tonight despite 2 nice goals. He has all the tools to become a top defender but doesn't seem to have the focus or first touch to realize his potential

2176~~~
Liked how all the United players were practically laughing when Smalling scored <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2177~~~
Ball watching for their first goal, scored two goals for us. Definitely a weird game from him but he came out of it looking alright overall.

2178~~~
This. He was shite defensively today, but being dropped for no reason for the poor Jones can't do much for his confidence and rhythm. Hopefully Smalling is back in our team next game and back to his best.

2179~~~
Has more goals than Balotelli in the league this season.

2180~~~
Evans was ten times as bad! He was poor on the goal but so was Evans (marking the penalty spot) and second half Chris kept them out by himself. Man of the match, though given how bad we were generally that isn't saying much!

2181~~~
And the same amount of goals in all competitions <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2182~~~
Looked like a defender that hadn't played for a while today. Very heavy on his feet, Ings pretty much gave him the run around.

2183~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OsYfujnzdiQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2184~~~

2185~~~
Basically an explanation of why people shouldn't pay attention to websites like whoscored.com.

2186~~~
Christ.

Definitely deserved at least a point off for a couple of pieces of really rusty defending.

2187~~~
Good goals. Pleased for him. Not his best game defensively though. Was poor for their goal and lost Ings a few times. He has to do better than that. Luckily for him with Jones out and Evans being a complete lost cause he will most likely get a run in the team again, where he will show that he is our best CB again (although Rojo is catching him).

2188~~~
A 10 really? I gave him an 8 and I think I was being a touch generous.

2189~~~
He's immense. When he doesn't fancy defending, he just goes up front and wins the game.

2190~~~
It was a case of the good (goals) and the bad (his defensive play) tonight. Fortunately for him, we didn't see the ugly. Nevertheless, he will have to do better than that on his defensive game when such should be his bread and butter.

2191~~~
He made two big defensive errors but also some crucial interceptions and blocks and 2 goals. A bizarre game for him.

2192~~~
Was better going forward and in their half than he was defensively. Made a few blocks and clearances and Burnley became less of a threat but when shit was hitting the fan, it was their finishing or De Gea stopping Smalling and Evans looking seriously stupid. Very poor at the back I thought. But it was a clusterfeck of a defence to be fair and having Rooney as the primary DM can't be easy.

Either way for MOTM sorts of things, I thought Di Maria was far better once he went out wide. Burnley couldn't handle him in the end.

2193~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2194~~~
Any GIF of that tackle and run? That was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2195~~~
that's it shame some people are surprised with him being voted MOTM because of some of his errors. he did them and so did Evans and Rooney, Dimaria passing was shocking today but he made it up with good runs winning the penalty and workrate. Same with Smalling couple of not minor errors but he had also some outstanding blocks and headers. Some people just remember only the bad moments. It was really a bizzarre game for him but absolutely deserved the MOTM prize ahead of anyone. Not the 10. I gave him 8. In terms of defending it was 6 overall and two goals(one of them winning) for 1 point..

2196~~~
he gave it away for the first goal. lack of control on the ball. the other defenders failed to close. smalling did ok but that's all can be expected. and ffs jonny evans was out there tonight. partner him with rojo and i think he'd be better off. between him , jones and evans we look short of cb's. they are all pretty sh1t.

2197~~~
Their formula seems to be based on what a player does on the ball which makes their stats on defenders not very effective.

2198~~~
He was MOTM for his winning goals, not MVP which I would give to Ings

2199~~~
I want to see that too. <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> would you make this happen for us?

2200~~~
This.

2201~~~
He seemed well off the pace in the first half. It was like he was still mentally in the dressing room after he got subbed on. His defensive performance improved as the game went on, though. I still think he's our best defender when on form.

You could see how gutted he was after that Di Maria cross got fired in just ahead of him. He's probably never gonna have another chance to get a top flight hattrick. The chance was on, as well.

2202~~~
Had to laugh at Smalling being given MOM last night. He had a shocker defensively, but quelle supreeze, scores a couple of goals and everyone votes for him. v Funny !

2203~~~
he won us the game ffs, your comment is bizzare

2204~~~
Yea he basically won us the game despite being awful defensively and it's not like anybody else played a fecking blinder that night to snatch the crown from him. You don't often get a defender scoring two goals in a match and given that our forwards were inept as feck we needed somebody to score it.

2205~~~
In the 2nd half he was much better and cleared and blocked so many balls. Compared to Evans, he was miles better as well

2206~~~
I am not sure. He looked like a schoolboy for the goal and his collision with Herrera (which I thought was mostly his fault) could have cost us in the second half. I think he was our worst defender yesterday but his brace took his awful defending out of people' minds.

2207~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2208~~~
He's now our joint 5th top scorer in the league this season, on 3 with Di Maria and Fellaini. Who saw that coming? 

From a quick check I dont think any CB has more than 3 goals -  Smalling, Terry, Koscielny. So hopefully he can keep it up and this is a part of his game now, because in the past goalscoring was lacking from Smalling, he was a 1 a season man... He had the size and would win cross now and again but the goals just werent coming.

His leaps for the goals were impressive and he took them well

2209~~~
If he scored 70 goals in 35 Prem games and was an average 15th placed CB defensively he'd be the greatest defender in the history of football, though. The best defence in Prem history gave up 15 and the worst gave up 89. So, 75 goal difference over 38 games. Divided up around 11 players, even with CB's being more responsible for conceding goals than most, the worst in a normal league season is probably not a bigger spread than more than, and this is exaggerating, 15 goals per CB.

2210~~~
Smalling and Rojo each had 24 defensive interventions; Evans had 16. It's unusual for the fullback to have more interventions than his CB - Rojo spent a lot of the game bailing Evans out. Smalling completed 86.7% of his passes; Evans completed 78.3. It's hard to think of any area where Evans could have been considered better.

2211~~~
I have literally no idea what you're trying to say here.

2212~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2213~~~
Nah, Smalling was pretty awful and totally at fault for the goal (he let Ings just drift off him) but Evans was his usual shocking self.

2214~~~
Haha. Totally fair. Not sure I did either.

My point was that a defender not completely shitting themselves and scoring 2 goals per game, if he did it every game, would have the greatest season a defender has ever had , so Smalling getting MOTM makes perfect sense. 

If he scored 2 a game, he'd be about 65-70 up over a full season on a normal CB. For a striker, that would mea scoring 80-85 goals in a league season. Even if you want to knock off 10-15 goals for Smalling defending poorly, he'd still be insanely productive.

I'm not sure this is any clearer. 

TLDR: Score enough goals, and you're great.

2215~~~
So basically we just need to get Smalling to score 2 goals every game, and we're good. Surely we can train him to do that.

2216~~~
You're just a hater my man. He did very well in the last 25 minutes of the game..made at least two vital blocks and nothing that came through in the air went past him

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/smallingdfqeu.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/smallingdfqeu.gif"/>

2217~~~
Ah, I want the pass too. Or the entire move.

2218~~~
*** pace <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Smalling is probably my favorite United player for some reason, I wish he'd stay injury-free for a season.

2219~~~
Smalling's another one that thrives on confidence. We've too many sensitive souls, we're too needy. He got better and better as the game went on last night. Majestic aerially in the last half hour. I wish we had a couple more who didn't give a feck about the odd mistake, had a bit more brass neck about them. Rojo has a bit of that about him. Poor old Jonny looked like he could burst into tears at any moment.

2220~~~
I think Smalling is our best CB, but passing isn't a strength of his. He doesn't make a ton of horrible errors, which is important (I can't really think of an underhit back pass of his causing a goal, for example) but he very, very rarely spots and hits a dangerous long pass forward and isn't great at slipping the ball hard into the feet of midfielder or striker centrally. He also hits passes behind or at his partner a lot, rather than just in front of them. 

That said, most CB's aren't contributing too much offensively and you can be a top 5 CB in the world without being a great or even very good distributor. Miranda, for example, has probably been that good over the last 2-3 years and he rarely does anything brilliant on the ball. 

It's like Silva's shooting. Something that keeps them from making a world's best squad and something you hope will improve with time and experience, but not a huge deal. 

All in all, I'd say only De Gea, Di Maria, Rooney (as a 9), Blind Herrera and Shaw look as safe as Smalling to be healthy, effective starters over the next 5 years. So 4 other spots to look at improving first.

2221~~~
Sorry for slow reply, havent been on for a few days.

Its great that he scored, but I'm judging him as a defender, cos thats what he's supposed to be. He's a bag of nerves, scared to bring the ball forward, panics when anybody runs at him, and seems to be constantly out of position

If thats what you people want from a Manchester United defender and I'm pretty damned sure I'm not the one being "bizzare"

I'm actually a fan, or would certainly like to be. I'd love him to cement a CB position, but he's got to play a lot of better than he has this season. He wouldnt be the first defender to look awful for a long spell then come good. Pallister and Stam had shakey starts and became legends

2222~~~
Looked really uncomfortable tonight, panicked every time Preston attacked us.

2223~~~
Very unselfish of him to leave other players save the day today.

2224~~~
Too many times players get between him and the other CB. When he knows where his man is he's totally dominant but it's one thing he needs to improve with his defending.

2225~~~
Was good in the air as far as i could see, but it is always the same with Smalling. Panic panic panic.

2226~~~
Expect better from him.

2227~~~
My only issue with him is there's always one mistake in him every game(Today being the slipped clearance).

2228~~~
Two really bad defensive performances in a row. Real shame.

2229~~~
Was fine aerially, but he just looks so, so sluggish at the moment.

2230~~~
Struggled against a couple cloggers tonight, his performance levels look so low from just a month or so ago.

2231~~~
He makes me nervous and he looked nervous, he's fine when the ball is hit in and he goes man to man for an aerial dual and he is a strong athlete, but the composure is lacking, there seemed zero communication between him and Rojo.

2232~~~
Has to cover for positional lapses of our other defenders too often. Rojo and Valencia kept being caught out which causes him to rush and try and save it. Dallies too long on the ball though, needs to pick the pass and play it.

2233~~~
Rojo is our only defender playing with confidence, it's worrying.

2234~~~
When Smalling plays on instinct he's fine, when he thinks about his game it seems to just make him panic. There are times when Smalling looks so commanding, and there are others when he plays as if someone has covered the ball in petrol and lit it. If he could just get his head straight he'd be a very accomplished defender. Its staggering that he's capable of marshalling our back line away at the Emirates but not at Deepdale...

2235~~~
Has looked pretty shaky since he's come back on, but this is just his second game since returning from injury. I expect him to be better in the next few games.

2236~~~
Not really in almost every game he makes few stupid mistakes and others have to fix it. 

The problem now is that none of our CBs is in form.

2237~~~
You can still make mistakes and play with confidence.

2238~~~
I wonder if him and Jones are playing with nerves as they know one of them is for the boot in the summer.

2239~~~
I think we should keep both for the sake of competition but get rid of Evans.

2240~~~
The man just isn't consistent enough.  There are games like Chelsea where he's superb and then flounders against Preston.

2241~~~
Oh I was already taking it for granted that Evans will go, but I see 2 CB's coming in as neither Smalling or Jones have shown nearly enough this season to warrant starting for a club with United's ambitions. To me it's one new CB for Rojo to compete with and one new CB for Jones or Smalling to compete with.

2242~~~
In my opinion Smalling has been better than Rojo in most games, including yesterday. But if we sign a right-footed CB, it will be Smalling who makes way.

2243~~~
Pretty much this. Rojo is playing as poorly as our other defenders, too many times he had to be bailed out

2244~~~
That's true, but I think hi confidence isn't really the good kind of confidence.

2245~~~

2246~~~
He's not perfect, but he is the best we have. I think he struggled early on not having a leader like Vidic beside him, but from what I have seen he is slowly becoming the leader. He is definitely more vocal than I can remember, but I suppose with Rojo not being great at English it's even more important.

2247~~~
Really love those squawka articles, ofcourse stats can be misleading but similar to the Herrera version, I think they're right.

2248~~~
Get in a center half to partner him. Someone great on the ball who reads the game well. Just get stones in so we can have a somewhat reliable pairing at the back that don't have to constantly be bailed out by our keeper. Rojo, Evans and Jones just aren't good enough to be starting games for us when the whole squad is fully fit at CB.

2249~~~
From the article, for those not wanting to leave the site.

There's some illuminating information in there for those who dont see he's clearly our best CB.

We still need 1 top class CB if we hope to have success in the future, but in terms of what we have right now Chris Smalling is our rock, the glue that keeps things together at the back

2250~~~
Like LVG?

2251~~~
He doesn't seem interested in defenders, just deep deep deep deep deep deep deep lying passers

2252~~~
I think hes been good too tbh. 
However hes not even first choice is he? Seems to be behind Jones in the pecking order, also his injury issues are still a worry.

2253~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that's true.

2254~~~
I think he has been decent this season but I'm not sure how accurate that article is. I can think of quite a few mistakes Smalling has made that has led to chances, the most recent ones being the hacked clearance against Preston (not a huge mistake) but in the game before vs Burnley he missed his kick which gave Ings a chance from 6 yards out.

2255~~~
I think when it comes to the errors stat its more about Rojo's kind of mistakes passing the ball to an opponent or getting tackled leading to shots against their team. With the Smalling vs. Burnley one it'll count as a clearance (gone wrong) and also the sites just keep the stats from the league, not cup games which explains why preston wouldnt be on there.

2256~~~
yeah I was surprised when Chris was benched after top performances since city game. Then Jones came out of nowhere and back in starting XI even his performances were really not good. But maybe it had something to do with Jones taking corners..

Smalling needs good run of games again. He showed great confidence after some of these games but after benched looking quite unconcentrated that much. but he will be good even in last few games he was our best defender. 

For the next season we may need one world class leftie to replace Evans who needs to play elsewhere. I think Everton could snatch him and we could get discount on some of the players we need more some of CM's Mccarthy and more advanced Barkley, also winger/striker is the priority in the next window before adding any defender..

2257~~~
Isn't it more likely that LVG will be looking at getting in a CB to partner Rojo, given that he signed him?  For that matter, he seems to prefer Jones over Smalling as well.

2258~~~
Enjoyed that article. Definitely agree with it.

2259~~~
Hold on a second though, they really ranked Smalling & Jones as the top 2 CBs in the league this season...

2260~~~
Smalling is class. The stint at RB stunted him, if anything.

2261~~~
Can't be far off it statistically. I haven't read the article yet but thinking back to the goals we have conceded it was mostly Evans and Blackett at fault early doors wasn't it?

2262~~~
He's our best central defender but you don't need those wanky stats to tell you that.

His clearance against Preston the other night was shite and could well have led to a goal, demonstrating just how pointless these statistics really are.

Smalling and Rojo at the back, for me.

2263~~~
Because Jones' defensive lapses arent accounted for. I dont think any site carries a stat for how many times a CB switches off and his man gets on the end of a pass or something. As I mentioned before, there is a defensive errors stat but it only covers specific things.

Now if Jones wasn't making those mistakes every other game then he would be one of the top CBs. But he is making those mistakes and it'll always give the opponent a chance, which is exactly the opposite of what you should be looking for from your CBs

Jones (and Rojo) score highly because of work rate and winning the ball with tackles and interceptions a lot compared to their peers. That doesnt always translate to looking comfortable and assured at the back, it just means they win the ball a lot.

2264~~~
The only defender we have that can consistently win headers in our own box, and we drop him. A Jones/Rojo partnership is horrible. 

Just another LVG cock up.

2265~~~
Agreed. Feck knows what he's seeing in Jones, honestly.

2266~~~
Its not like Rojo has done well

2267~~~
I've said it time and time again on here, Smalling won't get on ahead of Jones due to his passing ability.

2268~~~
Jones' inability to head the ball with consistency is a massive issue. I agree, Smalling shouldn't be on the bench.

2269~~~
Really? I think he has.

Looks as if he will only get better also. He can reach a level that Smalling, Jones or Evans aren't capable of imo.

2270~~~
He's made multiple mistakes losing the ball

2271~~~
Another good decision by LvG to leave him out. Bah..

2272~~~
Why would you need your one CB with actual defensive instincts? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2273~~~
Not sure what Smalling would have done to prevent either of the goals?

2274~~~
And it's not like we need someone who's good in heading, anyway. We were threatening from every corner we got.

2275~~~
He's a better defender than Jones or Rojo and should play. At this stage, ball playing skills are secondary

2276~~~
Against West Ham and Swansea, we looked terrible dealing with set pieces. I have little faith when it comes to Jones or Rojo dealing with set pieces. Atleast with Smalling even if he does hold shirts deals with them.

2277~~~
It is easy to say that he would have done a difference today, but looking at a bigger perspective i was unhappy with LvG not choosing him when he had played the last few games.
Rate him our best defender, even though he has his weaknesses when it comes to passing out from the back.

2278~~~
It annoys me that van Gaal has this "philosophy" of players coming back through the U/21s or whatever but Jones seems to just walk straight back in the team. It's not like he's a world class CB. Would have preferred Smalling to start. We miss his presence from set-pieces (both attacking and defending). If Rojo and Jones keep performing like that though then I suspect he will be back in soon.

2279~~~
Stupid decision to drop him against Swansea. Very stupid. Jones looked extra timid out there.

2280~~~
Smalling + Rojo should be our main CB pairing. Get it sorted LvG.

2281~~~
89% pass completion negates the argument that he is useless at passing, doesn't it? He still looks slightly awkward at times, like a goalie kicking a ball tbf, but he's far and away our best defender. Why LVG doesn't pick him is baffling. Jones doesn't impose himself on the game at all. At times I am wondering whether or not he plays at all, but then he goes dribbling as the last man and I go "there he is". Jones may have had, or may still have, more potential (whatever that may be), but currently Smalling is our best CB. I still think that Smalling and Jones could be a great partnership if not for the need to play a left footed CB. No wonder Rio and Vidic were shit.

2282~~~
Another of those baffling selections from VG. Even with the LCB/RCB nonsense he should be starting whenever fit.

2283~~~
The only defender who takes charge of a situation instead of sitting around.

2284~~~
Should be starting every game for us if not injured. Superior to Jones imo.

2285~~~
How many giant defenders also have great pace (Wilson said on average he's the fastest we have in training) and are also consistant doing a good job with their defending?

I can't really think of any comparible CBs out there, who have these same strengths which are pretty much a dream combination for a CB

We're lucky to have him.

2286~~~
Easily our best defender.

2287~~~
I just don't understand Van Gaals reason for dropping him in favour of Jones. He's taller, faster, better in the air both offensive and defensively and seems to be the only one of our defenders who pushes out with the ball. Its infuriating.

2288~~~
Well Jones makes the most interceptions of all our players, Rojo is also good at that. So perhaps its because they are more aggressive players with a high workrate, who win the ball more often.

Which is all fine and dandy until you count the fact that they both give the opponents far too many chances with loose touches, passes or switching off. And Smalling does a miles better job at doing those basics

2289~~~
Interceptions are fine but we need much more from our cb's. Jones' positioning at set pieces just leaves me speechless. I did have high hopes for him when he came but he just does not seem to have improved.

2290~~~
Actually position himself in the box to clear the cross instead of dwelling on the edge of it?

2291~~~
In all honesty, only the very best like Boateng, Ramos, Kompany (though he's not that good any more). Now I'm not comparing Smalling to them but he certainly possesses those traits.

2292~~~
Varane?

2293~~~
LVG has started this irritating trend where Some players need to be shit for 5 matches to be benched while some need to put up anything but a perfect performance and its bench time.

2294~~~
I think Herrera, Mata, Rafael and Smalling all fit into that category.

2295~~~
Fast, but a couple of inches smaller.

Smalling matches the likes of Fellaini and Matic

I wouldnt say they they have that kind of speed but they are probably all stronger/more powerful than Smalling

2296~~~
I thought that putting "Bah" at the end was a give away of my sarcasm. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2297~~~
Why didnt he start yesterday I'll never know.

I hate when managers constantly change CB pair for no reason whatsoever. YOu have to have an established CB pair.

2298~~~
Smalling had an absolute shocker against Burney despite scoring 2 goals. Neither Jones or Smalling are good enough currently and might never be. Jones was dire against Swansea but Smalling has been equally dire for us in other games so it's a tough call...Jones seems to be a more aggressive defender but Smalling definitely has a lot more about him. 
I'm certain Smalling will be in ahead of Jones in our next game but if he has a shocker then everyone will be crying for Jones to be back in the team again

2299~~~
Varane isn't close to Smalling's level in the air, but he is very athletic. They are probably on par for pace. Rio was at least as fast, almost as good in the air and generally a better defender. Concerning today's defenders, Jagielka is the fastest in the league<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2300~~~
He wasn't that shocking. For the first goal there were no other defender's in sight. The cross was executed perfectly and the run and timing for the header sublime. Smalling made a decision to go for the near post, which wasn't a bad decision, just turned out it was the wrong one. For the clearance where he missed the ball, Herrera came running into him. If Smalling had smashed that ball, he would most certainly have smashed Herrera's leg also. In the second half, he pretty much cleared everything that could be cleared.

2301~~~
I think it was Ferguson who said that the central players on the pitch should pretty much be established. LVG still seems to struggle to find out who is the nailed on starters. Disregarding DDG, It seems we only have Rooney and RVP for that, and both have been below par.

2302~~~
Smalling-Rojo should be our main CB pair. It hasnt been perfect but it has been the most comfortable of all the pairings we've seen this season. And we've seen a lot.

2303~~~
Agreed.

2304~~~
He's miles better then Jones.

LVG is an idiot.

2305~~~
I think he's far better than Rojo as well.

2306~~~
Yep.

2307~~~
I’ll most likely get it from all angles here but what’s the point of being a member of the forum for if you can’t give your opinion.

I think Smalling is massively over rated on here, he gets away with mistakes that others would be hung out to dry for, he’s also one of our worst passers in the squad (<i>not talking about stats</i>) and he will most likely be one of the first players to leave in the summer (<i>if LVG stays</i>).
I’m not saying he’s a bad player, he’s not and I’m as comfortable as anyone when he plays but he’s as capable of a mistake as any other CB. If all a defender had to do these days was defend then I’m sure Smalling would be picked ahead of Jones, but it’s not the way the team is being asked to play. I’ve been saying it for a while now, LVG doesn’t seem to rate Smalling, and with the way he wants his team to play I can understand why.

2308~~~
As I said in the Jones thread, he compliments Rojo much more than Jones does. He's a bit of a calming influence there, a Ying to Rojo's Yang. It's probably down to communication, when I see Jones on the field I always imagine he talks to everyone like Zed from police academy.

2309~~~
Which would all make sense if he wasn't getting dropped in favour of Jones who is a) far more prone to mistakes and b) almost as bad on the ball.

2310~~~
I have no answer for that, personally I would pick Smalling at the moment (<i>although Jones at the start of the season was playing very well before the injury he got playing for England</i>) but I can understand why LVG doesn't. The only reason I can think off is Jones is slightly better on the ball. Both make as many mistakes as each other, Smalling has a better recovery though.

2311~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2312~~~
Fair enough but of all our defenders you have to admit he's the least error prone, he is also probably the worst on the ball but he doesnt give the ball away and gives it to players who are better with it. If we had 0 ball playing players in defense, that would be catastrophe.

2313~~~
There are a few 'intangibles' to defending. One of them is to inspire confidence in your team-mates. Whether it's your goal keeper or your centre midfielders - they need to feel confident in you. I just don't get the impression that he inspires confidence in those around him, despite being good at the 'pure' defending.

None of them do, to be honest, but especially Smalling. Even his partnerships tend to look more like two separate centre backs doing their isolated defending, rather than playing in unison. Maybe I'm being harsh though.

2314~~~
At the moment he is yes, although I think Rojo has it in him to become a regular for us for years to come, the more experience he gets (<i>along with a regular partner</i>) I'd imagine the less error prone he will become .

I think the difference between Rojo’s and Smalling’s errors is Smalling’s are usually unforced (<i>although that could my memory playing tricks on me</i>) but for me Smalling’s biggest advantage over everyone else is his speed. Due to the way we play he very rarely gets to use it, which is another reason why I don’t think he fits into the managers plans. It seems its speed on the ball not speed of the player that LVG wants in defenders.

2315~~~
He's definitely shown improvement on the ball this season, doesnt give it away much and now and again he's done some nice work going past players and playing a pass. I'm not sure he's any worse than Jones or Evans on the ball anymore, they are the ones passing to opponents

2316~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant, and probably true.

2317~~~
After our earlier debate in this thread thought id watch the Juve Dortmund game.  Seriousley.......Matts Hummels is not a good centre half

2318~~~
He's not having a great season, but he's a fantastic player, and as you say we've had this debate.

2319~~~
Smalling is soo overrated by United fans it's embarrassing.

2320~~~
He's also criminally underrated by many. More united fans rate Jones. Evans was God before people woke up to his uselessness and now most of his diehard fans are OTT Smalling critics.

2321~~~
Shall we just ignore Phil Jones exists from them stats then?

2322~~~
You just need to watch one game to see all the mistakes he makes at the moment

2323~~~
According to Squawka he's the 2nd best CB in the league behind Smalling, has a better defensive rating and has also made no defensive errors along with Smalling. So, if you intend on using Squawka to prove a point, why is it valid for one player but not the other?

2324~~~
Because you're deliberately ignoring all the other stats, just because 1 of them doesn't cover everything it should. The defensive errors dont count everything we fans would consider a defensive error, which I already explained earlier in the thread.

You could also go watch a match and see that Jones is making mistakes and Smalling makes the least of our CBs.

2325~~~
I'm not ignoring anything lmao, i think Squawka is a ridiculous thing to base a players performance on, but if you're going to, you can't divide opinion just to suit your argument.

I watched the match last night and Jones made one minor mistake all game, yet apparently he was a liability and cost a goal that had nothing to do with him, so it seems fans are equally delusional whether they're presented with statistics or not.

2326~~~
I've heard this mentioned a bit but I am not sure it is true, at least not anymore. People seem to be really critical towards Jones this season.

2327~~~
If somebody tells you one thing, do you have to believe everything they ever say?

Its one stat thats a bit useless because it doesn't cover enough to call it "individual errors". Get over it

2328~~~
It's one of several stats displayed. Jones is rated the 2nd best CB in the league behind Smalling on that article. His rating includes nearly 8 higher than Smalling defensively. Then on the United stats he's 3% less on pass accurate, about 1% less on aerial duels and then he's averaging an interception a game more than Smalling. The article (who's written by someone equally as blind) then suggests that Smalling has been by far and away our best CB and questions how we have such a great defensive record. Well, if we apparently have the best 2 CBs in the league, whys it such a mystery? Could it be that maybe Squawka stats are complete bollocks? Or maybe they're accurate and Smalling is fantastic. In which case, so is Jones.

Which one is it?

2329~~~
You must've missed the backlash from the City game.

2330~~~
Yeah, he should have been praised for that game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2331~~~
No he shouldn't, but after that game people were quick to write him off. He came back into the side and controlled our back-four in a certain amount of games and turned some heads. It just goes to show how fickle us fans are.

2332~~~
I think this is a fairer comparison?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/phil_jones/126/126/89/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/chris_smalling/126/126/584/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/gary_cahill/126/126/451/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/john_terry/126/126/72/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/vincent_kompany/126/126/543/0/p#defence_score/interceptions/blocks/clearances/defensive_errors/errors_leading_to_goal/pass_completion/tackles_won/tackles_lost/aerial_duels_won_%/fouls_committed/cards_for_bad_tackles/total_duels_%#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...mitted/cards_for_bad_tackles/total_duels_%#90</a>

2333~~~
Came back in and controlled the back four? Have you seen our defence this season, there's nothing controlled about them.

2334~~~
Maybe not controlled but atleast he tried to orchestrate it and i felt when he was on the pitch the other defenders wasn't as nervous than without him.

2335~~~
He came back with strong performances against Arsenal, Hull City and Stoke. His response was brilliant. After the City game people didn't want him in the starting lineup again

2336~~~
All I'm saying is, Smalling is not the next Messi.

2337~~~
He and Rojo are rated better than Smalling on whoscored.

Again, as you're too dense to realise its because theres no good "this guy cocks it up this much" stat

You just have to use common sense and factor that in with the stats given. Do you want someone who wins the ball a bit more, but then presents the opponent with a good chance every game? LVG seems to

2338~~~
Too dense lol, I'm not the one that's using the stats to support my argument, infact I've mentioned several times that they're complete bollocks, and they are. You get points for clearances ffs, what a ridiculous stat to mark a defender on.

As I've already stated in the thread, a lot of these Jones mistakes are non-existent. He didn't give Swansea any chances last game, for example, yet his thread is still littered with shit. There's also been several times this season where he's been left 2v1 due to other cocking up and he's dealt with it exceptionally well, but we just forget about that. We also forget about Smalling losing his man vs Burnley and then completely fluffing a clearance in his own 6 yard line which almost resulted in a goal. I don't like being negative towards him because I like Smalling, but the caf would be in uproar had Jones been so poor in such situations, considering he was apparently at fault for a goal that had nothing to do with him at the weekend.

2339~~~
No one said he is. What kind of analogy is that?

2340~~~
'twas a joke.
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/we-must-buy-the-next-messi.401797/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/we-must-buy-the-next-messi.401797/</a>

2341~~~
A clearance is clearing the ball from the penalty area. Why wouldn't a CB get positively marked for that? 

Let me guess, you really thought they meant hoofing the ball up the pitch or out of touch? Says everything

Yes Smalling has made a couple of mistakes recently, but he's clearly less error prone in his 5 years at the club than any of our other CBs have been in their time. So obviously its more rational to consider more than a couple of recent games, else we'd be under the impression that someone like Rooney is an average player.

2342~~~
I always thought United fans rated Smalling higher overall. However non-United fans seem to prefer Jones over Smalling, if they had to pick one, but most think both are shite.

2343~~~
I still hold out hope for him and Jones because the two of them are excellent in 1 on 1 situations, Jones in particular has a great burst of pace even if he gambles and loses his man to recover and make a tackle. They both do however need to get better aerially first and start sniffing out danger before having to make a tackle. I'm genuinely surprised that they spent 2-3 seasons with Rio and none of his composure has rubbed off on either one.

2344~~~
Smalling is dominant in the air. Thats one of his strengths.

2345~~~
Should/can be better though I think. With his size and athleticism, he should be Vidic-esq at both ends.

2346~~~
Smalling wins a few especially off corners because he is just taller, when I think of aerial dominance I think of players like Vidic, Cahill & Koscielny who attack the ball before letting it bounce between midfield and defense. I think Rojo is much better at it than any of our other center backs.

2347~~~
Not particularly, a defender could have the composure to play the ball out of the area despite being under pressure, yet that gets absolutely no reward when it is clearly a more skilled action to take. Someone making a fantastic last gasp clearance and someone panicking under pressure are grouped as the same thing, which is ridiculous.

I don't necessarily think Smalling has been a less error prone centre half to be honest, I think that's a bit of a myth. However that's exactly my point, because of the hype Jones has received before it seems that fans are looking for mistakes in his game where as Smallings can be swept under the carpet.

2348~~~
If we going to play Rojo or Jones then Smalling needs to play next to them.

We looked weak during set pieces against West Ham and Swansea with Rojo and Jones. Gomis could have got two goals from their first two corners. Smalling is a lot better in the air than both of them.

2349~~~
Rojo? He is worse than Evans in this aspect.

2350~~~
You guys are both underrating his aerial prowess. In the game against Burnley nothing went past Smalling in the air. He won 80% of aerial duels. Thats very Vidic like. Watch the game again if you can, the second half especially.

2351~~~
It's just as clear as day both he, and Jones haven't 'trained on' both need to go, one this season, one the season after.

2352~~~
Yeah its pretty obvious for anyone who has been watching us for a couple of years that Smalling makes a lot less mistakes at CB than Jones does

2353~~~
None of him, Jones or Evans are good enough. Smalling perhaps the best of a bad bunch. I'd imagine Jones is who will stay in the summer due to his age, and the other two will be gone.

2354~~~
Why do people keep saying this? If you're not good enough it doesn't matter how old you are. Jones has had 5 years of first team football

2355~~~
Jones is also above Smalling current in the pecking order (as has been shown by recent team selections)

2356~~~
That doesn't really mean anything. Smalling was ahead of Jones at one point. The only CB who seems to be assured of a starting role is Rojo because he has a left foot

2357~~~
I'd bet a lot of money that both he and Jones will be here next season. I think Evans will be off.

2358~~~
I think Evans will be off too tbh, but I also think we may see more leave than stay when it comes to defenders.

2359~~~
Evans and Rafael to leave, I think, with Blackett going on loan. Rafael leaving will be hard to take, when fit he's legitimately one of the most talented full backs in the world, but I'll understand the reasons behind it.

Something about Smalling and Jones. No matter how many times I watch them play shite, I still can't bring myself to want them out of the club.

2360~~~
Smalling will be off along with Evans. Jones will be given a year's stay of execution, but will then be shown the door in 2016.

2361~~~
Smalling does get away with murder here,
I'd go along with that.

2362~~~
I think so as well. Evans is the only CB who has been absolutely terrible.

2363~~~
Better ball playing performance than any of our defenders this season. Whats up, some brilliant passes.

2364~~~
Hull at home wasn't half bad as well.

2365~~~
Agree with this.

2366~~~
Good performance by our centerbacks. And Smalling is in a beast mode.

2367~~~
Getting more comfortable playing the ball out of defence, that pass near the end of the half was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2368~~~
He is our best centre back, plain and simple. His problem has always been fitness.

2369~~~
sometimes his first touch is little too heavy but apart that he bosses the game. I love his chesting the ball like nothing happened, great passing and some good runs, like someone earlier said I love how he thinks he's Messi for a while and than realize he's too far and pass it but good option how to set an attack especially when Blind looks not really convincing receiving the ball under pressure.

I really hope we finally buy some world class defensive midfielder, strong, agile fast type to cover the defense better..

2370~~~
Interesting to see how aggressively he has been pressing, practically playing on the halfway line and playing some great passes.

2371~~~
He's bossing it so far, big reason we've managed to stay in Sunderlands half for the majority of the game.

2372~~~
He's been awesome in the first half. So cultured on the ball. Been great to watch.

2373~~~
He's been smashing it! Never seen him look so good on the ball. I've always rated him defensively but his ball work lets him down. If he can keep this up he could really hit some form.

Also if LVG reverts to Jones after Smalling is putting out performances like this, then I just don't know anymore...

2374~~~
I don't think I have seen him play better for us. This is a throwback to the Smalling we signed not the one we ruined playing at RB.

2375~~~
Smalling-bauer!

2376~~~
Watch Jones walk back into the lineup when he's fit again now <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2377~~~
Even gave 2 brilliant crosses in the 2nd half, well played.

2378~~~
MOTM Big Chris.

2379~~~
Can you give a centre back motm after such a match? Incredibly good today, terrific on the ball and bosses defense. His passing is miles better than Evans' at this stage.

2380~~~
MOTM for me too.

2381~~~
Absolute monster today. A real driving force from the back.

2382~~~
Best CB at the club by miles.

2383~~~
Good game from Smalling but yes, it would be very odd to give him MOTM in a game at home where the opposition sat in and looked to score on the break.

2384~~~
I'd be pissed if we sell him and keep Jones.

2385~~~
Smalling-Rojo please. Surely a no-brainer from now on, another excellent performance.

2386~~~
They did try on the break, but when you put Adam through and Smalling simply outpaces him, what else is there for them to do? It was their only chance, but Smalling and Valencia would always boss that side for counter attacking play. What convinced me about Smalling today though was his ball playing abilities and the way he brought the ball out of defense and carried it to attack.

2387~~~
He should be starting every game. That was obvious even before today. Considerably better than Jones in the same role.

2388~~~
Always looking for the forward pass today. Outstanding.

2389~~~
Well done Smalling, great game.

2390~~~
Superb performance. Even his crosses were excellent. Made it look so easy.

2391~~~
Love when he bursts past strikers like they're nothing to him.

2392~~~
This. 

He's a few levels above the rest. He looked more confident than I've ever seen him today on the ball. Always trying to get forward, defending excellently and distributing the ball well. 

I'd keep him at United without a doubt. He may not be a starter when we get the players we want but he'll at the very least always have a part to play as a squad player.

2393~~~
This. Smalling is certainly our best RCB. Jones and Evans can stay on the bench.

2394~~~
They had 26% possession and five shots. I don't even think that they had a corner. No ambition really. Awful from them.

2395~~~
Still Smalling plus 1. Preferably Rojo.

2396~~~
He's our best centre back. Told you. 

Cue Jones replacing him as soon as he's available again.

2397~~~
Surprise surprise play Smalling and we look solid at the back (apart from the first 10). He's out best defender and a beast at 1 on 1s. He has to start every game he's fit for me.

2398~~~
He's the only one of our centre halves who can be agressive while being calm and composed at the same time. Which is absolutely vital if you want to put in a solid performance as a team.

2399~~~
Another brilliant game, still so underrated by our own fans and especially opposition fans

2400~~~
Wow! His decision making when on the ball was out standing.

2401~~~
Strong and always on the front foot today, very good outing for him, amazing to think he'd have been on the bench if Jones wasn't ill.

2402~~~
Our best CB. Simple as.

2403~~~
He was brilliant today, this is exactly the type of game that suits him. He even managed some quality passes! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2404~~~
Quality

2405~~~
He's our only defender who can physically dominate opponents. I hoped this season he and Jones would step up. 1/2 isn't bad I guess.

2406~~~
Beast today. Made everything look so easy. Probably why Jones often wins more plaudits with his ridiculous recovery tackles and charging about. More likely get on the highlight reels than stepping into interceptions or using your body to stop the forward getting the ball from you. He seemed to respond to the crowd and not go back to the keeper everytime he was facing his own goal. He did well to turn and bring the ball forward again and again.

2407~~~
Immense today he's our best CB. Love watching him in this form he's like a basketball player.

2408~~~
2 MOTM in his last 2 games. No doubt he will be dropped as soon as Jones is fit.

2409~~~
Matts who? Smalling was super today. Drove with the ball, great touch, dominated in the air, passed well, crossed well. I sound like I'm describing a fecking centre midfielder. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2410~~~
I'm quite annoyed he wasn't even an option for MOTM on the official United twitter... Rooney, Young and Januzaj were the 3 choices.

2411~~~
Probably because Sunderland showed no ambition. He had next to no defending to do.

2412~~~
Was very impressed with him today. Hope this form continues

2413~~~
Oozes class. Calm, confident play that just relaxes the midfield in front of him. 

Shades of Rio in terms of style today the way he used his body to roll the player and walk away with the ball time and time again.

2414~~~
This is why I don't get, how anyone can think Jones is more talented than him. Athletically, he's on a different planet. Just look at him.

And he's also consistently shown himself to be better at almost every single facet of defending.

2415~~~
Smalling is generally excellent, I think he's also mostly good in his use of the ball which is something he gets alot of stick for, its just there is always the chance he'll make a mistake, it seems to happen when he got lots of time, when he's reacting to things he's excellent and like others have said he can physically overpower most players. I think with him in the team I always feel easy in terms of set pieces, it means we don't have to have Fellani on the pitch for this bit of the game which allows us to play better players in the position he takes.

2416~~~
Not worth looking into the Rooney headlines tomorrow, Smalling commanded the defence today.

2417~~~
He was great. Should never be dropped in favor of Jones.

2418~~~
Played very well today, by far the best back three partnership we have seen.

2419~~~
Yep, it's obvious as feck that he's been working hard on his passing.

2420~~~
Probably because it was a back four?

2421~~~
His chest control today was something Fellaini would be proud of.

2422~~~
Was it though? I saw the team as playing 3-5-2

2423~~~
It was 4-4-2, Valencia and Rojo were definitely full-backs. di Maria had a free role in a midfield four.

2424~~~
Yes.

2425~~~
Very good game from him. Sunderland were trash though.

2426~~~
Really great performance from him today. Far and away our best CB, and has been all season. Just needs to stay healthy.

2427~~~
No way. Blind sometimes dropped in between the two defenders but we played a 4-4-1-1/4-2-3-1 or a 4-4-2 with two strikers who both had the freedom to drop deep but we definitely played with 4 at the back.

2428~~~
Yup.  Very impressive.

2429~~~
he showed good allround play and maturity today he put in two great crosses as well. Very good player, he's becoming my favourite player and team leader. I'd love to see him wearing armband in Rooney's absence..

2430~~~
You just KNOW Jones will replace him midweek. You can almost guarantee it.

2431~~~
Fair enough, I saw it as an attacking 3-5-2 formation,

2432~~~
I like Smalling. He's a center back that can defend and is more cultured than Jones and Rojo. Physically, he's a beast.

2433~~~
Can anyone make gif of that pass, it was sublime

2434~~~
The best I've ever seen him. So composed on the ball and such a strong and quick defender. I just didn't think he had it in him to be so good on the ball and I've got on his back a little bit. Long may it continue.

2435~~~
Smallinbauer

2436~~~
Easily our best CB. I just love the way he manages to sneak in front of the opposing teams attacker to carry the ball forward.

2437~~~
Does anyone know off hand how tall/heavy he is? Hes really weak challenging for aerial balls at times. Today he was either beaten to it or headed it about 6ft at most.

2438~~~
Excellent today. Looked like a footballer that can defend. Must be doing some good work in training. WTF the others are doing god knows.

2439~~~
Man of the match worthy performance.

2440~~~
This is bang on. I remember someone saying Rio didn't get the plaudits he deserved from other fans because he was never caught out of position so never had to make last ditch tackles. Smalling is the same.

2441~~~
Unusually calm and composed today. Brilliant touch, drove with the ball and that chest control <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

One of the best games I've seen a CB play for Utd in the last two seasons.

2442~~~
Excellent match by him today.  My MoM.  Now he needs to kick on and do this regularly.

2443~~~
Truth. Smalling often does get caught out of position. He recovers quickly with this pace, but he rarely dives in. Usually he'll catch his man and just put his body in the way. Again, it's unspectacular to watch, but he makes it look simple. The Rio comparison is a sound one. Smalling has a similar was of just positioning his body properly and putting himself in the right place. He is severely underrated.

2444~~~
He's 6'4". No idea about weight.

I missed the first half, but sounds like he had a good one. Very glad to hear, as I've always been a huge fan of his. The potential he has is scary if he can just stay bloody fit.

2445~~~
Just caught up with the game. Smalling was outstanding, best i've ever seen him play i think.

2446~~~
Yeah he was great against Sunderland, including his passing. He has a weird gait which makes him look clumsy but he was really confident on the ball today.

2447~~~
Exactly. This is my issue with him. Against Hull and Stoke earlier this season, he was fantastic. Then went off
injured again next game. I always feel the next injury or below-par display is just around the corner. He can be miles ahead of Jones and Evans if he could put some consistency together, both in form and fitness.

2448~~~
His performance on the ball was amazing today, and every time Sunderland would knock the ball forward, he would win the ball almost every time and help us start attacks again. He really is a great and composed defender, and his presence on the pitch makes us very solid, defensively.

He still has those moments where he panics in the box and loses his man, but if he cuts those out, he can be our main starting defender every match.

Plus, his through pass to Blind was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Off to the GIF thread for that one!

2449~~~
Best performance on the ball in recent memory. We'll see if it continues.

2450~~~
Toward the end he was.even putting good crosses in.

It was nice to see less recovery, hero mode defending.  He was a big part of that.

2451~~~
My MOTM by a mile; was class. He just handled everything brilliantly. His passing in particular was really impressive. If he gets dropped for Jones I will be furious. Jones can feck off. Smalling is our best central defender. It is not even up for debate. You hear me, Louis?! Smalling plays. End of.

2452~~~
Easily earning his place in the starting line up with performances like this. He's been in good form for a couple of months now but I'd say this was a level above the standard he's been playing recently. Encouraging stuff.

2453~~~
He had an air of confidence about him that bordered on arrogance that I think Van Gaal will have appreciated. He played the ball out of the back brilliantly and unlike Jones when he advanced into midfield, he had his head up and picked out a pass.

2454~~~
Was brilliant today but, it's going to be hard for him to kick on because LVG keeps chopping and changing. He needs to be a starter when fit right now along side Rojo as I think they compliment each other well.

2455~~~
His ball playing are confidence related. Once he gets a few run of games he seems to be a different player on the ball. 

If it weren't for his fitness record and us fecking him around at RB, he should/would be by now the best defender in English football. That is just how talented he is.

2456~~~
Our best cb bar none.   Great performance.

2457~~~
Funny, I read in the Evans thread that Evans was caught out on a few occasions by people running at him, yet on those occasions Evans was isolated, smalling was nowhere to be seen. It's all well and good smalling bursting forward but Sunderland really should have scored first. This thread would have been different then

2458~~~
Those were one on one scenarios Evans almost always struggles in. Smalling did leave him isolated once or twice, but Evans is always so slow and easy to commit against an attacker. If it was Rojo or Jones (instead of Evans) they'd have dealt with it better.

2459~~~
There is no doubt that he has the ability to be one of the top CB's in the league. The only thing in doubt is if he will be able to stay fit for a prolonged period of games to really get there. Only with more experience and routine he will be able to eliminate these brainfart games he has every now and then.

2460~~~
At 25 this really is the crucial period in his career. If he can kick on he could be a real asset for club and country, who are both crying out for a top quality centre half.

2461~~~
I said it a good few weeks ago that his passing had greatly improved under Van Gaal, hes got the full package.

2462~~~
I think in both scenarios Evans did well actually. The point was more that smalling left the defence isolated

2463~~~
First 20 minutes pretty bad. After that got better and better. But MOTM according to many and rated best player on the Sunderland thread? No way, Young by a mile.

2464~~~
Now watch LVG replace him with a still recovering Jones on Wednesday

2465~~~
Best defender by a mile Saturday.  Commanded space in the back and was very good with the ball as well.  He made a couple of long-distance passes that actually shocked me with their quality.

2466~~~
I will be furious if that happens.

2467~~~
Same here. I was pissed when he did it after Smallings 2 goal game against Burnley. The shit just didn't make sense.

2468~~~
Surprised no one has praised him. Penalty incident aside, I thought he played a great game. Easily the best Centre Back at the club.

2469~~~
It's normally a good sign in a game like that if a center back goes under the radar.

2470~~~
Just come in to bump this, absolute monster after the penalty incident. He keeps us in the opposition half. IF he can stay fit, it has to be Smalling + 1 and I don't care if they have to be purchased but it has to be someone better than Evans/Rojo

Although to be fair to the former, he too was very good this evening.

2471~~~
Easily our best centre back. Brings the ball out well with his sprints and adds physicality to our back 4

2472~~~
He also did a nice outside of the foot pass under pressure in.midfield. I really like Smalling and he just needs to.stay fit now.

2473~~~
Good performance.  The CB positions are wide open at this point, maybe he is going to take his chance.  Nice to see a defender composed while on the ball and willing to take control of a situation.  Given plenty of space at times and he was willing to get forward.

2474~~~
I thought both he and Evans were quite good.

2475~~~
I think he is progressing on the ball and is a beast physically, I'll be annoyed when he's dropped for Jones, although LvG did show him some love post Rooney hug.

2476~~~
I would be absolutely livid if he gets dropped for Jones.

2477~~~
He's too good for us, should leave. <span style="color: #ffffff">White text.</span>

2478~~~
The penalty incident was very rash of him, he needs to clear out these things, other than that he didnt put a foot wrong and was a beast. He could really be good enough for  top side.

2479~~~
Formed a good partnership with Evans for the last two matches resulting in two clean sheets which is nice. I hope he will keep his place even if Jones is back.

2480~~~
A real driving force from the back. He's so physically brilliant that we can afford to play a really high line. He's one of the first names on the teamsheet for me.

2481~~~
He's so valuable in the air when we're defending our box - absolutely miles better at heading then the rest of our centre-backs, and that's why he should be our first choice back there.

2482~~~
Good game both center backs, I guess with Smalling mistake at the penalty I would go for Evans for the MOTM.

2483~~~
He was OK i guess, clumsy with the penalty challenge could have cost us.

2484~~~
I get the feeling that Smalling's imposing presence and confidence as a defender is making Evans perform better as well. Smalling was solid today, and other than the penalty incident, he didn't really make any other mistakes. No wonder Evans is performing better recently.

After all of the doubts from the past few seasons, I'm very glad that Smalling is showing his true worth. He's even showing the confidence on the ball that he presented early on. His passing has really improved, and he looks more comfortable on the ball than he used to. Certainly, no one can say that he's clumsy and sloppy on the ball at the moment.

2485~~~
He played ok although very clumsy and it should've been a penalty.

2486~~~
I thought he did well apart from the peno shout.

2487~~~
Outstanding second half. He led the back line tonight.

2488~~~
Jones esque performance tonight. Make of that what you will.

2489~~~
He is a clueless player and then he makes stupid things often.

2490~~~
Just recalled his no look flick round the corner in the second half.

Stonewall penalty aside, his usual self. It is absolutely imperative we keep him fit (and in the team LVG!) for the tough run of games we have coming up.

#SmallingPlusOne

2491~~~
Amazing how often he had to clear things up on the left. No idea where Evans and Rojo were wandering off to.

2492~~~
This is an incomprehensible post.

2493~~~
He was responding to my post I think.

2494~~~
It will be interesting to see if van Gaal keeps him in ahead of Jones, or whether that (non) penalty tackle will cost him.

2495~~~
Him and Jones are two clowns

2496~~~
He's been so bad on the ball I genuinely feel sorry for him. After 30 seconds he played a bizarre pass into Sanchez's hand and never recovered. A bag of nerves

2497~~~
Is he gone in the summer? Surely we can't have a centre half who can't pass in the modern game?

2498~~~
Why was he shifted to LCB after half time?

2499~~~
A bad game tonight and if he had reacted a bit quicker to Valencia's error he could have put some pressure on Welbeck.

2500~~~
It's not his fault we ask him to be our fecking playmaker. Even CBs with better passing would struggle with what van Gaal is asking from him with the ball(since I don't believe he is playing so much risky passes because he wants to, there is no CB who would enjoy doing that). Anyway, still our best defender by mile.

2501~~~
Great in the first half, went to shit in the second.

2502~~~
Why the feck was he on the left? First the pointless substitution and then we feck around with the other CBs position as well.

2503~~~
He looked incredibly uncomfortable tonight at times. I was concerned every time he was on the ball that he'd end up costing us.

2504~~~
Good player but limited and definitley not top class. We wont be winning anything with him as first choice.

Saddest thing about that is he's probably our best CH.

2505~~~
Wtf was he doing on the first goal? Instead of staying out on the right he wanders to the inside and does nothing.

2506~~~
His touch is pub team level, sometimes I wonder whether this club is too big for him.

For me he is poor but I would still keep him in the squad ahead of Evans,  Jones!

2507~~~
None of Jones, Evans or Smalling are anywhere near good enough.

2508~~~
Has been disappointing in the last several games.

2509~~~
I agree, they have a couple of games here and there where you think they might be getting it and then it's back to brain fartery, no way we challenge for the big competitions with the CB's we have.

2510~~~
He was playing in the Conference a few years ago, it's not hard to see why. We desperately need a proper, ball playing cb to partner Rojo.

2511~~~
And we have been repeating this for three years and feck all has been done. All three of them are crocks who have 0 composure when it comes down to it. Makes me sad that we went from Rio and Vidic down to these lot

2512~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.lastminutegoals.org/manchester-united-vs-arsenal-fa-cup/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lastminutegoals.org/manchester-united-vs-arsenal-fa-cup/</a>

You can see the whole thing from the start. Valencia has gone walkabout like he did constantly throughout the game, somehow he starts on the top of the pitcture moving down the middle of the picture and leisurely ponders back towards the right side, but doesnt get there fast enough to pressure the Arsenal winger so Smalling has to confront him.

Valencia doesn't wake up, continues to almost go through the motions but not quite as he slots into CB, then puts in a feeble challenge letting Chamberlain go past him. Smalling has tried to recover his own position because clearly Valencia has no idea what he's doing, but Valencia has done the opposite and instead of covering what he's responsible for he's charged out to the edge of the box and let his man go past him with ease taking him out of the game.

Now in hindsight the right move from Smalling is to incapacitate Valencia with a swift jab to force LVG takes him off the pitch before he costs us the game. And perhaps if Smalling stayed with his man, covering Valencia, then Monreal would have had a more difficult chance and would have been less likely to score. But the best thing that Smalling could have done would have been to get back to CB and Valencia finally get back into RB, but Valencia does the opposite.

Its a mistake from Smalling as well as Valencia, but had Valencia tried the best option - as Smalling tried, then it would have probably worked out. Instead of running out to the edge of the box, be the right back your supposed to be.

One final option is that Smalling leaves Ozil to freely pick up the ball on the left and do as he pleases with no Valencia to be seen. Thats dangerous, but ultimately we might have got away with it. We didnt get away with what actually happened

There's also Di Maria who isnt tracking a fullback, isnt tracking a winger and is in fact ball watching the whole time that Smalling is struggling to correct the error between himself and Valencia. But by this point I know thats what Di Maria is going to do, he has no interest in defending. So I almost expect that.

2513~~~
Wasn't very good tonight, and I am a Smalling fan. He seemed to had to cover for Valencia/Di Maria a bit in the first half. Then got moved to LCB and struggled on the ball.

2514~~~
How people still 'believe in him' and think he is a title winning and CL winning CB, I have no idea!

2515~~~
Thought he was rubbish tonight. 

He played like non-league Smalling

2516~~~
They would play only mid-low table teams, not sure as regular starters

Smalling>Newcastle
Jones>Aston Villa
Evans>Sunderland

2517~~~
Quite poor today.

2518~~~
He does seem to be very highly rated on here, I'm not sure why.

2519~~~
I've been saying it since forever....I just don't get it.

2520~~~
It only seems to be on this forum for whatever reason, outside of it he is seen as an ok player, nothing more nothing less.

2521~~~
agreed!

2522~~~
Looks comfortable against lesser teams but causes so many problems for himself against top opposition.

2523~~~
Looked awful throughout.

2524~~~
Decent squad player if you need him to cover, could do a solid job alongside Rio or Vidic, but is badly exposed with weaker players alongside him.

2525~~~
Simply not good enough, average at best.

2526~~~
Thought he was absolutely woeful. One of a few at fault for the goal in the first half and he just went to shit in the 2nd.

2527~~~
Biggest Smalling defender on here, but he was poor and off his game tonight. Terrible on the ball, although the midfield didn't help and it seemed that he was trying to play central midfield himself, but from defense.

2528~~~
Worst match I've ever seen him play, absolutely terrible.

2529~~~
Poor today, very poor

2530~~~
Just when I go and all-out praise the fecker, he plays like an absolute fecking moron.

2531~~~
Sadly this is the truth.

2532~~~
I think he is like Pique where he thrives the most off a leader beside him. His best games were in his breakthrough season with us, and then he had games with Vidic and Ferdinand, and he looked so calm and composed for someone his age. Bring in a big character who can command the CBs and that is where I feel we will see the best of him.

2533~~~
Man... In any domain, one cannot always hope to have a leader nearby in order to thrive. At some point, the individual has to take the reins on his own. Smalling's growing older and so he should be in a position of commanding something in the United hierarchy by now. If he can't bring that kind of presence, then what is he doing here?

The same thing is being said about Evans and it is not pretty at all.

2534~~~
Some people seem to praise Smalling constantly and keep telling the world how shite Evans is. Smalling is fecking liability. Proves it time and time again.

2535~~~
I have never seen a more woeful player for us than this clown (and i saw Ralph Milne)
Seriously - every time he plays the commentator mentions how it wasn't long ago he was playing non-league football and i ALWAYS instantly think ''well yeah he should have stayed there''

He really is abysmal and its an embaressment that he plays for us.
When he has to much time on the ball he slows down and asseses his options before panicking under the pressure of nobody before deciding the best ball available is someone in an opponents shirt.

When he doesnt have time on the ball he trips over the fcker or just boots it out for a throw in.

He turns at a slower rate than Mertasacker. He isnt particulalry a good defender (though some will argue that he is due to one decent performance in Munich last year)

Fulham did well to get 10 mil (same price we paid for Jaap Stam might i add) from us and i really think that now is the time to say 

'you no what, we bought him as he had potential to grow but he has been here 4 years now and he hasn't improved a jot despite having the best centre back pairing ever as a mentor. Lets just get rid of this brain dead moron'

2536~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2537~~~
He absolutely plays with no brain. His marks Monreal on the first goal, and go on OX to close him when there are Valencia and Rojo on him, leaving space behind him. How the hell is he that far on Ozil on this action ?

He's an absolute nightmare and we'll never progress with him in the defense

2538~~~
I agree.  He's completely clueless for a player  who's been a professional for that long.  His mistakes are schoolboyish.  i don't like him and he needs to go.

2539~~~
He hates to have a ball at his feet, always panicks with it, and yesterday he panicked nearly every time Arsenal players were in front of him. He's not a young player anymore who has potential, some of the bad things in his game he already should have polished.
Worst part is he's the best of the bad bunch although I think Rojo has potential.

2540~~~
He's decent cover for the reserve team should one of those players go down.

2541~~~
Jones is better defensively, Evans is equal with Smalling with a confidence near 0... We should get rid of Smalling and Evans this summer, but having an upgrade like Rojo won't be enough 

Because we’re very tough with Smalling, but Rojo except giving the ball back to De Gea or throwing long balls to Fellaini is not much better than Smalling….

And we still have to play Costa, Aguero, Sturridge, Kane this season….

2542~~~
I said a few months ago that he was brainless, costs us games & we could not progress with him at the back. Results & performances backed me up yet everybody said that I was drunk & on a wind up.
There's been some kind of agenda on here the last few months & anybody that said anything against Smalling was called an idiot or accused of not watching the games.

I really struggle to think of many worse defenders to have played for us in the last twenty years. Evans & Jones are not any better but they haven't had the deluded fanboys noshing them off all year.

2543~~~
Trust me you’re far from the only one, when you have a poster saying that Smalling has had a better 18 months than Hummel’s or that Smalling is our best Centre back by miles, then there really is no point in continuing in discussion with those posters as opinions are so far apart it’s only going to go one way.

Smalling is an ok defender, he makes as many mistakes if not more than most of our players yet he gets away with murder on here (<i>outside of here he is regarded by many as our weakest defender</i>) His mistakes are usually attributed to someone else’s error, or simply ignored while otheres are villified for the far less damaging mistakes. It’s a weird one as some posters seem to want other CB’s to fail so Smalling can stay in the team (<i>or that’s how it feels at times</i>)

2544~~~
He makes less defensive errors than Evans and Jones. That is why he gets praised so highly, because in comparison to those two he is the much, much better defender. I know he has had some poor moments, but he has been better than those other two. He and Rojo are our best CBs I (still) think.

2545~~~
Still our best CB. Everyone has an off night now and then, and his was y'day (and the Man City game). But this over reaction and asking him to be dropped/sold is just silly. His general performances over the season have been fantastic.

2546~~~
This is the overhyping I was talking about, fantastic, come on FFS? He’s been ok, and that’s at a push.

2547~~~
He's taken on the mantle left from Rio/Vidic and become our best CB. He's a fantastic CB. He's strong in the tackle, good in the air, quick, and reads the game well.

2548~~~
How can anyone want a starting defender for us who can barely control a ball. 

Putting it out there, Smalling is an ok defender, but as a footballer? He's awful. His passing, control and touch are all poor. His size and pace are his major assets.

2549~~~
Made a big mistake yesterday with a heavy touch under no pressure. Stuff like that makes it hard to see him ever being a really top class defender.

2550~~~
Depends on what standard you want to be at, for a mid table/battling for top 4 standard he's been good. Don't think he could cut it as a title winning or champions league winning centre back. If we've dropped our expectations that's fine let's keep him but if we want to battle it out for the top European and domestic trophies we need to do a lot better than Smalling. Maybe the fans are getting used to the mediocrity of the last season and half that's why Smalling is getting so much praise.

2551~~~
Exactly. Completely baffles me.
I never want one of our players to have a nightmare & it's not his fault that he's been hyped so much by people on here but every game in which he's been rubbish I log on here expecting the penny to finally have dropped. There's either no mention of him or people making excuses.

2552~~~
Exactly. I mean, if I did that for my sunday league side I'd be crucified. Yet people persist with someone doing that at the top levels of professional football?

2553~~~
There was a moment later on while playing LCB that I understood Van Gaal's wish for a player that is at least left foot comfortable to play in that position. The ball came to him very square and he had pressure from, I think, Welbeck honing in on him. A left footed player turns it quite comfortably outside and plays it to his fullback, as a predominantly right footed player he found that manoeuvre very difficult and the last thing he wanted to do was play it onto his right foot which would have been very dangerous if he was tackled or intercepted.

The safest thing to do, and what players at a lot of other clubs would do is Row Z it but with the possession system it's discouraged so he looked very uncomfortable and almost cost us.

2554~~~
He's never played as a LCB. England U-21s Jones was always the LCB, same here at Utd and even Rio used to move to the LCB role when partnered with Smalling. It's just dumb playing him there with his deficiencies on the ball.

2555~~~
Yeah, the only defender we have with the ability needed for this system is Evans but he seems positively afraid when he is playing these days.

Ironically Pique would be perfect, a player that was derided for many years for not being able to 'defend' like a player like Jones can. Times change.

2556~~~
Looks terrified on the ball when he had to switch positions at the back.

2557~~~
I'd be reluctant to take him even at a mid-table club. He's not a good defender & he'd still be clueless & make the same mistakes at a lower level team.
Wes Brown could be just as erratic but I think even he showed more promise when he was here. He's had a nightmare at Sunderland & his flaws have been even more pronounced since being there.

2558~~~
Get this Donkey out of this club. Im tired of us carrying players like him. He's past the age where he's given benefit of the doubt. I have never been convinced by him and as a matter of fact the only time i started being impressed by him is his short spell at right back he had. Him and Evans need to be shown the door, and Jones thrown out so he's teetering on the edge with the clubs strong arm weighing down on his throat being told to sort himself out or he will be shown the same fate. Sick of this pissy, nervy attitude and calamity defending their all doing.

2559~~~
That's just bollocks, pure and simple.

2560~~~
Accident waiting to happen. Always the same, one mistake early on and he loses it. He is so nervous, i could never trust him week in week out to deliver.

2561~~~
He is infuriating when he just dawdle's with the ball. 

Lets the opponent basically chase him down and win the ball. So slow and languid at times. 

Physically is a beast, should use that more effectively and stop trying to be cute with the ball.

2562~~~
Usually a fan  of his, but there is no denying he was poor last night. Thought him and Valencia were both at fault for the first goal. They both seemed to follow each other around, leaving a massive gap for Monreal. Smalling also had a few other moments where he looked shaky, possibly not helped by being left sided central defender in the second half. All in all though, disappointing because I know he is capable of much better.

2563~~~
None of our CB's are up to it, not a single one.

You wouldn't notice them standing out if they signed for a club like Villa or Sunderland. Much like Tom Cleverley.

2564~~~
He struggled last night because he was under so much pressure. Arsenal were playing a high line and pressing us high up the pitch, and he couldn't handle that. He's never been able to. That's a huge deficiency in his game, but I'm not sure it warrants getting rid - you just have to take it into account. The same way Vidic or Terry are left embarrassed if a pacy attacker catches them one-on-one when they're high up the pitch. You'll never find a defender totally free of flaws, so you build your system to minimise their weaknesses and maximise their strengths.

We didn't do that or take his weaknesses into account, and we didn't push Arsenal back. We let them press us up high without punishing them on the counter or with balls in behind and we paid the price.

Meanwhile, Mertesacker, who has the turning circle of an oil tanker and is woefully inept anywhere outside his own box (see the Arsenal v Monaco game from two weeks ago as evidence) was allowed to stroll around on the halfway line without us doing a damn thing about it.

2565~~~
Atrocious defender.

2566~~~
So much truth! With Vidic, he had Rio who was positionally excellent there to cover him most of the times so his weakness was masked. A defender is only as good as whoever is next to him. Smalling and Rojo do well but I can't see him working well with Jones.

2567~~~
This guy is really just not that good eh?

He dominates in the air but as soon as the ball is on the deck, he suddenly acts like he's never seen a ball before. Everytime he's near the ball in a pressure situation, I genuinely fear for the worst. I can't imagine how De Gea must be feeling with that lack of certainty in front of him. We really have came so far since the days of Vidic and Ferdinand.

2568~~~
Have had enough of him and jones and evans. They have been given their chances and shown they should not be starters here.

2569~~~
Probably not the same posters, but I'm sure the attitudes towards him must completely change every two pages. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He goes through a few games where he looks uncharacteristically composed and commanding. Almost like a twin brother. But usually, even if he's doing his individual defensive job well, he rarely looks in unison with his partner or composed or convincing.

There's something about him. I just don't get the impression he ever inspires confidence in those around him, even when he's winning his individual battle. That's needed as a centre back.

2570~~~
Those saying he has been fantastic cannot be serious. Either I have been watching a different player or the standards at this club have dropped significantly.

He is a capable defender but in today's game you need more than that, especially under Van Gaal. He is so poor on the ball its shocking and not acceptable for a club looking for Champions League football.

2571~~~
Nah it might look like it but seriously he's been average to shite all season and I personally haven't seen or said anything other than that. Think a few on here had the cheek to call him our best centre back in response to his reckless sending off against City.

No sorry, that's Rojo and even he isn't anything special (he just does his damn job).

Smalling along with Jones are two of the biggest examples of why despite United supporters (although maybe I'm being unfair and it's just the English) having high expectations, a lot of them simply have no standards to continue backing such average footballers. Both of them wouldn't even stand out playing for a mid-table side.

Ryan Shawcross (who for many is labelled a big reckless lump) does both their jobs without any of the hype.

2572~~~
Constant fluctuation of performances is worrying. Anyone saying he's always been shit or that he has been shit all season is wrong. He should still go after Jones and Evans, if at all. Very good third choice/second choice RCB to have.

2573~~~
Depends what you want from a defender. For a club like Manchester United, he's shit.

For Stoke? Sure, make him Captain.

2574~~~
He was arguably MOTM against Sunderland not long ago. He has been inconsistent since he got back into the team (after being solid and then dropped for no reason). It's frustrating that he is being inconsistent, and it will put him under pressure to stay. He is still our best CB I think though.

2575~~~
He makes always amazing runs and then the final pass <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2576~~~
He's brilliant. I love his attitude.

2577~~~
Has definitely played a lot better today.

2578~~~
Been brilliant, has won every battle vs Kane.

2579~~~
He's bossing Kane.

2580~~~
He keeps on shifting between Smalling-bauer and Smalling-bramble.

Our best defender at any rate.

2581~~~
It seems like Spurs are just letting him dribble three players on the trot, knowing that he'll never create anything anyway.

That being said, defensively he's been a rock. Kane and Eriksen have been completely invisible.

2582~~~
Bullying Kane, but useless with the ball thus far

2583~~~
After those dribbles he just has to give the ball to players who are wide and not try to make that killer pass.

2584~~~
The 70 yards crossfield pass to Young which probably touched God on its way was a thing of beauty though.

2585~~~
I'll take that combinations from my central defender to be honest <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> he's been absolutely sensational today, although if Kane ever works out he can start playing off Jones we might be in slight trouble.

2586~~~
I can't love him more. Great at man marking, and his long pass is getting better.

2587~~~
Can we send him for a summer camp to Barca? They'll teach him how to pass. He has all the tools.

2588~~~
Brilliant player <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2589~~~
Hes been fine on the ball.

Pin point pass to Young for a great chance.
Tanked through the spurs midfield but fecked up a tough through ball pretty bad.

And a few other drives and miss placed passes, but only the last one was bad as it was in a bad position and we couldve been caught out.

2590~~~
BigChrisPlusOne, boys.

2591~~~
I love that he's been marauding forward with the ball at his feet, he's not perfect at it but at least he attempts it and will only improve.

2592~~~
Him and Jones have made mistakes and questionable decisions/passes with the ball. But the great thing is seeing both of them so confident. Especially Smalling who is just running like an African gazelle everytime there is space.

Confidence boost for both of them especially with tough matches ahead.

I still maintain that him and Jones are the future of the club and should not be sold at any cost.

2593~~~
Best defender we've got when it comes to taking the ball out of defence at his feet. If he brushes up on his passes Smalling could become a big plus for our build up play.

2594~~~
Defended much better than Jones and the driving runs are nice and all but his passing is shit.

2595~~~
Has Kane in his backpocket.

2596~~~
It was a crying shame to see him playing at RB, but if it's added anything to his game, it's the confidence to carry the ball forward into the opposition half, much like Ferdinand did. 

As with almost all CBs, he gets a nosebleed, but great to see none the less.

2597~~~
Van Gaal is the summer camp.

2598~~~
This.

2599~~~
The change of mood in this thread between the arsenal game to now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2600~~~
Impressive again.

2601~~~
The gimps that were criticising him have gone into hiding. He's great, if he could guarantee us 40 starts next season I'd only buy one LCB and a RB.

2602~~~
Marked the leagues in-form striker out of the game. Quite easily, I might add.

2603~~~
I've always been ChrisPlusOne, it's just so easy to find a scapegoat like him.He absolutely bossed the most in form striker in the premier league today.

2604~~~
Indeed, he continues to grow. At <b>centreback</b>. Where he should have been playing for the last 4 years.

2605~~~
Had an excellent game today. His passing is very erratic, but made some good runs forward and did his job incredibly well defensively.

2606~~~
His prior mismanagement has been a crime.

Another very good display. Three league clean sheets off the belt with him at the back?

2607~~~
Kept Kane in his pocket. Was a colossus for us.

2608~~~
Look at how comfortable he looked on the ball this match. Playing as a RB helped him become a better CB.

2609~~~
Harry who? another commanding performance.

2610~~~
When a ball is punted into our box and then just gets cleared about 30 yards, you always knows it's him who's decided to to beast every single other player in the box to get his head on to it.

Complete defender.

2611~~~
It really hasn't. It just set him back about two footballing years in development terms.

2612~~~
I want to see him pass better and defend like this for a couple of months before I get on a bandwagon as we've had these games before from him followed by brainfart games.

2613~~~
This. We've tried our best to ruin by far the most talented English CB around. Its just a testament to his own talent that he is still such an accomplished defender.

2614~~~
Kane was well and truly in his pocket today. Didn't get a sniff. Liked his "attack-the-space" runs too. Pulled off some lovely passes, while also misplacing a few. 

Good performance for him - hopefully he can build on it now. Definitely seems the type of player who needs confidence to play well.

2615~~~
Someone needs to send a search party for Harry Kane. Reports indicate he was last seen in Chris Smalling's pocket.

2616~~~
This.

2617~~~
He's our best CB. Its just that he has his bad moments and people just forget the good bits till then.

2618~~~
Boss

2619~~~
Yep, consistency is a big issue. He has games where he can look like an incredibly solid CB, but then look like someone who's no more than a squad player for us. He was good on the ball today when he was running with it, but not so much with his passing of it.

2620~~~
What would have been the alternative? He would have spent a lot more time on the bench if he only played CB. And there is a lot of quality CBs who also played a bit of RB in the early portion of their careers.

2621~~~
Very good performance but got too excited a couple of times with his runs and passing. Other than that a wonderful performance

2622~~~
Exactly, I can't get excited about him and Jones until we see the performances become the common place we expect and the errors fade to a bare minimum.

2623~~~
I'd say I'm a lot more convinced about Smalling than Jones personally since Smalling probably is our best centre back at the moment, but even that's not much of a compliment.

2624~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2625~~~
I can't believe there are people who refuse to see the fecking obvious. Smalling is our best CB by a huge distance!

2626~~~
Might be a bit harsh from him, although I don't think it'd be ridiculous to say he's not had a particularly great season.

2627~~~
He's clearly had a good one, following up on a good one the season before

2628~~~
Overall? Meh, he's been okay. The strongest centre back in what's often been a dodgy defence. Put in some very good performances at times, but had plenty of poor ones too.

2629~~~
I do. He's got better and better as the season's gone on and is looking more and more comfortable on the ball too. I genuinely think he'd be talked about as one of the best centre backs in the league if he could stay full for a full season.

2630~~~
He's now attacking space with the ball at his feet. I've always said this about the guy,when composed he can be so damn good.

2631~~~
Dropping a clearly unfit Ferdinand that could no longer head the ball or travel the length of the field to compete for a corner. Smalling was brutally mismanaged and it's a crying shame.

2632~~~
He's looking more and more comfortable controlling the ball, although his passing on it's still not great.

2633~~~
He's had a couple of off games this season for sure, but he's been impressive defensively and the standout in a defence that has conceeded less than City, Liverpool and Arsenal. Only Southampton and Chelsea are letting in less

2634~~~
Newbie in the match day thread. Don't know how legit it is, but I don't really find it hard to believe. I can barely remember anyone getting past him one v one, even at RB.

2635~~~
He can be a boss, I like Smalling. He's our only CB I feel confident will not be physically dominated by any striker in the PL. He still has the capacity to make silly mistakes every now and then, but, he's very good.

2636~~~
I think most would agree though that De Gea has been the primary reason for our defensive record due to how good he's been. Not that Smalling hasn't had an okay season, but I think there's a little bit of a kneejerk reaction here at the moment because he's off the back of a very god performance. Just a little bit, though.

2637~~~
Another great performance by Chris. Dominant in the air, composed on the ball, pass it well, drove out with the ball. Simply superb. Had Kane in his pocket. Him and Jones seem to compliment each other.

2638~~~
True, but it's definitely getting better. He's played off a few great long balls in recent weeks. Still needs to work on the weight of his passing but I'm confident that will come with more game time.

2639~~~
He's the type of player who's confidence grows during the match. If we start dominant, he nurtures into the role nicely.

2640~~~
Yeah, hopefully. I think he's always been the most promising out of Jones, himself, and Evans to be fair.

2641~~~
Of course De Gea has been the best, but every other team mentioned has one player thats clearly performed better than the rest. It doesnt mean his teammates are garbage. De Gea is on a level of his own, but Smalling is head and shoulders above the rest. And De Gea would have conceeded a lot more if he didnt have Smalling helping him out too

2642~~~
Our best CB by a mile as I have been saying for the past 2 years.....check my old posts. If he could just improve his passing a bit more then he could be one of the best Centre backs in the league. Im just not sure who should partner him, at the moment it has to be Rojo.

2643~~~
Again, while it's true, it's not much of a compliment when you look at our centre backs this season at times.

2644~~~
Tremendous athleticism and speed but those wayward passes reminded me of Bebe's crossing

2645~~~
The thing I really liked about him today was the willingnes to take one or two touches and pass/move forward instead of taking a safer option. Helped the tempo of the game a lot.

2646~~~
While all our Cbs have looked a bit nervous this season at some point, they haven't been that bad overall. The main problem has been careless/self inflicted errors from Jones, Rojo and Evans and of course Smalling's sending off against City. If they were just more careful and those errors hadnt happened, we wouldnt look half as nervous at the back. The bulk of the defending, mostly from Smalling but also from Rojo and some from Jones has been quite good. Its just that good work is undone with a pass to an opposing striker

I remember before Vidic came we used to have a lot of individual errors in the backline from Brown, Silvestre and Neville too

2647~~~
He's the less rash of the two and the better in one on ones, but both worry me positionally and in possession.

2648~~~
Smalling's positioning is good

2649~~~
That's more like the performance I expect from him.

2650~~~
Still surprised plenty think that Jones is the better defender. Seen a few post-game tweets slagging off Smalling, even after he put in a very solid game today. I think many have just decided they don't like him, and that's that.

He seems to be hindered by a reputation, possibly from being a fairly sub-standard right back for the past 3 years or so. Apart from the City game, I don't really think Smalling has done much wrong this season. Some fairly average performances in a constantly rotating starting 11 and an ever changing formation, where the whole team was playing a very negative brand of football; but a great deal of solid individual displays within that, especially more recently. 

I'm a fan of Jones as well. I think he's a great tackler and I like his tenacity, but he's calamitous and really needs to compose himself, especially positionally. Right now, Smalling is a much better defender. Severely underrated outside of this forum, IMO. After the round of fixtures where we beat Burnley, he was given the highest rating of every player in the league that week on whoscored.com (Obviously bolstered by scoring 2 goals, unusual in itself for a centre back). The response to it was as if Chris Smalling had raped the mother of every opposing fan in the country. How could Smalling, of all people, be the pick of the week?

Good player. Still far from perfect, but if he can keep putting in performances like today, he could be one of the best in the league.

2651~~~
Expect he hasn't been poor at all.

2652~~~
Well I simply disagree. His sending off against City genuinely made me question his IQ and I have watched him put in many shaky performances this season (in my opinion, I guess).

As I said though, much improved today and his best performance this season (and possibly since he's been at the club in my memory).

2653~~~
He played well today, good to see, hopefully he can build on it.

2654~~~
His passing and close control with the ball at his feet have really come on this season.

2655~~~
His passing is shocking.

2656~~~
Beast of a defend but an absolute calamity with the ball at his feet. In an era where pressing the defenders is used an abused, he's an accident waiting to happen.

2657~~~
A rash tackle is a testament to a low IQ? That makes most footballers idiots on so many levels then. Amazing post that is; unfortunately, amazingly bad.

2658~~~
Look at when he darts forward with the ball; our attackers look glued to the pitch as if waiting to see "how far can he go" - a bit reminiscent to watching Valencia two years back. That pass to Young was terrible, but not much worse than some of what our midfielders did today. His passing IS much improved, even if he still has some way to go still.

2659~~~
It's just another one of those mindless arguments about him. There have been so, so many over the last couple of seasons; he's slow, he's poor in the air, poor one on one, poor positionally, poor tackler etc etc. In terms of defending, the only thing I want to see him improve on is his ability to sometimes be caught ball watching. He obviously still needs to work on his technique and his passing, but it's far from poor.

2660~~~
It's his consistency for me !
Iffy on Monday against arsenals pace but superb today against Kane .
I think carrick helps him a lot

2661~~~
A couple at best

2662~~~
I guess in your opinion Rooney's sending off against West Ham has you questioning his IQ as well

2663~~~
Great dominant performance. Handled Kane with ease and showed glimpses of good passing. I actually think one more pre-season under van Gaal could elevate him. He just has to continue working on his passing and decision making with the ball, and after a summer of doing that I think he'll be brilliant.

2664~~~
Really liked how positive he was with the ball at his feet today. Lost count of the number of times he surged forward with it and totally threw off the oppositions structure. Hopefully we see more of that from him. Though would be nice if he was able to pass the ball properly after doing so <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2665~~~
He and Jones clearly had instructions to surge forward with the ball, they were both really positive and played well today.

2666~~~
Centerbacks surging forward are a key component of LvG's philosophy. It forces the opposition out of shape because of the extra man.

Anyways, I thought this was one of Smalling's better performances. He played well and rarely made mistakes and even added surging runs forward to his forte. Unfortunately, most of the time, he either overhit all his long passes or wound up dispossessed. That's something he still needs to work on if he wants to be a van Gaal defender, I guess.

Well it's still good that he has been adding new facets to his game. I've always said that Smalling has all the potential to be a monster defender. A new Jaap Stam. Tall, fast, strong. My main frustration with him has been his inconsistency. He has a tendency of switching off during games where he just doesn't think or anticipate the the flow of the game at all. That has led to mistakes over the years, but if he can cut those mistakes out, like in the last game against spurs, we can all see what his true potential is.

The hallmark of top class defenders have always been how rarely they made mistakes. Ferdinand rarely made mistakes in his prime. I've been hoping, for the last 3 - 4 years that Smalling will finally come of age and at least come close to that level of rarity of mistakes. Hopefully that time will come.

2667~~~
He was very good but I don't want to get excited over both him and Jones because you know theyre still both an accident waiting to happen.

2668~~~
Seeing as Kane scores a hat-trick today and has pretty much been the in-form player lately, I think it speaks volumes about Smalling's game against Tottenham and Kane in particular. He had him in his back pocket the entire match. Jones also had him under control, but Smalling was immense. Hopefully he can keep up that form against Liverpool.

2669~~~
He was great, but I think the whole team did well to restrict Spurs from feeding Kane any chances. Kane was completely invisible until the 89th minute.

2670~~~
Smalling just needs to stay fit for a few months to get some momentum. If he stays fit then he can be a solution to our center back search. Don't really care if he is not passing like Beckenbauer, what i want him to do is continue to defend well, read the game and position himself correctly, because at the end of the day, he is a defender and his job is to stop goals being conceded.

2671~~~
I agree I also want him to become more of a leader at the back but that comes with confidence and momentum as you said.

2672~~~
True, but they had several encounters, but Smalling won every single one of them, be it in the air or on the ground. He was immense, and it is the first time I've heard the Norwegian pundits giving him some proper praise, which was about time.

2673~~~
Him and Jones have done a decent job so far. Having Carrick back is making it a whole lot easier for them.

Im sure they will still make mistakes but anybody doubting their talent is crazy. Both are here to stay for the long run hopefully.

2674~~~
That one long ball out to Young was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2675~~~
Yes! Great to see him confident again. I thought he would sink into oblivion after the red card incident.

He has a future at this club. No doubt about it.

2676~~~
want to wait until the game is finished but cannot help, he has been super confident on the ball over the last 2 games. what LVG has done to him?

2677~~~
Another great game from him, I thought.

2678~~~
Excellent performance from him- where Jones had a bit of crazed maniac feel about him, Smalling was cool, calm and absolutely dominant.

2679~~~
Imperious. Born to defend.

2680~~~
Colossus back there, won all his one on ones and even had a couple of drives up field.

2681~~~
He didnt really catch my eye, I think that means he's solid.

2682~~~
If him and Jones actually had ONE injury free season we might win some trophies.

Great partnership in the making. Jones is slightly behind in reading the game but Smalling is showing maturity over the last few weeks.

2683~~~
I love that both Smalling and Jones got Balotelli to lose his cool.

2684~~~
Epic performance. His physicality and anticipation have really improved under LvG.

2685~~~
Hugely impressed. He's been an absolute beast at the back for a while now.

2686~~~
Great performacne and would of backed him to beat the shit out of Ballotelli.

2687~~~
Solid - has been the entire season barring that one moment of madness against City.

2688~~~
Excellent performance, kept his head and showed surprisingly no signs of nervousness.

2689~~~
Smalling has improved drastically throughout the season. Not only is he positioning himself better defensively, but he has improved a lot on the ball too. I must admit I never tought that would happen. I have a lot of faith in him and Rojo. Smalling needs to stay injury free or he will go back to his previous level.

2690~~~
Brilliant again today. People were actually wishing he was sold a while back too.

2691~~~
Big Chris at it

2692~~~
What's with the newly-acquired Messi runs from the back? He's actually quite decent at them.

2693~~~
Yet another great performance from him. Comfortably our best CB.

2694~~~
Great performance in big game, I guess this is what we asked from him.. Stay fit and confident, Chris and you could be the best center back in the league

2695~~~
He's doing a very good job. I still think that we need an another defender, but Smalling is doing well. Hopefully, he makes a good partnership with Rojo in the next 8 matches.

2696~~~
#Smalling+Jones

2697~~~
Our best defender tonight imo. Kept his calm in every situation and was always there when it counted. 

His dribbling in the second half I think surprised everyone including his own team mates who just seemed to stand there and watch like "wtf is going on with this guy?" <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2698~~~
Yeah let us stick with that partnership until injury breaks it up. Our defense has looked as solid as it had all season these last two matches.

2699~~~
Solid...Again

2700~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Reminds me of Phil Neville doing the stepovers and everyone laughing at him.

2701~~~
Must be a nightmare to play against on this kind of form.

Can see why Balotelli was getting so wound up. He knew he wasn't getting anything.

2702~~~
You can see why Michael Owen rates him as the best centre back he trained with while he was here.

He has absolutely everything needed to dominate teams. Immense today. He looks so assured when defending compared to Jones, who gives me the yips whenever he goes anywhere near the ball.

He seems to have tried to develop his passing. He played some fantastic long range sweeping passes today.

2703~~~
Love him. I genuinely don't think he's put a foot wrong since that calamity of a display against City. He makes slight positional and marking errors on occasions which all defenders do every game, but he's just so incredibly solid overall. I never felt nervous seeing quick, powerful players like Sturridge, Balotelli and Sterling running at him. He kept managing to show them away from goal, and he always seems to win the kick-and-chase race. Physically he is perfect. Enormous presence, but blistering quick. Severely underrated, even amongst United fans. I don't think I know anyone outside of the caf who doesn't think he's useless. Those godawful RB performances have really given him a lasting reputation.

2704~~~
So did Danny Welbeck.

2705~~~
Smalling has clearly grown in confidence over the last few weeks. His long passing has improved and he is even charging out of defence with the ball - and doing it sureprisingly well. He even got a couple of goals a few weeks back.

2706~~~
Smalling's looking like the player he was a few years ago. Couldn't have happened at a better time either.

2707~~~
He was never even that bad there. Defensively, he was still among the best. See the home against Arsenal last season where he single handedly shut down that right hand side and completely took Cazorla out of the game. He's just a classy defender.

2708~~~
He must be a strikers nightmare when on form. He's rapid, strong, great in the air and good at reading what an opponent is gonna do. One of the first names on the team sheet for me.

2709~~~
Another good performance from him. He really is hard to beat in one on one situations and he's only going to become a more rounded defender. His surging runs forward are class but sometimes just gets the ball caught under his feet which can be dangerous in the wrong part of the field.

2710~~~
And he served Welbeck up for pace just to remind him <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2711~~~
Defensively he was decent. Solid in one-on-ones as always. I think his passing and moving with the ball has improved massively, quite probably from being exposed to playing at right back. He often did look horribly clumsy out there though. I do remember some pretty naff performances from him out there. Hard to blame him completely, as it's just not his position anyway. Very glad Van Gaal is not even considering him out there, so it seems.

2712~~~
I always feel it was really detrimental to both Smalling and Jones being played at RB so much. I don't think it is any coincidence that now they are finally getting a run of games at CB (and staying fit) that they are both playing at a much higher level (although I am still not entirely convinced by Jones).

2713~~~
Hopefully, Smallingbauer keeps up this great form. He definitely has a future here.

2714~~~
Pulled out another pinpoint 40 yard pass again today!

2715~~~
Chris Smalling has earned a place on the team next season, never been a fan tbh......i am now

2716~~~
Epic determination. His arc this season amazing.

From dressing like Bin Laden to being a pillar of defense... perhaps an unquestionable leader of formation someday.

2717~~~
He is getting better and has improved this season. I think he's now ahead of Jones in terms of development.

2718~~~
Just a matter of time to prove what a good player he is. He just needed to stay fit and played in his proper position. SMH at posters who even now suggest that we get rid of him. Clearly the best defender we have at the club at the moment. I really like his partnership with Jones right now, hope we continue with that partnership as long as they both stay fit.

2719~~~
Tremendous again <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2720~~~
Yeah it startles me when you see people talking about how we should be signing some new young CB prospect just because they look solid in the Dutch league (for example). 

I expect we will sign a new CB, but it needs to be a proven, world class established player, otherwise just stick with what we have.

2721~~~
He's turning into some player. Makes it a bit easier for LvG to focus his transfer priorities elsewhere.

2722~~~
He doesn't need replacing at all. Unbelievable defender, one of the best in my opinion. He's a tough, no nonsense centre half and I have immense faith in him long term.

2723~~~
That's always been the case. He always looked a level above him for the England U-21s and he's just far more talented. Doesn't mean Jones can't/isn't a good player though. Smalling's size, athletic ability coupled with his aptitude for defending is unique.

2724~~~
Honestly don't mind a experienced center back or a great young prospect, but not at the expense of Smalling.

2725~~~
If the team is set up with options for him to distribute then he is quite good already.

2726~~~
You don't mess with The Smalling
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/ajImdg0.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/ajImdg0.jpg"/>

2727~~~
As I said in the match thread, Smalling would wreck him.

2728~~~
Balotelli to fans: "HOLD ME BACK BROS!"

2729~~~
Been class recently and again today. Needs to take up yoga with Jones if he hasn't already. He needs to stay fit.

2730~~~
Welbeck, Kane and now Sturridge/Balotelli. Hope he's got enough pockets. What a boss! Great performance by Smalling.

2731~~~
I think in terms of talent Jones is better but talent only gets you so far hard work is also required too. I agree with you about Smalling, you can see he clearly loves defending which is great.

2732~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I wish they hadn't, maybe Mario would have done something stupid to get sent off.

2733~~~
Yeah I was hoping for that too. I felt safe with Smalling in that situation that he wouldn't do anything stupid. If it had been Balotelli vs Jones or Rojo though I would have been a bit worried <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2734~~~
But, Smalling might have been sent off as well if it escalated and we need him a lot more than Liverpool need Balotell

2735~~~
Smalling doesn't like the type to lose himself and do something silly. Balotelli was already on a yellow at that point wasn't he ?

2736~~~
Our best CB by a mile as ive been saying for the past 2 years. I still actually think LVG may go for Jones and Rojo when all fully fit though which would be completely the wrong thing to do.

2737~~~
What was that about?

2738~~~
He's a beast. Wish he wasn't so injury prone. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2739~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OYIJz0Zh0LO/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2740~~~
He is starting to regularly hit some good long balls now too.

2741~~~
Jones wouldn't hurt a fly.

2742~~~
Intentionally.

2743~~~
Glad to see he is finally getting the praise he deserves. He's not and never has been the problem

There's space for someone top class next to him and whoever that is, they'll greatly appreciate the support Smalling gives them defensively and with his pace.

Was nice to see Balotelli bouncing off him as well. Both Smalling and Jones are looking more powerful in their physical battles

2744~~~
Hes also building confidence in terms of running out with the ball into the space. Started last match and hes picking out some good passes. Long may that continue (something Rio offered when he first joined us). Smalling on the defensive side looked solid as ever and I never thought we would concede from a cross or a long ball near the end due to him being there (helped we also have Jones and Fellaini who are strong in the air)

2745~~~
Haha, Balotelli is such a twat.

2746~~~
Here here.

He's been made the fall guy too often over the last few seasons, due to some incredibly fickle fans. He's certainly been guilty of a few brain farts, but how many defenders aren't? His defensive game is supreme.

My only gripes with him are his ability on the ball (which by the way, is <i>nowhere near</i> as bad as some on here would say - but it is often rash) and his injury record.

2747~~~
vine's good but the picture's great <a class="externalLink" href="http://goo.gl/hMOxY0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/hMOxY0</a>

2748~~~
Showing some of that form going forward that he showed when he was ripping teams like City apart at RB in his first season. I still remember him canning City down the right in the charity shield match.

2749~~~
Yup, noticed that recently. Definitely worked on that in the last few weeks. In truth, he's a good defender. Don't think he'll be leaving in the summer anyway.

2750~~~
He's definitely a favorite of mine - so happy to see him assert himself in the team.

2751~~~
Love it. The sort of passion we've missed at times this season. Big Chris just needs to stay fit and there'll be no looking back.

2752~~~
playing like a center half isn't he.

2753~~~
I love Smalling, one of my favourite players, and I thought he was good. However I think he was poor for the Lallana chance which could have been a goal.

2754~~~
#SmallingPlusOne - this season and beyond. Is England's best for my money, and fitness permitting, can establish himself as the best in the league by next season if allowed to just continue playing.

2755~~~
He has the Ferdinand knack of being at the right place when defending balls into the box, be it headers or intercepting at the near post. Our most consistent defender and it has to be him plus another for me.

2756~~~
He's a beast isn't he? Reads the game absolutely well, makes crucial interceptions and dominates in the air. What more could one ask of a CB? The only thing he was terrible at was the passing and in general doing anything half decent with ball at his feet, but I must admit he's improved a lot on that too!

2757~~~
Dominant today, looked like the player we hoped he'd become when we first got him.

Just hope he stays fit now for the rest of the season and really nails down that first team spot.

2758~~~
Sorry but I don't care how good he is on the rare occasion he's not injured.

We can't rely on him.

Magnificent today but you just know in the next few games he'll be out again.

2759~~~
His injury record is overstated, in only one season here has he played less than 30 games. And that's without ever being first choice for us.

2760~~~
I know he does the mean and moody look but Balotelli always looks like a terrified kid when actually confronted.

2761~~~
He has been doing it for the better part of a month.  He no longer looks like a deer in headlights now that he has internalized what he is supposed to do when in possession.

He is looking imperious at the back now that he has seemingly come to grips with LVG's expectations for the position (interceptions>tackles).  I'm not sure if it is due to him playing as the more proactive center back in the pairing or if it is due to developing comfort with the system, but it is working very well.

2762~~~
He's been fabulous these last few matches. Please let him stay healthy!

2763~~~
That pass to Young where he nearly fell over was just too cool

2764~~~
Anyone else reckon he'll start for England now?

2765~~~
He should.  Him and John Terry would  have been ideal together.

2766~~~
Would be great for his confidence, just don't get injured Chris!

2767~~~
Smalling has come of age in this past month. These games against City and Chelsea could be defining moments for him and Jones in terms of cementing a partnership that will perhaps give LVG a bit of a re-think in the summer. In my opinion we will still need a top class centre back but with Rojo, McNair, Evans and Blackett as back up numbers wont be the issue - just the quality that might be questionable.

2768~~~
There's a small part of me that doesn't want him to start for England because he always seems to get injured when he plays for England <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2769~~~
I have been critical of him this season and don't think he has been nearly as good as a lot do reading over the last few pages but he was brilliant yesterday. So dominant and good on the ball, felt like I was watching Smalling of 2011. Just hope he can stay fit for the rest of the season now

2770~~~
Beast of a performance yesterday. Keep him fit and this is the level he should perform at week in week out.

2771~~~
Thought he was brilliant, one of the best CB displays Ive seen for a while in a Utd shirt. Really top class, lets hope that continues, looks like he did when first joined, committed, good positioning, great decision making. I like also the fact he's trying to step out of defence even if not always executing his final ball well, but he beats the first man really well. He even hit 2 good switch of plays. 

Defensively though he was excellent. Hoping Jones can step up to match this. Thought Jones was alright just looked a little rash still, i.e the yellow, few fouls, nutmeg, deflection getting beat to easy. But he had a good game in other aspects.

2772~~~
I still can't quite get over how underrated this guy is, especially by opposition fans. I remember last week having a discussion with my friends and they were all saying that he is our worst CB, that Jones, Evans and Rojo are all better than him.

2773~~~
I've had that experience too. I think fans of other clubs view him as an O'Shea type utility player because of all the games he spent at right back. When in reality he is a a pure centre back and should have been played there far more often. 

It reminds me of Carragher when he was a young defender always being played at left back. I thought he was as average as they come and couldn't understand why Liverpool fans rated him. It was only when he played his natural position full time that I realised they were right and he was a very good player.

2774~~~
In his last two games, Smalling has played against both Kane and Sturridge - two of England's strikers - and gave them pretty much nothing... yet (other) people will still question his inclusion in the England squad... it's daft.

2775~~~
Defensively he doesn't have any real weaknesses, his positioning has improved massively, he's an absolute monster in the air and is incredibly quick for a centre back, when's he's one on one he just doesn't get beat. His obvious weakness has been on the ball but whatever LVG and his team has done to his confidence is really showing now. He seems so much more confident on the ball now because he's realised if his passing avenues have been cut off he's more than capable of stepping forward with the ball without fecking it up.

2776~~~
That has definitely been the biggest addition to his game that I have noticed recently (stepping out with the ball). The last few games he has had a habit of making drives forwards with the ball, and normally he is actually quite successful.

I think Smalling's technique and ability is quite underrated. There is one particular moment I remember which was a couple of years ago when he played for England, he received the ball from the GK (I think) and was facing our own goal, with two opponents charging him down from behind. He did the most beautiful cruyff turn between the two attackers just as they got near him, completely skinned the pair of them. It was fantastic to watch but I have never seen the clip since <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2777~~~
Been amazing of late. Hes actually fast as feck for a lad his size, and also has that cool composure that separates the really good ones from your run of the mill bruiser. If he can stay injury free he might become the new Rio <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2778~~~
Get him a top class partner. Jones is his backup/competition (and can develop at his own rate) while Rojo is the LCB backup/competition (and likewise can develop with less pressure). 

He has enormous potential I really think there's a personality factor involved though. You get the feeling he's a bit of an introvert compared to Rio and while Rio had this swagger and arrogant confidence naturally, you only see that in small moments with Chris. He does outrageous things occasionally, breaks down a seemingly certain goal with his pace and timing and then sprays it 40 yards. 

He just needs someone to keep bigging him up and making him believe he is as good as he is.

2779~~~
He's having to react less than used to.  Now he's reading the game and adjusting to situations before they are problems.  Much improved.

2780~~~
Our best centre back by a mile! Get him an experienced partner like a Hummels and we will have a very solid base.

2781~~~
hes been going forward, but then not sure what to do. The Arsenal match, I remember commenting, because he went into space the first half, then just booted it out of play and everybody in the stadium was like "WTF?".
Last game against Liverpool he drove forward twice which worried them which was great.

2782~~~
I'd have absolutely no problem going into next season with him as our first choice defender. I've been seeing all over that we need to replace 3 of our 4 first choice defenders, but it seems this narrative has been built on basically one game against Leicester and the fact that De Gea has been great.

Whilst De Gea has been great our defence as a unit has been one of the best in the league and Smalling is a key part of that. It's certainly not in need of the major surgery that is all over the tabloids and the subject of every pre-match pundit predicting a thumping (how many times have we heard "if they can get at the United defence, it's proven to be shaky" yet we haven't conceded more than 2 goals at any point except Leicester).

Fun fact: we've only conceded 2 or more goals in three Premier League games this season, two of which were before November (West Brom, Leicester & Swansea).

2783~~~
We've conceded 27 - 2 more than Chelsea, 1 less than City, 4 less than Arsenal and 5 less than Liverpool. We have the second best defensive recording league - only behind S'hampton who have done wonderfully and just conceded 21. The last 10 games we've conceded less than Chelsea too.

2784~~~
Exactly. The narrative seems to be that we'd have conceded 30% more times this season if not for De Gea. Whilst I accept he's had a great season the majority of his saves are ones that you'd expect one of the world's best keepers to make. 

The fact that Smalling & Rojo have been great overall; whilst Valencia, Jones and Shaw have looked pretty solid seems to get lost in the "dodgy defence" story line that's been perpetuated regardless of our results since the Leicester game.

I certainly don't think a back 4 containing any of Valencia, Smalling, Jones, Rojo & Shaw is any worse than the likes of City, Arsenal, Liverpool etc. It's one great player away from a very good back 4 in my opinion.

2785~~~
I think DDG has made plenty of excellent saves but the goalkeeper is part of the defense. We started off being shaky and since then the media has just gone with that story, not much to get upset about that is their job. Create the most dramatic angle on everything and repeat it until it is true. 

I think that an Smalling-Jones-Shaw makes for a great British back-bone for a great team and they will not peak in a few years yet. I would love for Rafael who is a homegrown to also succeed but his injuries seems to have got the best of him. If we upgrade Valencia with Clyne that would be a great business, four English defenders who has the potential to end up playing together for England and it would really promote English football. 

With Cleverley, Fletcher, Giggs, Ferdinand, Zaha and Welbeck gone and Carrick is at the very end of his career and Evans has been pushed down to reserve material we are left with almost no English/British players.

2786~~~
We brought in Mcnair, Blackett, Shaw and Wilson, though.

2787~~~
I thought he had a very very good game, but its becoming quite obvious that he needs someone experienced next to him, just to settle him down when things get a bit nervy. He has a tendency to panic when things start to go wrong, and he loses all composure. I'd love for us to bring in an experienced head and pair them together next season.

2788~~~
While our goals conceded maybe one one of the lowest, our defense has been quite shaky for a large part of the season. That's because of all the chopping and changing both of personnel and systems. Earlier, Rojo looked to be one of our more solid defenders, probably in large part due to playing most of the games and same goes with Valencia, solid for the most part. Smalling now having got a run of games is looking quite the defender. 

While outside of the club people might still question if Smalling is good enough, I think a lot of United fans have always thought he is a very gifted natural defender but, his fitness issues made many question if we should be depending on him long term. He's been colossal recently and cross fingers fitness woes are all in the past because he certainly be good enough for starting XI for United.

2789~~~
Don't think youth prospects are comparable to having home-grown or at least "national" first team starters. We had one more British starter than Real Madrid has Spanish starters, they had four Spanish substitutes as well while we had zero British substitutes. It doesn't look too great considering Carrick is soon gone and Young is likely to be replaced in the coming window. 

City/Chelsea had slightly less British players in the squad in the last game and being close to their proximity in those regards isn't positive.

2790~~~
Love his size and physicality. Looks to have progressed the most this season compared to Evans and Jones. Happy for him.

2791~~~
Smallingbauer

2792~~~
Fair to say our top 5 best individual CB displays have all come from Smalling?

1. Arsenal away
2. Hull home
3. Chelsea home
4. Spurs home
5. Liverpool away

Sunderland home might have been better than the Liverpool one. Rojo against Stoke home, McNair at West Ham home and Jones Sunderland away also deserve a shout.

2795~~~

2796~~~
Pretty much.

2797~~~

2798~~~
fecking Arsenal. We are not their feeder club.

2799~~~
Telegraph yesterday, The Times today. Hopefully we sort out his contract ASAP.

2800~~~
I don't want to rain all over the Smalling circle jerk but do you realise this thread just keeps going in cycles? Smalling wank fest after a couple of good displays followed by the "he's useless & will never learn" posters (me included) after his usual run of poor performances.
I'll hold my hands up if he puts in a good run of games between now & the end of the season & looks to have turned a corner but I still can't ever see him turning into a reliable defender.

2801~~~
Get it sorted, LouLou.

2802~~~

2803~~~
So the good run of games he's been on since City away don't count for anything for you?

2804~~~
They tried to sign him last summer as well during all the Vermaalen crap. Nothings changed since then, he is still by far the best CB at the club.

2805~~~
There's been as many bad or barely average performances since that City game as there has been good ones.

2806~~~
Bullshit.

2807~~~
I'd really like to see Jones and Smalling have a run of games together before I judge them. The fact that this has never happened till now is perhaps the heart of the problem.

2808~~~
You could go back through the thread for the last few months & find everyone moaning about him after games or if you prefer you can just ignore those & pretend he's been fantastic every game.

2809~~~
People tend to moan about his distribution as opposed to his defending. That's always been the case. The latter is very good.

Anyway, I'm glad it looks like we're going to keep him on. Great news.

2810~~~
We have threadmarks now, so let me indulge you.

Liverpool away: 'imperious', 'colossus', 'excellent'
Tottenham home: 'impressive again', 'great',
<b>Arsenal home: 'disappointing', 'not top class', 'good first half, bad second'</b>
Newcastle away: 'beast physically', 'real driving force... one of the first names on the team sheet', 'easily our best centre half'
Sunderland home: 'Another brilliant game', 'Absolute monster',
<b>Preston home: 'Expect better', 'uncomfortable'
Burnley home: 'Weird performance, two goals, dodgy first half, solid in the second', 'defensive errors',</b>
West Ham: Didn't play
Cambridge: 'Our best centre back', 'comfortable'
QPR: didn't play
Southampton home :'Excellent', 'Dominant as usual', 'great again'
Yeovil away: Very little discussion of him,
Stoke away: 'Decent', 'very solid', 'best of the three'
Tottenham away: 72nd minute sub
Southampton away: Injured
Stoke home: 'He's brilliant', 'class again', 'top drawer'
Hull home: 'Quality', 'Best defender this season, best defender last season', 'top performance'
Arsenal away: 'Best CB we have', 'quality', 'MOTM'
<b>City away: Got sent off, had a shocker. </b>
Chelsea home: 'MOTM', 'excellent game', 'good performance'

In bold are the the only times where the CAF has slated him post match, even Burnley and Arsenal at home that opinion wasn't universal. So, in 14 performances since City away he's received almost universal praise in 11 of those in a season where, until last week, the Caf was pretty much hysterical about absolutely everything. 

He's undoubtedly had a good season, even if you don't think so yourself your assertion that yours is an opinion shared by the majority on the Caf is simply wrong.

2811~~~
I did just that, thanks to threadmarks. I've selected a few comments which appear to be the general consensus from each Premier League game since that calamity against City, to the present day:


The praise for him is largely consistent. Not much moaning about his performances, even in games where we didn't play well.

EDIT: beaten to it by Ninjafletch, who is equally as sad as me.

2812~~~
fecks sake, if I realised someone else was going to do it too I would have saved my self the time, it took ages to go back! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2813~~~
Thanks both. It needed saying. Its ridiculous how much lazy criticism he finds himself on the end of. He's a good defender and has had an excellent season.

2814~~~
Excellent.

2815~~~
Classic Caftards.

2816~~~
In a space of two games he went from this to a terrific defender against Arsenal.

2817~~~
In fairness emotions run high during the derby, and he did f*ck the game up for us. He's been brilliant since then.

2818~~~
More the case he went <i>back</i> to being a terrific defender. So many people want to believe he turned some kind of corner after the City sending off, forgetting the fact he put in a top performance against Chelsea the week before. The sending off against City was dumb and completely out of character - his only sending off in his career so far. He's always been an excellent defender from his first season at the club. This season, he's taken his game up with his ball playing ability though.

2819~~~
The bit at the bottom hits the nail on the head. The quotes <b>you've selected</b> just go to show how much we've dropped our standards that average performances are heralded as "Quality", "absolute monster", "dominant as usual". The Stoke away game sums that up perfectly. He nearly cost us that game yet the quotes you've picked out are 'He's brilliant', 'class again', 'top drawer'.

2820~~~
I think he could be a top defender for us. I don't really rate him that highly at the minute, he's 25 going on 26 and I wouldn't have him on the list of 10 or 20 best defenders in Europe but he's definitely got the tools to be a very good player for us. Smalling will not be mentioned as one of the 5 best defenders in the world at any point in his career but not everyone has to be Ferdinand to play in defence for Manchester United, if he can be consistently as good as he's been recently then he deserves to be a starter for us and what we ought to look out for is a partner for him, although I think Rojo can be that. I still want us to bring another defender as Evans has been useless this season and we cannot cope with 3 defenders, out of whom two are very injury prone and one of them is very rash.

2821~~~
Been our best defender by far this season. Lad deserves a new contract & an extended run in the team. Not sure what your point is, but the lad has done very well in numerous games this season, that cannot be disputed.

2822~~~
I thought you might accuse me of cherry picking, it's the only defence you can fall back on, but unfortunately for you the threadmarks are there for everyone to see. Just admit that you don't speak for the Caf, even if you don't rate him, and move on.

2823~~~
How surprising that Arsenal are suddenly interested in him the moment he has two excellent games and seems to be forming a solid partnership with Jones..

But just weeks before that they were going on about how we need a whole new set of CB's especially since Jones and Smalling had failed to live up to their initial hype and need to be sold.

2824~~~
How is that ironic?

2825~~~
edited it, started off the sentence wanting to say something, ended up saying something else <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2826~~~
I don't speak for the cafe. I don't rate him. He's clueless & you're all bloody deluded. I'm right, you're all wrong.

2827~~~
I hope the Arsenal rumours are a load of rubbish. We need to get this guy signed on a new contract asap and he should be a mainstay in our defence with whoever LVG chooses to partner him with. Although it does worry me somewhat that when Smalling, Jones and Rojo have all been fit, LVG has always gone for Jones and Rojo as the pairing from what I remember, so maybe he doesn't rate Smalling that much. I hope his opinion has changed because Smalling is far better then both of them and should always start IMO.

2828~~~
Our need for a new CB is obvious and with the injury record we have amongst CB's I'd go with 5 players in the squad for 2 spots.

So with someone coming and Rojo 2 places are taken. Means 3 out of

Jones
Smalling
Evans
McNair
Blackett

I'd loan the 2 letter to a prem club and think Evans despite being the most experienced one has  been the weakest since SAF left.

2829~~~
He's been our best defender this season.

We missed him against West Ham and Swansea. Both teams looked dangerous from set pieces and I don't like Jones or Rojo as a pairing. Stick Smalling with one of them and it is fine.

2830~~~
His main weaknesses are that he's prone to injury (if you want to call that a 'weakness') and he has been poor with the ball.  His ball-handling skills, though, seem to have improved noticeably this season and maybe, just maybe, his injury problems will be solved with the changes LVG has made to the fitness program (demoting Strudwick, etc.).  In terms of pure defensive ability, I think he easily ranks with the top backs in the league.

Although this is what we've been hoping for years...

2831~~~
Hope he stays. Think he is the best of all our center backs, not that this is a hard task. We need to keep our English base in the squad. He's also our tallest center back, we need to keep height back there.

2832~~~
I think it's obvious that Smalling should be first choice at RCB, backed up by Jones. Then we need someone to compete with Rojo on the other side, which would give us the 4 CB's we need considering the injury record of the current 3 we have. Evans should be sold while he still has some value.

The big question is what CB do we buy. Do we buy a young player with massive potential who can compete with Rojo or buy a veteran to start right away.

2833~~~
Buy the best one available. Old or young doesn't matter.

2834~~~
He and Hummels would be ridiculous as a partnership.
The positional sense of the two would be a joy to watch

2835~~~
His defending is almost exemplary, apart from the odd lapse in positioning, which Jones, Rojo, Valencia and Shaw also get wrong quite a bit. He's ready to be take more responsibility - become automatic first choice at right centre back and the leader of the back line.  Looking forward to it.

2836~~~
He is an outstanding defender, and has had a handful of bad games in his 4-odd years here. We will struggle to improve upon him in the market this summer, and he should be a regular regardless of who we buy.

2837~~~
Crazy

2838~~~
Although there's still room for improvement, his decisions when in possession have improved be quite a margin this season. Let's hope it goes on.

2839~~~
I posted this in another thread and It basically sums up my hopes for Smalling...
in response to us signing an established finished product.

yeah I guess thats what going to happen but then Smalling and or Rojo/Jones spend the majority of time on the bench. This season we have the 3rd best defence in the league despite constant changes to it. We have conceded 2 more than Chelsea I believe who's back 4 hardly changes. Our defenders are still all relatively young players. I just think we could have rewarded their efforts this season (if we get top 4) with the chance to do even better together next year and naturally I'd expect them to be better. Thats not to say I wouldnt replace Evans....I would with John Stones or Varanne/Marquinhos if possible. I think we'd have a cracking group of young defenders and keeper with that approach for the next 7-8 years. But anyway I can see the appeal of a Hummels also I just dont see much point in all the chances we have given these young lads to lose faith when they are actually starting to justify it.

2840~~~
Lay off the Margaritas, mate!

2841~~~
That guy is deluded af.

2842~~~
He's amazing with dealing with tricky dribblers.

2843~~~
I agree with you but most won't. Another player who we over-rate like mad on the caf. 

If any other side attempting to challenge for the league had a centre half as poor on the ball starting regularly for them we'd mock them big time.

Smalling is good defender, but isn't a good footballer. Watch someone come in and post a lot of stats and other nonsense, but watch him with the ball at his feet when someone presses him. Panicks.

That's what let's him down majorly. Otherwise he'd be great. I just don't think you can get away with that.

2844~~~
I think his talent ceiling is extremely high. I mean, our biggest qualm was he couldn't pass to save his life and he's improved on that massively. Not just the last couple of games but it has been clear for some time now. His confidence must by pretty high right now. I don't think he can 'just be a player for us' like many claim but I see him as a potential star. The way he improved his on the ball skills scares me.

And don't forget he lacks the football education Jones or Evans possess. Van Gaal was the best manager he could get atm for he values features that Smalling lacked and already improved on. There were never question marks over his defending.

2845~~~
He was our passing defender at Anfield in a game we dominated and were as comfortable in possession as ever. If you were talking about pre-LvG Smalling then you'd be right.

2846~~~
Even last match he had some bad giveaways. I am happy with his recent form but, passing still is not a strong suit of his.

2847~~~
It's not his biggest strength but you couldn't watch him the last few games and say that he's a calamity waiting to happen on the ball in recent games. That's a good platform to build upon. Granted he's not Rio but I can't say his passing vs Spurs and Liverpool was worse than Nemanja's for starters.

2848~~~
you actually watch some games right? Or you stick to these nonsense statements like Smalling's still 21. He developed his passing game quite well. He can make those surging runs through the middle carrying the ball from the defense really well and doesn't look like shitting his pants at all. He usually does one or two great cross field passes per game, he's not hoofer of the ball either.

 There is one think about Smalling he just looks quite clumsy at times and his first touch is not always perfect but apart that he's brilliant with the ball let alone he's the best defender in the team..  <b>Just because he doesn't look elegant like Carrick with the ball doesn't make him being shit with it.</b> These dull misjudgements will never end I guess. It's like saying Rafael's still rash just because his game is set on aggressiveness. 

They will never get rid of their sticks for some people just because those people are too lazy to change their opinion or actually watch them play and use their brain judging them.

2849~~~
I'd say that his passing has been scrutinized even more so because he hasn't had the company of a great ball-playing cb like Rio. He's in this case unfortunate compared to Nemanja. Evans would be that guy had he developed the way we wanted. Now if we have Smalling and Jones who're both hit and miss, pretty hot-headed with the ball at their feet it's more visible.

2850~~~
If he goes to Arsenal I will be crushed. Get the contract sorted! He's our best CB.

2851~~~
Never lost faith in him. If he can stay fit he's got incredible potential. I've argued with posters in the past about referring to a 25-year-old's 'potential', but he's still got relatively few hours on the clock. It's all about staying fit.

2852~~~
No way should we be letting this guy go. Smallings only real weakness is his passing and sometimes he looks a little panicky on the ball; Now im not in any way saying Smalling is up to Vidic standards yet but Vidic was utterly shocking with the ball at his feet at times, his passing was poor, along with his lack of pace and every now and then getting torn apart by certain pacey strikers and getting sent off etc. But he was forgiven for this because he was suck a rock and a beast at every other aspect of the game. Smalling can be the same, athletically, in the air, winning the ball against pacey tricky players, I haven't seen many better recently and he is improving with every game. As with Vidic I think Smalling's sometimes erratic/poor passing can be forgiven unless its really causing us problems which I don't think it is and he is improving that aspect of his game all the time. We all talk about his poor passing or being poor on the ball but when do we ever really see him get us into trouble or lose the ball in a dangerous position? If he ever does lose the ball or misplace a pass its usually from when he has driven forward into the oppositions half looking for an attacking pass.

The more he plays the more composed he will become, he has all the qualities to be the best CB in the league in the next few years IMO.

2853~~~
I wouldn't trade him for another centre back in the league.

2854~~~
Smalling's only problem for me is his fitness. If he stays fit he's a beast of a CB.

2855~~~
Same. He's only 25 and still has a lot of upside to improve further. If so, we will have quite the player on our hands.

2856~~~
The fastest player Fellaini has played for and against, apparently? Odd, I'm sure he must have played with and against Valencia and Hernandez and ADM. Or maybe Smalling is just really fast? (Caption to the 3rd pic<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2857~~~
Usual run of bad performances? When? Only knock on him has been his injury issues. His performances for the most part have been pretty good to very good. Like most young defenders he's had his bad moments but, they've not been that often and more and more you can see him growing into a top CB.

2858~~~
our best CB.

2859~~~
Don't forget he was playing at non-league Maidenstone until he was about 18 as well. So he hasn't even had the 'upbringing' in a proper academy that most players benefit from. In that sense, I always  think of him as a 'young 25'.

2860~~~

2861~~~
3 who arent better at all, one who would cost his fairly extortionate buy out clause and another who Arsènal have no chances of getting? Right...

2862~~~
Terrible, terrible article - and I normally dont mind Bleacher Report.

Umtiti is completely unproven at a decent level and I expect would just become another average defender like a Sakho, Squillaci, Mangala, Nastasic etc.
Stones is a great option, but £8.8m? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Everton will be wanting £30m for him I would expect.
Varane is a decent shout but would be very expensive and by no means the finished product yet. Untested in the PL, which for a CB can be a big factor.
Hector Moreno im afraid to say I havent heard of, but he is too old to be considered 'one for the future', and hasnt played at a particularly high level yet which should say something.
For Laporte, see Varane.

2863~~~
Untested in the PL isn't a great reason not to sign someone, at what point do you "test" someone?

I think Hummels is our best option. I do think he's overrated, but he's good on the ball and he plays on the left side which is ideal. For me, Hummels LCB with Jones and Smalling competing for the other spot would be a healthy position for us to be in with our centre halves.

2864~~~
Umtiti is actually pretty good. If we sign a left footed CB he would be my second choice to Laporte.

2865~~~
Welbeck said the same, and so did WIlson

2866~~~
Bleacher Report will publish anything. It's the platform of last resort for people who can barely string two sentences together but who nevertheless mistakenly think that people care about what they say. This particular writer has managed to somehow not figure out that transfermarkt prices are only values, not what the club will sell at. Use value rather than exchange value.

2867~~~
Manchester United are prepared to reject a £12m offer from Arsenal for 25-year-old defender Chris Smalling. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-reject-arsenal-smalling-8927425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(Manchester Evening News)</a>
From BBC Gossip Column, and of course to be taken with a fistful of salt. They've also got another golden nugget, where we're bringing Ronaldo back home.

Another link to Arsenal though. What's the status of his current contract?

2868~~~
One year left at the end of the season I think.

2869~~~
wtf with this smalling and arsenal link? every transfer window there will be news about arsenal making a bid for him.

2870~~~
Wenger is a big fan. He wanted him back when he was at Fulham too.

2871~~~
Havent Arsenal already tried unsuccessfully to sign him last summer?

or was that just the rumour mill at it again?

2872~~~
owh i see. unlikely that we are going to sell our best CB now. hope we just sort out his contract as soon as possible.

2873~~~
I believe they asked for him in an exchange for Vermaalen. Imagine if we actually went through with it...

2874~~~
Oh the irony.

2875~~~
that was a real joke. 10 million + smalling for vermaelan if i am not mistaken?

2876~~~
we dodged a bullet there

2877~~~
It would be pure madness to sell Smalling. Defensively, he has no real weakness barring the odd mistake any  defender can make. He's strong, quick, reads the game well, and is a good tackler. He's well worth sticking with till he becomes less injury prone.

2878~~~
We need to sort the deal asap. I don't think we would want to sell him, but who knows if he may want to go if they promise him the status he desires? He's seen Welbeck make the same move, who will likely be trying to sell it to him, and on the pitch - we aren't really the one level above Arsenal as we have been in years gone by.

We should offer him a new deal and the role of first-choice centre-half here.

2879~~~
Smalling has started pretty much every game he has been fit I believe, and I think LVG is becoming a real fan of him. I was worried he would be dropped when Rojo came back, but it just shows how impressed he must be with him recently as he is going against his left + right foot policy.

I would be absolutely gutted if he did leave, as in my eyes he is the best CB in the league on his day IMO.

2880~~~
Agree with all of that. Absolute monster and virtually unbeatable when he's on it. No way should Rojo have a spot secured in the team going forward by virtue of being left-footed.

2881~~~
While I did think the Rojo and Smalling was the best partnership, Jones has come in recently and done really well too. You don't change a winning team in my eyes, and Rojo will have to wait his turn to get back into the team.

Knowing Jones/Smalling 1 of them will end up injuring themselves soon <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

2882~~~
In a perfect world, we'll get him to sign a contract, he'd continue to put in obviously dominant performances, he'll cut out the mistakes... and everyone else will still think he's rubbish.

2883~~~
Wasn't Jones on the left against Spurs and Liverpool? It'd be him that was dropped for Rojo or Evans if so.

2884~~~
He's pretty much a laughing stock as is Ashley Young and many others at the club. But so were Fletcher and park and other mainstays of trophy winning teams. Once opposition fans have an opinion on a player its impossible to shift it.

2885~~~
Smalling is a laughing stock?

2886~~~
The main reason Arsenal are linked to him so often is that they were competing against us to sign him from Fulham. So media assumes Wenger will never stop trying to sign Smalling.

2887~~~
Pretty much I live in London and as soon as his name is mentioned its all jokes. For example an Arsenal fan at work has been getting ripped by everyone from West Ham to Chelsea fans about being linked with Smalling. West Ham fans think he's a poor mans Reid!

2888~~~
I think he means opposition fans love to make fun of Smalling and even Jones as overrated players

2889~~~
Excuse me?

2890~~~
He is for most opposition fans, along with Evans and probably Jones as well

2891~~~
I didn't realise that. All the opposition fans I've spoken to about Smalling all rate him highly. Pretty much the only United defender they'd take.

2892~~~
Most of my Liverpool and Arsenal supporting friends think he's just a tall, dumb defender who is good in the air and that's it. Obviously they are basing this off some of his bad performances, and like someone said earlier in the thread, once they make up their mind about an opposing player, very hard to change it. 

They think our defense has been terrible this season when the truth is we are the 3rd best defense in the league ( I know a lot of credit goes to DDG for that but still)

2893~~~
Well down here all I can say is they'd rather take a beating than take Smalling.

They said the same about De Gea for the first 2 seasons mind but he's so strong now they have had to move on to saying he's Madrid bound instead.

2894~~~
Most of my non-United supported friends also think Smalling is shite.

2895~~~
A few idiotic Manchester United fans I know still don't rate him. The masses on Twitter probably don't, either.

2896~~~
Every rival fan I know think that every centre back that United have is crap. Smalling included.

2897~~~
A lot of rival fans I know also just about happen to be among the biggest set of morons to have walked this planet. I feel you guys are having the same experience.

2898~~~
To most people 99% of our players are crap - I mean look at Carrick! People still don't rate him.

2899~~~
I've got a few footballing mates who seem like knowledgeable guys but still don't rate Carrick. I just can't take them seriously anymore.

2900~~~
And there's me being so envious of Arsenal's, Liverpool's and even City's centre backs for that matter - NOT!

2901~~~
It is not a good era for centre backs in all honesty.

2902~~~
This is news to me too. Most people I speak to outside of the Caf all think Evans is fecking gash, Jones is overrated but Smalling is actually quite good.

2903~~~
True and no-one currently stands out for me who would actually improve us next season

2904~~~
Yeah and Herrera is already getting it as well. To be honest you cant have a sensible argument as even if we get Pogba and I say "a midfield of Carrick, Herrera and Pogba and I'd be happy"...to any non United fan Pogba is the only one in there they wouldnt laugh at!...same all over the team, same when we were winning everything in sight.....and I had Arsenal fans down here telling me their midfield of Fabregas and co  dicked on ours....on paper perhaps but never worked out that way.

2905~~~
There's obviously something about Carrick that just isn't appreciated by some. It's not like it's just the normal bloke in the street that doesn't rate him but pretty much every England manager during his career hasn't thought much of him either.

2906~~~
Someone that can stay fit for more than half a dozen games in a row would be a start.

2907~~~
Same when looking at the entire PL and who's possible to buy..afew from Southampton but nothing you'd be very sad to miss out on.

2908~~~
Don't care what opposition fans think of him in truth. He is bossing games right now and of he stays healthy, see no reason why it won't continue. With his confidence if driving forward with the ball and improved passing, he is perfect for LVG system. Teams over the season have tried to stymie us by putting people on our holding mid and our CB looked a bit clueless as what to do. Now with him we have a player that can break that pressure by simply taking the ball up while being covered by the likes of Carrick or whomever else is being man marked out.

Couple that with his strength in the air and speed - be glad no one wants to buy him or try turn his head.

2909~~~
He doesnt score. Thats basically it. Gerrard and Lamps always going to look great in comparison. Scholes scored the odd worldy and chipped in most seasons. If you dont score you aint rated by rival fans as your basically not mentioned on MOTD!

2910~~~
We may be getting there, personally, probably contrary to many on here, I'd be quite happy for any 2 out of Smalling/Jones/Rojo to be our regular centre-back partnership. The key is to form a partnership and understanding. Ie injuries being the stumbling block so far

2911~~~
The problem is the rare few times Smalling, Rojo and Jones have all been fit and even Evans. Smalling has been dropped to the bench. Will it happen again? He is our best CB but I feel Van Gaal prefers Rojo and Jones for some reason, I hope im wrong.

2912~~~
I think Van Gaal loves Jones' all or nothing approach, plus he's better on the ball compared to Smalling, atleast he used to be.

But Smalling's passing and decision making has really improved this season.. We need to settle on a preferred CB pairing, and I think once Rojo is fit, we should see him and Smalling start more often though him and Jones make a very good duo at the back

2913~~~
I think both jones and smalling have been very good as a partnership in the last 2 games.

2914~~~
They love to hate us, and the sum total of their exposure to Jones and Smalling is 2 or 3 games where they played at right back or central midfield back in 2012.

Jones said the other day they have been partned together at CB 4/5 times in 4 years.....

2916~~~
Unsurprising if thats true.

Im not convinced either of them will make it here, especially Jones, but the level of unfounded hatred for them throughout rival fans is ridiculous.

2917~~~
The irony is that their biggest problem was staying healthy, all three are injury prone defenders.

2918~~~
Ahh yeah I see, apologies that's poor form from myself.

2919~~~
Nah, you didn't mean it in that way anyway. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2920~~~
Point is simple, really. All of Smalling, Evans and T.G.H.B.E. are injury prone. So it would be reckless not to reinforce. We could easily end up with the same old problems next season.

Rojo is still unproven, I guess - so he stays. We bring in someone - someone who is of a certain standard and who is not injury prone. Meaning that we can - or should, I guess - move one out of the three mentioned on. Has to be Evans, then. Certainly not Smalling, who may have his flaws, but still. Hardly a defender out there these days without flaws.

If we're comfortable with limiting the chances of the likes of McNair and whatnot, we could even keep Jonny. If experience has taught us anything, it's that four potential starters at CB ain't enough for us.

2921~~~
Really? I've never come across that. Everyone I speak to about football, including fairweather United fans, they all think Smalling is guff. When I read mixed fan forums, whenever an England squad is picked, Smalling is nearly always the first to get slated and you get the usual cries for Ryan fecking Shawcross. Smalling and Jones have often been the topic of discussion on Sky Sports' Sunday Supplement and Soccer Saturday, and they get ripped to pieces.

When I'm not on the caf, I sometimes feel like I am the only person on earth who thinks Chris Smalling is a good footballer.

2922~~~
That doesn't explain why Barry was preferred for a few years. I accept it's a factor but there's obviously something else.

2923~~~
Tbh all our success has been down to luck, as all our players are guff on all other forums. Fans have very clouded judgement & United are the most hated club in the land.

2924~~~
True. I don't really care what opposing fans think, but it is perhaps just a United thing. I remember the 07-09 team being branded as average and being a "one man team" as Ronaldo was banging them in. Rio, Vidic and Evra in their prime, Scholes, VDS, Rooney, Tevez, Nani, even Anderson was pretty great for a bit... Baffling how that was an average team. It was one of the best we've had.

2925~~~
I wouldn't get too excited about him yet. He will probably be injured again soon, just as he looks like he's making progress.

2926~~~
WOAH, settle down cowboy, you will lose all credibility!

2927~~~
Like I said earlier in here, his injury record is really overstated. 

His appearances for us by season:
10-11 - 33
11-12 - 30
12-13 - 22
13-14 - 38
14-15 - 22 so far.

This is all without ever being first choice for us.

2928~~~
i think the problem is that he always seems to get injured after a nice run of 5-6 games and is out for the  next 3-4 weeks. then the cycle starts again. obviously he will still make 30 appearances plus a season but when you look at rio or vidic during their prime, they rarely missed a game.

hopefully smalling can get over that problem and he will be top class.

2929~~~
I really hope that LVG rates him , as he didn't seem convinced after some games - rather started left footer and Jones being his first option was quite worrying..

The guy has it all, I think he's maybe the fastest center back in the league, can't think of any faster in the world tbh, that gives him big advantage in 1v1 and in the game overall, he can recover very well. He's also very strong and aggressive enough. He's got good reading of the game always trying to intercept the ball than sitting back which is good sign for modern defender..

He is monster in the air, not only he's really big but his good spring due to his athleticity makes him almost unbeatable in the aerial duels. Shame he is quite inaccurate, always seems to know how to clear the ball but doesn't seem to head the ball i the back of the net on us taking corners. I don't think he's bad with the ball either he uses well his strength and speed to cover the ball when driving forward. Shame he looks too shy sometimes we could benefit from it more but I'm more than impressed when center backs does what he does carrying the ball out of defense. 

His passing is also good, the long passing especially, he's got good awareness where his teammates are but he looks a bit clumsy when he executes these kicks and passes so that somebody can call him unskilful with the ball but I think he's alright. Yeah some brainfarts are here and there and he can mishit the ball from time to time but who doesn't make a mistake?

 The most important think is that he should make some good understanding with the second center back and it will be awesome. He complements well either with Jones or Rojo as both are quite similar players in their playing style. He's also not old for center back and if he plays and plays he will remove some of the little mistakes from his game, but he's perfect material for center back.

I think even for his athleticism, strength and aerial ability you would want him in the team but he offers much more.  The most important think is that he's like Vidic, he loves defending. I really fell in love with him. Hope he does well and stays fit to fulfill his potential Wenger can feck off, he's no Silvestre. He's much better.

2930~~~
Why? He's right, Anderson was pretty good for some time, when he wasn't injured which was 95% of the time. But him aside, I won't take any discussion on this topic as it is pretty pointless with some people on caf

<b><span style="font-size: 15px">Manchester United defender Chris Smalling says he is happy at the club and is hoping to stay there beyond the expiration of his current contract.</span></b>
<span style="font-size: 15px">Smalling’s deal expires at the end of next season and it has been reported that United are yet to open talks on an extension for the 25-year-old.

However, Smalling has been in fine form for his club of late, teaming up at the back with his fellow England international Phil Jones during important recent victories over Tottenham and Liverpool.

Asked about his contract situation at an England press conference on Sunday, Smalling said: "That is one that I have not really discussed with anyone.

Asked if he saw his long term future at United, Smalling said:
And Smalling says he will be happy to wait until the summer before discussing any possible new deal.

Asked if any negotiations were currently ongoing, he said:

2932~~~
Good to hear.

2933~~~
Words are all well and good, but how can we expertly judge his body language from pasted text?

He's probably miserable.

2934~~~
It's almost scary to think that he doesn't know if any talks are taking place on his behalf - then again probably just trying to deflect.

2935~~~

<b>"I thought that it could be round two on Tuesday but I’ve seen that he’s not in the squad. We’ll have to wait for that".</b> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Go on Smalling.

2937~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Love that confidence.

Btw, LvG seems to love the word 'entice'. Probably a part of his philosophy now.

2938~~~
Loved that bit. He's really starting to come out his shell which is great. Despite the dopiest eyes in world football he comes across as very switched on.

2939~~~
Ye exactly. Sounding a lot more confident, which has shown in his recent performances. Long may it continue.

2940~~~
I remember back in the early part of the season I reckoned 5 at the back always needed Smalling in there to stand a chance of working. He had grasped the requirements and knitted it together. 
His recent performances show an authoritive understanding of how LVG wants us to play imo. Then there are all his physical and technical attributes. If he is able to stay relatively injury free he must have a great chance to be the man around whom the defence is built.

2941~~~
"The manager stresses that he wants the centre-halves taking responsibility rather than the easy option and passing to the full-back when the room is too narrow and they can’t really do much with the ball. He says: ‘Why pass it to him when you’ve got no one marking you? Try to entice and, if the opportunity comes, pass it to someone in a better position."

Perfect. It's great to see that LVG is really coaching them the correct thing. This is 1 of my biggest bug's in football, so many times the CB's just give it to a team mate who is already closed down, just because they are scared of passing it forward and losing the ball themselves.

In modern football where most teams play with only 1 striker, a CB is always free to make the forward pass. It's correct that they should take command.

2942~~~
<b>“The manager stresses that he wants the centre-halves taking responsibility rather than the easy option and passing to the full-back when the room is too narrow and they can’t really do much with the ball"</b> YES YES YES.

2943~~~
I absolutely love this. This is something United haven't done for years. Actually, I can't remember a United side ever doing this consistently. 

I have never understood players who pass the ball when they have acres of space to run into. It opens up the play. It forces the opponent to close down which a lot of the time leads to them losing shape.

2944~~~
Yeah that is the sort of thing I like to see.

One of my pet peeves is CBs mindlessly passing to the FB (or other CB) every single time, even when under no pressure.
It may explain why in recent weeks we have seen Smalling start to bring the ball forward from defense and run with it.

My other pet peeve is mindless headers to nobody (even when under no pressure). Hopefully that can be next on LVGs hit list.

2945~~~
Have great man love for Smalling. Give him a 5 year deal. And the captaincy for the hell of it.

2946~~~
4th best CB in Europe this year according to Football-observatory: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/wp105_eng.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/wp105_eng.pdf</a>

2947~~~
While I agree Smalling has been awesome, they have Hummels and Subotic in the top 10 since January aswell. No way should they be anywhere near there with Dortmunds season surely?

2948~~~
This is one of the things that goes to show the sort of basics LVG had to try to teach most of our squad, which is why I had lots of patience when results were going against us, and still would have until the end of this season. There are so many technical/tactical things that, for one reason or another, many of the players hadn't learned to do in matches.

2949~~~
Interesting but who on earth compiles these stats? Navas, for example, is the third best attacking midfileder in Europe over a period in which he has scored none and had just one assist in the EPL. Meanwhile Clichy is ranked best fullback in a period where he's been out for a month and not seen a clean sheet until last time out. Results skewed by 2 assists v Sunderland perhaps way back on New Years day?

Those rankings are complete bollocks

2950~~~
Injured. Benteke will be liking this.

2951~~~
Ffs

2952~~~
Seemed to be seeing stars. Hoping nothing serious, didn't seem it tbh.

2953~~~
Had a good game until the injury, hopefully nothing serious....

2954~~~
What kind of injury did it look like?

2955~~~
He didn't look right from the moment I tuned in, looked to be walking/running strangely 

Looks like concussion or illness, or possibly a vision problem. Typical really.

2956~~~
Concussion.

2957~~~
Nah, a typical Smalling injury is a calf strain.

He can miss the Villa game, and be back the week after.

2958~~~
I presumed he'd done his groin or calf.

But it definitely looks like some sort of head problem. The physios were checking his eyes when they came on.

2959~~~
My first thought. Jones and Rojo struggle in the air somewhat.

2960~~~
No biggie, looked like he was struggling to keep his balance with all those PL strikers stuffed in his pocket. Will be playing against Villa.

2961~~~
Cheers, will probably miss the weekend match then. Not too bothered about him missing that, as long as he's okay for City and Chelsea.

2962~~~
Didn't look like an injury. He was either feeling sick or concussed.

2963~~~
Hopefully nothing too bad. As long as he's back for the big games.

2964~~~
I think he was just feeling iffy or something, no biggie hopefully.

2965~~~

2966~~~
Thank feck for that. Should hopefully be fine for Villa.

2967~~~
That doesn't sound too bad. A few days rest and should be fine for the weekend. We'll need him against Villa.

2968~~~
Hopefully just a precaution - good man <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2969~~~
Yep as others have said, lets hope it was just a precaution and hes fit for the weekend. We will be far weaker defensively if he is out.

2970~~~
Seriously?

2971~~~
Hodgson has confirmed that he was struggling with illness after 10 minutes and had to come off.

2972~~~
First saw that he was injured and was devastated. Then to see it was just an illness is a huge relief. Hopefully he'll be right to take on Villa, because Benteke (and Agbonlahor at times) can be a handful.

2973~~~
Yep we definitely need him against those two, he is good at dealing with pacey tricky strikers.

2974~~~
Come off because he didn't feel well. Should be fine for Villa. Hope he and Jones will continue their partnership.

2975~~~
I fell asleep for a bit during the first half, was he substituted early on? I'm glad he wasn't taken off instead of Jones and that he probably just ate some dodgy pasta rather than being injured again.

2976~~~

2977~~~
Good news.

2978~~~
Not Good <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2979~~~
Ugh. Definitely not good news at all. Luckily it is only Villa (no disrespect - we should beat them at home) but I have no faith in Rojo and Jones together.

2980~~~
I am hoping it is LVG on one of his little wind ups/tricks, and that Smalling will actually be in the starting XI.

On the other hand, we know how much LVG likes his left sided and right sided, maybe he was just looking for an excuse to drop one of Smalling/Jones so he could bring Rojo back in and have that LCB/RCB balance again...

2981~~~
Sounded like he'd back into the team if he can train today. We'll need him big time though even if it is only Villa.

2982~~~
He doesn't lie about players being ill or injured. Smalling got taken off at international duty, I don't doubt he's ill.

He doesn't need excuses to drop players, if he wants drop someone he'll have his reasons and do it. He's very adamant about being 100% match fit, if Smalling only just got better and missed a training or didn't perform well in one he won't play because we've still got Rojo and Jones. If he plays, he is fit enough.

He usually chooses his XI after the press conference, because they still have a training session after.

Jones and Rojo should suffice against Villa, although I'd like to see Smalling start myself.

2983~~~
Distribution from the back tends to be shocking in the absence of Smalling. Jones is great at stopping things but awful at starting them. I'd be tempted to start McNair alongside Rojo if Smalling's sick.

2984~~~
Don't think we can afford to pick an inexperienced player considering we have to get top four. McNair is more likely to make a mistake which could cost us points than Jones or Rojo.

2985~~~
Should be straight back in the starting line-up next week against City IMO.

2986~~~
Yeah, really need him back. Let's hope he doesn't have a nightmare of a game like he had at the Etihad.

2987~~~
Rojo and Jones looked a lot better on playing out from the back today but we're really hurting for size and command of the pitch when Smalling isn't there.  Look forward to having him back next week.

2988~~~
This, pretty much. The amount of times Benteke got his body in the way of Jones and Rojo was a bit worrying. We had the same thing against Kevin Davies, iirc the Preston goal started with Rojo being outmuscled/eased off the ball by him.

2989~~~
Yep. Rojo and Jones are hardly lightweights, but they certainly aren't going to be able to contain the true big brutes as well as Smalling could.

2990~~~
I hope he gets back in but it wouldn't surprise me if he misses. When Fellaini was subbed off I was worried every time Villa had a set piece. Without Smalling or Fellaini there we are so vulnerable.

2991~~~
Hes our best defender and its not close. How anyone can think jones is better in any way baffles me. I think people are still in love with huge and brave defenders that run around and slide tackle. Hence the potential label that jones still has even though hemakes the same mistakes.

2992~~~
I think it's widely accepted that he's our best CB, at least on here. Jones if anything is the most maligned of our defenders, taking over Evans' mantle from earlier on this season.

2993~~~
Smalling's upside/potential has always been far more than Jones. Its one of the dumbest myths that have been peddled around for so long that Jones has more potential. They're both extremely athletic defenders, but Smalling just about happens to have around 4 inches of height on Jones and is probably even quicker.

He's also always been a cleaner tackler and he's always shown himself to be a more intelligent defender.

2994~~~
This. But also, playing with Smalling, Jones is by far our second best defender - not so much playing with Rojo or Evans.

2995~~~
I agree the Smalling is comfortably our best CB. However I think Jones has been harshly treated on here over the last few weeks. He's a bit wild but he's generally been decent for us this season.

2996~~~
And every good CB pair needs at least one aggressive defender. So Jones being a bit wild should not be a huge problem.

2997~~~
Just found out he's a fellow Judo player. Granted I doubt he does train anymore, but I've decided ive changed my views on Smalling based off of this alone and he's now one of my favourite players

2998~~~
Called it <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2999~~~
When your defender is king in both penalty boxes you can remain calm as Van Gaal was on the bench.

3000~~~
So happy for him when he got the goal after his nightmare at the Etihad.

Thought he was good today, bit all over the place at the start but grew back into it.

3001~~~
Brick Walling.

3002~~~
Dont think he was great today but very nice that he's continuing to score goals. He always should have been a real threat and now he's become one

3003~~~
Dodgy as at the start. When we scored we took control of the game and we weren't tested much.

We are two central defenders off of being one of the top sides in world football.

3004~~~
Yeah, didn't think he was particularly very good either (shaky at the start and partially responsible for City's 2nd) but he's capable of so much more and I'm happy for his goal.

3005~~~
He was good, first half he had to cover for Valencia a bit too much but Valencia went into beast mode in the second half and he looked much better. He's a really good defender.

3006~~~
Yeah agree with that. Had a pretty solid game and scored a good header, but the 4th goal he completely lost Aguero.
Still can't complain too much.

3007~~~

3008~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3009~~~
And Falcao.

And four times as many as Balotelli (and the same amount as Balotelli in all competitions).

3010~~~
This pretty much. Not his best game. He made a couple too many mistakes, but he scored a nice goal. Defended well overall, but just a bit sloppy at times.

3011~~~
I wrote all of our CB's off shamed to say, but since coming back from the last injury he's been absolutely brilliant. Yes he's not the best passer, but he can defend and he's massively improved his coming out with the ball this season.

3012~~~
Didn't track Aguero for their consolation goal. The whole team fell asleep really, but it was still just basic stuff. He was alright though.

3013~~~
Strolled back in with confidence, think he's the one that should partner whoever we buy in the summer.

3014~~~
But but.. Our Danny boy..

3015~~~
Smalling should want to strangle Valencia after today.  He was left to cover so much on the right in the first half, it was ridiculous.

3016~~~
Yep. There were two or three times in the first half where on first viewing I thought Smalling had made mistakes in positioning or following a run, only to realise on the replay that it was actually Valencia doing the wrong thing.

3017~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fantastic.

3018~~~
Some people said that we should have kept Welbeck. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3019~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at that stat. 
He's brilliant though. Started the game shakily but grew in confidence. Such a shame all our defenders are so injury prone, you can see how good they get once they get a run of games.

3020~~~
Am I making this up, or are his most often goals are those like that one today, after set pieces from similar ditance/angle like today's? I remember him scoring couple after set pieces like today's. Didn't he also score similar goal against City two or three seasons ago too(when he was slightly offside)?

3021~~~
He scored against City in the Community Shield back in 2011/12 where we came back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.

3022~~~
Bad mistake where he let aguero in and Valencia saved us but good overall. He's improved on the ball hugely.

3023~~~
Same amount of goals as Welbeck despite playing 5 games or around 300 mins less. Better record than Ozil, Willian, Coutinho, Balotelli and Sturridge too.

3024~~~
Chrisy Chris picking out some delightful balls again. Was great again.

3025~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.tinypic.com/2z5vfpf.png" src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2z5vfpf.png"/>

3026~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3027~~~
Well, I still would rather have kept Welbeck than bring in Falcao.

3028~~~
Pretty sure he's the top scoring centre back in the premier league.

I'm loving him this season, he's come on leaps and bounds. Credit to Van Gaal for improving his use of the ball and playing him consistently in his proper position.

3029~~~
Yep, that's probably the one.

3030~~~
4 goals from 58 shots for Welbeck? Blimey.

3031~~~
He scored a similar goal  against Chelsea that season, which is probably the one being referred to. His goal in the Community Shield was with his foot.

3032~~~
Oh, I can't remember anything now. It's late.

3033~~~
Was class, when we were under pressure he looked our only defender at times. Sign Stones to play next to him.

3034~~~
That's a conversion rate of 6.8%. Jesus.

3035~~~
I wouldn't trade him for another centre half in the league.

3036~~~
Paid extremely close attention to him today because I was really bigging him up to my Liverpool/Spurs supporting mates prior to the game.

I thought he was very, very good. Dodgy on the ball, gave it away a few times and when he headed the ball clear he often failed to direct it towards a red shirt, but his defending was almost impeccable. He had to cover a lot for Valencia who went missing a lot, particularly in the first half. At one stage it felt like he was doing all of the defending by himself.

I'm a big fan of Smalling and I think the penny has dropped with him. I don't really get nervous watching him anymore. Would like to see us just buy one centre back in the summer (Hummels) and playing Smalling alongside him.

3037~~~
4 goals from a CB who has started 15 games is actually a stupidly good record for Smalling. I didnt quite realise he had so many from so few games, I think we can point to him as one of the best targets for set pieces in the league this season

Vidic's best goalscoring season for us was 5 goals in 35 league starts. And then he went to like 1 a season.
Terry's best was 6 in 31 league games and also got 1 champions league goal that season, and he usually gets 3 or 2 goals a season.

Crazy. Well done Smalling

3038~~~
Baloteli is 1 in 49 FFS! He might be the worst striker in the league.

3039~~~
But he runs a lot and opens up spaces you know.

3040~~~
He started nervously on the ball, and Jones did too I think. He also had to cover quite often for Valencia which didn't help him. He grew into the game though and was good. Switched off at the end which was disappointing, but I guess ultimately not too big of a disaster.

3041~~~
Milner was in the team to close down the defenders and be close to Carrick and it started off working well. But after about 15 minutes he decided he'd had enough and we were able to play it around without trouble

3042~~~
Good summary. I'm just looking to the future what it might be like when he can deliver a full 90 minutes of solid play with the improving understanding of the other defenders. And maybe with a more defensively accomplished player than Valencia next to him.

3043~~~
Has as many league goals as Danny Welbeck and Falcao.

3044~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3045~~~
I thought Milner played it perfectly for the first 15 minutes.  Good thing that he fecked off and did his own thing after that, because I thought they were going to reduce us to passing slowly among the back four at one point early in the match.

3046~~~
Always looks awkward when running with the ball but defended well enough today and tried to show leadership across the line

3047~~~
Really? I didn't think that at all. Smalling and McNair looked very confident running the ball out to me. Maybe looked a little lost with what to do with it when Chelsea let them run really far forward, but that's not particularly surprising or a problem. 

Defensively there were some impressive Varane-esque shows of his pace too. Caught Drogba at full sprint a few times when it looked like he was only at three quarters pace.

3048~~~
Smalling was solid...

McNair is a ready back up..

we are stocked up well for CB.

3049~~~
Good game from both he and McNair but really they saw too much of the ball. Couldn't break Chelsea's walls.

3050~~~
Haven't seen a replay - could he have done more to stop the goal?

3051~~~
Played very well today, as did McNair.

3052~~~
I don't understand why he shits himself in the opposition half when he's actually quite good in the ball. It's almost like he thinks to himself "Oh feck. I'm past the halfway line. PANIC!!!!"

3053~~~
His positioning wasn't impressive.

3054~~~
They let him have the ball today and he couldn't/wasn't able to take real advantage of it. Expected though, his on ball ability is a still work in progress though one that is improving exponentially based on this season.

Solid defender though. Won every header against a (past it) Drogba without having to even jump.

3055~~~
He was marking Oscar tight at the time, so probably no. Valencia needed to close the gap to Smalling IMO, but it's easy to say I suppose.

3056~~~
I didn't say he lacked confidence, just that he looks awkward running with it, like it's not natural for him, unlike say McNair who is very smooth when running with it. Not a criticism, just an observation as I think Smalling is more a traditional CB than a ball playing one but is doing his best to fit with what LvG demands even if it's not his natural game.

3057~~~
did well

3058~~~
Oh right, fair enough. I thought awkward implied a lack of confidence. Can't say I've noticed that myself.

3059~~~
One thing I'd like to see him change: when he steps out of defence with the ball it's fantastic but he then often negates it by playing a sideways or backwards pass. 

It's great though that we have start to see him step out more often.

3060~~~
Paddy McNair out performed him. 

I know we all want our younger English players to do well, but if we go into next season with Smalling as the main defender we won't win the league.

3061~~~
That was the hesitant and unsure version of him today, an eyesore at times. Look out for the decisive and precise version, a damn right treat really.

3062~~~
Wonder what game some people were watching, I really do.

He was excellent. Why is McNair having a good game a slight on Smalling? They can both deliver good performance, which is what happened.

3063~~~
You know why

3064~~~
Their goal was primarily just the fact that Hazard is the best player in the league and showed why. Could we have defended better? In hindsight, sure, but there was no blindingly obvious defensive error.

Overall another good game from him.

3065~~~
Was class and composed, which has become the norm this season for him, cant wait for next seasons developments now.

3066~~~
I remember thinking if Valencia was stood a yard further infield he'd have blocked Hazard's path through on goal. Also don't like how he gave up once hazard was goal side. Paying the price for not having an actual defender in defence.

3067~~~
Showing signs of finally fulfilling his potential for me. Feel like we've been here before with him but hope he can see it through now and become the player I think he can.

Smalling, Jones, Rojo, a new CB and McNair will do me fine for our group of centre halves next season.

3068~~~
On the ball, yeah. Neither really had anything to do defensively and when they did they both were more than competent.

3069~~~
Yeah I did notice that he seemed to just start ballwatching as though he were simply bedazzled by the beauty that is Eden Hazard.

Still, there was no way Valencia (or anyone else) would have caught Hazard once he had reached that point - we would more than likely have just given away a penalty. Herrera should have done better at tracking his run initially - and (this was pointed out in the HT analysis) could have simply checked Hazard off the ball to prevent the situation developing. It may have been noticed by the ref, but either way I think giving away a FK would have been a better option for us.

Of course Herrera was playing an unfamiliar position so perhaps wasnt quite clued up to execute a professional foul in that circumstance, but there you go.

3070~~~
Smalling was excellent on Saturday, not sure what some others were watching.

3071~~~
He's been excellent today, despite the score.

3072~~~
Terrific defender, would be great with Hummels next to him.

3073~~~
Been very good.

3074~~~
Only player who has played well today, I'd say.

3075~~~
MOTM in a 3-0 defeat - that's nice...

3076~~~
Let down massively by Valencia these months.

3077~~~
Defending on his own today.

3078~~~
He needs to stop appealing for offside. Seen it other games where he takes his eye off the play to appeal. What is the point?

3079~~~
Pretty much. He's just such a complete defender, and I can't think of any attackers he struggle against.

3080~~~
One man defence today

3081~~~
Probably our best player today.

3082~~~
So can we all agree that we probably need to play more than one man in defence? Shaw has been decent.

3083~~~
Getting him a right back is a bigger priority than a CB partner. His workload down the right is ridiculous.

3084~~~
Was just coming in to say the same thing. He's been deserted by the entire defence and midfield today.

3085~~~
Wouldn't be hard really. But yeah, agreed. He has really improved lately and is getting back to some of the brilliant early form he showed when he first signed.

3086~~~
He's Captain now btw! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3087~~~
Was our best player IMO.

3088~~~
Yep, aside from some dodgy passes he played an excellent match.

3089~~~
By far our best player today. Shaw good as well, but Smalling is standing our as one of the more consitently good players this 2nd half of the season.

3090~~~
Most weeks he has to do Valencia's job all game. Today he also had to do McNair's and half of Shaw's as well

3091~~~
Was our best player and the only one interested in defending. 

Get this man a partner.

3092~~~
He was running around trying to put out fires every time they broke as he had liabilities either side of him.

3093~~~
Apart from when Lukaku sold him a stepover, he had him sussed pretty well for the whole game. He just doesn't seem to get beaten.

Did well on two corners as well, the knock down for Rooney and the header on target, just a shame it wasn't to the side of Howard. He's so dominant in the air.

3094~~~
Was our best player today. I'd seriously consider making him captain next season. Not that it'll happen mind.

3095~~~
Strongly agree with this. It's unreal how much he has to cover for Valencia.

3096~~~
Can only trust him and Shaw at the back

3097~~~
Agreed.

3098~~~
Did the job of three men today. Very good again.

3099~~~
Does he still have any doubters?

3100~~~
Stepping up big time, looking like a leader and he's thriving with van Gaal's coaching. Needs some help.

3101~~~
Can we put the questioning of him being our best defender well and truly to bed now? He saved our arses countless times in a heavy defeat today, if the two standing next to him were playing to half of what Smalling was then we may have had a less embarrassing scoreline.

#SmallingPlusOne more than ever.

3102~~~
Was just about to post the same comment, nice to see him taking the lead and marshalling around our other young defenders, with Vidic and Ferdinand going in the one window we needed somebody to step up and lead the defence, I thought it was going to be Ronnie Evans but I can see Smalling keeping his place no matter who we bring in now

3103~~~
I love his speed, strength and sheer size. Great in the air.

3104~~~
Sign a quality CB to play beside this guy and we're laughing. Pity there's not many around at the moment..

3105~~~
I liked one of his last ditch tackles today, it was on a counter and he literally got the goal from Lukaku waiting for a low driven cross. I thought to myself that would never happen with Hummels as he would never get there as quickly.. It's really strong asset to have such stature like Smalling - athletic and strong at once... great to see him showing some leader ship recently..

btw that was really funny to see how some people last time said how McNair is better player or some other weird calls how he's becoming soon ahead of him. First he needs to learn how to defend. Smalling's excellent defender and if he ads anything else to it I am okay to start him. McNair looked better agains Cheslea side waiting for us at their half..

3106~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

What a player.

3107~~~
I've always liked him, put a calm head like Hummels next to him and we'll be mint.

3108~~~
btw how would you guys compare him to Boateng?

3109~~~
He's a better defender than Boateng, but Boateng is better on the ball.

3110~~~
He was the only player on the pitch who actually showed up today.

3111~~~
Couldn't agree more. Valencia can be a head case too often, while Paddy is still a kid and will be prone to having off games.

3112~~~
Only just realised that he got the armband after Rooney went off <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3113~~~
This. There's that article about him when he was signed. A proper mama's boy who rise from poverty by sheer hardwork.

3114~~~
Jones and Smalling is our best pairing right now. Been saying it from start of the season and actually from England U21 days they've had a decent understanding.

They need a good run of games together but Injuries constantly  disrupts that or Van Gaal starts messing up formations or going with his left footed right footed lark.

3115~~~
He is growing and improving. I can see him being vice-captain soon, he's becoming a leader for us

3116~~~
You wouldn't happen to have a link for that article would you?

3117~~~
I enjoyed him losing his shit with those around him on a few occasions.

3118~~~
He's really turned it around after the City game, I remember in my complete rage at his red card I wanted him sold (I don't think I was ever as angry at a player <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>)

De Gea, Shaw and Smalling are quality if we add Hummels and a proper RB to that back 5 we'll have the best defense in the league. I would actually love Carvajal! 

---------------De Gea
Carvajal-Smalling-Hummels-Shaw  

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3119~~~
Clyne and Stones and have the full England back four!

3120~~~
Smalldini <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3121~~~
What's this obsession with Carvajal all of a sudden?

3122~~~
Danilo signing for R. Madrid

3123~~~
..... what have I just read.

Smalling is so vastly over-rated on this forum.

3124~~~
AGENDA POSTER!

<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3125~~~
I think it's this one. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2099484/Chris-Smalling-promises-repay-mum-faith-him.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...is-Smalling-promises-repay-mum-faith-him.html</a>

3126~~~
Carvajal had a stellar 1st part of the season, but his performance levels have dropped (noticeably) since the turn of the year.

Anyway - back on topic - Smalling is an excellent CB, and I've been saying this for ages. He should be the mainstay of our defence for the foreseeable future.

3127~~~
Smalling has huge potential as a centre back. For one thing, it is the position where, more than any other, physical abilities are important relative to technical ability. Ideally, a centre back is big, tall, strong, fast and a commanding header of the ball. Smalling is easily the best in the league in these aspects. He is also a natural defender and rock solid in one on ones, intervening in dangerous situations, and in making clearances. Where he falls down sometimes is concentration, positioning and distribution. As he learns the technical aspects he is going to get better and better. He is also becoming more confident and assertive on the pitch, a sign that he is developing the mentality to be a big player for a big club. He is set fair to be one of the big winners under van Gaal.

3128~~~
Thanks!

3129~~~
He has all the attributes to become a brilliant centre back but I feel the only thing that will hold him back is his distribution - it gets better when he is confident but at times it can be very erratic

3130~~~
Lots of man love for Chris

3131~~~
armband for Chris on Saturday? would love that

3132~~~
I was thinking about this. If Carrick plays then he would get it I suppose. Not sure how van Gaal rates RvP in terms of leadership for us either, but he would probably get the nod if he starts too. Personally I will be thrilled if Smalling leads us out <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3133~~~
I think it was him who took the band after Rooney was subbed off against Toffies, RVP going on the pitch and giving the band to Chris so that makes RVP out of contention and only one who could were it ahead of him could be Carrick but as you said would be fantastic to see our team coming out of tunnel with Smalling wearing it ..

3134~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3135~~~
Carrick, probably.

3136~~~
Brilliant highlight video of Smalling's season. Needs to be updated at the end of the season

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDfvfiXcAR4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3137~~~
Completely forgot about that! You're right. Hopefully it is Smalling then.

3138~~~
Did his job, today's shittery wasn't on the defense.

3139~~~
The only player who looked remotely like he wanted to win. 

i.e. Most attractive patient in the serious burns unit.

3140~~~
His usual self today. His consistency since the Etihad brainfart has really been special. Just a shame he's plumped next to our globally renowned left-side-of-defence revolving door.

3141~~~
Typical Chris Smalling performance, played well. Too bad his teammates are utter shite.

3142~~~
defending 10/10 today, passing though? sideways, sideways, sideways, 
Steps into the space in midfield annnnnd...... passes it backwards to a teenage McNair to take responsibility.

3143~~~
Did his job impeccably - which is pretty much normal for him now. We had them locked in their own half and it was a lot because of him, repeatedly winning everything that went anywhere near our backline and regaining possession.

3144~~~
I'm liking the consistency, he's an absolute beast in the air too.

3145~~~
He's been dealing with two idiots to his left and right for three weeks now and conducted himself impeccably. A one man back line.

3146~~~
Pretty much. Our best player alongside RvP. McNair, Jones, Rojo all are miles behind him at the moment.

3147~~~
It would be dumb to make him step up and run into midfield and desert the defense because he's basically the only competent defender on the pitch for our team. Do you really want the likes of McNair and Valencia back defending a break? If so, see Everton's first goal last week.

3148~~~
Yup. It did basically become a one man line when Young went LB and Falcao came on for McNair.

3149~~~
Played well today, I was impressed with his concentration level. He could easily have switched off today given that he was playing as the last man.

3150~~~
God I can't wait until he gets someone actually good next to him.

3151~~~
The problem was I think perpetuated, we had no Carrick to dump our balls from the back to bring out into midfield.
Smalling continually passed possession to a young McNair to bring into midfield.
A small mark against him, but cant fault him for his defending at all.

3152~~~
Only player you can't criticise in the last three games.

3153~~~
Agreed.

3154~~~
Even at McNair's age and inexperience, I think his technique at running with the ball is already much better than Smalling's. I think McNair is a much more gifted ball-player, so I don't have a problem with the more competent dribbler taking the ball out. I want to see us take more risks, but if anyone on the pitch is going to play it safe, I'd definitely rather it was Smalling.

3155~~~
Yea, fair point.

3156~~~
Has come a long way, please dont get injured!

3157~~~
One of our best dribblers tbh, takes the ball out well from the back.

3158~~~
The funny part was after we took McNair off and Big Chris was literally defending by himself.

3159~~~
He clearly need to score more goals because who will if not he ?

Stellar lad. Will be even better with more compact team around him.

3160~~~
Another good game from Smalling.

3161~~~
Really happy that he's finally showing promise, always felt he was the best out of him, Jones & Evans. Hopefully Jones can make a step up soon but I'm not as confident.

3162~~~
A terrific performance by Smalling again. But I'd like to see more composure from him when he has the ball.  He looks a bit nervous and passed the ball backwards to McNair when he had decent options forward.

But in truth he didn't have a whole of defending to do today.

3163~~~
Is he our best outfield player this season? I think the only thing that's against him is that he hasn't played that much but he isn't that bad either, he is our 10th player by minutes played this season in PL and 8th in all competition, only few minutes short of Fellaini and Young in PL and about 3 or 4 games short of Mata and van Persie, which isn't a lot over 30+ games at all.

We actually finished the game with him playing one man defence.

3164~~~
Literally the only player that deserves any credit for that match. He's coming on leaps and bounds.

3165~~~
Quite possibly. Between him, Ander and Carrick in my eyes.

3166~~~
Late to comment as I have been busy all day. Just wanted to say that I thought he was probably our best player. Considering the players he had either side of him.

3167~~~
Yesterday was one of his worst performances in terms of ball playing, there was so many space for him to just dribble in, he rather chose to pass it sideways to McNair. Was quite disappointed as he improved this massively, this season. Other than that, my Motm as he looked assured all match defensively.

3168~~~
Don't you think that's been the case for the last 3 games though? I don't think he's made any runs in the last few games, and I think that's because

a) There's no Carrick to drop into his CB position when he leaves
b) His partner is McNair rather than Jones/Rojo/Evans

So he's been more conservative on the ball.

3169~~~
He played well but didn't have to much, if any, defending. So not sure there's much need for plaudits.

3170~~~
I think that's a legit explanation for it, I really hope we sign Hummels, he'll even improve more I think.

3171~~~
Yeah, this is valid. Chris is the senior defender in the back so he is being conservative, covering - especially as we have seen that McNair has no reservations about bombing forwards, and it is more his natural game than Smalling's.

3172~~~
Nail on head.

Smalling is another one who gets vastly over rated on this forum,

3173~~~
Yeah, <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/search/16263999/">we've got the point</a>. Still think we'll sell him this summer?

3174~~~
At least he seemed to care

3175~~~
Our best CB

3176~~~
Not saying a lot though tbf...

I do like him...And I do love how he has tried to step up and be a leader and take responsibility...(While our senior defender is shite and spits on people)

Smalling will become very good/great if he didn't have to carry the defence....But at the moment, he's not good enough to do that. A few years with an experienced partner would do him the world of good

3177~~~
Having an absolute shocker today.

3178~~~
He's having a bad few minutes only, he was fine in the first half.

3179~~~
He has two neurons held together by a spirochete. Dumb as bricks that man.

3180~~~
Brilliant kneejerk, was fine first half.

3181~~~
He's been atrocious this second half.

3182~~~
He was being held too or did no one see that ?

3183~~~
Thick idiot. Between him and Phil Jones they don't have one brain cell combined.

3184~~~
Same problems in the first half. Charging forward, getting beaten to the ball and leaving acres of space behind him.

3185~~~
Had a shite game in general. Not the Smalling we've become accustomed to this season.

3186~~~
I still cannot fathom how people rate him.

3187~~~
You've said.

3188~~~
I can't fathom how people can watch him every week and not rate him.

3189~~~
Endless times. 

He's having a bad game but has basically carried the defence on his own for the past 5-6 weeks.

3190~~~
And look how bad our defence is!

3191~~~
Yep, he's been a rock these last 2 months.

Today he's playing on a bobbly pitch, with no midfield shielding him and under constant pressure.

3192~~~
That performance, ending in an injury, should give you a hint.

On his day he's fantastic but when it's not his day he can be really shocking. Plus he can't stay fit.

3193~~~
Because he's the only one who knows actually how to defend? Even Ferdinand would struggle carrying a 19 year old and a winger who doesn't know what defending is.

3194~~~
This pitch is absolutely atrocious and it was only a matter of time before someone got injured on it, you can't really pin that all on him.

3195~~~
Not having his day, been poor 2nd half, but he's been a rock the last two months, you hear nobody, bad performance  and he's shit/ how can someone rate him, really sad to see someone waiting on his own players to play badly.

3196~~~
The injury is annoying but I still don't think he was <i>that</i> bad besides that 10 minute spell. And even then while it was a silly foul to give away for the goal, he wasn't completely at fault for the other chance as it was a terrible ball by Evans that put Smalling under pressure in the first place.

3197~~~
He just had a bad game. Loads more mistakes than those two you mention. It happens. Not everyone plays well every game but central defence is one position where it's a real risk to accomodate someone whose form is so extreme.

3198~~~
The said thing is that if you add Rojo and Evans, the result will still be the same.

3199~~~
Please don't be injured for a long time

3200~~~
I thought he was clearly our best defender aside from giving away 1 freekick that they scored from. Other than Young and DDG, nobody else outperformed him

3201~~~
Fine in the first half, shaky in the second. Hope he's fit for next week.

3202~~~
I'm not denying he was bad, he was, I just think people are overstating how bad. I think your last sentence is a bit harsh though, you can count his bad games this season on one hand imo.

3203~~~
First time as captain?

3204~~~
His defending, free kick aside, was spot on today. He's a one man back line and made some hugely important blocks in our box. He won practically all of his aerial duels, too. Not really sure what some people were watching today.

3205~~~
Do you not remember him losing the ball after dribbling into midfield giving them a run on goal? Or his hospital passes?

3206~~~
He has way too much work to do covering left and right of him IMO, he needs a partner bought in this summer. His injury is the most disappointing aspect of today's game, hope it's not serious.

3207~~~
I do, I was referring to his defending in my post, though. We all know that he somewhat struggles on the ball.

That incident specifically, though, could have been avoided had Evans not put him in a sticky spot with no passing options or angles.

3208~~~
The amount of times he ends up on right back position defending against opposite winger one on one is ridiculous.

3209~~~
True, but he should have got rid. I think Evans coming on gave the whole defence the hebegebees. He starts making panic gestures with his hands as soon as he can't find a pass, he is the opposite of a strong leader out there.

3210~~~
It does my head in! We really need a specialist RB.

3211~~~
they're just frustrated so they play the blame game, SMalling's the last man to be blamed. His neverending covering for incompetent Valencia is ridiculous..

3212~~~
He should have got rid, definitely. I suppose this kind of thing is something we'll have to expect from time to time under Van Gaal, given he'd rather not see our defenders just boot it.

3213~~~
Ay, he's genuinely covering the whole right side of the pitch every week.

3214~~~
What annoys me is him running with a ball for X yards then even when there is more free space to run or pass,he pass it back almost to same line from he started his run.

3215~~~
Hope the injury was nothing serious. He continues to impress me more and more with each game this season. Felt like he was turning a corner with his injuries, but when people like Rooney are starting to pick up knocks then no one is safe <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3216~~~
Should be fine for Arsenal then presumably.

3217~~~
Phew... But cramp?!

3218~~~
The only thing here that's extreme is your criticism of Smalling. He's had an excellent season. It's baffling how you can constantly defend Valencia then jump on Smalling as soon as he has one iffy game. He's been covering for Valencia's mistakes for months. If anyone is being accommodated its Valencia and Smalling is the one having to do it.

Edit: just saw you're latest posts in the Valencia thread. Damn you <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3219~~~
Shaw and Rooney are fine as well. So, all the meltdown due to the injuries were unwarranted <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3220~~~
Better fitness record than useless ass Evans and Jones. Even Rojo is struggling now

3221~~~
Our best CB by a mile but feck me he's raw and inexperienced

3222~~~
Not sure about the freekick. He was the one being fouled. The ref got conned. Should he have done something differently? The guy hardly ever gives away a free kick. Im not going to jump on him over one foul.

He made one other error where he got caught in possession when he should have just put his foot through it. It was a poor ten minutes.  Wouldn't say he was awful by any stretch though. His errors just seem to get more scrutiny for some reason.

3223~~~
Maybe because he's a good player?

3224~~~
Was one of his worst performances in a while. His first half was fine but the second I thought he struggled (though the whole defence was under siege so it's not entirely his fault). The goal was clearly not his fault. Murray was holding Smalling's arm around him, which to be fair was just smart play. He lacked some confidence bringing the ball out of defence and I thought Evans was better in this regard.

Also, he needs a RB beside him. The amount of time he gets drawn out there because Valencia's positioning is awful is just incredible.

3225~~~
Glad it was only cramp.

3226~~~
Smalling has been one of our best players for some time now. He's really establishing himself as a very good defender

3227~~~
I really like him, but he wasn't good yesterday. However, people labelling him as inconsistent and what not is silly as he has been our most consistent outfield player this season.

3228~~~
Good defender, horrific on the ball. Whenever he has the ball he should just leather it towards Fellaini, it would be the safest thing for everyone.

3229~~~
Both and Jones lacked aerial dominance yesterday.

Very strange. Some days they look like Terry/Vidic-lite, clearing everything in sight.

Then days like yesterday you're shitting it every time the ball goes high.

3230~~~
I'd like to think Smalling was suffering from cramp for the best part of the second half, first half was good, he started well in the second half but then wasn't his usual imposing self, seemed a little sluggish too therefore I suspect he was suffering with cramp for a while before being taken off. Maybe he caught the bug too or was recovering from it.

Anyway its about time someone made a YouTube video of his season where he's been 1 of our top performers. Credit to KaiizoHD, makes some fantastic videos, 1 of the best on YouTube.

It was a free kick, he has a nasty habit of shirt pulling, I really hope he can get that bit out of his game before he gets a bad reputation for it.

3232~~~
The lad is class. He should be the mainstay of our defence for the forseeable future.

3233~~~
This.

3234~~~
The only issue being he's as injury prone as the rest of our defence.

3235~~~
He missed 6 games this season (groin and hamstring injury), 4 games last season (hamstring injury), 15 games in 2012/13 (metatarsal fracture), 2 games in 2011/12 (head injury) and 0 games in 2010/11.

Apart from that one injury in 2012/13, he's not been that bad in comparison to Jones/Evans.

3236~~~
Apart from the start of the season, + the Man City suspension, he's been fairly regular for us.

3237~~~
He would be one of the best CBs in the world by now if he would have had professional coaching since he was a kid.

He has improved at a crazy rate this year, it's great to see!

3238~~~
Smalling spending all that time at time at RB was criminal and, personally, I believe it put back his development as a CB by 12 months.

3239~~~
Add the niggling injuries and the rotating door treatment he got playing CB to prolong Vidic/Ferdinand's careers, no surprise he's only coming into his own with the potential he always had now.

3240~~~
6 yellow cards in 150 games for us. One sending off.

No yellows this season apart from the double-yellow sending off at City.

Rio had 35 in 451 for comparisons sake. Not doing too bad. 

(stats all from transfermarkt)

3241~~~
I seem to vaguely remember, didn't Ferdinand go like 50 odd games without a booking? That's pretty crazy.

3242~~~
I think it was without committing a foul. Also, pretty crazy.

3243~~~
Actually, he's still playing at RB when having to cover for all of Valencia's feckups.

3244~~~
Didn't have a great game by this seasons standard but he wasn't one of our worst players at the weekend by any stretch. Overall I think he's come on leaps and bounds, can't wait for him to get a proper pre-season under his belt and hopefully a stable partner for next season.

3245~~~
That is making his performances all the more better.

He has been dominating that right hand side and the only real big mistake was the foul against west brom.

3246~~~
His house was on fire?

3247~~~
<span style="font-size: 18px"><b><span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Premier League - Chris Smalling's hot tub catches fire, firefighters called</b></span></b></span>
<span style="font-size: 18px">
<span style="font-size: 18px">Firefighters had to be called to the home of Manchester United defender Chris Smalling after his hot tub caught fire.

Police patrolling the area spotted smoke coming from the England player’s house and promptly went to investigate, discovering a “large fire”.

Emergency crews rushed to his home on ‘Millionaires’ Row’ in Bowdon, Altrincham, on Tuesday evening after the whirlpool bath caught alight in the back garden.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: “Just after 8pm on Tuesday, May 12, 2015, a crew from Altrincham Fire Station attended a house in Altrincham after reports of a fire in a back garden.”

Watch manager Stuart France said: “Police were in the area when they spotted smoke and reported a fire to our control centre.

"When we arrived it was quite a large fire involving a whirlpool bath and decking, which could have easily become something more serious.

"The police officers who were at the scene used a garden hose on the fire and when we arrived we extinguished it using a hose reel.

“The most likely cause was an accidental electrical fault,” he added.

3248~~~
Chris Smalling. So fecking awesome he can light water on fire.

3249~~~
I blame Valencia for that

3250~~~
Yep, need a new RB

3251~~~
They've done everything they could...

3252~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3253~~~
Captain today <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3254~~~
Good on him. Really started to step up and be the leader of the back line this season.

3255~~~
Pleased that LVG seems to rate him as much as I do.

3256~~~
Fully deserved to get the armband today, he's been one of the few players this season who has a spine and isn't a pussy when the going gets tough. 

As others have said, he should be a mainstay in our back four for years to come.

3257~~~
I'm glad he's got the captains armband. That makes him 3rd captain I'm guessing?

3258~~~
Well done to him, hopefully he stays fit more next season. He's had a good run of games the last couple of months, hopefully it's more then just a little run. The biggest problem for all of our defenders has always been the injuries really.

3259~~~
Me too. Was worried Van Gaal wouldn't be able to see past his below average on ball ability when he first came.

Think Giggs also might have had quite a bit to do with it. I've previously heard Smalling was always rated incredibly highly by both Ferguson and Moyes' coaching staffs. Think he would've strongly put Chris' case forward.

3260~~~
Well deserved

3261~~~
Looks like LVG finally agrees with the caf! Chris Smalling is king.

3262~~~
Arsene rates him very highly too. Chased his tail basically every summer.

3263~~~
Good luck to Smalling today

3264~~~
One step closer to his full transformation to Smallingbauer...

3265~~~
Glad hes got the armband. last 18 months hes come on leaps and bounds and is easily our best central defender. His downfall is the technical side of his game but as long as he keeps it simple and just does the defensive side of things hes a very good player i think.

3266~~~
I thought he was immense against Arsenal. 

Loved how he drove forward into the box after the equalizer, and he looked very disappointed at the final whistle.

I thought he showed real leadership out there.

3267~~~
Great game, along with Ashley Most Improved Player this season … can't include Fellaini (sorry, he's just not a footballer IMHO)

3268~~~
Beast defensively! He will never be a ball-playing CB but is developing into a fantastic defender.

3269~~~
Has improved a lot this season.

3270~~~
Played exceptionally well today.

3271~~~
Loved how he showed a lot of desire to get a goal back, you can see he really wanted to win the match especially as captain.

3272~~~
A great game again. Can't wait till he has an actual RB (Valencia did play okay today, to be fair) and top tier LCB beside him.

3273~~~
Looks good wearing the armband.

3274~~~
His passing was very sloppy today, defense game was brilliant though.

3275~~~
His passing will never be great but then again neither was Vidic's.

Played an impeccable game today and even got forwards a few times!

As long as him and Phil stay fit we will be fine at the back.

3276~~~
Fantastic again today, did well as captain.

3277~~~
Another good solid performance from him and easily our best centre back now.

3278~~~
Fine defensively but absolutely embarrassing technically

3279~~~
Amazing how a centre back plays better when he's played regularly as a centre back, baffling really.

3280~~~
Can't pass for love nor money but has grown into a composed leader at the back.

3281~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3282~~~
He really needs to stop all those ambitious passes from the back. He simply doesn't have the technique to pull them off. He's a good enough defender but he seems to fancy himself some sort of ball playing defender, which he clearly isn't.

3283~~~
lol

3284~~~
Played very well today and it was nice to see him made captain for the match. He's improved so much this season.

3285~~~
I think that community shield game did more harm than good in the long run to us...

3286~~~
He didnt used to try to be. Clearly a LVG influence, and he's become much better at it

3287~~~
Now to find a partner for him this Summer.

3288~~~
Hummels. Perfect combo.

3289~~~
From the little I saw at the match, seeing him run up to join the attack was just badass even if it gave me a heart attack thinking we were exposed. Proper captain moments they were! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3290~~~
Sadly, or perhaps not too sadly, I was on a plane from Miami to the Dominican Republic during this match so missed it all. Sounds like another furthering of my #SmallingPlusOne campaign though. I think we should petition it and send it to Louis.

3291~~~
Well he made him captain today, so I think (hope) he has finally got the memo.

3292~~~
Reminds me of;

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy_BKKnHgas?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

(Hopefully there are some IT Crowd fans here!)

3293~~~
Beast of a defender but whats the point of his bursts past the halfway line if he can't complete a pass after it?

3294~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Smalling is possibly my favourite player at United, but he needs to cut that out or even better, learn how to pass the ball.

3295~~~
Was very good defensively but his passing was off. He hit one or two early on that were quite good, but after that he put them out which was disappointing. Hopefully he keeps working at it and can improve.

3296~~~
Yep. Would love to see that. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3297~~~
great defender but an awful passer. still he is like a brick wall for strikers to get through.

him and jones make a fine defensive partnership but we need a signing to get us to another level here.

hummels-smalling could be perfect, with jones and rojo as cover. they all will get 30 appearances each still.<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

3298~~~
He played a worldy of a 50 yard pass to young early in the game, his passing went down hill from there. He had a really good game today and he is coming along nicely, one more in the summer to play alongside him and the legend that is Phil Jones as a backup, perfect.

3299~~~
He is good defender we all know it,
Only issue is, can he stay fit for at least 10 consecutive game?

3300~~~
As someone who's been quite vocal about not rating Smalling, I think he played well yesterday. Still a bit bambi on ice when on the ball but a much stronger showing imo.

3301~~~
He is developing into a top pure defender. He needs to stay at Carrington in the summer and work on his passing though, yesterday was a bit of a horror show in that regard.

3302~~~
good season for him.

3303~~~
The fact that he was captain yesterday really shows his development - he has definitely stepped up in that regard, and is much more vocal and commanding than previously.

3304~~~
How many has he played in a row now? Seems to have played quite a few consecutively.

3305~~~
I thought he was very good.

A Jones-Smalling CB partnership could develop into something a bit special <span style="font-size: 26px">if</span> they can both stay fit for 30-ish league games each season.

(that's a very big if btw)

3306~~~
Thought he was pretty solid. A really good season for him overall. Hopefully he continues to improve and goes on to become a top, top CB.

3307~~~
Didnt see the 2nd half, but was solid in the first 20 minutes. He needs a new partner imo, his distribution will improve with that.

3308~~~
It would be good if he kept developing as a leader too. The whole 'my captain must play' thing from van Gaal is going to cause issues as long as Rooney is captain and not performing well.

3309~~~
Another solid outing from him today, hope we get him the right partner for next season.

3310~~~
Solid top defender.

3311~~~
Again couldn't really fault his defending, but on the ball he has no confidence whatsoever in passing the ball forward. Also seems to get it stuck between his feet a lot. 

Good season overall though for him but he needs to continue to improve and stay fit next year.

3312~~~
Only his constant injuries stand in the way of him becoming an excellent central defender. Please stay fit, Chris.

3313~~~
Put him next to a defender who's composed passing the ball and I think Smalling will pick it up slowly. That's his only downfall (as well as being a little bit injury prone but he can't help that at times).

3314~~~
If he keeps improving like he did over the last 6 months, he will become a top class defender and our new captain

3315~~~
He can look back on his performances after City away with some satisfaction. Now he needs to back that up for a full season next.

3316~~~
Can Smalling and Jones stay injury free for an entire season?

If they can then we don't really have a need to buy a new defender.

3317~~~
Apparently they've started nine games together at centre half this season and we haven't lost.

Those two, Rojo, a new central defender and McNair should be able to cope with the extra games next season. Evans sold and Blackett loaned out.

3318~~~
Would you bet our season on Smalling and Jones staying injury free? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3319~~~
Its clear to see that those two are the future of the England national team etc. etc. etc.

Can we deal with another injury crises like we did this year though? Huge gamble for LVG to take if he chooses not to bring in a centre back.

In an ideal world both Smalling and Jones will stay fit for most of the season and we will have a similar backbone to teams like chelski.

3320~~~
Settled that hes the best CB we have then ?

3321~~~
No way. We definitely need another Centre Half this summer and we'll get one.

3322~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Great defender.

3323~~~
He needs to learn how to control a football. I love him as a defender. Big, strong and a good header of the ball. But feck me he almost falls over at every first touch.

3324~~~
He's got better as the season progressed. Definitely seems to have improved his distribution. Our best defender this season. 

6/10

3325~~~
He's been our best centre back this season, which isn't really saying much because it's one of our weaker positions. He's looked excellent at times, but is still fairly prone to poor performances or dodgy errors. Still though, plenty of improvement from him considering he was starting to look like a written-off crock a while back.

3326~~~
He never looks like he's in control of the ball and anything other than the obvious simple pass seems beyond him and his technique.

But then again, he has improved and did defend very well at times. No doubt been our leading CH this season.

Still think we need better first choice if we are to win the title and be strong in europe.

3327~~~
not his best game today but over the season he was composed, passed reasonably well and had good balance

today was bad Smalling where he looked awkward and panicked at times but these performances have been less common

hopefully the progress will continue next season next to a strong dominant CB

3328~~~
It's just the way he looks playing the ball, clumsy is the word" which leads people to discredit his ability on the ball, he certainly is not bad but he can take the ball forward from time to time and make a nice crossfield pass, yes he tends to stumble or slip from time to time but he always recovers well never give the ball away easily which is what matters. 

Every player doesn't need to look as composed as David Silva when playing ball..

My MOTM against Hull and top3 United player of the season for me

3329~~~
Ask Getsme.

3330~~~
Good video this is.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzPyAl93AGM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3331~~~
His profile picture looks like he's squeezing out a tough one. True story

3332~~~
He will be right up there

3333~~~
Brilliant compilation, he is reverse Rooney with Young it seems, likes to spray it out to the left. He's been immense this season, he has been good consistently since City away, bar Carrick he has been our most consistent positive factor, with all the others who lost their form in a bit. If his distribution improves, for me he could be the best CB in the league, because pure defensively, I dont know what he's to improve, his distribution holds him back.

3334~~~
Very definitely.

3335~~~
What a great video.

3336~~~
He was pretty close to the finished article at the end of his first season here. Injuries and misuse has held him back.

3337~~~
6.1 Average rating
6.8 Your rating

had a good season in my opinion. 

I'm a big fan of the Smalling-Jones partnership. They complement each other pretty well. I think that if they had a better core of player around them, just the basics to begin with, like a proper healthy left back and a proper healthy right back, our defence could be formidable. 

of course, they have to stay fit as well. It's about time we get a full injury free season out of them.

3338~~~
I think he's an excellent defender. Funnily enough he's always been quality at the defending bit, it's only the rest of his game game and fitness that's needed real work. Defending comes very naturally to him.

3339~~~
If he played for Southampton he'd cost us £30 million easy. If he played for Porto he'd cost us £40 million

He's been easily our best CB for the past 2 seasons, as I've said all along we're lucky to have him. He's my highest rated player according to the stats at 6.9

3340~~~
No, he wouldn’t. He’s had a very decent season and would cost us a fair bit of money, but there’s very little chance he’d go for £30m, and the idea that he’d go for £40m seems a bit ludicrous. We’d be crazy to pay such a fee, anyway.

3341~~~
True, I'm thinking of euros and the Mangala deal. He's better than he ever was. And Southampton are selling Lovren at £20 million, Shaw at 30 and Schneiderlin will probably be 30. Smalling is just as good in his field

3342~~~
Comparing to similar cases can often be a bit faulty though – Andy Carroll once went for £35m after one half season in the PL where he’d been decent, but it doesn’t mean that players like Darren Bent and Peter Crouch were suddenly worth that as well.

I think part of the reason why Shaw went for a lot was because he’s rightfully considered to be an excellent young prospect. While Smalling’s still fairly young and is (hopefully) only coming into his prime years, he doesn’t have that advantage of being an extremely young future prospect anymore.

3343~~~
Great video.

3344~~~
He's as dominant a center back you get in today's game, but horrendous with the ball at his feet. The only way we can justify having him in the first 11 is to have him playing with a dominant ball player at the back ala Stones.

3345~~~
He's not horrendous with the ball at his feet though. His awkward failing arms make it appear like he isn't in control of the ball, but he's fine at playing it simply to the wing or Carrick/Blind and he's learnt to stop playing those Hollywood balls. His pass completion was 89% this season.

3346~~~
His on ball ability is fine though a bit rough around the edges. Rarely gives the ball away, and when he actually attempts to make a tougher/higher risk pass there's usually a pretty high reward attached to it. He's put in Young quite a few times this season with a few beautiful diagonals, though inevitably as he's a defender first he's also miscued a few of them.

Though obviously, it'd be great if he continued to work on it and developed the ability to play those a bit more often.

3347~~~
This criticism of Smalling is becoming increasingly invalid imo. In each of our last two league seasons he has either been in the team or on the bench for 30/38 games. He does pick up the odd injury like most players but has never been out for long and has been available the vast majority of games. 

Jones is a bit more of a problem, his numbers are 24 and 26. Not awful but not good enough. 

I agree with you that the partnership has a lot of potential and that a fit Shaw plus a good right back would have made a huge difference this season.

3348~~~
Kind of sums up our defence this season, our best defender is 6/10.

3349~~~
Wow, so many good moments this season. I'm a big fan

3350~~~
He has improved this season in some aspects of his game for sure. Was our best defender, but that's hardly a great accolade this season, all things considered.

3351~~~
Thats why I picked out two clubs who consistantly get a premium for their players and who consistantly have buyers for their players anyway

3352~~~
Got bored and watched highlights of the Anfield game, noticed his voice at 2:30 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2cK-kDJq2c?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3353~~~
2:13 gave me goosebumps. Whose voice is that screaming at the goal.

3354~~~
It really is.

3355~~~
Alot of comments were saying Rooney but it's hard to say.

3356~~~
Bit of a random bump but this doesn't really deserve its own thread either.

Smalling just tweeted these pics of his holiday and I was just thinking it's great a more cultural holiday with his girlfriend, rather than Jack Wilshere-esque pictures of our players on piss ups in Ibiza smoking in swimming pools surrounded by models. In the main we've got a great record for players behaving and generally being a drama-free club of all that bullshit. Smalling leads by example in this department. Following his captaincy against Arsenal (I think?) I can really see him becoming our main captain in years to come.

3357~~~
