Express your feelings here.

70 mins of running the midfield in hard conditions took its toll. If he had been taken off for another midfielder, maybe Fletch, I would have said fine LVG obviously wasn't pleased but seeing as he bought Chicha on I think it was to do with the fact he was fading. In the first half he shared the running responsibility with Herrera, in the 2nd half it was only him.

Integral to the 1st and 2nd Rooney goal. Very good performance, will be surprised if he's not a midfield stay and in with a shout for permanent captaincy.

3~~~
A slightly worse version of Joe Allen.

4~~~
We are so shite since he is off

5~~~
Was pretty average. Started off very poor but got better.

6~~~
A lot of the time I forgot he was playing.

7~~~
He was decent.

8~~~
Decent game but all in all not United quality I'm afraid.

9~~~
Average performance from him today in my opinion.

I feel like he can do a job for this team but certainly not as a starter.  Think he'd be a decent option against the weeker sides.

10~~~
Gave the ball away in his half 3 times. I think Van Gaal said Cleverley was going to be the only one who gets 90 mins today (although the commentators during the game said Blacket would too) no surprise he didnt make it.

11~~~
The thing I don't understand is before the game people were saying he'd play better in a quick passing team, which is precisely what we had in the 1st half in which he played an important role, but as soon as we bring on wingers the only player he links up well with is the only player who you can say actually favours a quick passing game and that was Kagawa.

Its safe to say we lost any measure of control we had on the game after he was taken off, which is surprising seeing as he was playing with makeshift midfielders.

12~~~
He was poor first half and improved the second half a bit.

13~~~
Decent, a shocker in the first getting caught in possession but tightened it up thereafter.

14~~~
Coming into this thread reminds me that when I can't watch a game for whatever reason I shouldn't necessarily look to the matchday thread for a summary. I take it he wasn't the walking disaster that he was made out to be over there?

15~~~
This match just proves further that we need to buy at least one midfielder. Clev's just not good enough to start, he has a great engine but offers nothing more than running. I don't want him to leave but i also don't want him anywhere near our 1st eleven.

16~~~
Cleverley, the worst player in the history of United, gets subbed off and the team instantly gets put under massive pressure and lose 2 goals. It's safe to say Cleverley is the reason we almost lost today and the reason Moyes failed last season.

17~~~
If anyone was then its between him and Amos. Generally the typical Cleverley performance but with 3 sloppy bits of play in his own half losing the ball

18~~~
Who replaced Cleverley's midfield role?

19~~~
Put himself about and got stuck into a few tackles. Dawdled on the ball a couple of times and only one real slack pass. Did look up and spread the play okay as well. Something to build on and we did miss a player like him when he went off.

20~~~
Lingard. Joining a midfield containing Kagawa

The most important part

21~~~
He lost a couple of duels challenging for the ball, but other than that it was a typical Cleverley performance. Tidy, nothing special but not too bad either. Nothing worth making a big deal out of!

22~~~
Van Gaal was that disgusted with the performance of Cleverley he subbed on a striker just to show that he favoured a midfield of Kagawa, Nani and Lingard over Cleverley. Disgusting performance and he should be sold to West Ham where he will find his position in a bottom-end team.

23~~~
Exactly why the midfield looked like crap as soon as he went off. It wasn't because he's decent. It was because he was replaced by a player that isn't a midfielder. No idea why Blue Always Red doesn't see it that way.

24~~~
He will become a Sunderland or Villa player.

25~~~
Even if we don't sell Cleverley, we need another midfielder who can actually influence the match this season. Another Herrera would be great.

26~~~
Some very poor moments (in the first half), overall decent enough, I suppose. Hard to tell with that set-up today, we looked a bit shapeless to me in the second half, ending the match with Kagawa in the middle "partnered" by...Lingard. Or Nani. Or something. Certainly wouldn't be in favour of selling poor Clev given our other current options, he's miles better as a central midfielder than any of those, at least.

Bit worrying that he was subbed off - since I thought giving him the armband meant ninety for him, like with Fletcher last. Could have been completely knackered, of course - it was bloody hot, by the look of it.

27~~~
Is it fair to then base judgement of his game on his second half performance when he was playing with a winger and a No. 10? Rock solid in the first half, had a hand in the 1st Rooney goal and was integral to the penalty.

28~~~
Absolutely agree. Kagawa and Lingard as the CM would make Joey Barton look amazing after being subbed.

29~~~
What? He was worse in the first half

30~~~
He didn't have a rock solid first half. The team as a whole was bad, but players like Herrera, Mata, and especially Rooney had moments where they were threatening. Cleverley had nothing of the sort.

31~~~
I don't see that performance having given Van Gaal any confidence in him.

32~~~
I thought he was going to play the full 90 today... Any ideaw hat happened?

33~~~
You're completely glossing over the fact that for the first 30minutes of the match, and the first 20 mins of the 2nd half Roma were the better team, in control of possession and pace. All this happening with Cleverley on the pitch. 

Plus, their first goal was a wonder goal, Pjanic was deep in his own half Cleverley wouldn't have been near him had he been on the pitch.
The second goal was a harsh penalty. But their build up play was similar to what they had been doing all while Cleverley was on the pitch, the difference was that they got a penalty.

It's not like Cleverley was the difference between us keeping a clean sheet. And he was the glue that held the entire midfield together, breaking up play, winning the ball back etc

He didn't play badly but he didn't impress and this was the game where as a captain he should've impressed.

34~~~
His performance up until the point LVG had seen enough and took him off happened.

35~~~
The crowd wanted to see Hernandez in action. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

36~~~
Can I just ask a quick question guys. When we played 3-5-2 the other night, who did we have? Fletch - Herrera - Mata right? Who did we have tonight? Clev - Herrera - Mata right?

Forgive me if I am mistaken but Cleverley played in the same role as Fletcher and if you're asking the holding/DM to be threatening, you're asking the wrong question... 

There were also 2x where Herrera knocked the ball out of play trying to pass it to Valencia, but his name is not Cleverley so...

37~~~
No, actually it was Herrera who was mostly falling back, playing deeper because Tom was invisible most of the match. With Fletcher, he's had plenty of more freedom to go around and playmake.

Speaks volumes when a 30 year old midfielder that went through a lot of health problems that stopped him from playing football for nearly 2 years makes you look like a fecking pub team player.

For all the build-up tough talk it was yet another disappointment from him.

38~~~
Was thinking about Crewe Alexandra.

39~~~
I know this is harsh. But I'd rather have Fellaini in the team than him. Atleast he'd elbow a few people.

40~~~
Is this not how we set out to play, a similar setup to Holland, no? They had more possession, but apart from the ball over the top in the 1st few mins which caught our back 3 flat footed they didn't have any clear cut chances. If Nani and Kagawa were renowned hard-workers who are known for their running, I'd agree and say Cleverley wasn't holding the team together, but when these attacking players gave the ball away needlessly, there was only 1 midfielder running around in those conditions. He basically did the running of 3 men after the 1st half.

41~~~
There was also a few times where Herrera tackled at crucial moments either in the middle of the park, or one particular moment where he wrapped his legs around the ball from behind as the Roma player was entering our box.

I can't remember anything memorable that Cleverley did.
He passed forward a few more times which I remember making note of, but I honestly cannot remember anything else that he did.
If you can feel free to tell me I'm wrong.
Even Kagawa, who isn't a CM played better in that position.

42~~~
He's bang average, simple as that.  If he played for Chelsea, Liverpool, City or Spurs we'd take the piss something chronic.

Get rid, we're Manchester United not Hull City.

43~~~
Good points. However what you do expect from that deep central midfielder is to keep the ball and not give it away in silly areas. Cleverley did this more than any other player on the pitch, which isn't too like him generally but it happened tonight and was very poor

44~~~
Poor today. Doesn't force the issue or control possession, and today he had three horrible losses of the ball as well. Disappointing after the faith LVG showed in him.

45~~~
Just before we won the penalty he was involved in a 3 pass move before he switched play to the right and then the ball was played back and we won the penalty.
Around the 63-64 minute mark he played a 1-2 with Kagawa and hit a peach perfect ball over the top to Keane who failed to capitalise.

46~~~
If he played for us he'd perform about as well as Joe Allen. In the right system he can be good, but the right system for him is probably a 4-3-3.

47~~~
He's a youth team player. He'd come good when he's 30. 

But you are right. If he played for Liverpool, we'd have a thread dedicated to mocking him.

48~~~
van Gaal didn't need 90minutes to tell Clev is shite?
Anyway I do agree if he came from city/Liverpool's youth team and played in their 1st team regularly, we would be laughing our asses off right now.

49~~~
Not good enough today, struggled for most of the game, did improve a bit but didn't really make the most of his opportunity, I agree with what Cleverley was saying about him being the type of player who LVG likes, the problem is he just isn't very good and doesn't offer enough to the team. I really do think he would struggle for games at least half the premier league sides because there is just nothing about him that stands out.

He runs around a lot and is an average all rounder who keeps possession ok but that is about it, unless he improves dramatically in a short period of time I wouldn't want to see him anywhere near the first team and with only a year left on his contract maybe it is time to move him on.

50~~~
More importantly if he was playing for West Brom and United were linked with him for £6 million we'd laugh it off because he'd be tens of names down the list of cms to sign from premier league teams. We wouldnt be looking at him.

51~~~
Joe Allen is bang average too.  Swansea City level.  We're Man Utd, don't want that kind if player here if we're to improve and challenge for European trophies.

52~~~
He's just not good enough. We need to be looking at players that will help us win the champions league and the premier league. Players of the highest quality and he is no where near that.

53~~~
Guys, I feel I'm coming across a bit to aggressive in my points but understand I am not saying Cleverley was the best player on the pitch. I just feel that sometimes the expectations and resulting analysis of him are a bit skewed. Had he played further forward I would have been very disappointed with his performance as in the 2nd half he offered nothing going forward, but I think he had a reasonable game and he was involved in some of the better attacking moves we had.

54~~~
You have to have players like Allen and Cleverley in your squad. You aren't going to have a team full of Vidals. They are more than good enough to be squaddies in teams that want to compete for major honours.

55~~~
You're reaching if you genuinely believe he was integral to that first goal, it was Mata's backwards deflection that caught the defenders off guard, not Cleverley's linear forward pass. But I'll give you that.

The 1-2 again isn't something that's memorable or game changing because honestly it's the type of thing that he should be doing every game. Kagawa provided that pass more often and he was on the pitch out if position for only 45 minutes.

And bringing up two instances in a 70minute appearance as captain, as evidence of him playing well doesn't really help your argument.

Again he wasn't the worst player but he's not more than a squad player

56~~~
We've had too many Cleverly's and not enough Vidals for too long now.  I know what you're saying but Tom has had his chances here, he's not good enough.  It really is that simple in footy - if you're a bloody good player, you make a squad like Man Utd's.  If you are bang average, you move to somewhere suited to your abilities i.e. Ipswich Town in Clev's case.

57~~~
Quite honestly I think he was poor.  van Gaal must have given him the armband today to gauge his mettle and he simply didn't do anything to take charge of the opportunity.  I've lost track of how many times Cleverley has been almost stripped of the ball deep in our own half or he's gone to play a ball without having any awareness of who's around him.  None of this hurt us today but in the PL matches any of these errors could cost us goals.  He is simply not the surest player on the ball and doesn't have the physical presence to take control of what's going on around him.  I also think Herrera's play this afternoon was compromised in having to play deeper.

Having said that, we cannot sell Clevs until another player has been signed.  He is still probably the best MF option after Fletcher, which says a lot about the state we're in.

58~~~
Was pretty average today in my opinion. I think the main problem with Cleverley overall is that doesn't really have any outstanding qualities. In terms of creativity and passing, I'd say Mata, Herrera, Carrick and Kagawa are all better than him. Carrick is better in the DM holding role recycling the ball and Fletcher can still just about put a shift in there. None of our central players are particularly good at tackling including Tom. Fellaini hasn't been good for us either, but at his best he can be a presence in either penalty area because of his height and he offers something different to our other CM players. I don't dislike Cleverley by any means, but I don't think he's going to make it. Would love to be proven wrong.

59~~~

60~~~
Yeah I really wanted him to impress me but right now, he's a squad player at best.

61~~~
Playing deeper? Not from what I saw. Herrera got up the pitch quite a bit. If you expected him to be in and around the final third all of the time, that's not going to happen with a midfielder like Cleverley as he's not defensively solid enough in the deeper role.

Cleverley didn't do too badly on the ball and was decent at winning the ball back. However, he isn't a midfielder who possesses the defensive nous to play a deeper role. If Herrera or Kagawa is to partner Cleverley, we're going to have problems unless Cleverley develops the defensive nous and awareness to play a deeper role, which is almost impossible at this stage, IMO.

62~~~
Cleverley did feck all as usual & gave possession away due to his head facing the ground. He never looks up - he's a headless chicken!

Captain of United - what a frigging embarassing joke that was. Makes a mockery out of that honour!!

Anyone here thats gonna crap on about Cleverley's potential & all that bollox - can just refrer to the fact; LvG said at the presser yest that he'll play the full 90 mins. He played 63 mins if memory serves & was turfed off because he was as useless as ever.

I hope to God LvG has woken to what 95% of football fans have already seen from that lad. Who cares if he came through the ranks - he shouldnt be at United anymore..

Herrera didnt have a good game either, but he has it in him to excel & its only his 2nd game - after a stormer of a 1st game. Shaw was pretty average for most of the half, but improved. I've no worries about either Shaw or Herrera. Top players!

Same cant be said about <i>"Clevz23"</i>. He's so far away from being good enough for a top 10 team thats it's unreal he gets to captain United. 

Is he even good enough for a top 10 Championship club? I'm not so sure..

63~~~
Yes but again you're disregarding the fact he wasn't playing as a creative midfielder... We had Kagawa and Nani playing in the positions that Herrera and Mata had occupied in the 1st half and they were our creative outlet in the midfield. Cleverley played 1 position during the whole game. If LVG wanted him to be more attacking he would have brought Fletcher on, moved Cleverley forward and asked him to play some more memorable balls.

I think that certain position is cursed if I'm being honest. Fletch received stick after the Galaxy game with people saying he's finished as a CM and that CB should become his new position. It's not a glamorous position, however the speed at which we shifted the ball from midfield to attack is something Cleverley helped with in the first half.

64~~~
You reckon he could do a job when called upon?

If Cleverley, Anderson & Nani are squad players come the start of the season - we're f*cked. Fergie's project with that trio didnt work - so scrap it & do it now..

65~~~
I reckon he could do a job in the easy FA Cup/League Cup games. Maybe come on as a sub for some of the lower midtable teams too.

I don't think he's so bad that he shouldn't be playing for any PL club, he's just not the quality United are looking for in a first team midfielder.

66~~~
Atleast Anderson and Nani have shown some sort of promise. I could understand in the past why people wanted to give them another chance. 

I'm not sure what Cleverley has shown that fans think he'd come good.

67~~~
Van Gaal will look at that performance and will realize that Cleverly isn't the man to pair Herrera with in the middle.
He is ok as a squad player but that's as far as it goes its sad to say.

68~~~
This sums up my view, if we are going to play with Herrera as an AM and Mata as a #10 then we need a boss in there with them. Cleverley is neither a DM or a deep lying playmaker, he's just a nothing midfield player of average ability who has had more than enough chances.

69~~~
That is the truth!

70~~~
I think the reason Tom came off was that the fans were chanting for Chicharito to come on since the 2nd half began..

71~~~
I seriously doubt that.

72~~~
Fletcher seems a better fit with Herrera, and Carrick should be too, so Cleverley looks to be a squad player at best.

73~~~
Seen he was given the captaincy in the press conference and LVG went out of his way to point questions to him, putting him in the spotlight, insisting he would play 90 minutes in public, clapping him on the back several times, think it was a test, he gave the ball away a lot and got pulled after 70 minutes, don't think it worked out.

74~~~
Tom and Blackett were the one's LvG could take off and I think he did it to please the fans.. nothing much to read into.. we had no need for another striker

75~~~
Dunno, I would say it's a real possibility that's exactly what happened.

76~~~
Does LvG really strike you as someone who makes his team decisions on what the fans are chanting?

77~~~
I'm sorry Raw, he drives me up the walls when i see his name on the teamsheet. He thinks he's better than he is & thats pathetically bizarre given how mediocre he is.

United folk keep giving him chances because he's been at the club since he was 13 or something & that type of logic is becoming cringey. If you're not good enough - you shouldnt be there..

Fletch got alot of stick, but he was our top CM prospect before his career was held back with serious injury when he was on the fringes. He came good & full-filled his potential because he was aware of his limitations & he worked on them so hard to become a fantastic footballer for the club.

Cleverley is that typical English footballer living on Easy Street & has his people blowing smoke up his arse all the time. He thinks he's Xavi or something..

Anderson & Nani are on Easy Street - same as <i>Clevz23.. </i>Get rid of them asap & free up space for players that are good enough & are up for it!

78~~~
So it had nothing to do with the basic fact, that he was his usual utter shite then?

Van Gaal said yest at the presser that Cleverley would play the whole match - yet he took him off around 60 mins?!

The penny has dropped for Van Gaal regarding Cleverley. Every football fan - apart from a minority of United fans, rate him as a Championship player at best!

I wish folk would wake up & show some ambition. Players like Cleverley, Nani, Smalling, Jones, Fellaini & Chicarito to name but a few - will not get us back to top of the tree Domestically or in Europe ever.

This place is sometimes like Rawk ffs!

79~~~
Thought he looked poor today. I worry for Tom, I think his days are numbered here. Another utd player who could end up at either Everton, Hull or Stoke.

80~~~
Hold on a second, let me make it very clear I don't rate Cleverley at all, and don't believe he is anywhere near good enough to be playing for United.

All I was commenting on was that it seemed very possible to me Van Gaal heard the cheering and decided to bring Hernandez on.

81~~~
Didn't do himself many favours. Who cares?  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

82~~~
Well, when we loaned him to Wigan he looked a real prospect at the end of that season. We need to write off last season anyway. Lets get behind the lad and see if he can regain his confidence.

83~~~
Fair enough Tom. Good man.. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

I hope your name isnt in reference to Cleverley though? <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

84~~~
That was about 4 years ago and McCarthy outshone him during that spell. Anderson and Nani looked good 4 years ago.

85~~~
All due respect LW, but big deal - that was years ago. Sure Anderson looked the business (<i>"..and he shittttts on Fa-bre----gas..."</i>) in his debut season with us in 2007/08 & look how thats turned out?!

Ask your level-headed non-United mates what they think of our squad & most of them will say we're a bunch of deluded mugs having him, Anderson & Nani still at the club - not to mention Smalling & Jones, to name but a few also!

86~~~
Clevs was way ahead of McCarthy back then. McCarthy has built on his promise though, alas with Everton. As for Anderson and Nani, they will always look good a few games a season but between injuries and lack of motivation they will never go anywhere.

87~~~
This is the worst thing a football supporter can do and I'm not proud of it but I sort of... want cleverly not to do well. 

I've seen enough of him and any good performances I'm afraid will just create an illusion to us that he's good enough or something. I want Van Gaal to see he's not. Maybe it's just the anger of last season in me that's doing all of this.

88~~~
The last time we won the league (2012-2013), Anderson played almost half the games and was stunning during the early period of the campaign. 

I am not a fan of Nani or Smalling, but Jones looks like he can have a future at the club.

89~~~
Well... It's not happening for him, is it?

Apart from his skill, one thing that worries me, is his stamina. Even if he is playing okay-ish, he looks completely done at 55-60 minutes. That's not normal. As for other things, i think he is somewhat over-confident in a situations where he needs to be cautions, like when he is last man in front of back three. He lost the ball allowing dangerous counters quite a lot today. And that was due to him trying some new, complex stuff, while more simple options were available. But when he is in the final 3-rd he is on the contrary lacking confidence. He is way too shy and always looking for a simpler, more safe solution. It's completely upside-down. Although a question remains whether he is actually capable of something sublime, some of the episodes from like 12-13 show that he is, but that was way down the line now.

90~~~
Which games were those exactly?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
And while he did have 17 apps sure, it actually was only 825 minutes, which translates into 9 full matches so to speak. and only 9 times out of those 17 he played more than or 45 minutes. And mostly in the second half of the season(6 times against only 3 over 45' matches in first 18 fixtures).
Fella, you are confusing his early form from 11-12(Arsenal trashing and so on) with 12-13. His first 5 games in 11-12 were basically the only impressive spell he had for United. Over the last God knows how long.

91~~~
I must have been on the "brown acid" then, because i dont remember any of that - far from it! <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Its about time Jones started showing it then, because i havent seen any evidence of him being good enough to help United to clean up at home & abroad..

92~~~
What? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

93~~~
I can't remember that bit too.

Carrick and RVP were stunning in the first half. RVP faded a bit in the second and our defence improved.

94~~~
90 + posts in a Cleverley thread when he did good in poor conditions.

Nothing in the Nani and Hernandez threads when they offered nothing in said conditions.

95~~~
He's thinking of 11-12, where Ando was not at all stunning, he was rather decent for the first 5 games then climbed back into his wheelbarrow and hibernated for the rest of the season.

96~~~
Look, he's a squad player lets not beat around the bush. he isn't starter material, but he does have a place here.

in my book anderson and fletcher/fellaini are more suited to being sold off ahead of clevs, and im not even a massive fan of our tom

97~~~
Livewire's off watching the season reviews since the 2007/08 season, to prove us all wrong & rub our faces in it.. 

I'm bricking it lads <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

98~~~
I think the spotlight is on Clev simply because he was picked as captain by LVG and plays in a position we're absolutely desperate for more signings in. He didn't do good at all, he was fecking awful.

99~~~
Cleaning boots & playing with the academy - where he'd get showed up there aswell..

100~~~
He wasn't awful by any stretch but carry on.

101~~~
It was the season before that Livewire is thinking of iirc. That season where we started brilliantly with Cleverley and Anderson dovetailing in midfield.

102~~~
I'm not going to carry on with anything, as I do want Cleverly to do well, but I thought that he was given a chance to impress and failed badly tonight. What did he do right in your opinion?

103~~~
Hes simply not good enough to start for Manchester United.

104~~~
The spotlight will always be on sub-average players playing for United, & as much as we think everyone else are abu's - football folk know a United-quality player when they see one..

105~~~
Spread play well, was involved in the build ups for goals 1 and 3 I believe, couple of good tackles and interceptions as well.

He wasn't great, I am not saying that but given the conditions and circumstances with our lineup I think all things considered he did good.

106~~~
What is your job in football exactly ?

107~~~
It's clear there will never be a general agreement regarding him but I think if we tried to play him in the PL as essentially the holding CM like tonight we'd be in a shitload of trouble. If he is kept then surely his best role would be as Herrera's back-up.

108~~~
How is he supposed to be good when even United fans call for his head? Think about it.

Cleverley is a decent player. I don't understand why people rave on about him so much. I'm pretty sure it's just another one of those "fad" things. He keeps possession and makes some good tackles. He's not a goalscorer.

109~~~
Championship at best? Give over. The same was said about Gibson and Fletcher countless times, seen it all before. He'll be a decent mid-table prem player when he moves on, just like Gibson. The criticism he gets is over the top, we do need better CM's in the first XI but he's fine for now as a rotation option vs the weaker sides. His performance is being rewritten in here, he really wasn't even that bad.

110~~~
The thing is he's actually learning some defending. Its the one thing thats improved with him over the last 18 months instead of regressing. So maybe after another half a season learning he'll be able to play the deepest role in midfield. Maybe.

Having him as Herrera's backup is like having Djemba Djemba as Roy Keane's backup

111~~~
Thats a pretty lame retort man!

You dont need to have a job in football to understand the game & a players worth / qualities. 

I think many people in football should have the same passion for the game that most of us all have. The normal football fan on the street talks more sense than many managers & pundits do - not to mention players, with a large percentage of them not even watchers of the game..

112~~~
He was pretty poor today. Was average to begin with and made 3/4 crucial errors.

But the criticism he gets goes over the top at times. Certainly won't sell him right now unless we are bringing in 2 starter quality CM's more.

113~~~
And do you reckon your average football fan talks as much sense and knows more than people like Eric Harrison, Fabio Cappello, Roy Hodgson, Sir Alex Ferguson and seemingly Louis Van Gaal ?

He made a couple of errors today, that much is true, he wasn't awful and he has played less than 100 competitive games for us, give LVG 6 months with him and we can see from there. Until then, just get behind him.

114~~~
It's a mix of, doesn't fit the circle jerk narrative and those two are being sold anyway so what's the point.

115~~~
He might be the reason we might push for a move for Vidal now, so we should be grateful really<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">Wishful thinking of course..</span>

116~~~
That's all well and good, most will happily get behind him I'm sure. However if he's somehow the reason that we don't sign another central midfielder well then people are going to be rightly pissed off. SAF failed to address it for long enough because of his bizarre faith in Anderson and Hargreaves who was never going to return. A lot of posters including myself are afraid of a similar trend happening all over again. 

Herrera or not, if we go into the new season with our current midfield, we're in serious trouble. Cleverly's performance tonight doesn't even matter, he's not been good enough for a drastically long time now.

117~~~
I didnt get a chance to see the last game, but my general opinion over last season was that he was a waste of space last season, but that that whole season was a write-off for him, because as an overall limited ability player who in my opinion suited what we should be wanting to do heavily (ie fast recycled pass and move feeding the more talented wingers and forwards) he was very clearly under instruction from Moyes not to play risky balls and not move too far forward, all of which was basically taking a limited player who had lots of average abilities and one clear strength, dynamic pass and move, and then telling him to ignore the one thing he was good at, and play the rest of his average game, there is no suprise at all that he not only didnt excel, but stank.

He well never be world class, his ceiling IMO if all goes well is as a decent sub overall, and as a dynamic player suiting specific types of games, presuming he gets the chance and develops well, but I think a lot of people made assesments out of context and utterly wrote him off without looking at context at all

118~~~
What this proves  ( as if it it wasn't the case earlier) that we need a bloody top class Cm even though we signed Herrera. 

I am shocked LVG has to even assess that part for a month.

119~~~
His biggest problem is that he doesn't have an outstanding quality to fall back on when things aren't going well for him.

120~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's a bit harsh, I thought the general consensus was that is short pass and move game in the final third was his best attribute? I can't see him ever being a proper DM or deep lying playmaker, he just doesn't have the tools.

121~~~
Yeah, feck van Gaal for giving one of his players a proper chance to express himself in front of a new manager. Cleverely was bang on mediocre tonight and obviously van Gaal will take that into account going forward considering who he'll want to bring in and if he'll want to keep Clev in his plans. And how do we know that van Gaal isn't currently pursuing midfield targets anyway?

For me, Cleverley is a squad player. Nothing more, nothing less. As other posters have said, he's a type of player you need in the squad - you can't have a team full of world class players.

122~~~
I have little problem with Cleverley as back up. I understand giving players a chance and all but when its so obvious, you have to make that decision quickly. Now I am not saying "Sack LVG" or anything. I mean I literaly love the man but SAF did this too. Something in the water at the club that they don't see the blatant lack of quality in CM. Cleverley, Felliani, Anderson are player who you can give feck loads of time and confidence but they are never going to be United class. At best each one of them should be a 4th-5th choice CMs for United.

I may sound like a dick but these are a few harsh realities.

123~~~
I don't get the whole 'we need him as a squad player cause we can't have all world class players' argument.

If you want to be the best then you need a squad of players all good enough to start, not a bunch of players who are average and just fill up the squad.

Cleverley needs to be gotten rid of. He'll never be good enough to start and therefore he's not good enough to play. Sell him to Sunderland. They like stocking up on absolute dross and like paying big for it.

124~~~
The term "decent performance" is not allowed in a Cleverley thread, I see. He wasn't "terrible", it wasn't a "disgusting" performance, and he is not "Ipswich Town" level as some clueless poster suggested.

It was another decent performance by a decent squad player. That is all Cleverley is, a squad player. I'm sure we are looking for someone better to start in midfield for us. Calm down.

125~~~
If you have squad of players all good enough to start then it'll cause problems with egos. Not that one should not try to make their squad as brilliant as possible. But it's not life and death. Plenty of title winning squads in history have had players not good enough to start who contribute lots to the team.

126~~~
True but at some point those players tend to get shipped out if they don't step up like 2008/2009 Fletcher- think P Neville, Gibson. Cleverley must be in the last chance saloon in terms of making it here. If he is not going to show any more than he has to date then I would rather a younger player with greater potential be given that squad role. Bear in mind as well that we have less games this year due to no European football.

127~~~
If he can do the ugly side of football without being in the limelight, then he'll be a good squad member.

128~~~
The problem is he doesn't really have any discernible qualities and putting him in the team at the expense of a potential new signing is weakening the team quite considerably.

129~~~
What's your beef with Smalling? I've hardly ever seen him have a bad game at CB. Excellent again last night. 

Also you're being v harsh on Jones. He's just off a very poor season but has shown plenty of evidence in the past that he has huge potential. Hence SAFs comments about him. Plenty of time for him to come good under thevright manager. Your post smacks of someone reading too many twitter comments as opposed to watching the games and appraising the players properly.

Although your probably spot on re Ando, Cleverly, Fellaini. Simply not up to it

130~~~
We need a team full of United class players though..

Cleverley aint United class & if Everton want him - we should snap their hand off!

131~~~
Don't hate the lad, but I've hated his performances ever since late 2012-13 season. Not good enough plain and simple. Started off well, then tanked and has not shown a glimmer of returning to 1/16th of the form he used to be on. If anything, it's been going from bad to worse.

Decentish player on his own, but not the type that should be playing a minute in a match that matters for United. Definitely a liability, but not a horrible player by any means. Exactly why he should be sold. He can be more than a bench warmer at a mid table club and could even blossom into a good player.

132~~~
That's the trouble with Cleverley, fans expect him to rip up trees in a game. Be content for him to do all the dirty work, a little like Carrick.

133~~~
Glad we agree on something then <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Fergie said alot of things that didnt pan out the way he thought - especially saying Cleverley was the new Scholes. Even more startling are the comparison's Sir Bobby made with Jones & Duncan Edwards..

134~~~
<i>"Dirty work"</i>? - his whole game is filthy.. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

135~~~
Never going to be a regular starter, otherwise he can be alright at times.

136~~~
He's not got the balls or the quality to do the dirty work though.

The ones who do it all have something about them. Carricks positioning and intelligence (passing too), Keane had an unstoppable drive, etc.

Cleverley has feck all. His entire skillset is 5/10 at best with certain aspects worse than that. People say we need squad players but he's not even good enough for that. Get rid.

137~~~
The next couple of months are crucial for him.

138~~~
Just stay out of their way, God forbid anyone should say anything as positive as "he's a good squad player" or this mob will descend. As you say, calm down. LVG knows what he is doing and if he shifts Cleverly so be it.

139~~~
Couple of points. 

Firstly, I'm pretty sure that LVG didn't commit to playing Clev for 90 mins. I am openly critical of him, but it seems some are twisting the manager's words to suit an agenda here. If i'm not mistaken, i'm sure he said 'everyone will play no more than 45 mins, except Cleverley and Blackett' - not that they would necessarily play 90.

As for Anderson, he most definitely did have a great run of form the last time we won the league.  He was slowly playing his way into the team, and was then outstanding at Stamford Bridge in that game that Nani fecked up in,  and then stayed in the side I think.  I remember some highlight moments in games that followed,  like him leaving about 3 players for dead and then playing a nice through pass to Hernandez for him to score against either QPR or Villa think at OT, until the game he was inevitably injured in away at Reading, where he scored a fantastic goal. That game was in December 2012 I believe. I'm sure if people looked back at all the match/rating threads for that game and the ones leading up to it, they would show how well Anderson was playing.

140~~~

141~~~
Problem is, at least half of all the players on our books aren't even United bench quality.

I would like to see him shipped off. I think someone would actually pay a modest fee for him, which is more than can be said for many of the players we need to get rid of.

142~~~
Can I just point out that the position he was played in was to protect the back 4 and recycle the ball. Whilst he was on the pitch we didn't concede. I think LVG brought in Kagawa and Nani, who are not natural midfielders, to see whether Cleverley could control a game on his own. He failed in that respect.

143~~~
Would never expect Cleverley to control a game. Showed no signs of being capable of that when he was on form. A team playing well and he'll do his part. Otherwise he'll just be average depending on the opposition level.

144~~~
Safe passing is his best part. Not creative passing, breaking down tight defences, not dribbling or tight control like Ander.

Just picking a high percentage pass that even when he underhits it, will still get to the player.

He does try to win the ball and he's okay at it. I think we'd lose less with Cleverley covering Carrick than if he was covering Ander.

145~~~
Opposition teams arent scared of us anymore & its pretty obvious the reasons behind that. 

I'm sick of hearing opposition players & managers saying OT has lost its fear-factor & that they fancy their chances goin there - not to mention us playing them at their manner..

We used to have teams beaten in the tunnel because of the players we had lined out - not anymore though!

146~~~
Can't argue with that. But having a safe passer around as a squad option is fine by me - if Cleverley can improve further tactically, whilst remaining a safe player, one who doesn't give the ball away needlessly - he can do a decent job for us against many teams. The fact that he doesn't impose himself on games is a problem - for him. Because it means he'll never become a top class player. But it isn't really a problem for us if our intention is to keep him on as part of the rotation - as someone you throw on to ride out a match, or someone you use against lighter opposition.

147~~~
Heard Paddy Crerand say that he thinks he's improved from last season. I know we're only two matches into pre season but I just can't see in what way he has improved. He's definitely playing for his future at the club without a doubt.

148~~~
He also needs to take more authority on the ball. Every time the ball is played to him he instantly tries to play it first time to someone. Often panics in fact. The safe pass isn't the best pass. Herrera in 2 games has shown more creativity but he's being assertive in possession too. Playing it and demanding it back, dictating the game.

149~~~
He knocked  a couple of decent cross-field passes that I wouldn't have expected of him.

150~~~
I didn't see the game last night. The thing with Cleverley now, as I see it, is that he has no positive effect on a game, even as a squad player. If someone asked me when he last had a good game, or changed a game, I honestly couldn't recall. He vanishes totally in matches, or doesn't seem to want the ball and things just pass him by. It might be down to confidence, but that was definitely a problem last season as well and possibly part of the season before. We had the whole 'I'm being made a scapegoat' thing last season and obvious attempts by the club to make him feel better about himself and now it looks like LVG is trying to do the same, by giving him the captains armband.

At some point someone somewhere is going to have to weigh up whether Cleverley is integral to the squad, or whether it might be better for everyone involved if he moved on and tried to ply his trade elsewhere. He's certainly not good enough for us to be setting up the team in a way that can fit him in, 4-3-3 etc.

151~~~
I just watched the game although tbh I wasn't really focusing on it much but I thought he did alright but did make some mistakes. I think half the problem with these discussions is that the loudest opinions are often too far over to one side or the other. Clev is clearly a PL player, clearly a top 10 in the league player, I just think his level as a starter anyway is for a team looking to get 8-5 not top four. 

I think though that some are overly generous and the comparisons with Fletch aren't fair given that by this age Fletch, regardless of the level of pos/neg bias had towards him, was putting in at least a handful of top performances a season and was serving an important role which was to help make up for the legs of Scholes/Keane but also help balance the team with Ronaldo taking an increasingly smaller defensive role.

It's similar to Henderson, he wouldn't be a starter at one of the big clubs imo because none of them have a player like Gerrard in the middle who is too good to drop but needs protection. Henderson can give him that so whilst he might not be a particularly good player he can serve an important role in the first team. Similar to Milner as well. He helps to balance the team, Park is another example.

With Clev though when you look at his qualities for me I just don't see how he would be a first teamer in an appropriately strong midfield based on his ability nor in a role where he facilitated others playing to their best. But I do think he's good enough as a squad player but I just think at his age and with the ability he has to be an important player elsewhere he should look to move on if that is his role. 

That said I think he is better than he is currently showing and some of it seems to be a mentality thing rather than a lack of technique, because he's got a good touch, a decent range and decent mobility but he just doesn't take enough risks and is far too cautious. His other weaknesses are for me a lack of tactical movement, for me whilst he's a willing runner I often think he puts himself in poor areas and he could be a bit stronger. Both of these he can work on through training, the first point though is hard to overcome I'd imagine.

152~~~
Just watched the game. Nothing spectacular but did a job for the team.

153~~~
this is a poor argument. 1) we're on a forum and discussing cleverley 2) in the public sphere it's ridiculous to criticize your players so those who have worked with Tom/coach him would usually praise him. It's a way to build confidence.

3) learn to post in context. RHD talked about pundits/ex players and some managers. He didn mention anything about the aformentioned ones. 

4) it's not about knowing more but being able to articulate your point well on a player in this thread. 
5) why do you assume Cleverley will get 6 months under LVG?
6) Why are you trying to tell him how to support Cleverley?

154~~~
Just very, very ordinary against Roma, although the conditions didn't help. When he's given an opportunity from the manager and a confidence boost with the captaincy, he just isn't seizing his chance at all and I don't think he has the capacity or mentality too.

I'm very much on the fence over whether we should keep him or move him on. I initially thought van Gaal's philosophy would bring the best out of him, which still might be the case, but it would only serve to proceed his ability. He is very ordinary and doesn't have much capacity for further improvement - 2011/12 was probably his limit.

The managers hand might be forced though. If our search for a new midfielder doesn't intensify or there is nothing in the Vidal rumours, we essentially have just four central midfielders for the start of the season and two - including Cleverley - are average, one isn't a conventional midfielder and one is an unknown quantity in the Premier League.

155~~~
Why do people expect Cleverley to play a more expressive, attacking, role when he's playing alongside Herrera or Kagawa? That doesn't make sense to me at all. If Cleverley played more openly in a central midfield pairing with Herrera or Kagawa, we'd be frequently exposed as was the case when we had Kagawa and Lingard.

Now, if Cleverley played alongside more of a holding player like Carrick or Fletcher (even a new signing like Schneiderlin or Gonalons) under van Gaal and wasn't expressive and attacking in his freer role, then there would be a basis for criticism. However, at this point, I don't see a basis for criticising him for his attacking performance when he's playing alongside Herrera or Kagawa. What he should be criticised for is not keeping the ball well (1st half performance) and a poor defensive performance (again a part of his 1st half performance). Plus, the fact that he looks tired after the 70th minute is worrisome as he's frequently playing as a central midfielder.

156~~~
He just hasn't looked good in the pre-season so far - an anonymous chaser who's been left for dead a couple of times. There's no doubt that he has somewhere within him the ability to be a decent player - that 3 1/2 games at the start of the 11-12 season showed that (although I suspect that a lot of that was down to Anderson who was in the form of his life). Unfortunately, as he's got older, he's got more and more negative in his passing and general decision making. Maybe van Gaal can get him inspired but I don't really see it happening.

157~~~
I can predict what he will do in 9 out of 10 situations. It's much more difficult to create space with him in the team than Herrera.

158~~~
Fletcher played behind Cleverley today. A more attacking, 'memorable' performance, no?

159~~~
I'm not his biggest fan, but I thought he did well in that half. Not as good as Fletcher obviously, but overall a good substitution.

160~~~
He was decent today and recycled possession well. I can't really see much to fault him with today.

161~~~
Very strong performance tonight from Cleverley. Really looked his old self. Confident, willing to take risks with the ball and choosing the right pass, even under pressure. Very happy to see him back to something like the player he was before we lost to Madrid in 2012/13. Van Gaal's arm(band) around the shoulder routine has worked a treat with him. When I read Cleverley's pre-game interview with our official webpage about how he has pictures from the Roma game, and will always remember captaining Man Utd, I knew he'd had a confidence boost. Cleverley's renewed self-confidence really showed tonight.

162~~~
Cometh the hour, cometh the man. I don't want to hear about him 'hiding' ever again. Such bravery.

163~~~
Much, much better from him tonight, good to see him actually getting forward instead of hanging back. Still wish he would attempt more killer balls when the opportunity presents itself rather than choosing the backwards pass though.. But mainly the focus is on the positives.

164~~~
That was a good performance
More please

165~~~
Miles better in every way tonight. I know he played a different role to the match against Roma, but even his tackling was more impressive. Just a better performance

166~~~
Good job Tom. Showed he has some heart and drive tonight that he hasn't shown for some time.

167~~~
Good half from him. More bite and confidence; even tried to volley that bobbling cross. More of the same please.

168~~~
I wouldn't really say Fletcher played behind, they switched around quite a bit. Fletcher got forward into the edge of the box with Cleverley sitting deeper a fair share. Even still as you say much better attacking from him. Great drive from him to get in for that penalty shout which should have been given imo. A few good long balls and some great tackles. Looked much more confident and look forward to seeing more of this from him. van Gaal seems to be already working his magic with Tom.

169~~~
He did ok, I think he looked more at ease in the slightly advanced role Herrera has been playing in.

170~~~
Much better performance from him tonight - good to see, lets keep the improvement up!

171~~~
Played well yesterday, but he still has to improve a lot. What annoys me is that he goes hiding in games a bit too long and that he runs away when the ball is in defence. He suddenly just sprints forward to realise that the ball still isnt played out of it and returns. Herrera was the exact opposite yesterday. Always available and never too far away from Fletcher. Cleverley on the other hand was far too forward when the ball was at the back and we couldnt play out of it. 

Also he stands too far away from players dribbling at him and just looks instead of tackling them instantly, where i was reminded of Sandro last year when he let him come close to the box and he scored, even though he had a great tackle near the end yesterday. Offensively he was good and improved, but his positioning and lack of definsive awareness is a problem for me.

172~~~
Sorry but I feel like you're criticising Cleverley for the sake of it. Herrera did many of the same things you're saying Tom did wrong last night. Cleverley played better than Herrera did against Inter. The entire tempo of our game went up after he took on the #8 role. I'm not saying I think Clev's better than Herrera but you should give him credit when its due: He was sent on to make an impression and he did.

173~~~
He did an impression and i said he improved, but he just isnt good enough defensively in a two man midfield. He played better than Herrera yesterday, but one game cant change the perception i got from him. It is way too much praise for him on here after just one decent game against a team that never wanted to score. Cleverley was definately higher up the pitch than Herrera yesterday and therefore was more often than not unavailable for a short pass from the back line. Herrera is normally solid defensively, Cleverley isnt but can still improve. No question that he was better and like you said upped the tempo of our game, but lets wait and see if he can maintain and improve further. I am not bashing him, it is the first time i write a post about him. I think that he can improve and will play his part under van Gaal, i just wrote what i noticed yesterday and last year about his bad habits.

174~~~
It's a 2 man midfield with 3 CBs behind him, so any defensive shortcomings are mitigated, something else that's helpful about 352 considering our limitations, as we don't have a truly dominant DM.

175~~~
He could be our Henderson next season. Just kidding, we need to aim higher than that. 

Joke aside, he did well and I can see he was oozing confident against Inter. He made a great forward run inside the box, which should have been a penalty and some good tackle and passes aswell. I also realized that even though he does not have the killer pass attribute or crisp movement when on the ball, Cleverly is a number 8.

176~~~
Was a better performance from him last night and he was ok overall but is still some way short of the level required and lacks the technical ability to be effective as a number 8 at this level. Opinions on Cleverley are too extreme, when he plays a few bad passes he is labelled as useless and when he plays a few decent ones or goes on a good run people start saying how good he is. Truth is he is a very average player who wouldn’t get in the starting 11 or probably even on the bench at any of the top 6 or 7 sides but he could be a decent player further down the league. He will have a role to play under Van Gall until we can bring in some better players but the fewer games he plays next season the better. At least he did show some signs of improvement though.

177~~~
Okay player with an okay performance.

178~~~
<a class="username" data-user="80787, @izec" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80787/">@izec</a> <a class="username" data-user="56404, @#07" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56404/">@#07</a>  didn see too much between herrera and cleverley's performances but i would definitely say Herrera is better defensively than Tom. Although his tackling technique may be a bit unorthodox, seems more likely to recover possession than Tom.

The biggest difference between them imo is speed of thought and play.

179~~~
Which is why the manager of the 5th place team has sung his praises and rates him very highly.

180~~~
I don’t really care what the Everton manager thinks to be honest because he would still pick Mccarthy, Barry and Barkley ahead of Cleverley and a few nice words don’t change that. Cleverley would also have Besic, Gibson and Osman to compete with for a place on the bench and he would need to be at his best to be ahead of all of them.

Sure Martinez has said nice things about the likes of Kone, Gomez and numerous others as well so I really don’t think some comments from him are a good way to judge our players.

181~~~
What technical aspects are not good enough?

182~~~
His passing, control, movement, dribbling, everything really, it’s just not good enough at this level, I am not saying he is awful but in comparison to other players and in the context of a team that wants to win the trophies he is a very average player. If he had more pace, trickery or a physical presence then that would compensate but he doesn’t so I personally don’t think he is someone who we can afford to keep playing regularly.

Playing lower down the league or being used as a starter 5-10 games a season to plug gaps then fine but there is a huge gulf in class between Cleverley and players at other top clubs and we need to stop trying to make do with ordinary players otherwise we will struggle to compete.

183~~~
I rewatched the game vs Madrid and he was quite good when we were in possession, some very good passes (both long and short). Positively surprised by that.

However, he takes strange positions while defending. He’s a little Mata-esque in that regard, it’s the weakest side of his game by some distance. He’s so easy to go past it’s incredible at times.  

In that regard Herrera has a massive advantage.

184~~~
He's English so that helps with the quota. Nothing more than a squad player for me.

185~~~
He's always had that. It's just last season our players were forbidden to express themselves properly. It'll take a bit of time for that negative instinct to be driven out of our players. It's the same scenario with Kagawa, he's starting to rediscover his creativity and flair now that we're playing positive football again. But they'll have the stigma of Dave Moyes football attached to them for a while.

186~~~
Great in the build up for the third goal. Amazing two of our scapegoats from last season are amongst our best players this pre season

187~~~
Good ball for Shaw for our second goal, too. He's done well in pre-season, and it's what you expect of Cleverley.

188~~~
He's still average. Too weak and slow.

189~~~
Definition of a nothing player

190~~~
I don't get why you would come in here just to post that? It was a good cameo

191~~~
Cleverley did well after he came on. Liberated Herrera a bit and in the build up to our third goal he played two very cute passes. Also put in plenty of good tackles. A positive step back towards the standards he hit against Inter.

192~~~
Agree, thought he did well tonight but he's a million miles away from a Manchester United midfielder imo

193~~~
Thought he did well when he come on. Was instrumental in the third goal and played a nice switched pass (that everyone seems to moan about when Rooney does it) that resulted in the second.

194~~~
I like Clev but wasn't too impressed with his cameo. Apart from few good passes(including the build up for the goal), he did nothing. If anything he showed how weak he is in one on one situations.

195~~~
Did he feck! He won maybe one challenge and it was an unnecessary challenge on a payer going nowhere, which went straight out of play.
He gets bullied all over the pitch. He shites out of 50/50 challenges and any time he attempts a pass, longer then 5 yards, he gives it away.

Why do people insist on bigging him up for doing the basics? He's a fecking Premier League footballer, the very least we expect are the basics.
He ran around a bit but didn't really do very much. Also don't try and kid me with this, 'what he did was subtle', bollocks. It was so subtle it was basically non existent.

196~~~
Decent performance again.
I'd keep him till christmas, with carrick injured he'll get the odd chance here and there hopefully.
If he takes them then ... i dunno.

The problem is we really do need to buy another midfielder. So hes basically competing against fletcher, carrick and herrera for 1 one the 3 remaining spots.
You'd expect Hererra will take one. Might take him a while to settle but hes shown enough to suggest hes a fair bit ahead of the other 3.

197~~~
Played the ball into Shaw for the Mata goal and played the ball into Young for the Lingard goal. Not sure why he is once again being singled out as the shittest guy on the pitch.

198~~~
Some real blind hatred, he did nothing wrong.

199~~~
DId well when he came on. Better than against Madrid. Still shouldnt be starting. We need reinforcement.

200~~~
Great cross-field ball to Shaw for the second goal.

201~~~
Need better quality in midfield. He would be good for a team like Villa but sadly not for us.

202~~~
Decent performance tonight. Good pass to Shaw for Mata's goal and he did okay defensively as well. 

He's a neat and tidy player with the ball at his feet. He'll be a good squad player in this system.

203~~~
I thought he did ok, played a part in the goal and chased hard, still not enough to be a starter for us, cup game CM for me.

204~~~
Good performance from Tom. Got stuck in without conceding lots of freekicks, involved in the build-up for Lingard's goal.

I do think he's vulnerable if a big name central midfielder arrives. Overall Fletcher has outperformed him on this tour. Hard to see a 5th choice midfielder getting much playing time in this system, in a season without CL.

205~~~
Good performance.  Don't think he is good enough in defense or attack to ever nail down a consistent starting place in this formation in the either of the two deeper lying positions.

206~~~
Showed a real turn of pace to chase down Henderson at one point, I actually thought it was Shaw.

207~~~
let's not go that far

208~~~
I'd rather we gave Cup games to Pearson and Rothwell if it's come to that.

It will be interesting to see what van Gaal thinks of him. 

With the right motivation and teammates I think he could improve markedly.

209~~~
Squadie.

210~~~
He also put the ball over the top to Young that was fed into Kagawa and went to Lingard for his goal.

211~~~
He still lacks a bit of grit to play in that position IMO.

212~~~
He's just too flat doesn't change or set tempos. I just don't see enough guile to make it worth him staying in the squad. We need another CM badly.

213~~~
A bit better this time around but he's still deferring to every other United player on the pitch, which doesn't bode well when your midfield partner is Jesse Lingard.

214~~~
Hasn’t done himself many favours on tour, looked very ordinary, even his better passes are ones that he should be making and he doesn’t play them often enough, nowhere near the standard required to be a starter and he returns home the 3rd choice cm on the tour and with Carrick, Fellaini and possibly a new signing all to be included as well he is probably 5th choice at best. Could be on his way if we receive a decent offer.

215~~~
He is a decent back up but personally I would like to see Pearson and Rothwell given chances to see what  they can do. Tom has had enough chances

216~~~
Two second assists

217~~~
Sometimes I wonder why some on here actually watch football to begin with. It's as though they're watching just to get wound up and spit bile all over the internet. I personally will never understand it, it makes it near to impossible to see any sense or reason about a footballer. Even when he does something decent, it doesn't register.

218~~~
He played well, made some great forward passes that led to two of our goals. Put in some tackles and didn't make many misplaced passes, kept us ticking over in midfield against Liverpool. Won't stop some wankers giving him a 5 rating though! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

219~~~
Clev could score an overhead kick from 60 yards out and people would still miss it. This poor guy will never be appreciated by the majority of football fans because everyone now has the preconceived idea that he is amazingly shit. There was 2 pages of "<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> That ball by Herrera" when Rooney scored the first goal and then there wasn't a single post of appreciation for Cleverley spotting Shaw in space which led to the Mata goal. Infact, I noted down around the 67th page directly after the goal someone wrote "I don't know why Cleverley attempts longballs". The bit of interplay which freed Young down the right was not acknowledged in the match day thread either. The poor guy is even taking stick for making tackles.

Comparing his performance to that of Herrera's, I'm not sure what sort of out of this world performances Cleverley has to put in to get more appreciation than 'Ok'.

220~~~
Clean start for Cleverley next season, if we are moving players on then it I would prefer Anderson/Fellaini to go first so I would afford Cleverley another chance.. 

If no midfield signings further are made then he will have a real chance to play, start fight with Fletch until Carrick comes back from injury.

221~~~
The difference between the two passes is Herrera was under pressure and Cleverley had plenty of time and space and that is why more fuss has been made of it. The pass Cleverley made was relatively straight forward, the interplay with young was better to be fair but he isn't going to get loads of credit for playing a could of decent passes  in 45 minutes. He isn't shit but he isn't good either and he pretty much sums up how average our midfield has become.

222~~~
Everyone is looking for every mistake he makes so they can comment on it. The moment he makes a mistake you end up with a couple of pages of comments.

223~~~
I'm not his biggest fan and think some of the abject performances he has served up over the past few seasons, have been unacceptable.

Lack of competition over recent years have appeared to stagnate his career somewhat. He was getting far too many games, due to a-lack of options in that position, despite putting in very mediocre shifts. It was honestly like he thought he had 'made it' here when, in reality, he should have kept on improving and giving absolutely 100% in every game.

Nevertheless, he's not a woeful player and could be a decent squad player if he can find some semblance of form and grow a pair of balls. I certainly wouldn't sell him for £8m to Everton. Would much rather keep him and see what LvG can do with him, than take such a pitiful fee.

224~~~
That's another argument that pisses me off. Last night he played with balls, playing forward passes, tackling and getting more involved. The lad gets very little praise, his average rating last night is 5.6, which frankly is absurd. Played a crucial part in 2 goals, tackled way and kept our midfield ticking over. We won the 2nd half 3-0, a half that he played the full 45mins. Just seems like people will shoot him down for being on the pitch let alone making a mistake.

225~~~
The non-stop Cleverley bashing is really very strange but I guess there's always got to be at least one.

226~~~
What do you make of him, out of interest?

In my eyes: At best a decent squad player to have against poor and average opposition, who lacks the ability or mentality to be a first teamer in United's midfield.

227~~~
There's such a massive confirmation bias about him now with some people it's simply not worth arguing.

228~~~
What do you mean by ability, its a pretty general term.

229~~~
He's just not a fantastic footballer and he doesn't make up for it with great heart or wonderful physique.

230~~~
He's an okay footballer, nothing more. You'd never see him start consistently for our title rivals. Keep him as a squad player and to fill home grown quota.

231~~~
Meh.  Yeah...meh.   

This ladies underwear Ad at the bottom of the page on the other hand..........meh...

232~~~
Don't think anyone expects that though? Do people really expect us to become Real Madrid and have two superstars in every position? We need players like Clev who are good squad players who can fill in when injuries/suspensions can occur and who are happy to fulfil that role in the squad. I still think Clev has all of the tools to be a very good player, the genuine issue with Clev is that he's good at everything but a master of none. But I still think there's unlocked potential with Cleverley, just needs the right manager to bring the best out of him (which tbf I think LvG can do). He's certainly improved already since the start of the tournament imo, expressing himself more during a game and playing better decisive passes forwards and getting stuck in a bit more. People will cast a blind eye to the positive things though and will instead go mad at him when he makes a mistake.

The Madrid game made me laugh as an example. First 20mins in the 2nd half we played poorly (having just made several substitutions at halftime while Madrid made none), no surprise that we looked rusty give the team had been changed so much. Yet people still complained, as soon as Madrid made their changes we bossed the game again and Clev played well (which was of course on the whole ignored).

I might stop reading Match day threads this season, they just piss me off and it just gives the newbie trolls a platform to make us look like right nobs.

233~~~
If we want to compete with Real Madrid then that's exactly what we need to do surely?

Why, if there are injuries/suspensions do we need players like Cleverley to fill that position when we could simply have a better player?

I will never, ever get this argument. The simple fact that you said 'Do you expect us to become Real Madrid' - a team that are many orders better than we are currently, suggests to me you don't even want us to improve and be the best team in Europe/the world, which is odd.

234~~~
First of all I don't agree with the fact Cleverley has some big potential that still has to be unlocked, he is as you said average, he has always been rather average and imo he'll always stay average. I don't know what potential you see in Cleverley at all, he is clearly way past the he is still so very young we all got to give it a little bit more time phase. He has had plenty of chances and he has almost always disappointed me, even under SAF I never saw Cleverley as a Manchester United quality player and I don't think we'll ever see him like that under LVG or any manager simply because he isn't a Manchester United quality player. The only reason he is still here is because he is english and an academy product and because our midfield options over the last couple of years have been so shite that he stuck out as one of the least shitty shits, but in the end he is still shit and he doesn't belong at a club of this level.

Secondly I don't agree we should just keep players for cover who can fill in when we have injurries and suspensions, I think all players at Manchester United should be good enough to warrant a starting position. Sure one can warrant it more than the other, that is the basis of competition and will bring in the best of these players, but if push came to shove and the second choice needs to fill in for a big game he still needs to be good enough to do a good job and we shouldn't all be shitting our pants at the idea of this guy playing in a big game, even more if things would go really bad and the first choice got injurred for months or even an entire season you shouldn't need to worry about the fact the player filling in will play most of the games. Now I'am clearly not comfortable with the idea of Cleverley starting in the midfield for us in a big game and I'am certainly not comfortable with the idea of him starting most of our games. The reason why is because he ain't good enough to be in the squad period. I'am happy with Carrick and Fletcher providing some cover up and filling in for us when we get injurries or suspensions but I'am not with Cleverley. Imo we need to sign another top CM to partner Herrera and Carrick and Fletcher need to provide cover and Cleverley can go (be sold or loaned I don't even care).

235~~~
I thought he is okay on those technical areas, just quite a bit of headless chicken sometimes and not performing up to the standards.

236~~~
Exactly, remember back in the day when it was Fletcher? There's a subset of supporters who love to slag off on players they deem "not United quality". Right now it's Cleverley, Young and Fellaini. And while I don't think any of those 3 are elite I don't think any of them are near as bad as they are made on to be on this forum.

237~~~
Young is pretty shite winger in 442 system to be fair, Fellaini is just pointless for us.

238~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2717145/Tom-Cleverley-sees-bright-future-Manchester-United-Louis-van-Gaal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...-future-Manchester-United-Louis-van-Gaal.html</a>

239~~~
Young made the PL team of the year twice as a left winger in a 4-4-2 system. Personally I think the issue with Young is the same as with Nani and that is consistent playing time. Some players just need to play week in and week out to play at their best. 

When Nani played consistently he was player of the year and as soon as he went back to being rotated he was crap. The same is true for Young. He started his United career off well, remember the 8-2 Arsenal game? Then injuries and such caused him to be rotated in and out of the lineup and the level of his performances dropped. 

The same is also true for Rooney, when he misses a few games he's quite mediocre before getting in the swing of things. SAF even said as much. Unfortunately for them Nani and Young are never given a chance to get back into a grove, both are usually dropped after one so-so performance.

240~~~
"Under the new manager we are being told to think of things as a team but personally it has gone well. I definitely think I can fit into the way he plays. I don’t think I have got to make much adaptation because he likes passers, movers, and people who understand the game."
"I would still have loved to have gone (to the World Cup) but I think I made it hard for myself to go to Brazil with not playing in the last three months of the season. I played in a lot of the qualifiers, but I’m not bitter about it. I’m fully hoping to get back into the squad and help us get to the next Euros."

I totally agree some of the criticism has been OTT but I can't believe how good I thinks he is.

241~~~
So if people call it how it is and say he's an average player, it's now construed as 'Cleverley bashing'? This place is awful tedious at times. 

I only watched the game yesterday when I got in from work as I had it recorded. I can honestly say that I didn't notice much of Cleverley. Anything I saw was fine and I would give him a 6.5 rating. He didn't appear to do much wrong and made some good passes. 

<a class="username" data-user="21631, @RedSky" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21631/">@RedSky</a> well I have alluded to the fact that I only watched the match after I made my last post. That post had nothing to do with the Liverpool match. If you are trying to tell me that Cleverley hasn't gone into his shell over the past two seasons and played with no balls whatsoever, then I would be genuinely amazed. As for the everyone wants to be like Real and have superstars in every position, what, just what? Has anyone actually said that? I think you will find most are saying he is average and a decent squad player. Have other top PL teams got better squad players in that position? Yes, some do / some don't. So really, we could do better than Cleverley as a 'squad player' but for £8m (the price he's linked to Everton at) we wouldn't do much better, so I'll happily keep him and see how this season goes.

242~~~
He is ok technically but that is not enough at this level when you don’t have any physical attributes to fall back on, especially if he regards himself as a creative player which I think he does. It’s for that reason that I think he would be better trying to be a defensive player because his limitations would not be as obvious and he might have more to offer but even then I still don’t think he should be near the starting eleven.

I would be happy to see him stay if he is 5th choice next season, don’t think he is good enough to be any higher than that, I think a club this big with the expectations it has can reasonably expect to have 3-4 cm’s who are either good enough to play week in week out or have the potential to be good enough with another 1-2 as backup options to play in the cups and fill gaps. Personally don’t think Clev is or will ever be good enough to play week in week out.

243~~~
I think he is technically very very good. He receives the ball with text book body shape and touch. He can receive with either foot, both front foot and back foot receiving. He for the majority of time attempts to take the ball with a positive touch and actually has a varied passing range.
The area where he is lacking is that he very rarely travels with the ball driving forward. Also he needs to take a few more risks with his passing. he will pull out of a possible pass if the receiver doesnt have a decent amount of time or space and so ends up moving the ball sideways or back to try and retain possession rather than risk a bigger reward.
Despite what some on here think, he always is available for the ball, he constantly shows for the ball and if he isnt showing for the ball he is moving in such a way to create a passing channel for someone else.

I just wish he would travel in to space with the ball more often and attempt riskier passes.

244~~~
First he comes out with the TC23 brand when he has barely made it as a player, then says he models his game on the Spanish style. He goes on to claim he is a LVG type of player and now makes those claims above. He needs to keep low profile off the field and prove his mettle on the field. Look at what Young has done during the preseason, he has buckled down and worked hard to impress. Cleverley has had some decent performances with some below average ones(esp the one where he was the captain) and he needs to be more sensible in the things he says to the press. He is not helping himself one bit.

245~~~
I must say i'm not fully in agreement with those who describe him as technically very good. When attempting to hit a long ball first time he swings his foot too much causing it to loop which takes the pace out of the pass and ultimately the move. A small thing, perhaps, but it should have been ironed out by now.

246~~~
Yup, this is annoying.

Also he doesn't play with his head up. He'll take a touch or two, then look up, which in turn is why his potential receivers often have too little space and he opts for the safer pass. This doesn't suggest he's fully comfortable technically.

247~~~
Very very good technically implies he is well above average and should be amongst the better players in the league and he is nowhere near that level unfortunately. He is ordinary and I don’t see what is wrong with saying that, his performances over the last 3 years reflect that, there is a big difference between being a certain type of player and actually being good at it. Clev is the type of player who likes to receive the ball, play a pass, stay on the move but he isn’t actually good enough to play that way effectively at the required level.

248~~~
How do you quantify a central midfielder though? Even more, due to the role that he was clearly uncomfortable playing last season. It's not as though he's a striker or a defender where you can judge clean sheets or goals. 'Technically good' implies he has good technique which is a sound assessment. He's not a hell for leather player and he's not untidy.

249~~~
He doesn't have very very good technique, his technique is pretty average for a CM IMO, he doesn't for example take a ball on the turn whilst under pressure, will usually just pass the ball back to where it came from in that scenario.

Not that I am saying he has poor technique, I just don't believe his technique is very very good.

250~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> "Call it how it is". Hmmm. Weren't you "calling it how it is" when you called Cabaye an average player? He looked the part in a very good French side at the World Cup. Tedious indeed.

He thinks he's good enough to play for England - that's not exactly having an extremely high opinion of himself given he did play a fair bit under Hodgson and got praise from his manager, team-mates and the media alike for his England performances. The only other thing he says there is that his style of play is suited to how Van Gaal sets his team up which is obviously true - and the fact he's confident enough to say it suggests that he has slotted in well to Van Gaal's system and feels comfortable under his management.

251~~~
Cleverley's technique is mediocre at best. I hope he doesn't feature much for us next season to be honest, he just does nothing of any note on the field.

252~~~
That's such a bizarre criticism. He's a professional footballer FFS. I think he's capable of smacking a pass with his laces if he wants to. If he chooses to wrap his instep around the ball and put a bit of curl on the pass instead, that will be for a reason. Not because he's incapable of passing the ball using any other technique.

I know every fecker on here thinks they're some kind of unheralded coaching wunderkind but the overly technical way in which people seem to want to criticise managers and footballers these days gets right on my tits...

253~~~
<a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> yes, I still don't particularly rate Cabaye, your point is? You're beyond tedious, Brwned, you know that. 

So Cleverley is better than average, really? In the context of things; playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world etc, he's really better than average? Wow.

254~~~
That's the argument here Robbie. I don't think that's actually the case, he constantly gets low ratings in every game despite when he actually has a decent game. Like the Liverpool game for example when he was probably our best CM in the game, despite that he still gets an awful rating because his name is Cleverley.

255~~~
Well I tend to ignore the kiddie FM generation who apparently call for a team of 'superstars'. I can't say I honestly see it all to often, to be honest. The more balanced, insightful posters all appear to agree that he's fine as a squad player. He still gets dogs abuse from some, but so what?

Some are twisting things slightly. I don't see people calling for all these alleged superstars in every position; what I do find is people saying we should be improving in a notoriously problematic area of the pitch for us. Cleverley is fine, but is that really enough? If he stays, then so-be-it, he can be a grand squad player. If he left, I wouldn't be overly-upset but I would ship others off before him.

Things will always be polemic with Cleverley, but it certainly doesn't bother me. If people want to call him the worst player ever, etc, you can ignore them.

256~~~
he goes into tackles like a pussy and looses the ball to easily, is error prone. His passing, yes some days its ok. In total this player was nowhere near United quality (if we expect to be champions , not seventh) in the last year or longer and this pre-season wasn't any difference. I don't mind if he is going as even for LvG here is a hell lot of improvement necessary on this player

257~~~
I am not saying he is untidy or a terrible player just he is not good enough and I think that is a very fair assessment of his abilities and performances over the last 3 seasons, not just last season. In my opinion Cleverley is closer in ability to players at clubs like Swansea, Villa, Newcastle etc than he is to players at Arsenal, Chelsea or City let alone Barcelona, Real or Bayern. 

As I said I think he is technically pretty average at this level and if we do bring in another CM of any quality it will be easy to quantify because we will see the difference between a quality player and Cleverley.

258~~~
Now that Young starts improving and performs well, people start abusing Cleverley for decent perfomances and actually improvement based on last season. I criticised him before, but he actually played well against Liverpool, dont know what most of you are talking about. He even put in some nice tackles, what i want to see more of him. 

Whats the option? Selling him for 8m to Everton and buying another squad player like Blind for 17m or what? I was shocked at the rating he got, some of you really just focus on him and want him sold, unless he becomes a world beater. He is a squad palyer, every team has some and needs some. I know we would all like Pogba, Vidal, Gündogan, Koke etc at the same time in our squad, but it wont happen. The earlier you accept that he will stay, the better.

259~~~
He's a bit like a Mokujin to me, watches other players and tries to copy them (badly) with no identity of his own.

He tries to strike the ball like Beckham, you can tell he's watched Iniesta/Xavi - When i watch him play i just think 'who is Tom Cleverley' and other than short backwards and sides passes, what characteristics make 'Tom Cleverley' a player that stands out ?

260~~~
I like Tom, but fair feckin play <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

261~~~
He really is painfully average. Honestly, when he receives the ball I feel he does the exact thing in what I'd do. Before he passes it, I'm there thinking "I'd probably pass it back to Smalling now", and that's what he goes and do. He's just very predictable. 

Might be a good squad player, and I don't expect us to get rid of him this Summer. I just wish he had more of an identity. There are players like Carrick who go about their business quietly but efficiently. You know he's not a flashy player, but you know what Carrick does.

With Cleverley, I don't really know what he offers us when he's on the pitch except someone who will consistently pass the ball back or sideways.

Hopefully Van Gaal can do something with him.

262~~~
A good example would be that he never actually strikes a ball with his laces/instep for starters, really winds me up.

263~~~
Whaaaat? Seriously?

264~~~
You never noticed when he's running on to a ball on the edge of the box for example and he tries to generate power with the side of his foot instead of driving through the ball with his laces? Really does grind my gears.

265~~~
My point is that if people expressing perfectly legitimate opinions which oppose yours - e.g. Cabaye isn't average, evidenced by him establishing himself as a key player for one of the tournament's top teams -  is somehow tedious to you, then you're probably in the wrong place.

266~~~
He tends to try and pass the ball into the net, rather than hammer it. I generally wouldn't have a problem with this.

I was mainly confused by your mention of the word "instep". He doesn't smack many shots with his laces but he uses his instep all the time. If he doesn't use his instep or his laces, what's left? The outside of his foot? His heel?!

267~~~
He always attempts to take the ball on the turn, its something he is very good at.  Its how he shapes his body up as the ball comes to him.  His first instinct is to try and receive with a positive touch. The problem is that he is too safe with it and makes a decision to play the safe pass when he could take a few more risks.

268~~~
Ah Brwned, always missing the point. What I said was people using the term 'Cleverley Bashing' to refer to anyone who doesn't rate Cleverley, is very tedious, in my opinion. Welbeck and Cleverley will always polarise opinions and people will just have to deal with it. You have a lovely habit of taking what you want from posts.

As for Cabaye, I still don't rate him as highly as some. For the record, I said last summer that if it was a choice between him and Fellaini, I would take Cabaye. I never said my opinion was fact or gospel so I don't get your point.

You have had some belters in the past with your opinions on players so I'm not sure what your point is at all actually.

269~~~
Now that you say this and I think about it you might be right! I can't remember an occasion where he has put his laces through the ball.

270~~~
I don't think anyone referred to anyone who doesn't rate Cleverley as a Cleverley basher. In fact I know they didn't because I'm the only one that talked about Cleverley bashing in this thread and it was unsurprisingly referring to the people who were bashing him, not people who were calling him average.

My point is that your definition of average is obviously very different to many others - including Deschamps seeing as he made him a key player - so getting wound up about that definition is a bit silly. It has nothing to do with underrating/overrating/mis-rating players in general, just about accepting that people don't see things in the same black-and-white fashion and that viewpoint can come across as intensely critical to the point where it's seen as "bashing".

271~~~
You've got me a bit wrong there- I'm not saying he's incapable of using laces at all, in fact he did it to good effect in recent games, What I was saying is that when he tries to do a curling pass with his instep he frequently overdoes it which causes the ball to loop and it ends up behind the recipient which takes pace out of the move. A flaw in his game that, IMO, should have been eradicated by now and perhaps detracts from the suggestion that he is 'technically very good' as some have said.

I certainly don't think i'm a coaching wonderkid it was just a simple observation in an attempt to contribute to the debate that another poster actually kindly agreed with. Maybe I didn't articulate it very well and if so apologies Pogue Mahone.

272~~~
You lot are really over analyzing him. He's a player who can be summed up in one sentence.

273~~~
I would because he's fecking shit at it, he'd be better of trying to smash it as hard as he could and seeing what happens. 

It's the way he uses his instep, which is what i should have put, i was struggling to think how to properly describe it without going into too much detail. Basically he doesn't use his instep to cut through the ball and generate backspin, especially on long passes. instead you get some lofted curve ball that looks quite awkward and not very aesthetically pleasing.

274~~~
Wait what? I can understand Young who is surprisingly good in wingback role, but Clev is one of the best players in the tour? No way.

The bolded part is why I’m not sure if he’s even a good squad option. I would rather give chance to someone who is good defensively and can do some positive going forward.

He was decent against Liverpool, maybe better than Herrera. His best game I think. They both need to improve.

I’m confused about the “squad player” definition. It seems to be a common opinion, that players not good enough to warrant a place in the first team become automatically squad players. It depends on the position of course, but I want a midfielder who is a squad player to be able to fill in a gap which means he does not have to be brilliant passer or runner with the ball, but he absolutely has to be reliable defensively. Is Cleverley that kind of player? I think he’s not.  Carrick can be that player, or Fletcher if we sign someone better than him to partner Herrera.

He’s reliable and quite useful when we are in possession, it’s the defensive part of his game that I worry about.

He should stay this summer, but once we solve our midfield dilemma I think he will be the next one to go- simply because I don’t think it will be very difficult to find much better players with higher potential.  

He took a great shot vs Madrid, so I take it as an improvement.

275~~~
Not sure again what your point is. Your definition of 'good' / 'average' etc, would also vary wildly as opposed to how other people view the term. So a player I may say is good, you may say is average and visa versa. Who cares? Neither is right or wrong as it's an opinion. 

I don't know why you brought up Cabaye as it's plain odd. Saying because a player is rated by a national team manager as a basis for an argument is ridiculous, for what it's worth. I don't see why it offends you if people 'bash' Cleverley? Again, who cares? I'm middle of the road when it comes to him and I find he's both under and overrated on here.

276~~~
He wasn't shiting out of any 50:50 challenges against Liverpool. Went in hard and fair on a number of occasions. Once he even crunched Rooney too. I'll add to that to the long list of unfair criticisms.

On his defensive abilities in general, his best game of last season was against Arsenal away when he did a great job snuffing out Arsenal attacks before they got started. His main problem in the last couple of seasons has been a lack of consistency in his passing and a tendency to go into his shell when it's not happening for him. Clearly a confidence issue and it may turn out the he just doesn't have the mindset to thrive at the highest level. I do think this array of highly technical criticisms are missing the point a bit. He has had at least a few very good performances for Manchester United in his career. In none of them did he look like a footballer with some sort of fundamental deficiency in his skill-set. He blatantly can do everything we need him to do, it's just a question of whether he can do it consistently.

277~~~
You have a very low threshold and will group a huge amount of players under the heading of average is all. Cabaye and Cleverley are of course at very different stages in their career and at different levels yet in this very black-and-white definition there's nothing between them. It's not about being rated by their manager but about him proving himself very useful as a key cog in a strong national team. If that's "average" then Cleverley being "average" isn't necessarily a bad thing because obviously these "average" players can be very useful for strong teams in the biggest competitions. Much like Fletcher was "average" for a while.

It doesn't offend me at all that people bash him. I find it pretty amusing more than anything. If you read my first post you'll see I'm not remotely offended in any way, I just said it was very strange. That's all - not sure what the problem is here but I don't see this discussion going any further so I'll leave it there.

278~~~
Under pressure? No not really picks the pass  back to sender 9 times out of 10.

279~~~
I'd keep him as back-up aslong as he is happy to provide for that role. He clearly has some ability and he has shown it in the past, last season was a write off for him as he was shocking but he's not a bad player. He's a tidy passer but he seems scared to move with the ball. If you watch him from his time at Wigan and Watford, he would commit defenders and create space but at United, he's happy to sit down and simply pass it.

If he was fourth choice CM then I would be happy with that. He's young, came through the academy and can do a job when needed but in no way should he be starting every game as first choice unless he improves but he's no longer a youngster so can't see a massive improvement.

280~~~
Absolutely spot on, I've always hated that.

281~~~
Actually thats a perception but not true. 9 times out of ten is just an over exaggeration and makes it hard to take you seriously.

The first google search for Tom Cleverley all touches gave me this <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewPXxdcFWHI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
He does what you say just once in just on 80 touches during the game. Perception and reality on here are sometimes two different animals.

282~~~
Pogue I've tried and been patient as I can with him, but I'd rather we gave Powell a chance or another youth product or buy someone like De Jong. Cleverley hides to much for me when he's up against it. He never digs deep, plays it safe and tackles like a 15year old. I had hoped he'd come good but I thought Gibson was a better player who offered more and he wasn't good enough.

283~~~
Kagawa does it all the time no matter where he plays for us, and Gibson only has his shot and that's it imo.

284~~~
They still offer/ed more than Tom in my opinion.

285~~~

286~~~
Squad player at best. No way near the quality we need and has had more than enough chances and failed to deliver. Time to promote a young player......

287~~~
I think he plays better when the team is playing better. Expect us to get back to winning ways after LVG and when Cleverley is rotated in to cover for someone, we're more likely to play better and he can join in. A bit fair weather but could do a job

288~~~
I just dispise the way he thought he was some sort of icon, created a brand in tc23 and generally thought he had made it as a top premiership player. The contrast between this delusion and his actual footballing ability annoys me too much to ever have any like for him. He is just a young minded fool and will be gone either this summer or the next. His level is West Ham.

289~~~
That's not really a good player to have. When we're playing badly, we need players who can drive us towards winning regardless of the overall performance. When Rooney is bad, at least he can still produce some random moments of magic or just simply pops up at the right place to score.

Cleverley offers nothing extra unfortunately. I can see him being a squad player for a season or two now, and then will eventually be shipped off.

290~~~
What's the point of having a player like that? If we're not playing well we need squad players to fight for positions and give the under performing starters a kick up the arse.

291~~~
I think with consistent time and training under LVG he'll get his confidence back. Last season was a shambles and the instructions Moyes had his midfielders playing under were ridiculous. Think Tom is far bettervthan he looked last season and he is just the type and profile if player LVG loves to work with and improve.

292~~~
I'd agree with that.

Didnt even look impressive in our pre season games against half commited opponents when there was everything to show for our players.
He wasnt bad but those kind of average performances are his limit I feel. Fletch impressed me much more

293~~~
I just despise the way you make stuff up. He never created a brand in TC23. There is no brand called TC23. It was a one-time thing used for a charity. I know, such a despicable person to support a charity.

People who complain about him having a site is stupid as well. It is the exact same as having a twitter or facebook page.

294~~~
Gotta agree.

Cleverley made a webpage and for that he gets a load of hate. From the reaction you would think he was there in his bedroom updating if himself! C'mon people all this brand stuff is agents/PR people.

Cleverley hasn't lived up to his early promise, yet. But if we are going to criticise him let's do it for genuine reasons. Not make out the guy thinks he's God's gift and doesn't work hard.

295~~~
Would be a completely different player if he had the bollocks to keep the ball when under pressure and look for more opportunistic passes, as he has a decent passing range/accuracy, but he always plays safe which slows play down.

296~~~
Happy Birthday Tom!

297~~~
I don't know whether it was because it's his birthday or LVG has been doing even more behind the scenes work but he actively hunted for the ball in that half trying to make things happen himself. Was impressed with his vision, passing and determination.

298~~~
He was decent apart from that one horrible mistake for Valencias goal. Still don't see him as first team quality though.

299~~~
Finally some forward thinking passing from Cleverley. Also refreshing to see him move ahead of the ball at times, unlike last season.

300~~~
He's just not good enough for United and no manager can change that

301~~~
Made a couple of good tackles and hit some decent passes, he had a couple of lapses around our box though.

302~~~
He did a few good passes today and looked slightly more lively than normal. Don't know why he was rated nearly as bad as Hernandez on here!

He's still not good enough though. Never will be.

303~~~
Squad player, nothing more, nothing less. Should be good enough with a decent midfielder alongside him to play against weaker EPL teams or in Cups. Not good enough against top sides.

304~~~
I just can't see why he is at United other than being a youth product, he's simply not up to the task. TBH I hope he follows Anderson out of the door ASAP.

305~~~
Terrible defending for their goal, other than that he was pretty average, wouldn't say he was good or bad really but thought fellaini was much better.

306~~~
Frankly, if LVG doesn't get rid of him there must be something else going on. Does Cleverley toss off all the managers that play him?

307~~~
Looked lively when he come on. Hit some adventurous passes and shown good vision. Good cameo.

P.S. <b>Happy Birthday Cleverz</b>

308~~~
He is getting better throughout the pre season.

309~~~
25 years of age. The word 'young', should never be mentioned in relation to him ever again.

310~~~
What about "He's as shit as Young"???

311~~~
25 year old footballers are still improving and likely to do so for the duration of their contracf, hence it's reasonable to call them "young"

312~~~
Then your criteria is different to mine then. 25 for a footballer is not young to me. That is the start of the middle of your career in football.

313~~~
Sideways Tom did more than I expected from him today, looked fired-up what I like. Maybe he knew it's between him and Fellaini? Close call I would say.

314~~~
It was still nearer to the start than to the end for Giggs though.

Players like Drogba or Kelvin Philips are also late bloomers who became better players in the later rather than the earlier part of their careers.

315~~~
Very good today. His long passing in particular has come on leaps and bounds since last season.

316~~~
His just not good enough even as a squad player. Hopefully we can bring in another midfielder before the window ends and sell him next summer while attempt to get in Strootman.

317~~~
Hmmm, so-so last night. General play average, poor mistake for the goal. Not great overall. 

A few of the other players have had quick improvements under van Gaal, but not Tom. Still think LVG may get the most from him, but i think right now he's only at utd because it's an area of weakness in the squad. If LVG has concluded he's not made the cut he could hardly complain. I don't think he's shown any of his talent this pre-season.

318~~~
Stupid error for the goal, some neat long range passes but as usual nothing special from Tom nothing to indicate that he can do well against the top CMs in the league. Fletcher right now is a better player than Cleverley imo and that should be a worrying thought for Tom.

319~~~
He did good, but didn't cover himself in glory on the Valencia goal.

320~~~
Never seen a problem with his technique, his problem has always been his mentality, the exact same criticisms of Cleverley were aimed at Carrick (Sideways, not adventurous enough etc.) if the manager can sort that part out, he may come good yet.

Time is running out for him but there is definitely a player there. I just hope he realises it before it is too late.

321~~~
Bad error for the goal and also made a horrible mess of a routine clearance from a near post corner. Thought he passed the ball quite well though.

322~~~
He has a better match than usual last night (the stupid goal conceded aside but that happens to everyone).I don't think he's good enough but his passing last night was ok.If he is our 4th or 5th choice CM then I will keep him for another season.

323~~~
Forward passes are probably quite difficult for cleverley. He doesn't have the ability to create space for himself, either through dribbling or a good first touch that top midfielders have to give themselves the edge. Neither does he have the touch, positional sense nor vision to make things happen by dictating the play. 

That's how he gets into situations where the only thing he can do is to pass sideways and back, which are the options that the opposition actually gives him.

324~~~
Can't remember the last time I've seen someone so low on confidence. 

He has the ability to be a good player for us, but all of the time he just wants to play the safe pass.

It's like he does everything not to hear those disgruntled fans' sigh after giving the ball away trying something ambitious.

325~~~
Which all adds up to, yep, he isn't good enough. He simply does not have the ability to create any sort of space for himself let alone use it effectively when he's given it. 

Ho should be long gone by now. Long gone.

326~~~
That is significant because it is a typical sign of any athlete who doesn't have enough mental strength to perform at the level he's expected to. When that list of axed players by LVG was published (whether it is true or not, that's another debate) the other day, one would expect Cleverley to find a way to grab that second chance. I dunno how long LVG will tolerate Cleverley's usual stuff, but I hope the fuse will be really short in his case.

327~~~
My Dad's friend's son shares the same agent as Cleverley, and said that Cleverley will be rewarded with a new contract within the next week.

328~~~
Cleverley will stay at United till he retires. Every manager he has ever played under rates him and even if every United fan in the world signed a letter asking for Cleverley to be sold to a 2nd division side, he wont.

329~~~
Cleverley is good enough to be a squad player. I have no problem with him staying.

330~~~
Hopefully it's true!

331~~~
Hopefully not.

332~~~
We should not be rewarding mediocre mid table performances (Valencia, Cleverley) with new contracts. Ji Sung Park was the perfect squad player and the sort of standard we should be looking at for filling up squad positions.

333~~~
Why is he being rewarded? DDG is the only player that's deserving of a new contract after last season. Hopefully not true.

334~~~
What's wrong with Cleverley as a squad player, or Valencia for that matter? Cleverley gets around the pitch well, plays with his heart and is a United player through and through. He may lack a little sparkle, but overall he's good enough to be a squad player. Valencia can play the wingback role quite well with his pace and stamina, if not as a first choice. We still need squad players. Selling Cleverley will mean that we must spend more money on squad players instead of focusing on improving our starting XI.

335~~~
So you want to sell every player we have but DDG? City and Arsenal have nicer stadiums than United, perhaps we should sell Old Trafford too and buy a New Trafford. I know we support the club first and foremost, but that means the players that are at the club also.

336~~~
Why is this relevant? I can do all that. I don't know of any other top teams who have so many average 'squad players' as we do. Would be a disaster if we had to rely on Cleverley for any decent period of time, he is not good enough. And the less said about Valencia, the better.

337~~~
So who should we buy as replacements? World class players as squad players? Cleverley is still only 25 and is technically sound. Didn't cost us anything and isn't earning too much. All in all a very good basis to improve, especially under LvG. But no, let's rather buy useless players for around 20 mil and 100 k wages as their replacements / squad players.

338~~~
Erm, players better than Cleverley. Squad players should be challenging first team players and keeping them on their toes, you could find some no mark Spanish midfielder in La Liga who could offer more what Cleverley does for us, IE nothing.

339~~~
Who? You think a midtable Spanish player who is a starter might be happy as a squad player at United? And he would be for free? And would have low wages? You might name a few then, or?

340~~~
They are more modern, but sure they are nicer? I think Old Trafford is beautiful.

341~~~
The lad does have a point, to have a strong squad is very important, also for injuries which are well known at United.

342~~~
My point is we should be aiming a lot higher than mid table for "squad players".

343~~~
I suggest giving him a year or maybe two more to push for a place. But if by that time all he still has going for him is being a United fan, an academy product, being relatively inexpensive and already being here... we might as well cash in on him and give that squad place to younger academy players, who'll do the same job, cost even less, support United just as much, and has the potential to really improve. 

Squad players shouldn't just be here to play the strict role of squad player - they should either offer pre-proven first team quality alongside serious experience (eg. Ferdinand and Giggs) the potential to be first-teamers, or maybe versatility. Not just because it's convenient.  
Right now he offers a tiny bit more than the young midfielders in the academy, but that won't be the case in a year or so.

344~~~
Well yeah, but you really really have to find a good balance. More often than not you will either find someone useless like Fellaini (who for me isn't better than Cleverley and even if he is in some ppls' opinion, then not by much) but who cost a fortune in transfer fee and wages or your squad player is almost as good as your starters (for example Kroos at Bayern or Thiago at Barca) and then wants to leave.

345~~~
Put it a lot better than I can, good post. I would hope this is his last year if he continues to put in the same mediocre performances as the last few.

346~~~
I was making a sarcastic comment <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> I love Old Trafford, but arguments can surely be made for City and especially Arsenal having aesthetically more pleasing stadiums than United.

347~~~
You can do all that? So you are a PL proven player then? Good for you.

Take away Henderson, Gerrard and Lucas and look at what Liverpool has for their squad players, then look at what City have - certainly no better than Cleverley. I distinctly said he should not be considered part of the starting XI from what we have seen thus far, but as a squad player, he's still very decent. Only Chelsea can brag about better squad players than that, tbh.

The same goes with Valencia - he should, considering his last couple of seasons, not be regarded as a starting player, but as a squad player, he's better than what most teams have, discarding once again Chelsea. Arsenal, Liverpool, City cannot brag about having better wingers/wingbacks as squad players.

348~~~
Cleverley needs a goal like Fellaini has just done to get many off his back, then hopefully he can build from there.

349~~~
He did that against Villa last season. THen said he wanted to kick-on from that and thought he was going to really up his level of performances. He didn't though.

350~~~
I'm mainly talking from a confidence point of view, something to just give him a lift. Look at the sudden u-turn on Fellaini after his goal. Now there is a place for him in certain situations. The same people had no place for him 2 days ago.

351~~~
I don't understand it when people say Cleverley needs confidence to kick on. Confidence to kick on and do what? He's a limited player, he's not going to develop into a talented midfielder on scoring a goal.

352~~~
The guy was our 1st choice midfield partner to Carrick the season we lost the league on goal difference and the season we won it. I do not understand how you can sign a player like that for reasonable money and put him in as a squad player?!?!

353~~~
Good news, I like Clevs. If you don't mind me asking what league does your Dad's friends's son play in?

354~~~
He needs to define himself as a player, he doesn't do anything. He doesn't push forward, he doesn't score goals, he doesn't assist - he does feck all

355~~~
You missed out, he can't defend.

356~~~
Some utter c*nts on here these days.

EDIT: not aimed at previous post. Which is just a bit lame.

357~~~
Maybe if he had a game of excellent creative passing and good movement he'd progress, a one off goal might just make him think "next stop, champion of the world"...

I do hope LVG can make something out of him, whilst keeping his feet on the ground. Definitely a make or break season for him.

358~~~
This was reported in march last year and then again in march this year...don't know what the hold up has been. He's on 35k and he's going to be bumped up to 60k plus

359~~~
He obviously won’t turn down a new contract if he is offered one but I actually think it would be in his own interests not to sign a new deal, he has been the biggest loser in pre-season, he hasn’t been the worst player but he has been third choice out of three and with Carrick, Fellaini and maybe even a new arrival still to come into the equation he is facing a lot of time warming the bench or sitting in the stands.

Offering him a new deal is as much about protecting his transfer value as it is trying to keep him at the club long term, he would be better biding his time and seeing if he can make any impact on the first team, if he can’t then he will have much better choices as a free agent or with only 6 months left on his deal in January.

360~~~

361~~~
It's this bizarre notion that 6.5/10 is the new barely human. I certainly don't get it.

362~~~
tbf, he played well until Moyes over used him and got him knackered and then proceeded to drop him for the rest of the season. Can't tell you how badly our players were managed last season. Moyes was terrible at squad rotation.

363~~~
The thing that annoys me most about Cleverley is his insistence on over emphasising his passes. Anyone else noticed the way he twists his body even for simple passes as if it's some masterful ball to his teammate?

I think he sees his performances completely different to everyone else. All style, no substance.

364~~~
The main reason why he shone at Watford & Wigan was his position. He never featured in CM for them, always a .10 or even a winger. His 10 yard passes to strikers are actually quite good but when he has to dictate a game from deep he struggles as he hasn't got the passing range. 

As we all know, he isn't going to be given a chance in that position so he will be a CM for us, I'm happy with him as back-up but I don't want to see him starting the season and with the way it's going, he's nailed on to get around 20-30 games this season unless we sign someone. 

It's always harsh writing off young players who have showed potential before performing badly for an extending period of time i.e. Ramsey, Sterling, Fletcher, Walcott but I don't think Cleverley is in that bracket in terms of age. People still see him as youngster but he's 24 now.

365~~~
That's a fair point. Scholesy said something similar in an interview the other day too.

366~~~
Roma alone, Clevs actually played well in every pre season game imo. Passed it crisply, put tackles in, passed the ball forwards, made runs forwards. Generally been active in the game and looking for the ball. But that won't stop the tide of bollocks pushed in his direction by frustrated Vidal fans as reality starts to set in.

I actually liked the look of Fellaini and Cleverley as a midfield partnership, they actually bossed the midfield against Valencia (albeit a weakened Valencia side at that point).

367~~~
I agree - the caf is becoming worryingly like RAWK with some of the absolute tosh being constantly spouted.


I think a big part of Cleverleys problem (with the fans) is simply that he isn't the all-powerful, world class CM that we have wanted for the last 5 or so years. Realistically he is no worse than other squad players we have had (Valencia, Park, O'Shea, Gibson). Normally with those players though, they are distinct backups to far superior players we have in their positions.

With Cleverley, the fact that we haven't invested properly in midfield over the last few years means he has seen more gametime, and the fans probably expected him to become the world class player that we lacked - which he was never going to do.

That said, if it came down to him or Fellaini then for footballing reasons I would prefer Fellaini (if you bring wages/homegrown etc into it, it becomes a harder decision).

368~~~
Our standards for a good midfielder really have dropped over the last years

369~~~
Is he injured?

370~~~
He's been sold. LVG likes to live dangerously by only keeping 2 established CM's.

371~~~
Wouldnt he suit the wing back position?

372~~~
He barely runs with the ball so I wouldn't have thought so.

373~~~
He used to play at RB for some of the youth teams I believe and also played out wide on his loans so it could be something to try.

374~~~
Cleverley to come on in the 2nd half with United going on to win the game. 2 lowest rated players will be Hernandez and Cleverley.

375~~~
He's not on the bench.

376~~~
On a scale of 1 - dick, I am a dick. Please disregard that last post.

377~~~
Can't have impressed LVG as not even a sub today, one of those days though where it might have worked in his favour not playing though. Do feel he will have to grab any opportunities he gets or he could be sold in this window especially if we can't offload fellaini.

378~~~
Was he injured or something? Tbh I would prefer him to Fellaini or even Fletcher for that matter and that is not saying much... It is just mind boggling to see Fellaini in the team and the hopeless punts forward towards him are absolutely maddening. To make matters worse he doesn't even seem convincing in any of his aerial battles and he doesn't even properly contest for the ball aerially most of the time,

379~~~
Why is this lad being mentioned today? He would of done nothing to change us. He would of joined in with the slow passing and lack of creativity.

380~~~
Squad player in a group of even more squad players. (Beside Ander Herrera)

381~~~
Would you class the performance of Herrera above a squad players today? He offered nothing going forward and did nothing to dictate our game or our tempo. Pretty damning of our midfield when Herrera is being touted as the stand out quality in it.

382~~~
In that case we'll need a new midfield and that doesn't even sound so extreme to me as we were begging for some movement in that formation from years and all we have is Powell instead of Pogba.

383~~~
It's true and thats the worst part about it. I'm a huge fan of Herrera but if we're being deadly truthful would he be a regular starter for your City, Chelsea, Arsenal? I reckon he'd be a squadie for them whilst he's the best we have. It really is strange why we've never strengthened that position when we're so lack luster in there.

384~~~
This club is in denial from crushing amount success. The other teams are not blind and saw a vanity in United's domination. All they did is they used it to their own advantage with help of good old moneys.

Herrera does seem like a breakthrough in waking up to the midfield problem but that needs to be proven with further moves in that vein... perhaps even more ambitious.

385~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://t.co/hzknEuVPcN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://t.co/hzknEuVPcN</a>

386~~~
Out of contract next summer.

387~~~
I guess it secures him so we wont lose him for nothing.

388~~~
70k. So when he falls further down the pick of midfielders, who is going to pay him that when we try to sell him on? To us that isn't much, but to the majority of Prem teams that's towards the higher end of their wage structures.

389~~~
Happy with that Cleverley news. He's a good option to have here and even if he isn't starting every single game he is a useful squad player. Clearing the deadwood is important too so it's key that we get rid of the likes of Anderson and Fellaini. Cleverley has looked better under LvG. It's a shame he was ill yesterday. He'd have been a better option to bring on than Fellaini.

390~~~
No harm giving him a new deal because we are so short in midfield but I don't agree with giving him a pay rise and a long contract because he doesn't deserve it, we are just rewarding mediocrity. Give him a 2 year extension on the same money and if he improves give him a better deal, he is on the verge of being deadwood already and another year or two playing as he has been and he will be another highly paid player we can't get rid of.

391~~~
Who besides United would give him those wages? What kind of wages does he demand away from United? If other clubs won't give him 70k a week, there is no point in United giving him those wages. Tom has been linked with Everton and Barkley, a youth player with more hype and promise, is on 60k a week.

392~~~
70k per week? Is this some sort of charity?

393~~~
A run of the mill one, championship material, a new deal would be laughable.

Gibson was far better than him

394~~~
What the feck has he done to deserve a contract extension and a pay rise? It's moves like this why we are in the shit we find ourselves in. Unbelievable!

395~~~
Doesn't provide anything special, he can just keep possession by passing to the nearest player and his defending is somewhat poor despite a couple of interceptions he's made in his 2 years in the first squad.  I wonder if he's played in the wrong position though.  His crossing isn't too bad and he's got considerable pace.  I don't know if he can be played in a 4-3-3 formation as a winger or an attacking midfielder though.

396~~~
He doesn't deserve any contract extension whatsoever. We're trying to get rid of the deadwood, and this is how we do it? Our backroom staff is so shortsighted, it's not funny.

397~~~
Dead right. Whoever is in charge of HR at United is abysmal.

398~~~
I admit, I haven't been his greatest fan, but a new contract, after his performances over the last two years, is quite simply taking the piss.  We need to get rid of the dead wood, else we will never improve.

399~~~
Another player we might be stuck with for a few years because we handed him a contract despite poor performances.

Obviously would love for him to step it up but haven't seen the signs of that for awhile.

400~~~
I stand corrected, I didn't actually read the article so I didn't know they are saying we'd actually be upping his money, that would be ludicrous for a player that has done nothing to earn an improved deal.

401~~~
agreed.

402~~~
Yeah lets give him a pay rise and make it even harder to sell.

403~~~
This. Considering how Gibson is no longer here, it's not too much asked for the club to get rid of another piece of deadwood instead of giving in to the demands from that whiny little tool.

404~~~
Valencia and Nani had a new deal and a pay rise

Now it's the Cleverley turn

I think the Glazers and Woody are Liverpool fans.

405~~~
Well, he was the captain for our glorious victory against Roma, so he obviously deserves a pay raise.

406~~~
He needs to be sold. We simply have too many midfielders and Cleverley does not cut it. The only problem is, would any club in the world want to buy him? What does he offer apart from the experience of being first choice in our title winning season?

407~~~
Erm, yes?

408~~~
Some of you in this thread are hideous.

409~~~
We should be looking to get rid and not to raise his pay to 70k. No way he gets that sort of cash at any other club in the land. Lets go sign Classie and give him 30k a week then, he'd do no worse. What's Danny Guthrie up to nowadays?

410~~~
He may not be world class, but there would be plenty of clubs he'd be a 1st choice CM for.  He may not stand out at United but he's still a competent player.

411~~~
Forgive me if I am mistaken but is it not LVG who says whether or not we offer a player a new contract? I guess we can add him to the long list of twat professional managers who keep Cleverley just to piss us off.

412~~~
Probably the same lot who were abusing him on twitter.

413~~~
The point is he would still not get 70k a week at another club. Ross Barkley just got a new deal worth 60k a week at Everton. So even the club he is linked with wouldn't give him that kind of money. Give him an extension, but not a pay rise.

414~~~
Give him an extension for all I care, but the lad has done absolutely nothing to warrant a pay rise.

415~~~
Its DailyMail, probably just nonsense. I mean who would give a payrise to a player who has been underperforming for the past 2 years? We will probably give him an extension so as not to lose him on a free and he is still a decent footballer. Lets not forget he is 25 and can be a good squad player. I certainly rate him above Fletcher and Fellaini but it would be baffling if we were to hand him a payrise. 

Last season we gave Nani a 5-year deal for god knows what reason. We followed that by giving Valencia another deal this season although LVG himself has claimed we lack quality wingers implying that Valencia isn't of the required standard. What on earth were we thinking about giving a 29 year old has been winger a contract extension when he clearly won't cut it defensively at full/wing back. It's just befuddling. We might as well have let him leave on a free given that he is 29 and has minimal resale value and bought a specialist right back as cover for Rafael. The least we could have done was to wait till LVG assessed him before handing him out that deal. I am guessing LVG probably sanctioned it on account of Giggs's word without seeing him play at close quarters... We seriously need to be more suave when it comes to transfer and contract negotiations.

416~~~
Let the contract run out or sell him this summer. Did feck all to deserve the extension, same as Valencia.

417~~~
70K a week. Get to feck.

418~~~
Don't see why anyone is rushing in here to criticise. He's been fine.

419~~~
This sums him up

420~~~
Just when you thought he couldn't get worse.....how this guy is playing for a club like United is beyond me. Same can be said about a few players in the squad but this guy is a joke.

421~~~
He really hasn't.

422~~~
Saw some of you arguing his tendency to exaggerate his movements when passing is just style and doesn't hinder him.

Well, the world could see he was going to pass that ball to Young when Buckley counter-attacked, due to just that. 

Also: What a spineless performance. Nothing player. Should go to a side where it's accepted to go into hiding when playing CM.

423~~~
He's been better than Fletcher in the first half and still nowhere near good enough. That sums it up pretty much IMO.

424~~~
Looks traumatised. Easy passes. Scared to do anything hard. It's sad to see him reduced to this.

425~~~
Would love to see his pass chart. What do people reckon the % of forward, side and backpasses he has made?

426~~~
Terrible half for him.

Words fail me.

427~~~
He and Fletcher are woeful. Absolutely woeful.

428~~~
He's been like this since his partnership with Anderson where he took on the responsibility of just keeping the ball, while Anderson tried more things and gave it away more. 

At the time I commended Cleverley for doing that because the last thing we needed was 2 central midfielders giving the ball away all the time and it showed some maturity. But he's never improved on it since then, despite playing with players less prone to giving the ball away and less attacking than Anderson.

He has improved defensively. He's won a few tackles today as well, but gave away a silly dangerous freekick as well

429~~~
Hope the rumours are true we are flogging him out on loan

430~~~
It's cringeworthy watching him play for us and to think we had Pogba lol it's not even funny how pish he is.

431~~~
Better than Fletcher.

432~~~
Why loan? He's 25. 

Should just get rid.

433~~~
He's been what he always is, a cowardly little shite.

434~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

435~~~
Forget his play style of beg for ball, shits himself when he gets it, gives it back and then runs away. What annoys me is his apparent lack of self criticism. There have been interviews of him saying he thinks he shouldn't be the scapegoat, his style of play would be appreciated in other countries or whatever. He seems to think he's a great midfielder and it's everyone else's fault.

436~~~
Proper rubbish in't he? Sad. I thought he would turn out a good'un.

437~~~
"fine" performances like this don't win you games.

438~~~
Who is going to buy that guy? He won't leave for a lesser wage and we were stupid enough to give him a contract.

439~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

440~~~
Love how he passes backwards and the runs into where he can't get it

441~~~
Thought I was going paranoid and it was only me who sees that. He's literally hiding behind other players.

442~~~
If he was a signing he'd be regarded as one of the worst players to play for United for years and years and years. He's Obertan level. 

It's like he thinks "Hmm, what would a good midfielder do here" and then does the exact opposite of that.

443~~~
I just wonder how long his defenders can justify defending him.

444~~~
And people would be happy if we gave him a new 4-year 50k a week contract?

445~~~
Give him a new contract with an expiry date for the end of the season

446~~~
Homegrown lad, he'll come good y'know. It's probably Giggs filling LvG's head with a load of garbage about how Cleverley has been here years, loves the club etc.

447~~~
So disappointed with Cleverley today. Looks slow and laboured. Always hoped he would succeed as a United player, but I just don't think he's good enough.

448~~~
After todays performance its difficult to even consider him as a squad player.

449~~~
Aye.

450~~~
If that was the case , I question why either are either here. 

Only the biggest club in the world would they give a place to Cleverley fletcher Anderson fellaini Valencia and young

451~~~
I've played with players like him, they run around aimlessly pretending to look really busy and that they want the ball when in reality they don't. Pretending to be annoyed when they don't get the ball, when in reality they are glad. Then when they get the ball they want rid of it immediately because they are mental midgets terrified of getting the ball.

452~~~
No good enough. Cant tackle and cant really pass.

453~~~
He has the worst technique at the club.

454~~~
He's actually a liability at this stage but his defenders will tell you that he is actually quite good. Maybe the people that don't rate him just don't eh 'get him'.

455~~~
Never want to see him play for us again. No bollocks, no positives. Useless.

456~~~
An utter nothing player. His defenders on the caf must be thoroughly embarrassed.

457~~~
He embodies this garbage team. He is the face of it.

458~~~
Seen him complaining about someone not passing to him, despite the fact he does feck all with it when he gets it.

459~~~
They will wait until he has a game not quite as diabolical as this and say 'told you he's good'.

460~~~
feck him out of this club already. I just cannot stand watching him any longer.

461~~~
He went from being a reasonable prospect to a nothing player and he's now evolved into a liability. In fairness, he's not the only one.

462~~~
He complains all the time. I actually hate him.

463~~~
And the fact he makes himself unavailable more often than not after he make a pass. So when he actually asks for the ball it's a miracle he even made that space.

464~~~
That's it for me - he is the exemplification of everything that is wrong with this team. One of many below average, unsinpired, cowardly players stealing a living from Manchester United due to our sentimentality.

I've always said he's a championship player and I stand by that.

465~~~
One of his worst matches and he's had many stinkers before. Such a pussy of a player

466~~~
Passes the ball, then runs off, pretending to look busy.

467~~~
Worse than Djemba Djemba.

468~~~
Does nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Not good defensivley, not good offensivley. But hey, a local boy so play him!!!

469~~~
He has this unnerving ability to suck every last ounce of momentum from the ball each time he touches it.

470~~~
I'm starting to think he isn't even good enough for West Ham or Sunderland.

471~~~
Honestly if anyone's got like a kid, you can get them to be a premier league footballer if this guy can be one. Just get them capable of running around for 90 minutes and passing the ball between 5 to 10 yards to an open person. Don't bother with absolutely anything else.

472~~~
I'd take the Djemba twins over him any day of the week. He was never that poor.

473~~~
Absolute coward of a football player.

474~~~
Give him a new contract? I'd buy out the rest of his current one and kick him out the door.

475~~~
Poor once again, spends the whole game pointing, asking for the ball and then either passing it backwards, sideways or giving it away. Fl etcher was worse but says a lot that januzaj was better than both of them and he was playing out of position, LVG would be mad not to sign a cm or two and equally stupid to offer new contracts to fletcher or Cleverley.

476~~~
This game has to have finally seen off the last of the defenders of Cleverley and Fletcher surely? Anyone still in their corner after this is simply in some sort of denial.

477~~~
I'm not joking when I say that him and Fletcher might just be the worst midfield pairing in the league. Neither should even be allowed on the bench. Atrocious from the both of them today.

478~~~
To think we renewed his contract makes me want to throw up.

479~~~
He must be our most lightweight and weakest central midfielder for decades. Maybe a very very young Scholes is in there too, but he always had some fight and aggression. Cleverley falls over at the slightest gust of wind

480~~~
Honestly think that was the worst passing display I have seen

481~~~
Martinez likes him, doesn't he? we should seriously try to use him to get McCarthy then. Or just sell him, either way works.

He's the poster boy for our decline over the last year. He exemplifies it.

482~~~
The likes of Bolton or Wigan would seem like suitable destinations.

483~~~
He's a con artist, makes people think he's a footballer.

484~~~
Awful.

No creativity, no vision, no ability, no pace, no strength.

He is essentially worthless.

485~~~
Please do us all a favour and go play for Luton Town.

486~~~
I've been saying it for years but he's simply not good enough. Anyone can see it. The fact that he's starting shows how dreadful the squad really is.

487~~~
Like those bargin bin DVD combos of three films we should ship him, Young and Valencia off together for a fiver, or pay someone the fiver.

488~~~
very very average. needs to be sitting on the bench at best. an injured gundogan with a broken back and one leg cto hop on would do a better job. hope herrera is fit for the next game.

489~~~
He'd get a 7 or 8 for that performance in Spain.

490~~~
Thankfully his contract is up in 2015. If we give him a new one we're run by mental patients.

491~~~
yes, in 100 point ranking system.

492~~~
Opposition players don't even seem to bother with marking his runs, he is THAT guy. He's beyond terrible and must be the reason Van Gaal says it's hard to sell players.

493~~~
Can we bring Scholes out of retirement again?

494~~~
Not many are fooled, though. He has his tedious defenders on here who are actually quite embarrassing with their overrating of him. Funny that, like Cleverley, they are nowhere to be seen today.

495~~~
Stealing a living fecking hopeless should get rid ASAP

496~~~
Who sanctioned the new contract for him and Valencia? Surely Giggs right?

497~~~
That was a horrible performance. I don't even know who was worse between him and Fletcher.

498~~~
Karl Power has got nothing on this guy.

499~~~
Bring back Liam Miller and Richardson

500~~~
Giggs would do. Atleast he'd pass it forward.

501~~~
Didn't do himself any favours with that display.

502~~~
There's pass and move, but Tom Cleverley's pass it 5 yards back and slowly walk away from someone is probably more frustrating than Ashley Young's crossing.

503~~~
Inside the club I meant, how he hasn't been sold years ago is beyond me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He also makes a pass and runs in a blind alley, he makes these little sprint in no man's land. Someone really should introduce to the concept of give-and-go because for him it's give-and-vanish.

504~~~
He was absolutely rotten. He offers nothing going forward and next to nothing defensively.

I was one of those who thought with LVG coming in, Cleverly would be ok and good enough as a backup member of the squad but I don't even think he's good enough for that at the minute.

505~~~
Also thinking, Giggsy told LvG that he is misunderstood.....

506~~~
Too many chances at this stage, unfortunately he is simply not good enough.

507~~~
The likes of cricket or golf would seem like suitable destinations.

508~~~
48% forward, 28% sideways, and 24% backwards.

509~~~
He strokes it around casually like he's fecking Xavi or Iniesta. Wanker.

510~~~
He's lauded for his "neat and tidy passing", but he gave the ball away needlessly so often.

You can't even say he's a jack of all trades. He's not good at anything.

511~~~
That hurts my eyes. Just saw his pass chart, looks like a cat's cradle.

512~~~
Officially given up on the lad. Positionally hes bad, cant pass, cant tackle and his shooting makes Anderson look like Ruud. 

Guy isnt even good enough to be a squad player

513~~~
Young, Fletcher, Cleverly, Valencia.

Bleurgh.

514~~~
There might be some hope for him with some outfit down in the Championship.

515~~~
Also, he has stolen Shaw's haircut.

516~~~
I think what sums him up is that he has one main asset - Passing

And his passing range and ability is average. Its his main asset because he plays 99.9% safe passes that are incredibly difficult to mess up, so he doesn't lose the ball much. But he also passes on the responsibility of doing anything with the ball to someone else

517~~~
I really hope he does not get this proposed contract... Opitimises everything wrong with our squad. Average all over.

518~~~
He's often dismissed as "Sunderland level", which, based on today, is an insult to Sunderland. He's clearly not even good enough for lower level PL teams now they have the money from the new tv deal. Let's hope that di Maria is not the only arrival next week because our midfield options are a disgrace.

519~~~
I miss the days Thomas Cleverley wasn't even a thing.

520~~~
Hes a poor man's Gibson.

521~~~
If Martinez rates him still after that, get the money.

522~~~
That's what someone like De Jong would do. But atleast De Jong can win the ball back.

523~~~
Nope, that dubious honour goes to Valencia and Fletcher. Joint award.

524~~~
I've seen better players in my local league.

Wouldn't get into another premier league team.

525~~~
Oooh I fecking hate the way he swings his leg after passing it. Infuriating.

526~~~
He got more involved today and did try to get stuck in. Tried to hit some cross field balls and get some quick passing in. Has so little confidence though and if we had a fit squad, he wouldn't make the bench. Fletcher was very poor today, our whole team lacked pace front to back, including middle of the park.

527~~~
Both Cleverley and Fletcher were absolutely terrible. The result was acceptable, but the performance...

528~~~
He isn't a bad player. He's just the epitome of averageness and gormlessness.

I mean he'll never play a quick pass or a risky pass. It's always taking 2 or 3 touches before making a really easy pass to the guy next to him or behind him. He absolutely kills the tempo of the team and adds nothing attacking wise.

529~~~
Him and young need to go. West Ham or someone like that would suit them.

530~~~
Scapegoating never did anything for anyone. Just makes you look like a cnut. Move on.

531~~~
How many times did he give the ball away today, I'm sure I counted three times in the first five minutes alone.

532~~~
'Arry's going to be in the market after the hiding today. Hopefully we can offload some junk to that lot.

533~~~
He's a joke of a player these days. Genuinely wouldn't get in most premier league teams. He used to be good, now he's just become a pussy and is too scared to do anything with it and seems to have lost any bit of talent he had as well.

534~~~
You'd think after that he'd be the worst player on the pitch, but yet he was better than fletcher.

535~~~
Give him to Roberto Martinez..... FOR FREE.

536~~~
We laughed at Henderson. 

But he is so worse than Henderson.

537~~~
He was truly awful today....Clevs, Fletcher and Mata should be nowhere near our first team

538~~~
Not even close really.

539~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

540~~~
He represents what's worse in today's English football. Absolute laziness and lack of character. Already wants to be a star with a fancy haircut but can't even make a breakthrough pass, a shot or any type of run against Sunderland who outplayed us in midfield like some top European team.

Of course you can't blame him and put him under any critique because he's young and learning in the age of 25 and yes there are still people who will defend his performances.

The feckers like him are using Van Gaal's patience for club's younger players and doing absolutely nothing to improve while cashing in some solid money for that type of lousy excuse of football but of course we're too hard on young and talented Cleverley.

This club needs to go back to it's roots from it's ambitious era when manager could axe anyone including maestros like Beckham, Veron and Van Nistelrooy. If you let these type of amateurs run the show you will lose the team like Moyes did.

541~~~
Well Henderson made me laugh at Liverpool in the beginning, Cleverley has made cry for years now at manchester United. The day this boy leaves the club and I don't have to ever see him in our colours again will be one of the happiest days in my life. I absolutley hate Cleverley, there is no player in the squad that make my guts turn as much as this guy, I want him out, I don't even care if it is on a free I want him out. I'd even prefer to play an completley green academy player over him or settle for playing one of our wingers or defenders or even attackers out of position rather than give Cleverley one more minute on the pitch, hell I'd rather we play with a man less than to have Cleverley on the pitch, truely awfull player in every sense of the word.

542~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> 
The one that actually scored a goal and was involved in our attacks...wtf ?

543~~~
Terrible player. Fletch is no better,  and neither should make it into September at this club. 

I'd start Rothwell ahead of either.

544~~~
Fraud

545~~~
When does his contract run out? 

Can't believe he is older than Toni Kroos.

546~~~
He was a little better after Fletcher went off but that combination is football Kryptonite, the first half was as poor a Man Utd midfield duo as I've ever seen, Cattermole looked like Vidal in there against them, even Seb Larson was too much at times for Fletcher.

547~~~
Well Berbatov used to score goals for us but still slowed down our play and didn't get involved enough which negatively affected the whole balance of our forward play....He was never a Utd player and I fear Mata is not too

548~~~
I'd probably start Fred the red ahead of either, in fact I think playing with a man less is beter than to have those aholes in the team, what a disgraceful players. Unbelievable how they have earned the privelege to call themselves United players, get to wear the shirt and play for such massive crowds and get paid so much money for doing it. If I would be doing such a poor job at my work, my boss would fire me instantly, they can't even do the basics of football right, they are worthless footballers and they have the mentality of absolute pussies on the pitch ! Disgrace to our club, I 'am ashamed these shits can call themselve United players, the mentality and skill these guys put on the pitch is not what I'am supporter off, Sir Alex Ferguson would not have stand for such bollocks, he would not have let our club be ridiculed in this way, these two have to go, I don't want to see a single minute of them anymore this year or ever !

549~~~
The real sad thing is that we can't even ship him off to the likes of West Ham. Him and Fletcher played like two pub league players today, even the Championship would be embarassed to have midfielders like that.

550~~~
Complains when he doesn't get the ball, but all he ever does is just pass it staright back.

He'll be playing in the Championship 3 years from now, I have never been more sure of anything in my life.

551~~~
Of course we can ship him off. Doesn't he just have a year left on his deal? Wasn't that the basis for that ridiculous 55k new deal story? 

We could sell him to Martinez for 3-5m. Personally, I wouldn't care if we'd make no money from the deal.

552~~~
Did not do much right tonight, tried to defend sporadically, had no idea what to do whilst attacking the opposition. Him and Fletch are done. Time to invest in getting Herrera a decent partner.

553~~~
Clevs did pretty well when he was a supporting player under SAF but when things aren't going well there are really no redeeming qualities about him.  Has tailed off considerably since he first came onto the team.  He is a counterattack waiting to happen.

554~~~
Way to soon to have Mata in the same category as Berbatov...He is a playmaker and he needs good players around him to be able to really impact the game, if nobody is making runs or all good balls get wasted by pour first touches and being to slow in the excution than having Mata in your team boils down to not much more than an occasional goal from him and a few good passes that will usually result into nothing. He has proven last year he can score goals on a consistent basis and deliver plenty of assists, when he has good players around him with pace like he had at Chelsea then he can be one of the best in the league, but if you have players like Young, Valencia with no footballing brain or RVP and Rooney who just don't move about as your only support play than he can only do so much.

Apart from our defenders and De gea he is the one that annoyed me the least out there today. He has undoubtably got alot of quality and unlike Berbatov he doesn't sulk around all game, he actually makes some runs, goes on to get the ball, gets his hands dirty, he is not fantastic at it, but he is far more usefull player than Berbatov ever was and he is a million times more usefull than Fletcher or Cleverley. I really don't get why you lash out at him like that, if there is one player in the team next to januzaj and in a few days Di Maria who could turn things around for us, it his him no doubt.

555~~~
Diabolical today. One of the worst performances I've seen.

556~~~
You can't really laugh at Henderson anymore, he has emerged as a very good player.

557~~~
I bet you after a couple of days, a few come in and say he's a good squad player.

He's not. He's lower league class.

558~~~
Played well today I think but he didn't get to play enough in the pre-season to get over the hump.. Actually it was Rooney and Mata who came and literally took the ball away from him a couple of times, turned around and only then realized that  there was no one to pass it to after that.. He clearly isn't trusted with the ball and it shows..

559~~~
I'm sorry but he's utter shit. And what's that sideways shimmy he always does before he passes the ball, does my head in.

560~~~
He's not even Championship level; he's League 1 caliber alright.

Very good post.

I also have enough with a number of our English players who think they can have immunity because they're English. Well, I say FECK THEM! From the moment they offer nothing, the manager should have no qualms in axing them once and for all. Are Everton still interested in him? I would sell that whiny little b**** to them for United's good conscience.

561~~~
Aye sadly was pretty bad today, think his time is up tbh, surely one of the academy lads would be better taking his place now, personally i'd go for Pearson.

Maybe a cheeky £5 million + Cleverley bid for McCarthy is the way to go.

562~~~
To be fair, it did not help him that Fletcher was absolutely non-existent today and Januzaj is no central midfielder! Although doesn't take away from the fact that he was dire today as was much of the team.

563~~~
Right I'm officially done with him now. He was shocking. I couldn't even say that was just an average performance. That was just atrocious. This guy is starting for us. What the feck is wrong with us?!

He offers us nothing. No pace. No creativity. No drive. No steel. No goals. Nothing.

I want him gone. I don't care how spoilt this sounds, but there's at least 100 midfielders I could probably name ahead of him.

Edit: Fletcher was just as bad. But at least he can offer something. Today he was just atrocious. Cleverley is consistent at giving us nothing.

564~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://data.seruu.com/images/thumbs/right-content/2012/12/14/457(11).jpg" src="http://data.seruu.com/images/thumbs/right-content/2012/12/14/457(11).jpg"/>


How times change.

565~~~
He's not United standard. Didn't help that Fletcher was somehow even worse because Cleverley needs someone telling him where to stand and what to do. It worked when Carrick was playing well a few seasons but he's regressed and wouldn't stand out in a lower standard team.

Today I could tell exactly what pass he was going to do before he did it and like Fletcher, he gave it away so often it was hard to watch. I imagine van Gaal put him in by default this afternoon, but Kagawa should be playing ahead of him even though he's more suited to the 10 role.

566~~~
I just remembered that Roy Keane is now assistant at Aston Villa. If I was a very despicable of a character as the manager, I would find a way to send Cleverley in Villa to meet his worst nightmare and have his life becoming a living hell. What do you say?

567~~~
Anyone care to help with creating a two-paged brochure for him to sell him to the Spanish clubs?

570~~~
Did OK today. Provided more urgency than any of our other midfielders have managed outside of Herrera in the games to date. He's never going to be a world beater but he's decent as long as he picks up the tempo.

571~~~
No he didn't do ok today.

572~~~
Did ok? Couldn't even complete a 10 yard square pass if his life depended on it. Him and Fletcher make Djemba-Djemba and Kleberson look like Iniesta and Xavi.

573~~~

574~~~
It's always nice to see homegrown lads make it at United, but much like a guy like Gibson he just doesn't cut it. Gibson could shoot a bit, but didn't offer much else. Tom can pass and move a bit on his day, but not even all that great. It's time for him to leave. 

The way he presents himself in interviews doesn't make things easier for him with the fans either.

575~~~
I actually thought he played with a bit more conviction and bottle today. There were certainly more forward passes than before.

Obviously that was still way way too less compared to what's actually needed at this club.

576~~~
Thought it was a bad dream-most passes in opponent's half were to the side.

577~~~
There's no point me criticizing him anymore cause I'm gone beyond the point

I know he's a local lad and everything but he's stealing a living playing for the club

578~~~
He doesn't deserve a pay rise, that much is clear.

579~~~

He was appalling.

580~~~
I agree.

581~~~
The only praise I can give him was that he was better than our vice captain.

582~~~
Like Young I can't imagine anyone being crazy enough to take him off our hands.

583~~~

584~~~
Not even half the player

585~~~
It's those kind of bizarre posts that get me. How could anyone who watched today's game defend him?

586~~~
Not even a tenth the player.

587~~~
I wondered if it was 'just' loss of confidence that was making him perform badly last year.

It didn't look like it today. Awful performance from him and Fletcher, though they weren't alone.

If we want a fee for him, he has to leave in the next eight days as his contract is up next year. I hope we're not offering him a new one.

We need to be ruthless now. Sentimentality or keeping very average players will not get us back to the top.

588~~~
God he was fecking dreadful today, he really offers nothing. It was a right circus with him and Fletcher in the first half. He can only kick the ball a certain way, he never puts his foot through it or uses the outside of his foot. It's sad that Tom hasn't progressed but he's not good enough for United. It's as simple as this, if we don't buy a center midfielder we will struggle to get top 4. I really rate Herrera and still think Carrick is good but the rest are painfully average. I think Fletch is a sub for a big game and nothing more, it's sad. We have a lot injured and I'm convinced things will get better. It's a huge week for Manchester United in the transfer window. I really hope Herrera is back soon, he was missed today. It's not an over reaction, we have been weak for sometime in his position. That position dictates the tempo of our play. The ball distribution is key for the wings and overall control of the game. When you have so much class up front it's sad to see it starved because of a poor midfield. Time to move on Tom, best for everyone involved.

589~~~
<i>"I watch Spanish football a lot. If they pass the ball sideways but keep possession, the fans clap them. Their attitude is that as long as you have got the ball, the other team can't hurt you. I know the mentality is different here and that is what makes our game the best in the world because it is so intense. But sometimes I have got to not listen and play my game because I feel I'm doing the best thing for the team." </i><b>Tom Cleverley 2014</b>

As I said, a fraud!

590~~~
Did we watch the same match?  I can't for a second believe we have...

591~~~
Isn't he from Hampshire?
I thought he did fine, he kept play ticking. That pitch map shows that he did a good amount of work keeping the play moving. I am not buying into the whole pitchforks and mob harassing mentality that is going on in these threads. Let all the babies have their bottle. I'm behind Cleverley to turn it around.

592~~~
I did a little dance when we offloaded Gibson but I'd give my right bollock to have him back over Cleverly as it stands.

At least Gibson will shoot, pass forward sometimes, move about a bit, sometimes run with the ball.
Occasionally tackle.
Generally trying to play to football.

593~~~
He plays like a frightened child.

594~~~
How shit must Anderson be to have Cleverley start ahead of him?

Most on here complain about his ineffectiveness, but today I saw him hiding a few times as well. Literally taking up a position behind another player so that he cannot receive the ball. Sunderland pressed whoever was on the ball so making yourself available for a pass would have helped.

595~~~
I remember seeing that thread for the first time, hilarious stuff.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

596~~~
To be honest, the kid has 0 confidence which doesn't help. He was actually decent at times in 2012/13. He is such a basic Footballer though it's scary how he still turns out for us, simple passes all the time, looks totally lost. His level is even below the likes of Everton for me, he is just about a Premier League Footballer. That is all. Needs to go.

597~~~
I don't know why he has to do a 180 degree pirouette every time he has to hit a pass longer than his arm's length. Its funnier that he seems to throw his hands frustrated at others if they don't pass him the ball while does everything to make himself harder to find than a needle in a haystack.

598~~~
His shooting technique is absolutely hilarious. He just can't shoot.

599~~~
Almost every time he releases the ball he runs away into a pack of players. It's as if he's trying to make an attacking run or at least make it look like one, when in reality he's just running into a place he's never in a month of Sundays going to get the ball back.

600~~~
He passes the ball like with real concentration on how to get height and direction on it, there is nothing exquisite about it. With players like Scholes they just effortlessly pinpoint it 40 yards, the magic is all in the foot.

 Such an average player.

601~~~
He's not a local lad but he's definitely not worthy of playing for us.

602~~~
I don't think he was that bad. At least not as bad as Fletcher, who was beyond shite.

603~~~
Definition of a gutless passenger. Offers nothing. Better than Fletch though, but that's not saying much.

604~~~
They were both embarrassingly bad, but Cleverley irritates me whenever he plays because he is consistently shite.

605~~~
It's shocking isn't it. Although I don't even know if you can call what he does a shooting technique, he just can't shoot. That effort he made in the first 10 minutes was laughable at how inept it was.

I thought for a long time Cleverly was decent and would be ok to have in the squad as a backup. I don't think he can even be that though now, he's not just failed to develop from a few years ago, he's regressed. That central midfield today was arguably the worst we've fielded in the last 25 years. Park and Rafael were a better combo.

606~~~
It is amazing how much he's regressed. A few years ago it looked like he was on the verge of being a really good player for us. Shame.

607~~~
I can see that he really tries and I feel like he gives it his all but he's just so out of his league that it's unfair. And Fletchers performance today and against Swansea reminds me of pensioner that's starting to show signs of dementia (perhaps a bit harsh but it did anyways). I can't see any harm in trying other people in cm until Herrera and Carrick or a new player comes in. I doubt it could get any worse. Hopefully Powell and some other cm from our youth-team will get a chance to impress the manager on tuesday.

608~~~
Wow for all the talk about him being LVG's man this year, he has done feck all in pre-season and in yesterday's game. He can never get his confidence back here I think because with his form he is never going to get a consistent run in the team. I don't know why we are so reluctant to move him on. And talks of him getting a new contract is just laughable. At this point in time, I don't care if he is our academy product or not. If you're not good enough, you're not good enough. End of story.

609~~~
Can't shoot, can't tackle, can't dribble, can't run - offers nothing except the occasional simple pass. How he is a Man U player is beyond me. Lee Cattermole is a far far superior player than the great TC23.

610~~~
That's the exact same line I keep repeating day in day out. I just can't understand how and why our footballing people can't understand that when every football fan and his dog can see the same thing with Cleverley.

611~~~
To be fair to him literally nothing works for us at the moment. Something is seriously broken in our team, and it's not all Cleverley or Fletcher's fault.

612~~~
We are talking about what he is bringing to the table to solve our issues. And he isnt bringing anything. 

YES!!

He does this thing when he passes or crosses where it looks unnatural. It like he is trying too much. It looks sort of like the way Beckham passes but with Beckham its natural. With him its really not, it looks forced.

Cleverly genuinely makes me sad that my parents didn't  push me enough to make it as a footballer. I came from a match today before watching our game and I honestly dont know If I would look any worse in our midfield when Herrera and Carrick are not playing.

613~~~
At least he wasn't the worst player on the pitch (although that says something).

614~~~
I blame Nolan for that stupid tackle 3 years ago.

615~~~
According to whoscored.com his strengths are 'concentration' and 'passing' ... I think it's fair to rule passing out (he's capable of knocking an eye-catching ball every now and then, but it's few and far between, and his simple passes are often mind-bogglingly shit) so that leaves us with 'concentration'.

So, in conclusion, according to one website - we have a central midfielder, who's only strength is his concentration...

616~~~
He's unrecognisable now. Such a shame, because he used to be an accelerator of the game with a quick passing style and always seemed to be moving forwards. I thought he could be a useful part of our future midfield where we would employ a more relentless passing and pressing game. These days he's safe, predictable and a complete passenger.

617~~~
I'd give them £5 million just to take him. They probably value McCarthy at £20 million or so, so this suggests Cleverley is worth £15 million.

Even with massive, twice as much as normal English tax he's not worth into double figures. Utter, utter shite.

618~~~
I'm getting sick of thinking: 'right, everyone's injured so this will be his opportunity to stake a claim in this squad'. So far he's just been utter dross with every chance he got, even during pre-season where even Young looked amazing.

He just has to go, would not look out of place at a club like Burnley or QPR.

619~~~
I said before how I don't get why people think he's a good squad player. A squad player has to still play 20 games a season, I would not trust Cleverley to play 5 games a season in all honesty. He wouldn't get in any other top teams squad but he's starting for us.

620~~~
He makes simple balls look 5 times harder than they are. Player is 10 yards away and he puts his full body into it like he's taking a free kick, when he could have just poked it like any normal player. Trying too hard to be different when he should just keep it simple

621~~~
I hate this guy so much right now. He can't even do the simple things right anymore.

622~~~
He had a 90% pass completion rate, mainly because they were all sideways 5 yard passes.

623~~~
Every match he plays in, he has a few moments where you really think to yourself, does this lad even play football? He has this perpetual habit in games, where he starts off full of beans the first 10 minutes making some solid runs and passes then come the 15th minute he completely fecks a simple thing up, gets really mad at himself, loses focus, starts fecking up more simple things, rages at himself some more, and then starts his glorious runs into absolutely feck nowhere far far away from any teammate/ball.

624~~~
And then he screams at team mates when they don't pass the ball

625~~~
So does Martinez still want him?

626~~~
He is the prime example of players in our squad who are like night and day when it comes to the preseason we just had and the regular season. Fletcher, Rooney, Cleverley, Young were all excellent in preseason. We looked worry-free. Now they're the same shite again.

627~~~
Needs to be kicked out of the club.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, keeping him here sends a terrible message to youth players. Minimal effort and talent = huge rewards.

You don't want to encourage that.

628~~~
This is so fecking spot on, I have always hated the way he shaped himself awkwardly when making a pass and a shot. Like he wants to always bend them like Beckham, his shooting is horrible because of that, he shapes himself weirdly.

629~~~
Near the end of the match yesterday he was over the left hand side of the pitch near the Sunderland box, someone passed to him and he randomly kicked the ball into a Sunderland defender and then it started an attack for Altidore. An absolute liability.

630~~~
I can understand players not being good enough for the jersey but I detest a coward like him. Hiding behind opponents when the CBs don't have an option to pass.

631~~~
Can we all stop bringing "that" tackle up every time??

 It happened in 2011. . If a tackle from 3 years ago has messed him up, then its a damn shame that Keano and Brucy aren't still about. . . One tackle from them in training would have shown him up for what he is.

632~~~
If he wasn't such a pussy he could've recovered from that no problem, he was out for like 2 months only anyways, hardly a big deal. That scenario was probably a sign of things to come to show how spineless he actually is.

633~~~
Say what you want about Djemba Djemba but, he never hid away. .

Cleverley is the English Liam Miller.

All fur coat and no knickers

634~~~
I've defended him in the past but I agree with this. I'm getting tired of seeing him refusing to take responsibility and take charge of the game.

635~~~
Towards the end, Mata had the ball and Cleverley made a dart to make himself available for the first time in ages near their penalty box. Mata saw and completely ignored him. Almost seemed like he didn't trust him to give him the ball knowing full well that he will get it back 2 secs later.

636~~~
By trying and giving his all, if you mean hiding behind opponents, not taking any responsibility and being in general a coward and a passenger in this team; then we are on the same page.

637~~~
Fletcher, when he was healthy, was twice the player Cleverley can ever hope to be. Fletcher was one of our star players during his prime season and his koss was missed in the CL final against Barca.

638~~~
Yep, like that first-time shot that he took just outside the box in the first half. He was pretty much laying on the floor while he kicked it

639~~~
Not much to add to the above except to speculate if that was his last game for United. We have a coach who has managed some of the finest midfielders of the last 20 years (Davids, Seedorf, Xavi, Iniesta, Schweinsteiger) and he must know an imposter when he sees one. I predict a similar career trajectory as for the club's other Eric - another premier league club based on the kudos of being at United followed by a drop into the Championship.

640~~~
Watching the replay now and that just happened. Absolutely awful.

641~~~
This nonce couldn't play in a midfield 5 ffs

642~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/qN9HTGx.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/qN9HTGx.png"/> 

Saw this on RAWK. Depressingly funny.

643~~~
Both him and Fletch were abysmal. It says a lot when lee cattermole dominates the midfield.

It'l be a shame if he doesnt improve, had high hopes from him and welbeck under LVG.

644~~~
They stole that from here.

Typical Scousers.

EDIT: The Clevidal photo.

645~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

646~~~
His passing accuracy isn't that bad, in fact, it's pretty good. It's just the direction of the pass that fails him. Sad thing is, I could see him thrive in a confident team with a bit of confidence in himself. I think LVG sees something like this in him and will keep him on. Will never be a big wage earner so always a decent squad player if he finds form. If he could tackle and read the game better he would be a great holding midfielder as his passing is simple but could be effective.
Out of all the deadwood, I'd give Tom the chance because of his passing ability. I'd certainly keep him ahead of Fletcher, Anderson and Fellaini.

647~~~
The accuracy is largely a result of playing no risk (and no gain) passes nearly all the time. "If he could tackle and read the game better" - is he realistically going to acquire those attributes at the age of 25?

648~~~
What I hate the most is how he constantly does this stupid hand thing to ask for the ball, only because he wants to make another 2 yard pass to another defender and repeat the same 1 minute later.

649~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> its so true

650~~~
Henderson is a better presser, tackler, passer, and tries to create something. He's transformed from being a peripheral figure, to being one of Liverpool's most important players. He more or less guarantees you at least 7/10 performances every week. In the same period (11-14), Cleverley has only produced half a season of consistency - that's it. It's sad that the only thing he guarantees is a very good passing accuracy, and we all know why that is.

651~~~
let's be clear, he only does that when he has already assessed that he has no opposition player too close to him, and he has a clear view of the defender he will pass it back to.

I remember days when Paul Scholes demanded the ball with two players on him already, but that was the start of an attack.

652~~~
It's probably the most annoying thing I've ever seen a united player do. He does it all the fecking time. He also moans like mad at other players when they mis place a pass, when this fraud can't play a 40 yard pass to save his life. He's another coward who's been here far too long, he's an absolute hindrance. Get rid ffs.

653~~~
Sad to see his regression, but in the end it also exposes his mental fragility/weakness. Not a United type player in either mental toughness or football ability.

654~~~
That Cleverley thread after that Community Shield game 3 years ago... oh how we praised our new prodigy...

655~~~
I occasionally feel for the lad when he's on the pitch since he's obviously very low on confidence but sympathy only lasts so long, especially when he continually bigs himself up in interviews - or am I wrong there?  He's 25 now and it's just not working out for him at United.... maybe Van Gaal can resurrect his career but yeah, come January i'd personally be thinking of selling him if things haven't improved.  Torture watching him at the moment.

656~~~
Tom needs to move on. The fear of making mistakes like so many of the players here has zapped any confidence he had left. Needs to find that at another club in the prem. He won't be the first or the last that's had to leave a, big club to find his game again.

657~~~
Can I just mention - where has this 'shrinks away and doesn't want the ball pussy' thing come from? Watching the game again the guy is standing there with his arms out 90% of the time howling for the ball and sometimes I am sat here thinking why the hell do you not make a simple pass to him. Finally Valencia comes miles off his wing to do that and hits him this ugly ball peeling away behind him that he has to trap with his back to goal and Cattermole up his arse and play a pass back to his unmarked defenders.

I just think this odd - alright call his lack of go forward into question but I've seen him literally howling at Fletch for the ball at least 7 times in the opening 25 minutes of this game.

658~~~
I saw that a bit last season too and I think it's basically a case of the rest of the squad not having confidence in him at the moment.  Can't think of anything else really.

659~~~
Yeah, I know what you mean there, but in the end, he's a living a dream, and getting paid a shit load of money to do it. So that's when the sympathy ends.

If his not good enough, he should be moved on ASAP, and he's had ample time to rediscover his form or prove himself. He'll build a solid career for himself, so I'm not too fussed anymore.

Would have loved it if he made it here, but we need the calibre of players who will stand up and be counted when the going gets tough.

Simply put, he might thrive at a smaller club, where the expectation is less and he has time to prove himself.

660~~~
In addition to my bashing yesterday, after watching MOTD2 last night, there was one attack where Clevereley stopped tracking back when Buckley was taking on Young and Blackett, which resulted in a massive gap for Buckley to cut inside and then played a through ball for Wickham/Larsson (shot was saved by De Gea I believe). 

He just stopped running. It was unbelievable. The gap was just gaping and I'm sure Buckley couldn't believe it. 

It's embarassing that he's United quality. I'm fairly certain that I could have done better yesterday. Everything he did was just predictable and lacked any creativity or inspiration. 

Getting rid of players was just as an important objective as bringing in players in this window, and so far, we have not done the former well enough.

661~~~
He was shocking yesterday. The English Xavi, my hole. He's not good enough and never was. I hope he does well somewhere else. Seems a good lad.

662~~~
That wouldn't be a problem if it was a one off, but he's far too error prone and safe. Someone (I think it was Sixpence) was saying he'll pass he ball and then run away pretending to look busy which I can't disagree with.

663~~~
Yeah, fair call that is. Or 'designated outlet' players? It seems to me that from the middle they'll ignore a dish off and move into space if a player has come deep. I just feel that Cleverley playing with a number 10 in front of him is completely pointless. Take away his defensive duties by all means but he makes the dart forward and then he's bang sat there next to the no10 and nearly every time that other player usually passes to Mata (or the 10) every time. It makes us very unbalanced.

664~~~
far be it for me to give a Premier league footballer any advice, but surely on one of those 20-30 times he got the ball just outside the penalty box he could try a shot or a forward pass.

Just once!
If it flies into the stand, oh well you tried. But not to ever shoot!
Shame none fell to Mata. he'd have a shot.

665~~~
Or when he was injured after a good run of games, we all literally thought he was the key! Oh we've got Cleverley out, when he's back we'll be fine. Type stuff.

666~~~
Cleverley said he was perfect for LVGs style. He lied to us fellas

667~~~
Been saying on here for years that no way am I having that he is better than Anderson.  I think Ando gets worse and worse by his absence, however he is a better footballer than Cleverley, Fletcher and Fellaini for me.

All four of them are not good enough though.

668~~~
Yup, seen that as well and pointed it out during matchday thread. It's the same kind of mistake that cost us a goal against Swans. Midfielders are overloading the wing for some reason and then don't track back to their zone, which results in 16th yard being wide open.

669~~~
This perhaps is the single most frustrating aspect of all our squad players, is that not a single one of them ever puts that extra mile in to try and force their way into the team.
Cleverly yesterday ambled around, didn't try to impose himself on the game in any way, was lazy and dim witted in his play, he was embarrassing.

It's not in any way comparable but when I used to play in the 00s I was dropped out out of the starting line up of our Saturday league team because another local team had broken up and our manager had some shiny new toys he wanted to put in the side (plus they had mates in the side already).
I turned up for 4 games on the bounce and didn't get on the pitch.
The 5th match I came on in the second half as a left back (I was a winger/striker) when we were 2-0 down. I set up 2 and scored one, put a load of crunching tackles in and went on to start every game for the rest of the season.

I don't see any desire from our squad players at all.

670~~~
To be fair I think a lot of fans in desperation for a quality midfielder were seeing things in players and he'd be a good example that just wasn't there. Throw in the fact he was a young English lad and it was amplified even more again. Understandable enough I suppose.

671~~~
His technique is sort of bending down on one side, bringing his shoulder near his fecking kneecap, and side footing it. His passing technique is weird too. He just looks ridiculous in a team like United's midfield.

672~~~
Worst thing about Cleverley seems to be that he's mentally very brittle. When pressured he plays with a fear of failing and a nervousness to go along with it, rather than standing up, taking the situation on and doing something positive. He seems like the opposite of what a Manchester United player should be.

673~~~
needs to play tomorrow I think. Try and get some confidence against some players who he should outclass easily.

674~~~
I think what annoys me about Clev is that I don't get the vibe from him that he knows has something to prove. I don't really feel that he's giving everything or he's looking to take responsibility etc. If he was working really hard for the team but just lacked that bit of quality it would be one thing but it just feels that he thinks what he's doing is fine. It could be the other way and maybe he's just scared to make a mistake but then I guess you'd say he lacks the mentality to play at this level.

He and Fletcher were both terrible yesterday but at least Fletcher has an excuse for why he looks slow in terms of physical and mental thinking. I don't know what Clev's excuse is bar a pure lack of ability and mental strength.

675~~~
I always believe the making of a good player is to think how good he would look playing for a smaller side. Take Van Persie for example, throw him into Cardiff for example and I still reckon he'd look class. I honestly don't believe Cleverley would even stand out at a team of that ilk. Nothing against the guy, but he really isn't close to being United class. I can't think of one game where he has really stood out. It's time to move him on for his sake and the club.

676~~~
I genuinely think that if we sign Di Maria, Blind and De Jong, he'll be sold before this transfer window closes.

677~~~
Unfortunately, I agree, mentally he is too weak to play for United. His confidence has vanished and whenever he makes a mistake he looks visibly shaken, he needs to restart his career elsewhere.

678~~~
At one point I thought he could become "our Xavi-lite" and reach a very good level. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

679~~~
Has he really regressed though? Yeah he was ok at the start of the 11/12 season but since then he's been just awful ever since, he's weak, can't pass, can't tackle. He needs to go ASAP. If we weren't so light in numbers in CM I think he would of been sold

680~~~
You're possibly right, but he was nowhere near this "shit" - constantly and showed some promising signs.

Maybe it was more blind faith/hope or romanticism of wanting a homegrown player to "make it" I suppose, but he wasn't as bad and as consistently shit as he has been for the past year and a bit.

681~~~
It's not the same thing of course but in principle you're absolutely right, some of our players are just happy to be Man Utd player, whether that means staying on the bench or not.

682~~~
He was looking to be a fine player until that Kevin Davies tackle/injury. Since then he's never been able to get back to where he was. Shame.

683~~~
It's very strange. I remember thinking that he was the fastest thinking player in our team and knew what he wanted to do well before he got the ball.

684~~~
The Kevin Davies tackle was hardly a Ramsey/Eduardo leg breaker. I think he got hyped on the basis of appearances for Watford and Wigan (a lot of which we didn't see) followed by a brief purple patch at the start of 2011-2012 (even though some of those performances are now viewed through rose-tinted nostalgia and don't stand up to much scrutiny - see v Spurs for example). Still, I thought he could at least become a squad player. He has become truly mediocre without even a distinguishing feature like Gibson's shooting.

685~~~
He's someone you'd let date your daughter.

686~~~
He seems the kind of guy that would blame the woman for it too.

687~~~
Has he played a game as good as Gibbo vs Schalke in the champions league semis?

688~~~
No, or Gibson v Bayern Munich the year before for that matter. Plus Gibson didn't set up his own brand or claim he would be more appreciated in Spain. All round, he has become a bit of a poster boy for unwarranted entitlement.

689~~~
It always seems like an odd thing to criticise someone for but he looks so ridiculous that it makes him impossible to watch even when he's having a good game. Henderson and Glen Johnson also have similarly awful styles that make them look terrible even if they're doing something good (which admittedly is rare).

The thing with Cleverley is his technique and style of kicking means that passes are always underhit and always curling away from the target meaning that when they take a touch the ball is still rotating. Harder to control and therefore even his simple sideways passes are utterly shite in their effectiveness. The amount of times you want him to strike through the ball like Scholes used to and then he uses his instep to curve it and ruin a move is so bloody annoying it's terrible.

Just fecking get rid of him.

690~~~
I know it's not required, but that reads like you talked yourself into that final sentence. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

691~~~
It's very easy to talk yourself into that sentence when it comes to Cleverley <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

692~~~
True.
I was screaming at the TV, "Look at him hiding behind Sunderland players!" and "Pointing out passes, instead of demanding the ball!"
Properly lost it with him and Fletch.

693~~~
It's interesting how in the 2nd half Phil Jones largely ignores his repeated request for the ball and opt to pass to other players instead.

694~~~
Wonder if we'll allow him leave should we sign Vidal and Blind? I wouldn't bet against it.

695~~~
Haha he was screaming for it and he was right next to jones. Jones passes it to someone 20 yards away instead and Clev went into meltdown mode.

696~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Really? I missed this. That is hilarious.

697~~~
Yeah he was stamping his feet and swinging his arms around.

698~~~
The only way we can ensure that Fletcher-Cleverley in CM will never happen again is by selling one of them.  And when I say "one of them", I don't mean Fletcher.

699~~~
Why makes trillions, when we can make.........Make billions!<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://png-5.findicons.com/files/icons/1468/austin_powers/32/dr_evil.png" src="http://png-5.findicons.com/files/icons/1468/austin_powers/32/dr_evil.png"/>

700~~~
To be fair he wasn't exactly melting down, but he did express frustration.

I can empathise with Jones though. "Why the hell should I pass it to you only for you to pass it back to me a few seconds later?

701~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LCIuhr20U-Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Should we laugh ?

702~~~
You know you're really terrible when (and this goes for Fletcher as well) that I'm sure I'm not the only one who contemplated giving Anderson his 10000th chance if it meant replacing one of them.

703~~~
Nope. Im well passed that point. At least Cleverley and Fletcher have a bit of match fitness. When was the last time Anderson even played a game?

704~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Oh dear.

705~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

706~~~
As other people have said the thing that irks me the most about Cleverley is that he's just a huge pussy. Always shies away from the ball when the team needs movement from the midfield. Never has the courage to take a game by the throat and do something or make himself useful in any way. 

I can understand if you're not good enough for the team, but if you shy away from taking responsibility and are afraid to get involved then I will never respect you as a player. It's infuriating.

707~~~
Someone here commented earlier that they always preferred the likes of Anderson and Nani when compared to cowards such as Cleverley, Valencia and Young. That poster did have an extremely valid point. If you try and fail, fans will be disappointed but if shirk away and are a coward, then fans would be downright pissed off.

708~~~
Agree completely. Fans always love the players that give their all and make the most out of their opportunities. Nani has always had a great work-rate and Anderson typically hasn't been afraid to get involved - even if he wasn't that good most of the time. 

Tom Cleverley is the definition of a passenger on the field.

709~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hilarious reaction

710~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Giggs: "FFS Tom"

711~~~
Why do people keep calling them cowards? I am miffed by that.. Especially Cleverley, he was stood arms out calling or the ball every time a pass was on for an entire 10 minute period on the first half against Sunderland. If he doesn't get the ball when he's in space, how is that his fault?

712~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

713~~~
Coward as in he doesn't try risky passes or shots enough. He's afraid to take responsibility.

714~~~
I'm fairly sure they are two separate incidents. The Giggs and LVG laughs were directed at a throw-in awarded to Sunderland when it should have been our throw-in instead

715~~~
Fair enough, I don't really think that is his role though.

716~~~
What's his role then?

Tackling? Apparently not, he shy's away from that.

Taking players on to drive us forward? Don't be daft, why do that when you can pass horizontally.

Shooting? If by shooting you mean floating the ball well wide of the far post then yes, he's nailing that.

Picking up the space around the oppositions area? His current favourite after releasing the ball is to make what looks like an attacking run towards the box but in reality is just him running away from the ball into a crowd of players  where in reality he is never going to receive a return pass.

717~~~
TC23(™)

"<b>My job goes under the radar at times. I am not a player who's going to beat three or four people and stick it in the top corner or go round tackling people like Roy Keane</b>.

"I feel I've been made a scapegoat a little bit. A few people in the media certainly seem to have a perception of me not doing much in the team.


"Don't get me wrong, I know I can do better but people are making a big thing about <b>how I don't score enough goals when that is not necessarily my first job in the team."</b>

"I watch Spanish football a lot," Cleverley says. "<b>If they pass the ball sideways but keep possession, the fans clap them.</b>

"Their attitude is that as long as you have got the ball, the other team can't hurt you.


Maybe it's time we start building up with 'ooooooooh' when the ball is being passed to Cleverley and then break into a rapturous applause every time he makes a routine 5 yard pass.

718~~~
Quick pass and move, interact with the 10 and give a second option. I think, anyway..

Put in a couple of good challenges on Llarson at the weekend. Fought hard in a 50/50 in front of our box which was handy at the time.. Don't think I really saw him shirking his defensive responsibility if I am honest.
He is the main short pass facilitator and I found against Sunderland that a lot of the time the wingbacks were playing catchup and he was nullified by that. His simple ball is often the inside pass which Fletcher and sometimes even Mata facilitated often.
That shot in the first half that went over was hit a yard behind him and was a decent chance. He was in the perfect spot for a cutback when we scored as well. His usual movement forward is often nullified by the sideways pass to the wingbacks as well.  I saw him a few times have to jog back after Mata came deep into his position after a pass from Fletcher that went wide or bypassed to Mata.

Fergies system suited him a lot better than Moyes and this 3-5-2 of Van Gaal's but I am not really seeing any signs of cowardice if I am brutally honest. I think the fans are making things up to have a go at him with that one.

719~~~
Lol is that an actual reaction to that play? Funny if it is but I think it might not have been. Anyway funny video.

720~~~
Making things up? Lol did you see his "efforts" against Sunderland? I've got guys who play in my local all age team in Australia that would have been more effective in midfield against Sunderland.

721~~~
Cleverley's ability to 'tick play over' and interchange with short passes is so so overplayed. He 'ticks' and links play about as well as your average mediocre Premier League midfielder.

722~~~
It wasn't from that period of play, we were attacking the other end when LVG reacted like that if I remember rightly.

It was however after something similarly as bad from one of of our players.

723~~~
If there is one thing you shouldnt be criticising him for its this. Its very clear what he is doing when he does this. He is either holding space or dragging defenders to create a passing channel.  Have you ever played football apart from FM or FIFA?

724~~~
Agree with this. My problem with his runs is that they lack conviction, he needs to show more authority on the field if he want to succeed. I doubt he has it in him.

725~~~
That's a little funny, because he waves his hands and when he eventually gets the ball, he usually returns it to sender or makes another backpass. Cowardice is about doing all the simple stuff all the time. 9/10 situations I can predict what will he do with the ball.  

Another matter is that our defenders are clearly afraid to pass the ball to Cleverley (or Fletcher) if there is opposition player 5 yards away from them. No confidence in them at all. Can’t blame them going long to be honest.

I would agree but the way he does that, the ball never, ever fallows him. Opposition players know he won’t harm them anyway so they are not really chasing him.

I don’t think it works. It feels like he knows he should be doing this, but doesn’t really know why. Could not be only his fault though.

726~~~
It's not the same thing at all, as I said, he's running into a crowded space, he's not drawing anyone with him, he's running into blind areas where he is not going to receive the ball again and essentially marking himself. The opposition isn't tracking his run, they're not even following him, they're just allowing him to run into dead space where they're already covering the angles.

727~~~
If this was the case don't you think one of: Fergie, Moyes or LVG would have drilled it out of him? Of course he does these runs for a reason. What happens if their midfielders advance trying to close down the man and the ball and instead a ball is played through to Cleverley? 

OT - Cleverley's performance was freakin' dire against Sunderland. In the match thread I joked about how a partnership of him and Fletch (who have 6 league titles between them) would just about manage to dominate Sunderland but it was not to be. However, you'd be stupid to lay all the blame at their feat. We had 55% possession and its up to your 'big' players who were signed to give us a bit of flair and creativity to actually do something. You could be the greatest passer in the world but if nobody is moving ahead of you, what can you do? Mata, Rooney and RVP created diddly squat in the game, they hid as much as Cleverley did.

It is obvious our midfield needs a new player. You have Mata who is solely an attacking mid, you have Herrera who will aid both attack and defence and now we need a CDM who can also dictate play. If we find someone of Carrick's mould, snap him up ASAP.

728~~~
The single most frustrating thing about this lad, is that he will only show for the ball when he is in acres of space. He literally jogs backwards away from the ball-carrier in order to get in tons of space, then points to his feet wanting the ball. 

It's like he is under the belief that he just isn't good enough to control the ball in tight areas, which is the most annoying thing, because that is exactly what he is good at, and one of his main qualities.

I've completely given up on him at this stage. He completely lost his confidence in his ability years ago, and it is not going to return to him at United. 

He needs a move to re-rejuvenate himself. Everton would be ideal.

729~~~
Good to know but the reaction edited in the whole vid gotta say looked quite appropriate.

730~~~
Do you think Everton would be interested? They are an ambitious team chasing a top 4 spot. He was dominated by Cattermole on Sunday...I think he will end up at West Ham or Villa - he is simply not very good and, at the age of 25, still plays like a newcomer promoted from the youth team who won't take risks.

731~~~
He's not a young player anymore.

732~~~
To be honest not to defend cleverley, well it is in the way, you look at how VG set united up against sunderland, it aint helping anyone out. VG is playing a system that just does not suit the team, playing 3 at the back does not suit guys like smalling, our wingbacks are valencia and young, and upfront is the very static mata rooney and RVP coming back from injury. Yes cleverley was awful, but it never helps when our best hope for width is valencia and young, and no hope for getting in behind teams when there is no speed or creativity in the team

733~~~
Cleverley passes it back to the defence or gives it away. They don't need to worry.

734~~~
It's the mentality that's the problem. Players like him who are crumbling under the weight of expectations of this "collapse" play a big part. Sunderland pressed him, and like every time that's happened in recent times, he hides, he shirks and he becomes sloppy and full of errors. Right now, were badly in need of brave players and by that I don't mean players who will get stuck, but those who can actively take a role in helping us win games rather than trying to not feck up big time.

735~~~
He is right though, he will be vilified even if he ends a game with 3 assists just for giving the ball away twice.

736~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what? Of course he wouldn't!

737~~~
Sadly we'll never have a chance to prove it.

738~~~
There's no way he's good enough for to displace Barry and McCarthy. He's bottom half of the league standard, if that. An absolute coward and a conman of a player. Makes himself look busy by literally hiding away on the pitch behind opposition players so that he can have nothing to do with the ball at all.

739~~~
Yeah, think Martinez still likes him after his loan spell at Wigan.

740~~~
Hopefully there are bids for him.

He must be devastated considering since he was a boy he probably dreamed of being the next Paul Scholes. TC23 bigger than Brand Beckham. Even in the summer he was saying he thinks he is Louis van Gaal's type of player, last season he was talking about how his style of play would be appreciated in spain, the land of midfield gods.

I admire the optimism but he really must be gutted as I think he must be now realising he just isn't good enough but he needs to move on and work hard at a club like Villa. Who knows, when he gets his confidence back he might turn out to be a quality number 8 and make a return in a few years.

741~~~
Villa fans seem to think this guy has a very good record regarding Villa matters so far.

742~~~
That's been chopped together. That was their reaction to a decision made by the referee.

743~~~
Really disappointed how he has wasted the opportunities. His problem is more temperamental than technical and the way he has let pressure get better of him so many times, it doesn't show mentality of a player who can succeed with top club at top level. Hope he does well wherever he goes.

744~~~
He needs to move on for his own good. He might not be good enough for United, but the treatment he's had has been way out of order by some of our fans. I'm not sure going to Villa is the right move for him tbh as they seem to be in for a long season.

745~~~
Will be a good signing for Villa. He never developed to the level required for us unfortunately, but I got nothing against him and I hope he has a decent career.

746~~~
YES Cleverley out would be the best day of the summer !

747~~~
Last game played for United I should hope.

748~~~
Fellaini was out of order getting booed.

I don't think Cleverley has had anything out of order said against him unless you count the opinions of idiots on social media seriously. His performances have been poor and people quite rightly on here have questioned them.

749~~~
Best news all summer, after Di Maria's signing.

750~~~
I'm all for this transfer to go through. Villa is about his level.

751~~~
Questioning is one thing. But he's had constant insults at him from caftards, the matchday thread is terrible when Cleverley plays, he gets stick even when he's not the player to have made the mistake! He's the easy scapegoat.

I mean look at some of the posts in here. Best news all summer? Idiots.

752~~~
I was a real believer in Cleverley when he first broke through, amazing what's happened to him since. Sad too. If he goes he can't say it wasn't coming. If he ends up at Villa he'll regret not jumping at the chance to work with Martinez again when it seemed Everton were interested.

753~~~
No question we've someone lined up.

754~~~
You have no question? Why? It's not exactly a legitimate source!

755~~~
Ladyman wrote in his article yesterday that Cleverley could run down his contract with us.

756~~~
Might well be bullshit but <b>if</b> we have accepted a bid, I'd be amazed if we haven't got a replacement CM already sorted.

757~~~
I'll jump for joy if he does go. Started brightly, and his loan spell at Wigan was impressive. Unfortunately, whether he was found out early or he just became way too confident in himself (the TC23 may be indicating the latter), he became totally crap.

Never before have I seen such a predictable footballer. I know sayings are thrown about constantly in football regarding players, but I've never meant anything more serious when it comes to Cleverley. I could watch him play, and I'd know exactly where he'd pass to. He lacks bottle, creativity, drive, pace, goal-scoring ability and steel. He offers nothing except sideways or back passes. 

I hate slating a United Youth member, but he really does annoy me. It really doesn't look as if he's trying anymore. I mentioned it before in this thread after the Sunderland game - when tracking back when Buckley had the ball, he stopped completely which allowed Buckley to cut inside with ease when he was taking on Young on the wing. I was fuming. Sunderland had a fantastic opportunity to score from it too. 

Of all the deadwood, I want Cleverley to go the most. I really hope he does well at his next club, and I reckon he'll do well if it is indeed Villa.

758~~~
Hope so. Anderson to follow him out the door too.

759~~~
So finally it seems like his time is up. This can only mean we have another CM lined up, maybe not a world beater, but someone whose a good enough upgrade on Tom whilst not being a stupid price.

760~~~
Hope he goes. I had little hope left in him but any semblance of hope has been well and truly extinguished.

761~~~
About time. Never been impressed with him. Hope he does well at Villa or wherever he ends up.

762~~~
It will be interesting to see how he goes at Villa, if this is true, particularly whether Keane has any positive impact on him. Maybe he will have more confidence in a smaller pond, as he did at Watford and Wigan. If he doesn't then Villa may not be his final stop.

As mentioned, this would probably mean someone (Carvalho?) is on his way. We may actually be fielding a strong starting XI soon....

763~~~
Is this confirmed and real? Omg please let it be true.

764~~~
He wasn't especially talented ever but I don't think that was his problem here. He just has no balls and just couldn't handle the pressure here mentally, always crumbling under any bit of criticism. He'll be much better at a mid table club which is his level, but he's a lot better then what he's shown for us.

765~~~
Just wasn't good enough when he got his chance. Villa a good move for him......

766~~~
Aston villa is a good destination for Cleverley. He is not better than Delph, but surely he is a better option than Westwood or Richardson? Nevertheless, when all is said and done, I am glad he will no longer play in our midfield and he will be a good signing for Aston villa. Maybe Roy Keane and lambert will revitalize his career

767~~~
still, the twitter campaign against him by those who called themselves united fan was disgusting. Anyway we re used to such scum on twitter nowadays

768~~~
Sure but it's just twitter, if you're a footballer you should be ready to handle shit like that. It's not nice from the fans, but him actually being affected by that is a pretty clear sign he's not cut out for United.

769~~~
Still i hope people are capable of choosing between genuine criticism and twitter thrash. I m saying this because certain posters over here seem overly influenced by the latter...

770~~~
Twitter campaign?

There was a petition by England fans not to play him. Don't recall twitter campaign by our fans.

771~~~
Not a campaign per se, but if you type in Cleverley on twitter and you'll see what he means I think.

772~~~
Never had the mentality to play for us. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Thought he was going to make it an 1 point, then it just got progressively worse for him (especially since the Davies challenge).

Good career move for him. Hope it's true.

773~~~
I think he means that if we sell Cleverley another midfielder must be incoming.

774~~~
Frees up No.23 for Vidal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

775~~~
Gibson is a better player than Cleverley imo yet both were and are not good enough for United.

776~~~
Without a doubt. Gibson could shoot, had good passing and vision. Cleverley lacks all of that. 

Cleverleys a odd case because i still have no idea whats his best position. When he broke through i really thought he'd be good as a playmaker who plays wide, then he moved to CMF playing deeper and box to box roles that clearly dont suit him. Either way the sooner him and Anderson are shown the door the better.

777~~~
Oh god yes.

Any news on bid size? I'd guess £8m is fair in today's market.

778~~~
At the moment, neither anyone from outside PL will want him nor any from top sides. Everton maybe but it looks unlikely so late on that Martinez will make a move.

779~~~
What has happened to this kid? He used to be full of fire, he looks like someone trying to go in three directions at once while trying to recall what his tactical instructions were.

He used to be able to play central midfield a little, now he looks mindf******.

Could we maybe get him out wide and let him attack?

I think he'd even be better as a wing back than a CM, let him run out there with his young legs.

780~~~

781~~~
And for another two quid, we'll throw in Ashley Young.

782~~~
Payback for Young!

783~~~
Quick, accept it before they realise they put m in their bid.

784~~~
Fantastic deal for us if true.

785~~~
Sell sell sell! 

surely this means we have another midfielder coming in?

786~~~
Would be a bit surprising given Lerner's selling up and they've only spent about £7m on signings this window with most of the signings being free transfers.

787~~~
Hull too.

788~~~
He'd do well for a club like villa. I think he needs to go for his own good. Needs a fresh start to gain confidence away from united.

789~~~
Please accept one of them Woodward.

790~~~
Let's hope he doesn't play like he does for us with his sidewards passing. I can see a certain former captain of ours giving him a right old rollicking if he does.

791~~~
So what, should tweeters just pretend he isn't rubbish or something?

792~~~
It says it all that someone who has played over forty league games for us over the last couple of years is only wanted by Hull and Villa.

793~~~
If we have genuinely received £9m for Tom Cleverley then I think he will be personally driven to Hull by LVG himself.  Good player with a lot of ability, but he needs to be confident and he will just never feel that at Old Trafford in my opinion.  He will only be sold if a CM comes in.

794~~~
I don't know about you, but I am not a big fan of abusing players who are genuine fans of the club and give 110%. It's not like he dupes a world class manager into playing him...

795~~~
9 million? Jesus wept. That would be a fantastic deal for us. Hopefully he will go and try and revitalise his career instead of sitting on his arse here.

796~~~
I think he would do well at a club like Villa, Hull, Everton etc.... 

9 million is a good deal for both us and whoever buys him 

Let's just invest it in quality

797~~~
9M is not a bad amount to get for him given how much negative publicity he has received. He is not THAT bad a player as he is made out but not doing enough to stay. I would personally prefer him at Hull. Bruce is doing great job there and they look like a team on up. Lambert is a good manager too but Villa will be struggling a bit I guess.

798~~~
Feck it, I'll personally drive up from London to deliver him to Hull/Aston Villa if that's the price we're getting for him. I'll even pay for petrol!

799~~~
£9m is a lot when Gibson (who was better than him) went for £500k.

800~~~
He ranged from good to excellent in his loan spells at Leicester, Watford & Wigan so I reckon once he settles somewhere else in the Premier League people will realise he's not actually terrible. Technically I do think think he would be good enough to be a squad midfielder for us, but his mentality is really lacking for the big occasion/big club.

801~~~
LvG will drive him down there and Cleverley will turn down the move.

802~~~
Problem is we will have no fit midfielders at all soon.

803~~~
Nine million Pounds? Good grief, nice to see the "pay quadruple what they're worth cause they're English" rule is still in full effect, then.

804~~~
Offers from a few clubs. Thank you Brucie.

805~~~
Yes, it would be easy to make an unflattering comparison with where Real's cast offs end up...But 9 million would be a decent fee if true. You can always rely on Brucey (or Keano if it's Villa). And he may actually do a job for a mid to lower half team.

806~~~
If we flog him after the Burnley game we will have two weeks recovery time for our injured midfielders.

807~~~
A lot of ability?? I think not. He's regressed rapidly like a lot of our players.

808~~~
I think they're about the same level. Decent, earned their chance but didn't quite reach the standard and will have good careers elsewhere. Both decent but unexceptional all rounders with only a couple of attributes that earned them a chance at United. Gibbo had an absolute hammer of a boot and Cleverley has a good one touch passing game which I always felt was more suited to being the most advanced in a 3. 

I agree 9m is decent for both parties.

809~~~
To be fair, James MacArthur is worth 7m these days.

810~~~
Sounds like only Herrera will be back in that time frame though.

But yeah I take the point. And we are clearly still trying to buy too.

811~~~
I really won't miss him. I mean, I'd miss Welbeck, cause he has talent, and he made an effort and was genuinely fairly unlucky in his time due to the fact that we've always been well stocked up front. But Cleverley has had umpteen chances in our rubbish midfield, he could've absolutely revelled in it and instead he's regressed, and looked more and more out of his depth as time went on, going more and more into hiding and being more and more afraid to, heaven forbid, try and making a fecking mark on the club.

He's an academy player, and I wish him well (if he goes), but at the same time, I'll be grateful if he does go.

812~~~
£8m or more for Cleverley in the last year of his contract... 

Ha that would be amazing business.

813~~~
I think he would be a good signing for someone for anything less than 10m. Good player, just hasn't quite kicked on. Could do very well away from the heat.

814~~~
I personally think he does have a lot of ability.  I just think he is stuck in a rut of terrible form and suffering from a low level of confidence.

815~~~
That is true. When McCormack goes for £11m, Borini for £14m, Long for £12m, Livermore for £8m, Cleverley for £8-9m is about right.

Then again, unlike the others, he's in the last year of his contract.

816~~~
We should hold out for at least £12m, he is going to be a regular for England now to fill the void left by Gerrard and Lampard.

817~~~
How are you coming to that conclusion? He was a regular for England whilst they were still around, he then dropped out of the squad through generally being a bit crap, whilst they were still around, and England, for all their lack of talent, still have loads of better midfielders than him.

818~~~
Bite their fecking hand off.

819~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Will he feck be a regular for England.

820~~~
We should bite their hand(s) off for £9mil.

821~~~
9m is a fair price. I wish him luck, Aston Villa is about his level in my opinion.

822~~~
Poorly managed last season and doesn't seem to have recovered. Was playing aimless passes at the weekend without even making sure the player was still open.

823~~~
We should take the 9M before they change their mind, imo.

824~~~
That's not really how transfers work though. For some part it does I suppose, i.e. Bale's price would of been dictated by Neymar/Ronaldo etc but it's not a simple case of "Livermore cost 8m so Cleverley is 9m" there's various factors in the deal.

Cleverley isn't really needed at United anymore if the press are to be believed, that would lower his value somewhat as the club want him off the books (freeing up wages and getting a fee for him) for example. There's other factors to, how marketable they are, how much the other club needs them, how much competition there is from others to sign him wuich may increase the deal.

Someone like Cleverley who's a bit of a laughing stock really and the butt of jokes for United fans doesn't really have that much of a demand to have a high transfer fee I'd say. At the moment he's really seen to be punching above his weight and at a bit of a crossroads in his career. This could be a good move for him but he could also just end up as another player like Keiran Richardson for example just floating around average premier league/championship clubs.

825~~~
£9m is a great price for Clevz. I think he'd actually do well at Hull, Bruce has turned them into a decent team.

826~~~
Take the money and run.

827~~~
So that'd almost be a combined £25million for Hernandez and Cleverley which almost covers the Herrera transfer. Not bad.

828~~~
No, I agree with you and was at first mighty surprised we were even getting money for him, let alone £9m. All I'm saying is similar shite/average players like McCormack and Livermore have gone for similar amounts or more. I can sort of now understand why Villa and Hull are interested in paying for a PL-winning England international.

829~~~
Hope he goes on to have a decent career with at club at his level, if he leaves that is.

830~~~
Delph and Colback are even ahead of him.

831~~~
My thoughts on it as well.

He also lacks the required bolloxs for the job.

832~~~
His contract is up next summer.

833~~~
Doing my happy dance <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Does leave us a bit thin but hopefully it means we've got some coming in. Even Powell deserves his chance more than Cleverly

834~~~
I had high hopes for our Tom. Hope he does well there and manages to express himself better as a big fish in a smaller pond (as opposed to the opposite here). Hope he does well and given that Fabian Delph has gained an England call up I'm sure Tom can work his way back in the England set-up in the future (England's midfield options are hardly world class) once he gets his confidence up and plays a bit better. I'd rather he went to Hull, actually. I like Bruce and what he is doing there.

835~~~
Judging from the way he ambled around at Milton Keynes, no.

836~~~
I don't give a shit about us having 'bodies' if the best Cleverley has to offer is the performance he turned in last weekend. I'd rather just put Rothwell or Pereira in there.

I'd like to see more of Powell too, although he didn't cover himself in glory by any stretch on Tuesday.

837~~~
I'd bit someone's hand off if they offer 9 mil for him. I was resigned to sell him for about 4 mil to Everton.

838~~~
My mate who is a Villa fan says its £4m to Villa...however he didn't give me a source. Lets see what comes about his transfer...£9m is money we cannot turn down for Clevz.

839~~~
If he's off who do we play tomorrow in midfield? Herrera better be fit enough to play.

840~~~
£9 million for Cleverley with a short contract would be fantastic.

Villa have Westwood who is a similar type of player and similar level to Cleverley, I wouldn't even guarantee that he'd keep a starting spot there

841~~~

842~~~
Bye Clevz. Good luck at Villa. Never rated you but I wish you well.

843~~~
We shouldn't turn down a bag of Doritos and a Twix. Just get him off out of here

844~~~
If you told me at the end of September in 2010 that he would go onto become on the worst first team regulars ever I wouldn't have believed it.

845~~~
He's sure to be more appreciated in Spain

<span style="color: white">Birmingham</span>

846~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

847~~~
Disagree with this.

Moyes isn't to blame at all. That's preposterous. Cleverley believed in his own hype before that and became way too confident. I'm sorry, but having the tag "TC23" is just fecking mental. Took for granted what he had and looked as if he was comfortable enough to be at United for a long time.

I agree with the second bit though.


Edit: Thank feck he's going.

848~~~
Sky Sports reporting we have accepted a bid from Aston Villa. 
Great move for Tom, feel sorry for him not making it here...always nice to see a homegrown player do well, and he had the talent IMO. 

Now the question is, who do we play against burnley???

849~~~
Really disappointed to see him leave. Not because I believe he'd do well here but because he's a product of our academy who made it into the first team.

All the best.

850~~~
I know he is only Tom Cleverley but given the dire state of our midfield and the lack of numbers even with him, can we count on someone else replacing him?

851~~~
With the rate at which English players are going these days 9 million is not bad business for any buying club tbh.

852~~~
Good luck, hopefully a buy back clause?
<span style="color: #ffffff">just kidding</span>

853~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He is Villa's problem now!

But serious, Cleverley in a pivot would be really good as they Delph as the runner in the CM department.

854~~~
I was a big fan of him early on. But he obviously regressed.  He'd probably look neat and tidy in a good team. But badly exposed in Uniteds weak state. 

Good luck to him if he's leaving.

855~~~
All the best Tom. Like to see academy graduates do well. He's just not Manchester United quality at all. Villa is probably a good club for him.

856~~~
Usually these bids take a day or two to respond to, with this it seemingly took under an hour.

857~~~
I hope that Steve Bruce now turns his attentions to Fletcher after being knocked back by Clev.

All summer I had thought he was the Prem manager most likely to take him off our hands.

858~~~
Good luck Tom.

859~~~
Good stuff, good luck to him. Anyone out there willing to take Young off us as well? Surely they can cover his wages by offering him a longer contract with a reduced fee? He proved himself to be a very good player at a club like Villa.

860~~~
Amazing if we are really getting £9m for him, he is worth nowhere near that sort of money. Hopefully it means we are going to sign a midfielder or two otherwise we'll be relying on Fletcher and Anderson - amazingly ridiculous for Manchester United.

861~~~
Having an English passport goes a long way.

862~~~
academy product who always seemed a good lad who gave it his best shot. he did produce some good moments for us but struggled for consistency and lost his way
wish him luck at villa (assuming he goes!)

863~~~
Yes. Yes. Yes. Finally.

864~~~
Bit depressing that we have to say goodbye to him in this particular way and moment but I think player understands that he stopped improving which is most important thing in this club.

Nobody comes to the first squad as an instant star. Not even Juan Mata or Angel Di Maria. It's a road paved with sweat, tears, blood and most of all a real effort. Best example - Nemanja Vidic. In his first season he was thinking about leaving but didn't and in the end he worked his ass off to the very top, became a captain as good as Steve Bruce was for us.

All best to the player who was a huge hope two years ago but I think still can work his way to being a decent Premier League level footballer. Never too late for that.

865~~~
So who's playing midfield for us this weekend? Fletcher & Di Maria? Not too late to register Giggsy.

866~~~
Goodbye and good luck.

A shame... but clearly time to move on for both club and player

867~~~
Regardless of my harsh words, I do hope he has a good career at Villa.

868~~~
Yes!!

869~~~
Surely a midfielder coming in, if cleverley leaves?

870~~~
At worst a youth will be called upon, who has a higher ceiling for progression.

The problem with not selling players that are nowhere near good enough is it becomes less likely that we address the lack of quality in the team - i.e. SAF's last 6-7 years or so.

Also, as it stands, we've got 37 games left this season (unless we win our FA Cup game - then maybe a couple more) to be split between all the squad. Even though we're contending with injuries now, there'll be a two week break after the Burnley game...

bottom line: under no circumstances would I keep holding on to players who are useless just because we lack numbers. I know signing top players is tricky, but signings shite players to replace shite players, if we're desperate, whether on loan or for peanuts (on low wages) should be fairly easy (if we are super super super desperate)

Also: THANK YOU Aston Villa!

871~~~
Even Pereira could replace him and do a better job at this stage.

872~~~
What a sack of shite. Believed his own hype? His problem wasn't overconfidence, it was underconfidence. He looked a good player on two loans and his first season in the senior side and fully earned his place United and England. Since Moyes took over he's looked nervous and reluctant to play the quick passes he played before. And the TC23 thing, what's your point? The clothing brand? A young man trying to make the most of a short sporting career, you genuinely have a problem with that? He's a local lad who loves the club but wasn't quite up to it, give it a rest. 

Good luck to him. Hope and expect him to get a decent ovation when he comes back to OT.

873~~~
Good luck to him. I liked him, hes just nit.good enough.

874~~~
9m? I mean, really? 

I'm always sad to see someone from our academy go, but Cleverley for 9m is a pretty good deal for us.

875~~~
Go  4 at the back play Jones. Or Powell if his fitness has improved.

Di Maria or Janzuaj can do a job, but risky. 


Put Rooney there for a game ?

876~~~
Hope he does well.

877~~~
Good luck to Tom.

878~~~
This is the first time in a while where I think we sold a player for a decent amount... too many times we get ripped off but this makes me happy

879~~~
Good fee.

We must have players lined up. Would be a massive risk to sell midfielders regardless of how useless they may be.

880~~~
We could go to Burnley with only Fletcher available in CM.

881~~~
Daily Mail was saying £7m. Either way, best for both Man Utd and the player that they go their separate ways.

882~~~
For big clubs yes because they have to keep homegrown quota in Europe. I'd say Villa's chances of making serious impact in Europe are non-existent and they have a pretty solid English backbone as far as I remember so another English player isn't worth as much to them as he'd be to City or Chelsea. £9m is ridiculous for a player who has been out of form for a long time and generally isn't all that. £5m would probably be maximum I'd pay in their position.

I guess the new TV deal has made PL clubs more eager to spend money.

883~~~
If we're selling Cleverley what does this mean for Fletcher? He shouldn't be playing either.

884~~~
We probably need two more midfielders at the minute. Get Blind and Carvalho.

885~~~
True (although I think Livermore is a decent player to be fair) but I suppose you can argue that in cases like McCormack it's desperation on the clubs behalf/good agent/proven player. McCormack scored 30 goals for example last season, if he scored that again you could argue Fulham would go up and then they recoup that money...he's proven talent. I don't think the same can be said for Cleverley. Not saying he's as worse than McCormack but he just doesn't have that selling point about him. His attributes and contributions the last few years just seems to be lingering around a team he's not good enough to be a part of.

Part of my does sometimes sympathise with him, he didn't ask to be in a position where we had no one better. He probably would be a half decent player if we addressed the issues earlier and let him develop a bit more "naturally" instead he got thrust in to the limelight and was made a scapegoat for all our failings and is usually the go to caption when people want to slate our midfield. Equally though he did make the most of the "Fame" that being at United brought him and part of me thinks he brought the abuse on himself....course some of that goes to far.

886~~~
I hope he does well. Unfortunately he's not been good enough but he's a players who's come through the academy and has given his all to play for the club. It's the right decision to let him go but hard feelings towards him, hope he can revive his career.

887~~~
That was the risk we took in leaving our business until the last few days of the window.

888~~~
My fella the Villa supporter is ecstatic! <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

It's a lie, of course, but I'm trying to cheer him up with tall tales bout the Cleverley we once knew, and how Keane will scare the fear right out of him. Seriously though, I hope he can thrive in a new environment. Godspeed!

889~~~
I think we could be on the verge of seeing the smaller top flight clubs up their spending, to conincide with the increase of what 50 million could get you years ago, compared to now. 11m for <b>ROSS MCCORMACK </b>ffs...

890~~~
He's Vice Captain. Not going to be sold any time soon.

891~~~
The hate for Cleverley is unbelievable. He never became the player we all wanted him to be but some of the flack he gets...you'd think he played for Liverpool. I don't even think Daniel Sturridge gets the same level of abuse off the CAF as Cleverley.

892~~~
I'm actually quite disappointed. I wanted LVG to improve some of the homegrown lads. I guess Welbeck is next.

893~~~
Good move for all parties I think. Cleverley, Delph and Carlos Sanchez is a decent midfield.

894~~~
True. It is a matter of a couple of years before the likes of Villa, Southampton etc. start spending £25m on a player. Everton paid £28m for Lukaku, twice their previous record.

895~~~
He is beyond the point of reparation. The quality just isn't there.

896~~~
He's a tidy player no doubt with some skills, but he's not going to be good enough for United.  I hope he does well at Aston Villa.

897~~~
Somebody in Villa must be smoking some very strong gear. 

Good luck Tom.

898~~~
Let's get rid of all the low confidence and deadwood. Sorry to see how you regressed Clevs, but Villa is your level.

But £9m for Clevs is brilliant! Well done Ed.

899~~~
It was clear that it was never going to work out.  Still, he was a part of the squad when we were successful.  Feeling gutted with so many players leaving but an identity change is needed badly.

900~~~
Maybe can do that with the next batch.

901~~~
Fletcher's okay to keep around the place, he's got a great attitude and everyone respects him. 

Even if he doesn't add any value on the pitch, he adds some off it, unlike Cleverley.

902~~~
A million Asian schoolgirls will cry their way to school.

903~~~
I was more interested in seeing what he does with Januzaj, Pereira, Wilson, Rothwell etc. 

Cleverley was never going to make it.

904~~~
9 is a fair fee. Cleverley is an England international when confident, and he has experience of winning the league and playing in the CL. 

Sure he is damaged goods at present, but for a team like Villa he could do very well. I hope he rebuilds his career and goes on to do some good things.

I am also happy we managed to get a half decent fee, the way we usually sell I expected half.

905~~~
Well done Ed, pays too much for playes but also gets too much for players it seems, wish Tom the best but he is just no United quality.

906~~~
It was only ever going to be a matter of time really, the inflation in football only for a time seemed to be happing to world class or top class players, not it's begging to filter down.

907~~~
I think one thing we can all say about Fletch is that he's a fighter. To come back from a career ending illness deserves great respect. He's not going to be fazed by his own poor form. He'll work towards getting it right.

908~~~
Yeah, it's a bit unfair, I agree.
Problem is he retreated into his shell so much, so became like synonymous with the current 'scared and hiding' United. I'm sure the lad has it in him to play so much better; we've seen him do it, right?
Absolutely the right time for him to move on and get his head sorted. Keane is the man to do it, I hope. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

909~~~
Yeah according to SSN, we also got £2.5m for Bebe and £4.4m for Buttner. Sold Tom, Buttner and Bebe to cover for Rojo's fees.

910~~~
He isn't worth £9 million so well done Ewar.

911~~~
You're all quite cringeworthy. Getting all giddy over £9m.
At this point out of Fletcher and Cleverley, I'd rather Cleverely stayed. 
I wish him luck though. Hope he does well at Villa.

912~~~
They could have got Alonso for that.

913~~~
good luck to him. Villa is decent club and he'll get plenty of opportunities there.  

also:

914~~~
Bebe joined Benfica on a free. The €3m was just what we could make in bonuses depending on probably international appearances and them winning the cup/league.

915~~~
Take out the champagne

916~~~
If we keep all the deadwood, we can't even promote from within the club. Fletcher was never going to be sold due to his seniority in the club and after that being name vice captain.

917~~~
You're missing the point. We'd rather have him around for squad depth, but if he were to go £9m is a terrific deal for a player quickly losing value.

918~~~
We're not going to sell a guy a week after he's been appointed VC, and on top of that one of the few CMs we have left.

919~~~
Selling Clevz is as close to a confirmation that we're getting another CM in. Happy days.

920~~~
The disparity between English clubs and the rest of Europe is becoming ridiculous though. 14th placed English team have more financial power than 5th placed German, Spanish and Italian teams I think. And the shocking thing is they are still getting better players and are playing better football than English clubs.

921~~~
Bayern or Villa...

Um nooo

922~~~
Best of luck, Tom. Unfortunate that it didn't work out here.

923~~~
Making way for Vidal 23?

924~~~
He'll be great at Villa. Be like Gibson here, loads of lads thought he was championship quality but he's a cracking young player when he's on his game. Playing week in week out will be great for him.

Good luck lad.

925~~~
That ... sort of reinforces my point further, no?

926~~~
People are happy to see him go because he is nowhere near good enough to play for United not because of £9m. He might have a good career elsewhere and I wish him well but he's been poor for a while and seeing him in the team wasn't really pleasant lately. We'll be better off without him and he'll be better off at a club with less pressure.

927~~~
Get the shit meme's off this thread please. Alonso is about to turn 33 let's not act like we've done well to get more for TC.

928~~~
I guess so

929~~~
9m is a good bit of business when his contract is up next year.

930~~~
This. Did well to get almost £10m and thrilled to not see him get a new contract which was supposedly around £55k a week according to twitter two weeks ago.

931~~~
9 million for Cleverly. Not bad from Ed, much better dealings this summer than the last one. Hopefully getting rid of a midfielder will confirm that another midfielder is on their way (Vidal?).

932~~~
Big statement.

Best of luck Tom and hope he realises some of his early potential at Villa.

933~~~
The right move for him I feel. He is not as bad as he has looked over the last two seasons but he is also not a top team quality player so this move should be a good one for him.

934~~~
Start of the 11/12 season was great but since then he's not been good enough.

935~~~
Good move for all parties really.

We <b>have</b> to be buying at least one midfielder now though - two with any luck.

936~~~
But I thought "Cleverley was the kind of player who will excel under Van Gaal's tutelage and I could see him coming good", what happened to that nonsense? Spackers.

937~~~
Just wished we had sold Anders, Nani and Zaha as well instead of sending them on loan.

938~~~
Weren't those his own words? He could be LVG's man?

939~~~
Sad the way his games gone. Maybe it went to his head and got found out but it's for the best. We have talent in reserve and the possibility to bring in more quality. Untimately passing sideways wasn't part of LVG's thinking. I'm sure he'll come good again but his times run out.

940~~~
I still think he can be a good player. In two minds on this one, would love to have seen him progress at Utd.

He was clearly talented and had much more potential than he has shown in the last 2 years

941~~~
We've performed a fecking miracle to not have to pay someone to take the lump of shite off our hands.

942~~~
Take care, Cleverley, have a nice career there.

943~~~
Pah. Underconfidence my ass. I only need to take the Sunderland game as example that he was way too comfortable with himself. If you're under-confident and playing for United - what do you do? You take the opportunity you are given to gain that confidence. In the Summer he said that he believes he's "LVG's type of player". Oh really Tom? Then fecking show it then. You don't just go back into a shell and play the same way he's been doing for years by offering nothing to our midfield. 

I mentioned that he did well on his loan, and I was very impressed by that. I also said he started off brightly. Maybe this was all his honeymoon period at the club where everything was rosey. Some people have long honeymoon periods, others only have a few matches like Macheda. 

He was nervous before Moyes. It's absolute bollocks over the Moyes-bashing. He's to blame for stuff, but not fecking everything. It's pathetic. He's never been a creative player, and neither has he been a player who offers a drive in midfield. 

Yes I do have a problem with that. David Beckham 7, CR7, Ferdinand's #5. You don't do it when you've just broken the first team. It says a lot that as soon as he became comfortable of being part of United's first team, he decides it's a good time to bring out a clothing brand. Who thinks it's a good idea for a 20/21 year old footballer to be distracted with a clothing brand? It's pathetic. You can think it's not a big deal, but it's ridiculous. 

I hate seeing a Youth product fail, but he's the one that's annoyed me the most. He gives half-arsed performances, and hasn't taken advantages of the chances he's received. Sunderland was the last straw for me. It was the game that portrayed that he has no defining qualities what so ever, and that he really isn't close to being United quality. I'm still fuming with how he stopped running when Buckley had the ball. I've mentioned it about 5 times now, and I know I sound like a broken record but I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. A player who labels himself a "LVG player", gets given a chance and then stops tracking back during an important stage of the game. 

Defend him all you want, heck you're already defending him better than how he defends. But I'm glad he's going.

944~~~
Villa owe us for Young.

945~~~
Hope it comes off for him. Villa are exactly the level I would put him at and wouldn't be surprised if he does really well there. Playing every week with no pressure will be ideal for him. Good luck....just sign on the dotted line eh!

946~~~
Imagine we finish below Villa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

947~~~
I think that comment was made by him on like the 2nd or 3rd pre-season game iirc, however quotes like the one I said were by spouted by some people here immediately LVG took over.

948~~~
Decent player and nowhere near as bad as some United fans say he is.

However, the website and celebrity girlfriend was too much for me. I realize he can do what he wants but fame hores really piss me off. Especially when you haven't really proved anything.

949~~~
Shame he never developed as we hoped him to, but best of luck with Villa, Tom! Always liked Villa and hopefully he has a good career.

950~~~
They can have him back as well. £15m for the pair of them and I ll be happy.

951~~~
swear to god, do we need to send aston villa a message from the fans? thanking them for services to manchester united? i mean? 9 million pounds... thats highstreet robbery.

952~~~
There's no hate involved in being happy that a player who is pretty terrible gets sold. I don't hate the guy, I wish him the best. But I'm absolutely delighted that we've seen sense with regards to his situation.

953~~~
Another one of those players that looked great in reserves but could not step up.

954~~~
Good luck to him. I think that working with Keane can help him a lot, either Keano will kill him or make him man the feck up.

955~~~
I still think he had something to offer here.

But 9m isn't a bad fee for someone who isn't a first team player and likely never will be. Hopefully the money will go towards a new CM/DM. Good Luck Tom, sorry some of the fan here were such cnuts towards you.

956~~~
Absolutely. Good luck Tom!

957~~~
I am just showing you how dumb these people are. No thought into what they tweet.

958~~~
Good luck to him!

Good business by the club. It's obvious he isn't at the level we need him to be at and likely never will be. £9million is a good sum and should mean we get more than that for any other senior player we sell bar maybe Anderson.

He'll do better in a side where he can take a few more risks without being scrutinized whenever something doesn't come off. Hell, he's bashed here if he passes to a team mate and it wasn't forwards.

959~~~
I think there was a rumour about him signing a new contract recently?
Sorry if it was already discussed, I'm not up to date with his siutation.

Anyway, good fee, I'm sure he will be a good player eventually, just no chance that he will make it here. 
Another good news is that we're signing a midfielder.

960~~~
As much as he isn't the quality of player we require selling midfielders when we are so bare is a concern. Hopefully the club have something up their sleeve.

961~~~
It's a bit unclassy to be celebrating 'getting rid' of an academy player for 9m to a lower level club. 

However, it is a good move for everyone and best of luck to him.

962~~~
Probably explains why he's played so poorly thus far this season, he definitely played knowing he was to be shafted.

963~~~
So its okay to celebrate his leaving if he wasn't an academy player? This sentimentality of academy players is a bit too much. DO you cry every time an academy player leaves the club? If you are not good enough, you have to leave. Its not the end of the world and we are not monsters for doing it.

964~~~
I've always had a bit of a soft spot for Cleverley, it's a real shame he never kicked on from his early promise.  I remember being so excited we had a youth player scoring goals for fun from midfield in the championship and hoped he would really become a decent player for us.  Sadly not to be, a move is the best thing for all parties.

965~~~
good luck to him.

966~~~
He's going to be a good player for Villa.

It was time for the axe to drop, but I'm still sorry to see a product of our youth system fail to make his dreams come true with the club.

967~~~
Best of luck lad.

968~~~
Get in!! Best news all day

969~~~
He's a broken player... What's sad is to see him recede and regress week on week.

All the best of luck, hope he's superb for them and rediscovers his better football, against everyone but us.

970~~~
The part I've bolded is the reason people are happy. Personally I'm happy <i>for him</i> -- I believe he has it in him to be a very good player. Right now, with us, he's stuck in my new favourite expression (courtesy of Mockney) the shame spiral.

Of course we wish him all the best at Villa, it's a true win/win situation if I ever saw one.

971~~~
Good deal for both us and the player I think. Hope he does well, I reckon he will prove to be a solid and steady mid table midfielder when he gets some confidence and a steady run of games in him. 

Not a fan of the attitude of a minority in here with the 'best news of the summer' type posts. He tried to make the jump up to the United senior team but didn't quite have it in him, give the lad a break.

972~~~
I'm glad a lot of the absolute shite in the squad is finally getting the boot but i won't celebrate until we actually bring players in to replace them. Getting rid without replacing them is just making us weaker, no matter how shite they are.

973~~~
9 mill for Cleverly??? Still rubbing my eyes in disbelief! Good lad Keane, always manages to get our rejects are ridiculous prices.

974~~~
I forgot Keane's there. He might rip him a new one if Cleverley reproduces his Spanish brilliance at Villa but then again if there ever was a player who was destined to play for Villa, it was Tom.

975~~~
We have to sign a midfielder now. We have fletcher fit and that's it isn't it?

976~~~
It's got nothing really to do with the fact that we sold him - I think it is best for everyone. I am just not a fan of people celebrating. It's also got nothing to do with him being from the academy really, but is similar to when some fans were sarcastically cheering Fellaini's every touch. We are surely better than that.

He wasn't good enough for us, but he did offer some good memories (8-2 vs Arsenal), some freak goals and he often worked harder than more talented players. 

He received a lot of stick from opponent fans, I just don't think we should join them in belittling him when it was always a bit over-exaggerated.

977~~~
£9m is a really good price considering how poor his reputation is and has been for the last couple of years. Nobody actually seems to rate him at all so it seems higher than I'd have thought. If it's a real offer we'd be mad not to take it

978~~~
Good bye Tom =(

all the luck on the world for you.

Its a real shame he wont make it with us... sadly he failed to step up on a difficult time for the club. 

At least we are getting good money for him.

979~~~
Pity it didn't work out and good luck to him, but this is all for the best. He's not good enough for our squad.

Vidal in? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

980~~~
Hear, hear.

981~~~
I agree, but some people here are acting the same way that City and Liverpool fans acted when Fergie retired.

982~~~
Hopefully we bring in a CM and one other versatile player to avoid using Fletcher.

983~~~
Very harsh.

984~~~
He made a valuable contribution to our 12-13 title win.

985~~~
He will be a decent footballer just like Darron Gibson is (shame with his recent injury tho) Aston villa is the perfect club for him IMO. needs to get his confidence sorted. Roy will do him good. So I hope we have some players coming in. He was our only 90mins fit midfielder after all.. We may try Jones, Pereira in weeks coming. Maybe Mata for a while at the cost of tempo...

986~~~
Nah sorry, I had high hopes for Tom. He's hasn't stepped up and we are behind in the midfield department because of that. He showed promise for like a month 3 years ago. It's a shame

987~~~
I just saw this on a Villa forum -

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

988~~~
Good move for everyone involved. Good luck to him.

989~~~
Confidence player whose confidence is rock bottom. Sad he didn't work out and best of luck to him. There's a good player in there somewhere and I genuinely hope he can rediscover it.

990~~~
Not so long ago he was touted as better than Henderson and Allen. Henderson has come leaps and bounds, Allen moved sideways, maybe regressed a bit and Cleverley has just sunk like a stone. He's 25, not a youngster. You'd think he had settled into his level too much for that by now.

I could see him go entirely off the radar from here.

991~~~
It's sad to a see an academy player who looked like he could contribute something to the first team just regress to the state Cleverley did but he really does need to leave here for his own sake. Think he'd do okay at Villa and will probably benefit from the lack of expectations from him.

992~~~
I agree I don't think he'll end up much better off than someone like Steve Sidwell.

993~~~
Couldn't convince them to take Young back then. Shame.

994~~~
If he wasn't going to be sold before, I think getting subbed in America when he was supposed to play the entire game sealed his fate. 

Showed early promise but has been very poor since. Good luck to him.

995~~~
I'm not happy that he's going as much as I about us surely signing another midfielder. We need to completely restruct the middle of the field and it looks like it's finally happening.

996~~~
Good luck to him... 

(and if I hear Rude by Magic! one more time...)

997~~~
Villa fans are worried that Vlaar will be coming to us.

998~~~
Pity he couldn't step up. Good luck to him.

Anyway. Midfield is approaching the non-existent state. Only a few days of transfer window left.
PICNIC?

999~~~
Agreed, but I think people are entitled to feel how they want about a player being sold or brought in.  If this was Fellaini being sold, it'd be a lot different.

1000~~~
I've honestly not been able to keep up with the thread (Still trying to pretend I'm working!), but if so it's terrible.
To put it in a nutshell, to me Cleverley is a truly talented player who sadly at the moment is stuck in a spiral of fear and avoidance. A move will set his head right, I'm sure. And like I said, he's got Keano to help him give his head a wobble.
No more fear! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1001~~~
Off a Villa forum -

<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> At least people on here don't talk like that.

1002~~~
Possible little in for vlaar with this?

1003~~~
I'm not sure we'd have let Cleverley go without having another signing in the bag. I do expect more exits though.

1004~~~
He'll be average even at Villa. I see him getting more game time at the start of his career there and progressively less as the season goes. Cleverly is a championship player. Villa is the beginning of a merry go round career among the dross of the EPL.

1005~~~
Best news since Di Maria. I hope we hang onto Shinji though

1006~~~
9m is standard for a player like Cleverley its just we usually sell for ridiculous low fees. Hopefully Woodward is able to recoup more money from our other sales.

1007~~~
The reason we got a good fee for him is because there were probably other clubs after him.

Roberto Martinez and Everton for one. 

If Welbeck leaves (which I hope he doesn't because he can make it here unlike Clebs) then I think we'll get a good fee for him too.

My preference would be just to loan him out this year, and then bring him back next year when hopefully we'll need a bigger squad again.

1008~~~
You never know what he'll do at Villa. Playing at a club like United freezes some players, who just can't make the step up. Fellaini is a decent example i suppose. Who knows? He may well see himself as a big fish in a small pond, and the upturn in his confidence could do wonders for him. He might be a bit more incisive instead of the 5 yard passes we've grown accustomed to. Whatever the case, good luck Tom, pity it never worked out.

1009~~~
I', a bit sad it didn't work out, its always nice to see the local lads prosper at the club, but he had the one really good run of form at the start of the 11/12 season, got injured and he has never really got back to that again. I think the change of club will do him the world of good to be honest, I don't think he can ever step up to the level we need to be challenging for the major trophies, so leaving is for the best, but I do think he can become a solid player for team like Villa.

1010~~~
Agree with the above. The move will do him a world of good, just a bit sad he couldn't capitalise on the opportunity he had.

1011~~~
All the best to Cleverley, hope he does well and gets back on track. Good for him to get some game time and for us to get someone more suitable in.

1012~~~
He's from Bradford, so not exactly a local lad. 

I think everyone had high hopes for him after his good loan spells, but he simply isn't cut out to be a United player.

1013~~~
Imagine walking round Birmingham with Georgina Dorsett. It'd be like taking your Ferrari through Arthur Daley's car lot.

1014~~~
Do we think this means someone coming in is imminent?

1015~~~
Best thing for everyone. If he gets his thinking/mentality right he could be a good player at a midtable team. No point him sitting on the bench here as he won't improve and for us there are younger players who provided we sort out the quality of what's ahead of them, could benefit a lot more from his potential game time.

Only worry would be cover right now. Guessing we must have someone lined up as would be a bit thin without him as presumably Ando isn't an option and Powell will go on loan.

1016~~~
The Telegraph reported that we offered a 70.000 a week contract to hem, so far their reliability.

1017~~~
You'll have to understand, they're Villa supporters. Your average Villa supporter will make Rust Cohle off <i>True Detective</i> seem like Paddy Crerand on e.

It's a bleak and forbidding place.

1018~~~
bit disapointed by this, i think he is a tidy enought player and would rather see him stay oer any of our other center midfieldes except herrera.
plus with herrera injured he is the only mobile cm we have

1019~~~
Yes, a central mid would most certainly be coming in now. Didn't LVG himself hint at/claim that signings will be coming in in the recent press conference. I hope its Carvalho, won't mind Vidal either.

1020~~~
Hope he does well at another club, shame that he declined in the way that he has though. However, for £9m in the last year of his contract I'm not going to pretend I'm sorry to see him go.

1021~~~
£9m, snap their bloody arms off the silly feckers. What a great deal for us.

1022~~~
Keano possibly coming back as part of the coaching staff or one of LvG's right hand men or something would be more my thinking. It would be fecking mighty if it was.

1023~~~
Wow we would have done extremely well to get 9 million for him.

This can only mean that we are signing atleast one more midfielder.

Honestly it is for the best for both Cleverley and the club that he leaves. Good luck to him.

1024~~~
Yes, their owner Randy Lerner wants to sell them and they have been stingy in the market so far and have been unwilling to invest in their team. It kind of makes the Cleverley signing at 9 mil a surprise given the circumstances but I guess he is their 'marquee' signing from United. I don't think their fans will look at it that way though.

1025~~~
If he does go now at least he hasn't done a Nani and taken the club for as much as poss. Fair play to him for that at least.

1026~~~
Without him our options are:

Carrick (Out for 3 months)
Fletcher (Rusty, who knows what level he will return to?)
Herrera (Settling in, is he back from injury?)
Fellaini (The only time you'd like someone to contract second season syndrome)
Anderson (The less said about him the better)

Don't think for a second we'd get rid without having someone lined up. He's basically the only one who can stay fit.

1027~~~
Is it true if we got 9m for him it would be our biggest outgoing transfer since Ronaldo?

If he's off there's no doubt someone is coming in.

1028~~~
If we are letting him go, we must have someone lined up. We are already short in midfield.

And I think he'll do well for Villa..
There was too much pressure on him... and the whole thing kept snowballing. 
Regular game time and a fresh start should help him.

Shame how it turned out.. Didn't expect hime to be our "world class" midfielder, but really thought he was going to be a good squad player for many years..

Keano could teach him a few things in training too..

1029~~~
Haha..........NO!

1030~~~
9 million, I'd snap their hands off. I'm not sure if he is Villa level.

1031~~~
Our pool of midfielders next season, in order: Herrera, New signing, Carrick, Pereira, Fletcher.

1032~~~
Why? He has been a big let down.
Cleverley cost nothing so at least the club made a profit.

1033~~~
Should have charged them £18m, as revenge for Ashley Young.

1034~~~
This should send out a message to any young players getting complacent.

1035~~~
Not to bring the thread off topic but she's more like a pimped out ford focus. You can add all the extras you want its still an average car.

1036~~~
Yeah by a long way as well.

1037~~~
Not happy, especially not when worst and much more expensive players like Young and Fellaini are still here. So while those cost us fortunes in transfer fee and wages, Cleverley is at least bringing in good money.

Good luck to him, he is nowhere as bad as ppl make it out. And at least he won't be blamed now everytime we have a poor performance.

1038~~~
Hey i've got a focus!

I'd still take her for a test drive, mind. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1039~~~
Yes, we're going to miss his charging runs, they always caused havoc. Im bitterly disappointed as well...that we didn't sell him last season!

1040~~~
Yes. Nick Powell should look at himself after his performance against MK Dons

1041~~~
best of luck. hope he can regain his 2011-12 form

1042~~~
This will 100% mean we have another midfielder in. I can't see any reason other than that to sell him when it will cost us more to buy a player of similar quality to him.

On another note, I reckon he will play as a No. 10 for Aston Villa. He doesn't have the skill set required to play from deep as an attacking midfielder at United and he was never tasked with that, he was always the one who would keep it nice and let the others around him play their game, ala Carrick. I reckon he will do well at Villa and will bag some goals. All the best to him, but onward and upward now.

1043~~~
You forgot Di Maria.

1044~~~
Trust us to finally sell some deadwood when almost all our other midfielders are injured.

1045~~~
And risk pissing off a serious buyer? Nah I don't think so, just the fact that someone is willing to pay some money for him is reason enough to celebrate.

1046~~~
Really? you'd rather see Carrick or Fletcher sold?

1047~~~
Always sad to see our academy players not quite make the grade, I was genuinely hopeful for him throughout 2011. One two many knocks in confidence and he never regained his composure.

1048~~~
A player who's bright future at United is in his past. Hope he finds a place at Villa.

1049~~~
Well I guess that didn't work out then.....<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>


Personally I felt Tom was a good squad player to have, but obviously Van Gaal felt different, or maybe Cleverz wanted to go somewhere we he was more than just a squad player. 

If we're to replace Cleverley with say Vidal or Carvalho, I guess our midfielders will be:

Carvalho/Vidal (Starter)
Herrera (Starter)
Carrick (Squad)
Fellaini (Squad)
Flectcher (Squad)

1050~~~
Yet some how ashley young is on our books

1051~~~
im not saying hes world class player or does driving runs, but at least he can cover ground, which is more then Fletcher carrick fellaini,carrick or anderson

1052~~~
Was just about to say something similar. Would be another blow to his confidence though if she decides to leave when he goes to a less flashy club. 

Really hope Cleverley does well and find a place where he is appreciated for his contributions.

1053~~~
They probably love it, deep down. In fact, I know they're positively giddy. They're just always so bleeding negative about everything.

1054~~~
Seems like a nice guy, but this was always going to happen. Good luck elsewhere!

1055~~~
How Ando has spent 6 years here is what I want to know.

1056~~~
This smacks of selling to balance the books rather than selling because he's surplus or wants out, which is an out of order way to treat a player less than a month into a season with a new manager, imo. 

He's had a poor couple of years, but he's a versatile player in an area of the pitch we nearly always find ourselves short of numbers. There's certainly players we could afford to lose ahead of him...the only logic to it is they're not players we'd get £9m for.

He'd do well at a place like Villa I reckon, while we'd probably end up playing against him and seeing our midfield look as non existent as it did with him in it.

Unless there's something I'm not seeing here, Woodward's being given far too much decision making power for someone who's a clear and utter imbecile

1057~~~
I didn't include Mata either. I'm talking central midfielders, it's possible Di Maria play wide as often as centrally.

1058~~~
Carrick is underated in this sense. He offers better protection than Cleverley and distributes the ball better as well. Cleverley can cover more ground all he wants and still be completely and utterly ineffective.

1059~~~
should've told villa he works well with ando

1060~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1061~~~
Yup - i feel like part of our malaise last year was down to players feeling safe. A few departures should help that.

1062~~~
A bit harsh. Powell has spent more time on loan than actually at the club.

1063~~~
Never thought he had the talent to be a top player and it always seemed strange to me that so many rated him so highly in his early days.

I did think he could be a good squad player for us though, so it's a bit disappointing that he couldn't even step up to that level fully.

Seems like a fairly decent guy though so hopefully he'll do well at his next club. He was never going to really be Manchester United quality but Aston Villa is about his level so he may well thrive as a key part of that team.

1064~~~
Sorry but this is nonsense. This smacks of nothing other than a player who has repeatedly fallen short of expectations and failed to deliver despite numerous chances to do so finally being sold.

There is nothing versatile about Tom other than he has turned into a footballer who can be mediocre in a variety of different ways. He will now fade into obscurity

1065~~~
Mata and Di Maria don't play in the same position, I know you wouldn't include him. Mata plays as a number 10 whereas Di Maria played deeper in a midfield three which is his best position. 

Van Gaal and Di Maria have also indicated that he will play in midfield.

1066~~~
He's awful and a main reason why our midfield is so shite is because he features regularly. Excellent decision to sell providing we get some more players in before the window shuts.

1067~~~
^^
This

I have mixed feelings on this news, delighted because i don't think he's Manchester United quality and taking up a place in the squad and a little sad because 2 years ago he looked the part and he actually seems a decent lad.

Good luck to him, i hope he goes on to have a good career, improves and possibly go on to have a good international career too.

1068~~~
Yes but there are worse players than him in the squad. Unless we have at least 2 CMs lined up we'll be short and in trouble. Good luck to him though.

1069~~~
id rather Fletcher go defintly, because as sad as it is isnt a premier league player anymore

and carricks 33 and probably needs replaced anyway and i dont think his performances  where any better then cleverlys, and at leaset cleverly is still fairly young and cover the ground.

and we have lots of midfielders who arnt very mobile, and cleverly is one of only of two who are mobile, so i would rather see him stay

1070~~~
And yet we ended up having to play him loads of times last season due no one else being able to stay fit or play any better than him.

Meanwhile Anderson remains despite being so important he spent all of last season sitting on another team's bench. 

He wouldn't be going if there wasn't a money balancing excercise going on. It's simple as.

1071~~~
He's not good enough, won't be missed.  Hopefully Anderson, Hernandez, Fellaini, and Young will be following him out the door.

1072~~~
Ando remains purely because nobody wants him

1073~~~
Let's sign Delph now.

1074~~~
It doesn't mean his pathetic performance should be excused. He's trying to make it here, he had a chance to impress in front of Van Gaal and he blew it. Kid had no urgency whatsover, he was very lethargic and slow. Two pop shots at goal and some thought he had a good game.

1075~~~
Fletcher would be the main one i would want to go, unfortunately i don't think anyone would take him, possibly a jock manager might.

1076~~~
Yeah but nobody is going to pay money for Anderson. We've a whole host of players to sell and we have to start somewhere.

1077~~~
I don't think we'll be bringing anyone else in. I think he's being sold to balance the books for the money we've already spent.

If another comes in more will be on their way out first...and there's not enough time for that to happen.

1078~~~
Must be confident of getting a midfielder in then, surely we wouldn't let him go without a replacement, the midfield is already short in quality and numbers.

1079~~~
We are laughing getting £9M for him, his performances for us the last year or two haven't been worth £9!

1080~~~
I think it's got more to do with the fact that we're getting 9 million for a player who has been utter shite for the past 2 seasons. He showed signs that he could be a very good player when he first broke through but we can't afford to give him any long, look at Anderson...at the moment our squad is way too big so we have to get rid! I think the majority of United fans will be happy with this piece of business

1081~~~
i would agree with you carrick reads the game better and can position himself better, but he really struggles when the opposition attack either with pace or high tempo passing, he simply can't cope. 

i think clverly offers at least some help when teams attack with tempo, where i think carrick dosnt

1082~~~
This is so weird, he's shit but I don't want him to leave.

1083~~~
simple fact is no one would buy anderson,

1084~~~
I think one of either Carvalho, Vidal or Blind is guaranteed! Preferably not the latter

1085~~~
The main reason is him, Fallaini and Fletcher. Fellaini is better than them, but he will never be able to play to his strenghts at United, so he is just as useless.

Vidal, Herrera, Carrick, Lucas Silva and Pearson would be great. A Perfect mix of class, experience and potential.

1086~~~
They're still players that need midfielders behind them to do the work. Would you play Di Maria next to Carrick in a midfield 2?

1087~~~
Is there a story on the Sky Sports website yet? I've had a look and can't find anything.

1088~~~
I expect some of you are going to be seethingly disappointed on deadline day. 

I wouldn't worry about midfield. As soon as we switch to 4-3-3 we're slightly fecked once either of our fullbacks gets injured...and at the moment both of them already are.

1089~~~
Well Anderson has hardly played, ashley young has been consistently picked every week is what's even more baffling

1090~~~
Are you Cleverley's brother? Seriously, we're not missing anything letting him go. Cleverley was so poor that essentially his presence on the pitch could be equated to having a prop on a set. He'll struggle at Villa too. Mark my words.

1091~~~
Fecking hell! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1092~~~
I'm worried by all this exposure, can we not lock and hide this thread until then ink has dried on the contract?

1093~~~
Christ, sort out your grammar.

1094~~~
I hope it is 9 million. Snap their hands off.

1095~~~
I think Cleverley would be amazing for Villa.

1096~~~
£8-9 million <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> absolutely delighted with that.

1097~~~
We don't need numbers this season. We need quality. We've had a big squad for years and it's about time the crap got let go. We wont miss Cleverley. We wont miss Zaha, or Nani, or anyone else that's leaving.

1098~~~
Eh? I'd say the fact that these transfers seem to be happening with less than a week to go in the window implies that it's LvG telling Woodward to get rid.

1099~~~
Final year of his contract... His "advisers" have supposedly told the press he is happy to see out his contract to leave on a free
So 9 million quid is good business imo for a player unlikely to play many games then go for nothing

1100~~~
Haha 9million???

This is a wind up. . It has to be.

No one is that stupid

1101~~~
How does he achieve this? Cleverley is the worst marker of a player i've seen at this club in years. He tracked players like a 12 year old, it was very embarrassing.

1102~~~
The man is a PROFESSOR.

I really hope that SSN isn't wumming us, we really need to get rid.

1103~~~
For a midfielder who has been rated by all his managers and was 1st choice in a title winning season? Yeah, I agree it is far too little.

1104~~~
Best deal ever

1105~~~
Good deal. He'll do alright at Villa. Nice fee for us and it creates a squad space for someone better.

1106~~~
Why you not want Blind if you got Vidal? His versatility is key. Say Herrera or Vidal gets hurt .... who do you play? Blind fits perfectly into so many positions.

1107~~~
You're right partly, in that keeping Cleverley would either mean he would have been out of contract next season OR we'd have to give him a new contract. Neither makes any sense, financially or for the team benefit.

1108~~~
All his managers except the current one, the same guy who gave xavi, iniesta, muller and kroos their chances. I will go with LvG on this one

1109~~~
We want to see him gone, but come on! your trying to much. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1110~~~
Because he is a highly regarded scout in the game?

1111~~~
Rated? I think it's fair to say our limited options helped him get regular game time.

I think it's telling that its a club like Villa who are in for him - he just simply isn't good enough for a top 6 side. 

This would be a good deal with a year left on his contract.

1112~~~
its not just about marking about simply keeping up with the tempo of the game, im not trying to paint cleverly as this world class star, im simply saying beyond herrera he is the only CM we have who can deal with a high tempo game

1113~~~
A trace of dignity may be in order. Cleverely has devoted well over half his life to United and is still a capable player with the ability to do a good job at Villa.

1114~~~
I agree that he'd be great versatility wise but he'd cost about 20 million,which is a lot for a player that won't play first team. We'd still have Carrick and Flech who granted aren't good enough for the first team but I think they're more than capable back ups...I'd rather we spent the money on a defender

1115~~~
Probably been said but Hull haven't bid £9 million too, they bid that amount for Welbeck (Ogden).

1116~~~
Because he's average and ultimately a squad player - what we're trying to get rid at the moment. Fletcher and Carrick are going nowhere, so that's pretty much covered for CM backup options.

1117~~~
I think that replacing Cleverley with Vidal would be a step up for us.

1118~~~
Those celebrating his sale and abusing him are probably the same numpties that said he was the next Paul Scholes.

1119~~~
Is Bruce having a laugh?

1120~~~
How much would a striker who needs 10 chances to score a goal cost?

1121~~~
Seems legit. And seems like a fair deal. Good luck to the boy, I hope he does well for 'em.

Now, as far as United is concerned, we need to bring someone in - and sharpish.

1122~~~
Seems to be trying his luck with that, must be worth £16 million +

1123~~~
They just sold Long for £12 million.

1124~~~
Let me think about that for a second then get back to you.

1125~~~
Not me

1126~~~
He's not premier league proven though.

1127~~~
I'm conflicted on this on one hand I still genuinely feel with a bit of confidence he could easily be our Ramsey or Henderson, that may be blind faith but I guess now we'll never know...on the other hand him going must surely mean a better player will come in otherwise we really are leaving ourselves short

1128~~~
Carrick has effectively dealt with many high tempo games since he signed. You're forgetting that almost every game in this league is played at a high tempo. Essentially you're saying Carrick has been ineffective in a league where high tempo games are always expected. What about Anderson? He's more mobile than Cleverly no?  My point here is Cleverley offers nothing, even his ability to 'keep up' with the tempo as you say, did nothing for him as he's only had exactly two exceptional games since he broke into the team, against City in the Community shield in '12 and against Aston Villa last season in an easy 3-0 win away where he actually even scored.

1129~~~
Perhaps I shouldn't be laughing but, sorry. I just don't rate him. Never did.

1130~~~
Im asking you a question (no sarcasm etc). 

I often wonder how much Welbeck's worth myself. He's got pace and he's fairly gifted but his finishing is appalling. It would be very difficult to get good money for him hence why I disagree in selling him

1131~~~
are you ready yet?

1132~~~
Excellent for all parties.

1133~~~
Fellaini is PL proven, does this make him a better option than Vidal?

1134~~~
the guy had his chance and United were very patient with him. His confidence is a wreck and the staff has lost faith in him. Its better for both sides for him to leave

1135~~~
Welbeck's worth 15-20m, at least. If he goes for lower than that I'll be annoyed.

1136~~~
If we get £9 million Cleverley we have done pretty well. He is not good enough for us but I think he will be great at a team like Aston Villa. 

He has had a lot of stick during his time here so I really hope he excels at Villa. Good luck to him.

1137~~~

1138~~~
In a club like united no one should have a poor couple of years in a row and still be here, it's happening with plenty of players and it's one of the reasons for our downfall. It's true that we're selling him ahead of others because he's still worth something, but that doesn't mean he deserves to stay, it's simply a case of us having offers for him and not a single offer for anderson.

1139~~~
Welbeck is worth £15 million at least. Quick, strong, tall, technically gifted. He was picked by the greatest manager of all time to play against Real Madrid back to back, replacing Rooney in the line up. If he plays up front every week and he will get 20 goals a season somewhere. Not to mention he is still young and counts as home grown. He can offer versatility and 100% commitment. Easily worth at least £15 million.

EDIT - and he is too good for Hull anyway <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1140~~~
Fair enough, neither did I. He was always the next big youth player that was going to fall short of being a permanent starting XI.

1141~~~
Alonso = 5M, Cleverley = 9M

1142~~~
9 million

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/NUeVFnL.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/NUeVFnL.gif"/>

1143~~~
As said, its going to be very difficult to get good money for him. The boy ticks all the right boxes however his finishing is almost ridiculous and a striker must be able to score goals. 

Id rather keep him at OT. His pace and technique are much appreciated here

1144~~~
Yeah and Alonso probably earns double what Cleverley earns and probably only has two years left in him.

1145~~~
Welbeck really shouldn't be sold unless he wants to leave. Then again, maybe LvG has seen something good in Wilson.

1146~~~
Yes. Had to think really hard and I am not quite sure but I'd say you are probably right.

1147~~~
I kinda feel for him...in a way I'll always have a soft spot for every player that came through United's academy, but at the end of the day I think it's a win-win situation, providing ofcourse this means we're bringing in another midfielder, otherwise that just leaves us short on numbers.
I think he'll do well at Villa, although I doubt he'll hit any new hights

1148~~~
Sounds horrible but I hope we keep him as a squad player.

1149~~~
I think anyone who has seen Wilson play has seen something good in him tbf. He looks quality. I agree though, Welbeck should stay unless he has asked to leave. I couldn't hate Welbeck for it either.

1150~~~
Could you honestly see him turn it around with us?
New gaffer, new staff, new everything, and he's still on the downward trajectory starting under Moyes.

Maybe I'm naïve, but I don't see the Glazers' hand in this deal at all. I see a good player needing a fresh start somewhere else, moving on as he ought to.

1151~~~
Same

And if by some miracle Welbeck does manage to improve his goalscoring record then we'll have another top quality striker in the team.

1152~~~
Likewise. The lad actually has a lot of talent and doesn't shy away from standing up in a game, which can't be said about Cleverley, for example.

1153~~~
Well, i guess this means that we will be having new players arriving by the end of the week. The important thing is to see who we will sign for our midfield because these players, alongside ADM, will provide a more clear picture of LvG's plans.

As for Cleverley, i i believe it was the best decision for all parties. He always gave all he got and for that i want to thank him. It's not his fault we lacked better CM options and we played a formation (2 man midfield) which didn't help him hide or mask his weaknesses.

Unfortunately for him the modern game requires midfielders who can cover the whole pitch, carry the ball and be involved in the attacking third and also have the energy levels and dynamism to help the defense. Since we played Carrick as a holding midfielder, Tom had to do all the rest.

I think he will have a chance to revive his career at AV. More defensive set up, compact formation and enough players near him for support. For what he was expected to do at United, he could perform at 5-5,5/10. At Villa he could become a really useful player, like Gibson at Everton.

1154~~~
Let me ask you this. Were you unhappy when Rooney was the one who wanted to be let go?

1155~~~
Id say we should sell Hernandez and send Wilson on a loan for a year or two. By the time he comes back at United RVP would be probably either gone or ready to accept the bench.

1156~~~
Ben Davies went for 10m. After a couple of good seasons he's a player who's looked like he could go on and be even better and we've hopefully got 8-9m for someone who's stagnated.

1157~~~
Wilson or no Wilson...Hernandez most likely has one foot out the door already, RvP despite being a quality player isn't getting any younger and even apart from that he's just a very useful player. Sure he should get more in the goals department, but if we disregard that for a second he's a top player. I know we shouldn't generaly disregard his goal tally seeing as he is a striker, but surely I can't be the only one that sees what he brings to the team.
I'd definitely keep him as one of my first rotation options, or at most loan him out, whatever happens I just hope he's not sold.

1158~~~
Yeah, why do you ask?

1159~~~
yes....your comments make you one..

1160~~~
Tom had great promise but something got inside his head after the Davies scythe to his knee and he was never the same footballer again.

1161~~~
Good luck to him. I hope the move goes through and he can regain his form there.

1162~~~
How is it different if Welbeck wanted to leave the club? Why would you not be unhappy at him? I mean its not like he has scored 20 goals and assisted 15 these past two seasons and we still put him on the bench.

1163~~~
Tom's never going to fullfil his potential at United and he'll never be anything more than a squad player, similar to Ben Foster. The big stage is just too much for him.

I hope he does well at Villa though, for England's sake and just to piss everyone off.

1164~~~
I agree with you. He's gotta stick around surely. The moment we switch to a 4-3-3 permanently (its on the cards to happen soon IMO), Welbeck becomes a really really solid option to have.

1165~~~
We're not missing anything rather than potentially clogging up the squad to prevent other young midfielders moving up and getting their shot. We'll definitely be getting another midfielder so we do need to sell - Anderson doesn't count as he never plays anyway.

1166~~~
Well good luck to him - providing he does end up leaving. Has a bit of the Gibson saga about it, but he wasnt good enough for United and having him on the books makes very little sense given how little he seems to contribute.

1167~~~
I'd have been happy to hold onto him as backup since he's arguably a bit better than some of the dross like Anderson, but for that price it makes sense to sell. Not too gutted to see him going either if the deal goes through.

1168~~~
But his knee doesn't keep falling off

1169~~~
Interesting that this ends up being my first post in the main forum. I have to say that for a long time I was quite the Cleverley defender, especially the season before last. The fact of the matter was that in 2011/2012 United looked like a much better team when he was on the pitch. I even thought he would go on to make a meaningful contribution for England. Unfortunately, Cleverley has regressed most notably in confidence (can thank Kevin Davies for that among others) and that has been well documented on this forum.

I only wish him the best and shame it didn't work out. Cleverley is definitely better than some people make him out to be but there is no question that he will not succeed at United at this point. Hopefully he can get a fresh start, regain his confidence, and bring back his pass and move style.

1170~~~
No his constant injuries are always something new.

1171~~~
Sad to see him leave.

1172~~~
I'm glad I'm not the only one seeing the Davies tackle as a bad turning point for Cleverley. I'm not going to get all tinfoilhat saying that was certainly <i>the moment,</i> but something got knocked out of him there, it can't be denied.

I hope with all my heart he can shake the fear now, with a new start and with Keano to spur him on.

1173~~~
I'd agree that he was superb in the opening parts of the season, but later in the season I don't think he really made the team that much better, even if he was still decent. Hopefully he'll do well at Villa though and the club will be more to his level.

1174~~~
I'm hurt.....I'm bleeding

1175~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The handbags in here!

1176~~~
Exactly, how exciting is that?!

1177~~~
Either that or more likely just numpties. Some stuff on here is embarrassing.

1178~~~
The passport mate, it's all in the passport. Young, England international.....£20m easily or we keep him.

1179~~~
No need to hold back. They are numpties

1180~~~
Now you know why they call me The Professor.

1181~~~
Cleverley needs to avoid Aston Villa like a plague. He has his faults, but Villa are the least ambitious club in the league.

1182~~~
Once it became apparent Rooney only did it for a pay rise I did not like it one bit. If Welbeck wants to leave, it's because he wants to play more football.

1183~~~
I agree with that statement. I think a lot of people can agree that the rot in Cleverley's career really started in the 2012/13 campaign.

1184~~~
Has anyone got any link or tweet from SSN about us actually accepting a bid?

1185~~~
He said he was the type of midfielder that LVG seems to like.

He left out the bit where his current level is midtable at best

1186~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I don't get it.

I'm actually laughing that a player, whom has shown time and time again that he's not good enough, with about a year left on his contract, is going for £9 million! 

We bought Kagawa for 12 for God's sake

1187~~~
Aye, and he has been a huge disappointment.

1188~~~
Tbf, it was a great price at the time considering the prior seasons that Kagawa had at Dortmund. I genuinely thought he was a top 30 player at the time.

1189~~~

1190~~~
At the time, it was an absolute robbery

1191~~~
So did I which is why he has been a huge disappointment.

1192~~~
He had one year left on his contract and wanted to play for us. Dortmund had a reasonable deal.

1193~~~
£9 million? Nice. Absolutely must have someone lined-up to come in then.

1194~~~
Why are we selling him if we have no cover in that position? Our two best players there are already injured.

Yes, I know I don't rate him that highly but he's numbers in a position we cannot feck around with

1195~~~
Welcome up. Personally I think Clev still has it in him to be a good player. However at this point, judged solely on merit, he can't really complain if he's sold. You're right, he's not as bad as people make out, but he's underwhelmed in the last 18 months, and crucially, he's been pretty poor in the short time that LVG has been here. Not a surprise that LVG has sold him based on what he's been able to see.

1196~~~
we never sell players for much.
Some are laughing that £9m sounds high, but you'd barely get a championship player for that.

Wasn't so long ago he was seen as the answer to our midfield problems and we were lamenting him being out for weeks.

However, definitely the time to go. He needs to go to a Villa, somewhere where his every move isn't obliterated by the fans and press.

1197~~~
No white text?

You are joking right?

If you look it in this aspect then his price tag is dead on.

1198~~~
Point is what was paid for Kagawa is irrelevant. McCormack cost £12m what does it matter?

1199~~~
Everton eh, he might actually get European football next season!

1200~~~
Have you watched the kid play?

You can say he is young or inexperienced .... but is def. not average. This is the same kind of sentiment people were saying last year from Strootman.

1201~~~
That does matter!

That needs to be looked into! That was unbelievable

1202~~~
TBF hes not good enough for United but hes got a good attitude and tried his best for a club he genuinely loves. 

Its always sad to see one of your most promising young players to break into the first team leave after not achieving what he could have

1203~~~
Yes, at the WC and he's definitely lacking something very important - pace. Which we already lack in our game.

Yes, but unfortunately that's not enough for a big club like United. I feel sad for players like Rossi, Pogba (and now probably Welbeck) for example from recent memory, who had also a genuine ability, but I get the local lad angle.

1204~~~
Yeah, he never reached his early season heights for the rest of that year but he was still decent and reliable in midfield. He's just been aberage since then. I don't even think he's necessarily been a <i>bad </i>player for us in the way Fellaini has been, he's just been average and hasn't made an impact most of the time when he's featured.

1205~~~
Villa fans have their say

1206~~~
I know a lot of Villa fans and they have been slating the likes of Cleverley and Welbeck for the past few years. Always moaning and blaming them whenever Ingerland lose or if they get in the squad ahead of the likes of the almighty Fabian Delph. It's a shame that Cleverley will be leaving having not reached the heights that we expected but I will find it absolutely hilarious if he ends up at Villa.

1207~~~
Hell no. I thought he was decent when he broke into the first team in 2011 but he has never pushed on since then. I've wanted him gone for the last two years.

1208~~~
Somebody tell them theyve ha already signed shitter players than him, didn't they sign Joe cole, Senderos and some other useless players on free and they are still crying over him they should be thanking us.

1209~~~
Of course, you didn't cherry pick those that reflect your own view?

1210~~~
Aren't england international automatically like 20m? Wtf

1211~~~
And that was just Roy Keane's reaction

1212~~~
Cleverley would be better going to Everton or Hull if he could, Villa have turned into an absolute shit Football Club with a shit Manager as well.

1213~~~
I've warned you several times in this thread about the Villa support. Certainly nothing personal against Cleverley, and I'm sure they'll get behind him come match day.

It's just their idiom. If one of them won the lottery they'd go 'Bastard luck! Now I'll have to drink myself to death and talk to lots of fit birds rather than sit around and mope about Villa 24/7.'

1214~~~
He did score against them last season too... Goes to show how little people outside of United think of Tclevz. Must hurt seeing your team overpay for rubbish English players. The same player in Spain moves for next to nothing every season, literally.

1215~~~
I don't think that's true at all and I've been saying it on here for a while. I think Cleverly got the benefit of the doubt from fans over Fellaini because he was an academy prospect, wasn't lanky with an afro and didn't cost £27m. In terms of actual performance he's been no better, if not worse than Fellaini.

1216~~~
SSN just spoke about players that we could be selling but only spoke about Welbeck and Hernandez. Strange that there was no mention of Cleverley.

1217~~~
Good God....I'm not even going to respond to that

1218~~~
They are just taking the piss. Deep down Villa fans know that they will get getting a stable player in their ranks in Cleverly. Also, I am sure he will see better days there out of the need to prove himself again after having failed here. He will turn out to be a decent signing.

1219~~~
You have?!

1220~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Spot on. They are the most miserable set of fans in the whole of English football.

1221~~~
+ 1. I'm wondering where the SSN bit is coming from?? Has this actually been confirmed or is it a windup?

1222~~~
If he's another Hargreaves i'd rather we take a chance on Carvalho

1223~~~
Have to disagree with you mate, Fellaini shows time after time that he cant play in midfield. He doesnt pick up runners and doesnt seem to know where to play because he takes up some awkward positions - at least Cleverley had some sort of awareness about what his job in the midfield was.

I fully agree - you wont hear me complain about losing Cleverley but all i am saying is i understand why some people here are a little sad to see him go.

1224~~~
He's better than the likes of Delph for rucks sake.

I know it's fashionable to pretend some of our players are garbage and couldn't get in anyone's teams, but they're not here by accident.

1225~~~
Did you see the interview with Zaha in his car? He had rap music blaring out as he's answering questions, he looked like a right cnut.

1226~~~
Not you personally, 'you' as in 'the general Caftard'. I've just brought up their relentless negativity because it's fun to share the pain and annoy my fella the Villa supporter. 

From the horses mouth to your ear: They're so giddy you can not believe it. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1227~~~
How upset he's going to be when he finds out it's actually £9m.

Villa fans still hate us for 1993.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> I know this because I live just outside Birmingham.

1228~~~
Ah that makes much more sense now

1229~~~
Well Welbeck if he moves will also be getting more money than he is earning now. And he knows that. But if you are a so called academy product and a Manchester boy through and through, why don't you stay and fight for your place? And you don't think Welbeck will stay if we double his wages tomorrow? It will be more than he will be earning at a different club. It is about the money for all footballers but they are not open about it because they will be frowned upon.

1230~~~
There is going to be a serious meltdown on here if this ends up being a lie <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1231~~~
To be fair, Villa fans have been burnt before by signing players with a great future behind them (Stephen Ireland). He may turn out to be a decent buy but I can understand their misgivings as, after 3 years as a first team player here, I am still not sure what exactly he brings to the table.

1232~~~
And the rest. How much did the southampton bruiser got to the scouse for again? Welbeck is twice the player lambert is.

Of all our players having trouble with form, Welbeck is the one I want to stay, he still has it in him to be top class. Hernandez would be the one I'd like to make room for Wilson of our strikers/

1233~~~
made me laugh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1234~~~
SSN will probably mention it later when the script gets updated.

1235~~~
That O'Rourke guy from SSN tweeted it.

1236~~~
Always a shame to see a home-grown player go, after failing in the first team, especially since Cleverley was developing really well for a while. I think it's a good move though, for all involved parties. If it turns out to be true, of course.

1237~~~
Fellaini had a few decent performances in midfield last season against the cannon fodder. Most of them were away games too. As a squad player, I think that he could be more useful than Cleverly ever was. At least he's proven that he can score goals at Everton. Cleverly has little to no redeeming qualities apart from 'keeping things ticking'. In other words, passing the ball to the player next to him repeatedly and trying nothing else of note. One of the most cowardly players I've ever seen play for us.

However I still want Fellaini sold too ASAP.

1238~~~
Considering his place in the squad and the limited number of games United will play this season, Cleverly needed to move on for his own career. So i wish him all the best, and his place can be taken by a member of the reserves.

Good deal for both player and club.

1239~~~
Plenty of papers running with it so it probably is legit. As for the Sky Sports story one of their reporters tweeted that the bid was accepted. It is a legit account so it's a bit strange that there is nothing on SSN or their website.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I thought that too. You would think that when he knew he was about to be interviewed on tv that he would turn down the radio for a few minutes!

1240~~~
I feel their pain. Cleverley is worse than the players you mentioned (seriously you think Joe Cole was a useless player? An injured and finished Cole was still better than TC). They are simply saying the same things United fans have been saying about Cleverley. We should be thanking them for actually offering to pay for  that crappy ass player.

1241~~~
Hope he doesn't reject this deal after we accepted the offer. It shows where we stand in regards to him. If he can't take the hint, then it wont do him any good.

1242~~~
It's better to see them go than to see them wilt on the vine. Like I said to noods upthread, I just can't see him turning it around here. Much better to start over at a new club.

And <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> to dwd & .rossi -- Yes, you need to learn the Villa idiom if you're going to follow Cleverley via their boards or tweets. A few examples: bastard - a person; horrible, heartless bastard - a Villa player; hell - life; hopeless black hole of pure hell - a season; could also be a game.

1243~~~
Good riddance!!! 

The quicker we get these average Joes out the door the better and get them replaced with some real quality. Hopefully this is just the start and the likes of Young, Anderson etc.... aren't far behind him. We may not shift them all this window but as long as we've started the ball rolling I'm happy with that.

1244~~~
Rooney came out and publicly said the club lacked ambition.
Stay and fight for his place? He has been fighting for his place, many fans give him shit and he is wants to play week in week out before it's too late. He has Mata, Rooney and RVP to contend with, not a bunch of average players.

1245~~~
Bye

1246~~~
If rumours are believed, then Cleverley is worth more than Kagawa, madness what the 'English tax' can add.

1247~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1248~~~
Cleverley for 9m is worth more than Kagawa at 12m?

1249~~~
Is this real or just a massive wind up?

1250~~~
Kagawa been quoted at 10 million euros from what i've seen.

1251~~~
Wheres the source? Or is it only that tweet?

1252~~~
Let's be honest, the few people who are sad to see him go are only sad, because he is a youth product and comes from the academy. He 'understands' United. Could be true, but his perfomances tell another story. He will never be anything than a squad player. In the end not good enough, didnt work out for whatever reason. Let us take the money and wish the lad all the best.

1253~~~
So is this real then?

12m rising to 17m was the figure i remember at the time.

1255~~~
Not seen it on SSN tv. I hope it's true. I still have a soft spot for him and think the move would be good for him.

1256~~~
I particularly liked this one:

1257~~~
That's the fecking scary part.

1258~~~
Think we've crossed wires somewhere here, Kagawa's quoted price on potential move back to Dortmund is 10 million euros (£7.9 million),  and Cleverley to Villa is £9 million, hence me saying Cleverley been worth more than Kagawa.

1259~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1260~~~
He's referring to us selling him back to Dortmund.

1261~~~
Bugger shit'n'piss!

Sorry, didn't read back far enough i guess.

1262~~~
What do you mean he tries his best? His best is bullshit, everything about him is bullshit including what he says. He thinks his cowardly side passing is justified because Spanish players do it. fecking ridiculous typical English player who got cocky before he has actually made it

1263~~~
Indeed I was.

1264~~~
I think your entire post is conjecture, or bullshit, if you will.

1265~~~
Too right. TC thought he already made it here, thought he was the new David Beckham. He's not as cocky as David Bentley was but they shared the same 'i've made it' attitude that many young English players have (Kieran Richardson was another one). Darron Gibson was better than Cleverley, not like its a hard thing to do, he took his criticism and he knew his level. Cleverley on the other hand is simply not good enough, even for Aston Villa as they'll soon find out. Two seasons from now or even sooner no one will even mention his name because he'll be nowhere to be seen unless he's at a championship team. <a class="username" data-user="48264, @walsh" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48264/">@walsh</a> United22 is spot on.

1266~~~
Well ive seen players who do very little and just see playing for their club as a paycheque (most obvious in our squad is Nani and Anderson) but here we have a player who was a absolute professional for us and gave his all but, unfortunately, just wasnt good enough. Just my views on him.

Also i dont know what made you think he got too cocky early on in his career. I personally never saw that but if you could provide me with any articles i would stand corrected.

1267~~~
This is such a brutally unfair post. 

Yes, obviously his head is gone. Don't kick him when he's down -- wish him good luck and hope he can shake the fear and start over.

1268~~~
We are not going to take their Vlaar though.

1269~~~
The feelings on Cleverley really have come full circle on here. I remember the ridiculous hyperbole about how good he was in here when he first broke through and I thought he was overrated. It's come to the point were I imagine some of the people posting here are spitting at the screen in anger at him. I actually feel a bit sorry for him now.

1270~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Quality!

1271~~~
All of it is bullshit? Fair enough but I'm sure I'm 100% right about the side passing bit. He actually is wrong about that, he thought that because La Liga midfielders pass to the side and get clapped for it (exactly what he said), it was some sort of justification for him not passing forward and being adventurous with his play. Yes you don't pass forward all the time but that doesn't mean La Liga midfielders do it all the time as an excuse for not passing forward. Then he said he was made scapegoat for United's bad performances because he didn't do flashy things on the pitch, another thing that was bullshit. I can probably name over 6 players that got regularly abused last season through social media, and he was rightly one of them but not the only one. The truth is not only didn't he do flashy things but he didn't even get the basics correct. His 12/13 season was decent (still nowhere near the quality of starting for United) and that's as far as it goes for him.

The rest of my post about him being cocky is all opinion and fair enough if you think its bullshit

1272~~~
He definitely was a huge scapegoat though. Even though he didn't perform well, the reactions and criticism was ridiculous, especially for a local lad who's come through the ranks. What he said about Spanish/continental players did have some truth to it, he was basically saying his role is ball retention which is very important in Spain. However, I do agree that he doesn't do enough aside from short passes to justify his place in the team. You can't blame the lad for having no confidence though with the absolute dogs abuse he gets. The stuff about him being cocky was just completely incorrect I feel, I think he's the opposite and has gone into his shell since he came into the team and started playing well a couple of seasons back.

I do think that a move somewhere like Villa might be what he needs though, providing we sign someone to take his place in the squad.

1273~~~
Whats this about him wanting to stay and leave on a free in the summer?!
Saw it on Twitter that's his preferred move

1274~~~
Title changed. Seen nothing on SSN to indicate it's true.

1275~~~
Surely this means we are signing someone. It only leaves us with Carrick, Herrera and Fletcher, not counting reserves.

1276~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1277~~~
The rumours of negotiations are true. It's not a done deal, though. Cleverley will have to agree. I can't see why he's stalling, I thought he'd be out like a rat up a drainpipe, given the chance.

1278~~~
Villa ITK reported it first.

Then John Percy, Ducker and most reported offers.

John Percy reported Villa's bid been accepted but Hull and Everton also were interested after that.

Peter Rourke tweeted Villa bid has been accepted too.

Most likely this is true. I think he might first want to choose the club among options though.

1279~~~
Oh I know, but the title said that SSN said a bid had been accepted. Nothing on there. Pete Rourke said it had been accepted but still nothing official yet.

1280~~~
Some turds pop up after every flush.

1281~~~
The word is he'd get a better sign on bonus as a free player. Makes sense. I want him gone before Monday!

1282~~~
So there's still a chance we can send Ashley Young back as a makeweight.

1283~~~
No, nothing official. Agree totally with the title change.

1284~~~
His true character <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1285~~~
OK. Let him go for free.

1286~~~
So it was bollocks then? Maybe Lambert signed in to the Villa forum and read what the fans thought of it.

1287~~~
He'd also probably get a better choice of clubs on a free.

1288~~~
Really? Villa, Hull and Everton are the best he's gonna do in this country.

Unless he thinks some Spanish giant is going to snap him up

1289~~~
So is he not going now?

1290~~~
Villa is probably the worst he could do. If I was him, I'd probably wait it out as well. The worst that could happen is that Villa still want him.

1291~~~
Sit on the bench, pick up easy money and get a big signing on bonus in the summer...As opposed to playing football. 

Game's gone mad

1292~~~
Or possibly get relegated with Villa.

1293~~~
I think this wont not go through until after Saturday as we still may need him for the Burnley match.

1294~~~
Surely we've enough fit to name the required 7 subs?

1295~~~
Forgot about that, that fecking prick <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> Felt like Cleverley was showing marked improvements game after game in that period... and Anderson, too!

1296~~~
If Cleverley can't get over a tackle from 3 years ago, then it says more about him then Davis

1297~~~
You really are a sucker for media crap. In an interview he was directly asked 'do you think you're a Van Gaal player?'. He said 'yeah I think I could be', he didn't just blurt out that he was that, he replied that he thought he could be. Just like the 'more appreciated in Spain' thing. Ollie Holt asked him that exact question and he said maybe he would be. What's he supposed to say to those questions? Nah I'm not a Van Gaal player? They're leading questions asked to produce a headline and you've fallen for it, like so many others seem to have.

And you're contradicting yourself about the underconfidence thing. You say someone under confident would take their chance? What's that meant to mean? Surely if you're lacking confidence, and 'nervous' as you then went on to call it, you're less likely to produce your best form? If he was this arrogant jumped up kid you seem to think he is, surely rather than playing nervously he'd be selfish or try Hollywood passes, yet the absolute opposite has been happening with Cleverley. He's been struggling for while, quite obviously, with confidence. You've denied it but contradicted yourself completely above. 

And the clothing brand thing, that's a really bizarre thing to get annoyed about. I understand people thinking it's a bit daft and he's hardly going to sell like Beckham but why does it matter? He doesn't seem to be the sharpest tool in the box and he's trying to make the most of a short career at the most supported sports club in the world. You're genuinely annoyed at that? 

You're letting tabloid newspapers and your opinion of him as a player utterly cloud your view of him as a person. He had a good start but isn't quite good enough and is now moving on. Good luck to him, I liked the lad.

1298~~~
We'll have an 18, but if Herrera's not fit who's going to play next the Fletcher? Carrick's out, Fellaini's out, Kagawa came off against MK Dons and van Gaal won't play him there anyway. So Powell? Anderson? Januzaj?

1299~~~
Good point. 

But still <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1300~~~
I've changed a lot, there is a Dutch football managing game (onlinesoccermanager) and back in the days my username was cleverley, a lot has changed since.

1301~~~
Someone at United needs to bully him, he has to go.

1302~~~
In fairness, we've had Eric, Robbo, Keane, Irwin, Stam, Bruce, Neville, Butt, Ince, Scholes, Hughes, McClair, Johnson to name a few, who have delivered far worse tackles in the past....

1303~~~
LVG? Chinese burns and pink belly sort of stuff?!

1304~~~
Ah feck ye anyway skysports, I already transferred him on fifa.

1305~~~
Absolutely, I just agreed upthread that he wasn't the same after, like something got knocked out of him. Might be pure bollocks, though. What everyone can agree on, I think, is that right now he's got no confidence whatsoever. Would I prefer for him to sort it out here and emerge as the player we know he can be? Of course. I just don't see it, hence my being happy if the Villa deal went through.

1306~~~
To be honest I don't think he'd get much game time even at Villa and especially Everton. He has a lot of other same level players at those clubs for competition. I kinda feel for the guy, he's simply not good enough. Very fortunate to have come this far at United.

1307~~~
Would be fantastic if it wasn't true. If he goes then hopefully to Martinez' Everton and I don't care if they pay us much less than Aston Villa!

1308~~~
Just sell him and pay salary difference for this one season.

1309~~~
What's going on? is he staying now?

1310~~~
I am definitely going against the bizarre angry pitchfork mob abuse mentality and I think he has more to offer. I would be pretty disappointed if he was sold. Especially so if we don't have players lined up to come in. It would erase a bit of the feeling of watching youngsters grow and be nurtured by the club and go on to be memorable footballers. We are losing a little bit of that. Tom's breakthrough at Watford and Wigan. His defiance and eventual starting lineup berth and his injury and recovery. I certainly don't think he's as terrible as this rotten thread suggests but I would not be disappointed if he stayed and I sure as hell hope we have replacements lined up if he goes.

1311~~~
Making too much sense here. Thanks for the injection of perspective.

1312~~~
Chilli Pepper on his towel, pepper spray in his locker...

1313~~~
Was a joke.

1314~~~
I thought he was going. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1315~~~
Maybe Ben Pearson could be looked at? A bit early I know but could be worth a look?

1316~~~
Oh. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

But seriously, I'd like to know who we're playing next to Fletcher if TC23<span style="font-size: 18px">™ </span>is on his way out and Herrera can't make it. Powell and Anderson started in a side that lost 4-0 to a League 1 outfit.

1317~~~
If you are using the TC23 thing as a stick to beat him with you really should do some research on it. There are plenty of things to criticise Cleverley for but thats not one of them.

1318~~~

1319~~~
I'm just messing about, I don't hate the guy or anything and I read that it was for charity. Still not sorry he's leaving if we end up getting £9m for him, mind.

1320~~~
anderson didn't play that bad, that was powell who was clueless. We have some "options" in Jones, Mata, Anderson, Pereira. not convincing tho..

1321~~~
See before Sunderland I was a lot like you, I really wanted Cleverley to kick on and really thought under LvG he would flourish. However, I just think he's quite a limited player who's spent a lot of his time trying to find where he could play to his fullest at a top club but it just hasn't happened. 

I think we need to start trimming the rubbish we have in the squad and tbh cleverleys name is definitely up there

1322~~~
Powell was worse, but Anderson's still not really ideal in a game we need to win. Jones can do a job but we really need him in defence and Mata wouldn't be in his best roll. Then we're on to fringe players.

Anyway, this discussion is best saved for the match thread.

1323~~~
Wtf?? I thought he was going?

1324~~~
9 million is good business for us i think. Be a good price if its true.

1325~~~
Yes, I'd like a bit of clarification on why the tag has been removed from the thread.

Just having a read back through - my god some of you are embarrassing. 'Doing happy a dance', 'best day of my life', 'best day of the transfer window'. You utter, utter cretins. Abominable.

1326~~~
No, he decided against moving forwards, he's going to play it safe.

1327~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1328~~~
Hey Tom....


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s.mlkshk.com/r/TXL" src="http://s.mlkshk.com/r/TXL"/>

1329~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

ETA: No clue where that gif is from, Don, but love the 'the feck OUT!' whiteboard. Having said that, he's welcome to stay as far as I'm concerned. I just don't think he will.

1330~~~
Utter garbage.

1331~~~
So he can "pass the ball sideways, keep possession and get clapped"?

1332~~~
I'm not going to debate with you regarding the confidence thing, because we're clearly both not going to move from that. With the clothing brand, yes I am annoyed with that. Not because he's doing it, but because he's doing it so young when he should be focusing on his football. He broke into the first team after one season and thought THAT was a good time to start a clothing brand. You can think it's not a big deal, but I do. A young footballer shouldn't even be thinking about that at 20/21/22. I find it annoying and over-confident if you ask me. We're going to disagree once again on this, so I guess there was no point me saying this but ah well.

I'll admit defeat in the media twisting his words thing. Fine. But I still think he became complacent after his first season at the club and went into auto-pilot. He's an average player, but the fact he's practically made no effort in trying to prove otherwise when on the field. When you're fighting for a place at the club, and you surely know that the fans aren't on your side and during a transfer window, you DO NOT stop tracking back or slow down like he did against Sunderland. It's one moment, but it's a moment that epitomizes his last couple of seasons for us. 

I wish him good luck too. It's not great seeing a youth product fail at the club, but fact is he is just not good enough. I won't care that he leaves simply because he's been a passenger for too long (not as long as Anderson, but ah well).

1333~~~
Entourage.

1334~~~
Can't have a laugh, can we? Don't be so dramatic, I'm sure Don's just taking the piss.

1335~~~
Of all the useless, money wasting, parasitic, clueless, ineffective, responsibility shirking, mouth breathers we have at the club, he is the worst.

1336~~~
There is a line between 'having a laugh' and being downright disrespectful. Is this what fans fans find funny these days? Telling their own teams players to 'get the feck out'. Maybe I am just old school and like a bit of wit in my humour.

This reminds me of that baseballer in the US who was in the booth and his portrait was getting booed and trashtalked by fans then he'd step out of the booth and the fan would break down and go 'WOWWWW oh my god...' shake his hand in awe and eventually get an autograph. Same complete garbage up in here.

You utter embarrassment.

1337~~~
You mad? The sooner he leaves the better it will be for all parties concerned. LVG is not going to play him. Rubbish player be gone! Be gone I say!

1338~~~
You should really stop talking about yourself in such a manner.

1339~~~
That horrible TV programme with those boring pretty boys? Well, at least they had a good moment.

1340~~~
'Supporters' these days, unbelievable.

1341~~~
Keep your hair on. I've always liked Cleverley as a player, I'm so sad to see him stagnate, I want him to move throught the fear and play as I know he's capable of playing.

If with us, I'm delighted. If it means he has to move on, I'm also happy with that. Stop pontificating.

1342~~~
Cleverly is just limited in his vision, would say he has a decent attitude.

1343~~~
What a dramatic idiot you are, they were obviously joking. Why are you on a internet forum if you can't bear such things? Is every single post of yours from now on going to be a insult/rant about someone?

1344~~~
I don't think I was personally insulting you, I agree and I think there are many who want him to succeed, there is only one way he can though and that is game time, confidence, goals and actually getting stuck in. I am all for saying he's down at the moment and even that the future is quite bleak but laying the boot in and blindly abusing him and saying he'll never succeed and he'll never be good enough is just embarrassing. The fans are putting themselves in a position where if he does go on to turn it all around - what then? They back pedal and say 'it was all a bit of fun, you know?..' or something. The jokes are one thing but the abuse is unnecessary.

By all means, go on and have a laugh but lets not pretend just downright abuse is all a bit of fun. I believe I have stepped in between the pitchforks to say this so I will step out of the way and let everyone 'have their fun'.

1345~~~
I really hope he does well at Everton or Villa. There is a decent player in there somewhere. Hopefully the downgrade will make him more aware of his limitations and get him the motivation to improve himself.

Also, hear rumours that his people had approached the club for a contract extension and pay rise. What were they thinking? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1346~~~
"Is Tom wanted by the club and is he getting a contract extension? What is the future for our client?" I may be firing wide of the mark here.. But that could be a possibility.

1347~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1348~~~
Nah, I wasn't joking. I will likely do a small dance of celebration when Cleverley leaves the club, the goddamn scrounger/professional footballer impersonator. Sentimentalists who think every fecking player who walks through the doors of OT deserves 100000 chances are what's filled our squad with dross. GET. RID.

1349~~~
We need like buttons on here. LIKE

1350~~~
Quite the meltdown. You really do love the word utter don't you

1351~~~
I am not seeing the meltdown to be honest. Utterance of the word 'utterly' has been noted.

1352~~~
The change in the title is disappointing, hopefully he'll still be off within the next 4 days.

1353~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Thats great

1354~~~
Red Phoenix has had a meltdown in here. Could he be Cleverley's dad?

1355~~~
fecking hell I just realized Cleverley only has a year left on his contract. If he had 3 years or so I wouldn't expect us to get more then 5m, how the feck have we managed to get 9m for Tom Cleverley with just 1 year left on his contract?? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1356~~~
Alright, that was pretty funny. I am in fact, Cleverley's long lost father.

1357~~~
Same way we got 4m for Buttner. Honestly, though considering his exalted status as an England international this fee is par.

1358~~~
Yes but 1 year left on his contract you'd think hed go for a lot less. We got Kagawa for like 12m, van Persie for 24m and Madrid got kroos for 25m. The latter 2 are players who normally would go for 40m + but went for 15m less pretty much.

I'm not saying cleverley will never be worth that much, he'll probably become a very decent player, but after our history of selling players for ridiculously cheap, perhaps the most criticised one is being sold for more then he's worth at the moment. Just surprising really.

1359~~~
Jesus you're like a hysterical child, throwing a tantrum because the rest of the class didn't like your shit painting.
I'm more than entitled to be happy about absolute dross, finally leaving the club. I wouldn't mind so much if a player was just a bit crap, but tried his heart out and wasn't afraid to get stuck in or make something happen. I mean I quite like Darren Fletcher and at best, apart from a season or two, he's just an average player...but at least he has a pair of balls. Cleverley's lack of confidence on the ball and complete unwillingness to run at or try and boss the opposition midfield has been evident for some time, now and I'm fecked if I want a player like that taking up space at the club. That very scenario has been our downfall for far too many seasons now.

So, now you've been utterly bested by an utterly superior poster, which must be utterly embarrassing for you, so why don't you just quietly sneak off into utter obscurity.

1360~~~
I believe "Rekt" is the expression?

1361~~~
I am like a hysterical child throwing a tantrum?................. 
I have no idea what that means.

1362~~~
Exactly.

It's that feeling, somewhere between sheepishness and utter embarrassment, that you are feeling right now. Why? Because everyone can see that your argument has been torn to shreds and you've been made to look like an utter moron.

1363~~~
Whilst it's sad to see a local lad go, he's just not good enough, and I think he knew it. I don't agree with people saying that he didn't try, because I think he gave his all every time he played, the problem was that his all isn't that good. I think he was acutely aware of his general lack of ability compared to what was expected, which was reflected by him appearing to not want to play a forward pass or try and take someone on. He was scared of failing, and as such, was completely unambitious with pretty much everything he did on the pitch. I wish him well for his future. A fresh start might help him regain some confidence and he might start looking more like that creative centre mid we thought he was going to be.

1364~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
<a class="username" data-user="665, @Red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/665/">@Red</a> Pheonix Rising I think you are taking all the comments far too seriously.. Newly promoted I had the same problem/confusion. Just go with the flow, if someone is abusive or out of order towards any player etc, Mods will take care of it.

1365~~~
Sorry, but some guy on a forum making an absolute tool of himself isn't to high on my priority list. Nothing personal, if you don't like Cleveley and want to lash out and make silly (funny?) remarks about someone you'll probably never meet in your entire life then go ahead, you'll only look even more the tool. I think it's sad that you regularly watch a guy kick a ball around during the week and on a weekend and these are the emotions it conjures up.

If you want to call me a child and that I am throwing a tantrum then more power to you. Try not to do it before chucking a massive wobbly yourself next time.
Good to know. Genuine 'well, that is a rather grim existance' look on my face right now over that one. Thanks!

1366~~~
I apologise for laughing at him earlier but, let me explain...

I've seen Brian McClair go into midfield and do a better job then "TC23"
I've seen Lee Sharpe do a better job in midfield then "TC23"
I've seen Giggs, O Shea,Phil Neville, Johnson, to name a few, go into midfield and do better then "TC23"

Cleverley offers nothing in defence, nothing in attack, his "hollywood" 5 yard sideways passes mean jack shit. Even before "that" tackle, he wasn't very good. With the exception of the City CS game.

I wanted this guy to do well. I wanted him to be the first name on the team sheet, purely because he was "home grown" but he's utterly useless to us!.....Sounds harsh? But it's the truth!

And people going on about Kevin Davis:
1. We had Eric, Pally, Bruce, Stam, Keane, Robbo, Moran, McGrath, Irwin, Neville, Parker, Hughes, Ince, McClair, Johnson, even Alan Smith who used to kick people around the place

2. If Cleverley can't get over a tackle made 3 years ago, it says a lot about him

3. I don't hate the guy. I don't know him but, as a player, he is a coward! Only time I've ever seen him call for the ball was around 20 yards from our goal, he'd turn around and pass it back to said player who passed it to him...Arsenal last year, attacking in the final minute. 5 vs 4 in our favour, and he passes it back to Carrick. The one time I agreed with Moyes(watch his reaction) ....When I call him a coward, I remember on here, after the Munich game in 2010, 99% of people here called Carrick a coward for not blocking Robben's shot properly....What does that say about Cleverley

But funnily enough, I don't blame him....As I said in the MK Done thread, what the hell are our players learning at under age level?!

1367~~~
Nothing?... Nothing? I mean come on now - lets not rewrite history. It's almost as bad as the Fellaini thread in here.

1368~~~
A bit off topic, but taking a swipe at all the U21 teams is unfair. They have done well in recent times and a lot of the blame for the MK Dons game falls with the manager as well. We did the same vs Palace a few years ago under Fergie and got dumped out.

1369~~~
You're still doing it! 
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
This is amazing. It might be the best meltdown in weeks.

Most people know Cleverly is a bit shit and will be happy enough to see him go but you're acting like someone's run over your dog.
Just give up kid, white knighting all over young Tom just isn't doing you any favors and you're getting worked up over nothing.

Tell me, what does he offer? I'm Irish and I hate Glen Whelan with a passion but, he offers more then Cleverley

No that came across wrong...I listed all the academy players we've brought through over the last 30 years in the MK Dons thread..In the thread my point was, what the hell are the scouts doing at that level...And to be honest, I believe it's a fair question, what the hell is going on down there?

Since Fletch and O Shea, we've produced Januzaj and Pogba....That is awful for a team who prides itself on youth....But different topic, different thread. My bad

1371~~~
I still struggle to see any meltdown here apart from yours on the previous page. This whole 'meltdown' thing is very strange to me.

1372~~~
I see what you did there. Not bad...

1373~~~
If he sticks around on a for a free transfer, I imagine a tribunal would probably give us 3+ million or more, which probably isnt far of what Everton would try to low ball us with at the moment.

1374~~~
This might be a bit sensitive from me, but some of the 'celebration' on him leaving (which might still not happen) was over the top and a bit disrespectful. "Get the feck out" is a bit harsh on Tom. Yeah he won't see it, but I bet a load of people on Twitter or whatever will have done similar. He did play his part in the 2012/13 winning side and I think after all the criticism he has received deserves a, "he isn't good enough, but good luck to him". I know people will probably ridicule this post, but whatever.

1375~~~
One question that has not been asked enough here....

Why was he kept, put on big wages and Pogba wasn't?

I don't want a Pogba debate again (There's been enough) but, it's a fair question

1376~~~
Wow, are you okay? Look, just go have a cup of tea and a wee sit down. This madness can't be doing your BP any good at all.

1377~~~
Fair post....Nowt to ridicule nor should anyone ridicule people's opinions!

He deleted his Twitter btw awhile ago

1378~~~
Hold on, I thought tribunals were only for players who were 24 or younger? If Cleverley leaves for free next season, I think we will get nothing from it.

1379~~~

I feel like we're just covering old ground here but in the old scheme of things he would have been a classic central midfielder in the attacking role. Think Keane and Scholes, the attacking half of that. (Okay okay! It's a positional reference not talent and ability!) Now I think playing in that role at Watford he scored goals so it can be forgiven that it was the championship but it's something none the less. Wide left at Wigan he was actually pretty good with the quick release and get forward wing role that he played and he played more as a AM than a proper central player in the way I described it above.

Right now, I personally think that in this system he would benefit more playing as the AM/10 in this side. He doesn't have the defensive ability to be constantly dueling for the ball in deep areas then to break forward with short pass and move. Especially with a 10 he just ends up right beside the 10 waiting calling for the ball and usually the pass goes to the 10 instead of him. So in a system where the defensive position was reinforced and the load was taken off him and he was able to interact with a midfielder and go forward in that way (much like with Anderson) I think that would go a fair way to fixing him. Whether we have the time or the investment to go with that of course is out of his hands. He's not a regular 'main' squad player so building the system around him is moot, it won't happen. We've got too many 10's to move away from a proper string pulling 10 formation. In this day and age under stress and lacking confidence I just don't see him as an 8 without a midfield that takes the focus off him defending.

I suppose if we were to buy a 6 and put him there and play Herrera and Cleverley in front of him without a number 10 and Rooney dropping deep the way he does I think that could work potentially. I doubt it's going to happen though. The guy passes and shows for passes a lot, re-watch the Sunderland game and see just how many times he's stood there calling for the ball off Fletch even visibly getting the shits a few times that he's not played in. He fought for the ball a few times and won it as well, it must be tough in his situation.

I'm not and have never been saying he's a potential world beater but 'nothing' is harsh if you ask me. There is something there, just have to dig it out.
This is pretty much how I feel, the personal stuff means naught to me. Certain 'celebrationists' just make themselves look like idiots. It speaks for itself.

1383~~~
No. He used to be one of my fav players when in the youth/reserve side, and was considered be the big deal when he rang rings around Yaya in the Community Shield. It's just a shame that it didn't work out.

1384~~~
He's 25, we wouldn't get any fee at all if he left on a free. Has to be under 24 for that.

1385~~~
I don't feel sorry for Cleverley. He's a big boy on big boy wages. He'll be fine wherever he ends up at. I just hope its not at United.

1386~~~
Very well thought out post and points are made very well but, I disagree.

Tom Cleverley is not Manchester United quality..And except for that City CS game, I never thought he was

1387~~~
Good point, very well made

1388~~~
Big wages in relation to what? Is this the same argument as 'Felaini on big wages'?

1389~~~
Eh? Welbeck & Evans are regulars in the first team. Cleverley has been here longer than a lot of other academy products. Blackett and Wilson look here to stay. You can't have a class of 92 every generation. Chelsea and City don't really have anyone coming through their ranks and haven't for a while. Liverpool hadn't had anyone regular since Gerrard until Sterling came along. Aside from Arsenal, we're the only top side that have regularly had youngsters making it to their first team squad. Everton and Spurs have had a few, but they're not exactly top level.

There's even an argument for Rafael and Fabio. Pique and Rossi both spent time in the youth set up as 17 year olds. We signed Jones and Shaw as 19 year olds. Even when we've not produced them from our academy, we've definitely been far more willing to give youth a chance than other top sides in the PL. Arsenal are probably the only real rivals in this regard, and Wenger's probably been guilty of being over-reliant or over-confident in their ability to produce, hence Arsenal spending the last few years trophy-less and in 4th.

You only have to look around the PL, Championship and some of the other top flights to see how many of our products are having decent careers. The likes of Brady, Chester, James, Macheda, Daehli, Eikrem and Gibson are all carving out decent careers, as well as many others from years gone by.

1390~~~
We can disagree, I don't know about <i>your</i> Manchester United quality though, seems like it could mean anything. You could go through hundreds of imports and not ever find 'Manchester United quality' there. If he comes good, what then? 'Was never Manchester United quality' but a good player?

I don't think it's criminal to hope that he does a bit better than he's doing right now.

1391~~~
It doesn't bother me that some people are tickled pink that "TC23" is gone.  I was annoyed too when he seemed to go Hollywood on us.  I'm just sad that he never fulfilled the promise that he had before Davies took him down.  I'm not claiming Scholes or Iniesta promise, but just enough promise to be a solid regular for us for a long time while we rebuild a great squad around him.

But there's no doubt that Cleverley regressed and then kept regressing.  He had to go.  I understand the desire for some to party over this news.

1392~~~
Not about the class of 92 at all....Players like Bardsley, Richardson etc etc were always good enough to play premier league football. Not for us, but good footballers all the same....All the scouting and all the "we've signed such and such" over the last 4-5 years has been dross! That's my point! We used to produce premier league quality players at ease....Hasn't happened in God only knows. Januzaj is still young. It can go either way. Wilson looks a quality player though. Chap looks fearless 

In comparison to Tom Cleverley, I've seen Sharpe, McClair, Beckham, Johnson, Giggs, O Shea, Smith, Phill Neville and Fortune give better performances in midfield, then I have Tom Cleverley

1393~~~
I heard people say Richardson would be the next Ashley Cole and I myself thought Chris Eagles could have made it at United. I feel this is a pretty loose barometer to be running Cleverley through. Time is on his side at least, if he is awarded a new contract. From here I am not sure what else he can do in that regard. Not move, play his heart out this season and leave on a free.

1394~~~
Been on some Villa forums. Generally they aren't really happy with the buy, mostly due to the fee involved which they feel is to high.

1395~~~
Every single match, he plays like a youth player that got thrown into the first team due to a injury crisis.

1396~~~
My point is, these were all players played in midfield, completely out of position and out of their comfort zone and still done better then Cleverley....And he's a midfielder.

Lee Sharpe (Miss the guy) was an out and out winger! Could do a decent job at LB and was actually half decent in midfield....Still a better player then TC in that role.....Fortune, Neville. Same thing applies

1397~~~
So essentially we are ready to sell and he just has to choose from Villa, Everton and Hull?

1398~~~
I hear you. The old cliché 'the games gone n' changed'.

1399~~~
Game's gone mad

#Headsgone

1400~~~
I thought Sharpey started out as a fullback and converted.I miss him too. We could do with someone like him today.

1401~~~
They really didnt. We paid another £6+ million for Ashley Young in the same contract situation than we paid for Kagawa. It was such a coup

1402~~~
I don't really know whats happened in the last few pages. 

Just came in here to wish Tom good luck. I hope he can make something of himself. Maybe a bit of bollocking from Keano might push him. Always want our academy players to do well. What could have been. 

On a side note. It is worrying how little our academy players seem to progress. Pogba is the only player that I feel that came out of there that has 'made it'. I think a united B side is what is needed to get them ready for the PL. With the amount of pressure on united to win matches it is difficult to throw these young players in and give them the freedom to express themselves and learn on the job. Am I right in thinking (I don't get to watch a lot of youth football) that year on year united's youth seem to be the brightest in the country and yet very few achieve first team quality by the time they hit the ages of 20-21?

1403~~~
Not for us anyways. Olsen was there for awhile before Milne came in <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> ...Then came Danny Wallace....Then of course came Giggs.

Still stand by what I always said, if Sharpey had fulfilled anywhere near his potential, Beckham would not have got a look in. Says a lot about Sharpe that he was that good anyways

1404~~~
Football fans in general tend to overrate youth team players.

1405~~~
You can look at how Ramsey bas come back from his horrible injury, it's a matter of attitude.

1406~~~
Yes. They are both paid millions a year to play football. They can both do it away from OT because they are not good enough for United. Cleverley is a shit player and so is Fellaini. Good luck to both of them.

1407~~~
Good to see it looks like we are going to sell him this window. 8 million is fairly decent money as well considering everything. Hopefully he goes and does well there, as I do feel while he likely was never up to United's quality, that the slow pace of the midfield never helped him either. No real excuse for me largely regressing as a player over the last few years though.

1408~~~
Cute. Having a look around the papers it looks as though he earns 60k.. Which in the wage structure at United isn't really 'big wages' especially when Rooney earns 300k reportedly and the 'experienced' crop that just left us were all on reportedly over 100k pw. It seems 'big wages' is just being thrown about for any old salary when it fits the narrative.

1409~~~
So what's the latest on his proposed move? Is he going to reject the transfer and stay? I just get the niggling feeling that he might just do that.

Hope we include good clauses in his transfer deal if he leaves, still think there is a decent-good player in there somewhere. Still not United level though.

1410~~~
When compared to the average man on the streets Cleverley is one of the luckiest people alive to be in that pay bracket. 40, 50, 60 or whatever the hell he's earning is more than most of us will ever see in our lifetime.  I simply said he'll be fine regardless of where he ends up as long as he still has a career. You defend the guy from any sort of perceived criticism, it beggars belief.

1411~~~
Definitely an unintended byproduct of the sugar daddy ownership era (from Abramovich onwards). Our priorities have clearly changed in terms of needing very good players immediately rather than being able to gradually develop youth players into the first team at a time when the likes of Chelsea, City, PSG, Barca, Madrid, and others are literally buying their success through the purchase of outside players, usually at the expense of any youth development. This is the new reality that we are dealing with, and sadly it will probably mean less youth breaking through to the first team.

1412~~~
Even if you analyze how little our young players have progressed, its certainly not due to lack of opportunities. Cleverley had all the time in the world to establish himself as the first choice midfielder, Smalling, Rafael & Evans have got as much time to make a case for themselves in defense. The only players who can afford to complain about lack of opportunities are strikers like Rossi, Campbell, Macheda and now Welbeck but making it as a young striker at United has always been the toughest position.

1413~~~
Yes, but then it seems like cleverly had all the tools to make it (maybe not all). But he fails at the mental aspect. A stint in a B team where the game is physical but the expectations lower might have prepared him better. I had really high hopes for him, but over the last year and a bit I had honestly given up on him. Mentally he isn't there. 

Lets hope the next batch of young midfielders coming through our ranks can make the step up. It isn't like other young players aren't able to do it.

1414~~~
Yep, Clev has been very lucky in that we haven't really reinforced the midfield in years, which if you also factor in Fletch's illness, has given him a ridiculous amount of playing time that he would never have been afforded had Fergie opted to buy 2-3 years ago.

1415~~~
Legitimate criticism, sure but this is silliness. He's not even anywhere near the 'top earners' or 'big wage' players at United. I mean his next contract would probably even be sub 100k which still wouldn't dent the wage bill. This is just making up silliness to fit the stream of non sensical hate.

You've gotten angry about his earnings and then you've categorized them but you don't even know what they are categorized as?.. Seems pretty daft.

1416~~~
Gotten angry about his earnings? Jesus man you're obsessed! What part of that post even remotely suggests anger? I said he's a boy big earning big boy wages (nothing to do with how his wages compare to his fellow teammates) and that he'll find his feet wherever he lands, good luck to him! You're clutching at straws in this particular instance. Anything said here that doesn't favor Cleverley is percieved as hate in your eyes. Quote my original post about his wages and show me where you see the 'anger' and 'hate'. I don't hate the boy, but I hate him playing at United because like i've said, he's shit. Im unapologetic about that.

1417~~~
I'm kind of sad in a way - I really had high hopes for him since his spell at Watford which promises big things ahead for him. His breakthrough for us v.s Man City and the matches till the tackle by Davis got quite a lot of us excited. 

Excepted that he regressed and kept regressing. I hope he can resurrect his career at other clubs with less pressure. 

On the positive note, it might just mean that we will go from "TC23" to "Vidal23" <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1418~~~
Well you've just admitted you're upset about him playing at United and your 'big boy wages' comment was implying that he was effecting the wage bill in away that directly implicated his 'being shit'. I don't really go around telling everyone something or someone is shit when I am happy about a situation.

He just seems like such an inconsequential player to get this upset about. Desperate to tell everyone how shit he is and about how he's stealing a living playing for United etc..

1419~~~
17 new pages in 20 hours <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

All for getting rid of him! Great publicity generator.

1421~~~
Nail, head etc etc

1422~~~
Right, probably wrong. I thought It was for any players trained by the club under 24 years.

1423~~~
Seriously are people still blaming the Davies tackle? 

Poor excuse, if true. I've seen players get worse tackles and come back better than that. People need to accept him and Anderson weren't what they were hyped up to be back in 2011.

1424~~~
If it wasn't for the Davis & Pogatez tackles our midfield would have been sorted with 2 world class players.

Come on guys, he's really not good enough, and it will be even more obvious in a lesser side.

1425~~~
I don't think there will be a massive improvement on his performances. However, he is still a decent footballer and will be able to play more freely without the added pressure and expectation. I don't think he will be 'found out' or perform worse in a lesser side. He won't be a key player for Villa but he will be a good player for them.

1426~~~
You don't get it at all. My wages statement had NOTHING to do with the wage bill. Nothing. Let me make it easy for you. I basically said I don't feel sorry for him because he's a grown man living on very good wages, and he'll land on his feet no matter what club he ends up at, as long as it's not United because he's not good enough here. Good luck to him! How do you deduce from that statement that im being angry, hateful, or implying that he's a burden on our wage bill? Surely you're smarter than this man. I don't want to have to explain this shit again <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>.

1427~~~
Cleverley>Stephen Ireland

1428~~~
Is he leaving or what?

1429~~~
On big wages apparently.

1430~~~
This is probably an adequate summary.

1431~~~
I always thought there was probably something more to the TC23 thing than was sensationalised. I refuse to believe he was <i>that</i> naive about his level and it's appropriateness.

1432~~~
Bingo.

1433~~~
Good for him and for us also.

1434~~~
The only way a > mark is appropriate next to Cleverley is if he's on the right side of it.

1435~~~
Has it been confirmed that any bid has been accepted for him? 

Last thing I want tomorrow is another Fletcher-Cleverley midfield. Rather put Rooney back there.

1436~~~
This is overdue. Hopefully he can have a good career there, he couldn't stand the pressure of being a United midfielder and being told by thousands of fans week in week out how shite he is, which isn't easy to be fair. I guess he'll find his confidence back and be a good player for Villa, no way that's still possible with us.

That probably means we've at least one midfield signing lined up. Wouldn't mind if Pearson, Rothwell or Powell got a few chances though.

1437~~~
I think Rooney is crap in midfield but he'd still be a better option there than Fletcher-Cleverly.

It's all gone a bit quiet on this, starting to worry it's not happening.

1438~~~
So what happened with the bid then, Was it all bollocks? I've not seen anybody reporting it yet. Sky don't even have it on their rumour section yet.

1439~~~
Don't be so impatient. Telegraph reported yesterday evening that we accepted the 8M bid.

1440~~~
Good I was getting worried for a second, the thought of us not getting rid scared me.

1441~~~
Of course. But I think Van Gaal's words were clear too. Although he obviously didn't mention any names Cleverley is one of the first ones the fans want to see leaving and he really didn't show anything encouraging so far, not even in pre-season, so it all makes sense, there are also other clubs rumoured to be interested. Only possibility of this not happening will be Cleverley running down his contract at United, because he wouldn't get that much money anywhere else, but I think he'll think about his career and decide that he's better off at another club. I think a part of him will be relieved too, although he loves United, he just didn't stand the pressure.

1442~~~
Correct decision to sell him, he is average in every way, technically very limited and mentally weak the only suprise is a team like villa are willing to pay so much for him.  I have always thought he was at risk of going this window because of his contract situation and the fact he was the third choice midfielder in pre season. Good luck to him but I would not be shocked if he struggles to hold down a place at villa.

1443~~~
Breaking on SSN: Valencia make a bid for Tom Cleverley.

1444~~~
Are you winding us up?

1445~~~
Nah it's on the yellow news ticker at the bottom as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1446~~~
He should go to Spain, be great for him and for England.

1447~~~
Holy shit just looked, it's true. He'd get applauded in Spain.

1448~~~
Seeing as their was a petition to ban him from playing for England, an overseas move might suit him.

Hope he does well. He always looked like he could have potential, but it just never worked out at United. Definitely time for him to move on.

1449~~~

1450~~~
needs a side with feckall pressure, to slowly rebuild his shattered confidence. his wifey will enjoy spain as well.

1451~~~
That could be a great move for him.

1452~~~
Valencia wanna buy all our supposed outcasts or what ?

Peter Lim, didn't he run United bars or something as well ? And Jorge Mendes and Gestitufe have some involvement there as well IIRC. Curious. <a class="username" data-user="21825, @Ekeke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21825/">@Ekeke</a> ? 


Could be a interesting move for him.

1453~~~
So he has offers from Hull, Aston villa and Valencia not a very easy decision is it. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1454~~~
Everton are apparently interested as well.

Though not sure they can afford him now though or need him.

1455~~~
I actually think he will do well for Everton or Valenica in their possession oriented system and his confidence will increase due to it, but in a side like Hull and Villa he will decline even further, his confidence is already shot, and him going to defend and see very less of the ball, And defending and positioning isn't one of his strengths so obviously he will find it hard.

1456~~~
I think any kinda of scenery change will help Cleverley play better football.

1457~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

My United supporting mate lives in Valencia. I texted him yesterday that Cleverley looks to be going to Villa to which he replied "good riddance". Can't wait to let him know about this development.

1458~~~
Valencia would be a great move...I wonder if Cleverly will be grave and move to Spain!

1459~~~
True that, i think that online petition was it, from England fans to not select him in the England world cup squad was pretty bad from him, must have been horrible for the guy.

1460~~~
Yeah it's one thing to not like the player, to not rate him at all but to be mean and cnutish like that is something else. I'll never understand people taking things way too personally.

1461~~~
If he goes to Valencia at least he's playing in a country that will appreciate his brand of football.

1462~~~
You just know he'll go to Villa instead of Valencia. British players like Tom need to venture out. A great club with European football wants him, he should take it.

1463~~~
He's good at keeping things ticking without having the cutting edge to make the final pass or score the goal... But I think that will suit the Spanish style somewhat. Would be a great move and great experience for him if he gets that move. At least there's a lot of interest, so he's definitely going to move this weekend. 

Thought Villa was a done deal though!

1464~~~
All of the criticism from the media, fans of other clubs and even us has made him quite underrated.  He possesses good ability and he is still only young.  I genuinely hope he gets a good move and proves a lot of people wrong.  I would love to see him at Valencia, the little guy would get a lot of protection from referees over there and the the extra time on the ball would allow him to play his football to much greater effect.  He was better when he played with Scholes as Scholes would have 3 midfield players pressing him and Cleverley would have 20 yards of space.

1465~~~
What is his brand of football?

1466~~~
It's not like every single team in Spain plays a slow, possession based system where they bore teams into conceding. Valencia sure as hell don't.

1467~~~
Pass and move. Detractors will call it unambitious 5 yard side-ways or backwards passing, supporters will call it recycling possession and keeping things ticking.

1468~~~
Unless Everton come in for him, somewhere where he probably won't even start, Valencia would be a good move for him. Would like to see more English players abroad.

1469~~~
Valencia aren't a pass and move side and frankly I don't see Cleverley as that type of player.

1470~~~
Exactly.

I'm really not sure why so many people are claiming he'll 'suit the Spanish style'. What style? The national team style which is full of far superior players?

Most La Liga teams play nothing like that.

1471~~~
They're still in the top 25% of teams in La Liga in terms of keeping possession and passing accuracy...

1472~~~
I have no idea how they play, but I know many people who have the impression that every team in Spain plays that way.

1473~~~
Before you guys get overly sanctimonious on why Cleverly couldn't possibly be a fit for Valencia, my comments on "appreciating his brand of football" is more of a tongue in cheek comment based on what Tom said in a previous interview:

1474~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I imagine basically everyone in here who's said 'he'll suit the Spanish style' hasn't seen them play either.
They are, but they're not a 'sideways passing team' like some are suggesting. They're creative. Cleverley isn't.

1475~~~
Yeah but what players do that as their only function. Clev doesn't specialize in a defensive capacity or an attacking capacity. I can't think of any players who will be particularly valued who's only contribution is the pure recycling of possession, it's a good trait to have but it can't be what your whole game is about. Particularly as in Clevs case a lot of the times he does this a better or at least a more confident player could keep the ball but keep the momentum as well.

1476~~~
For it to be "pass an move", Cleverley needs to actually move after making that pass. He doesn't. He resembles a pudding once passes it.

1477~~~
Anyway, Cleverley should bite Valencia's arm off for a move there. One of the most beautiful cities in Europe, a fantastic stadium (or 2) and regular European football prospects.

1478~~~
Arsenal and Everton are interested apparently too. 

We could get £15m with all this interest.

1479~~~
We should just offer Valencia all our outcasts for a combined, lower fee.

1480~~~
Have any of the Manchester based journos said anything on the Valencia bid or is it just SSN?

1481~~~
Nah. Should offer Kagawa as a sweetener for Hummels or Reus next year. Hernandez for Vidal maybe.

1482~~~
It's precisely what makes him so limited - his skillset is confined to short range unambitious passing. Cannot pick a pass, cannot tackle, poor ball control, cannot beat a man, cannot shoot, cannot head the ball. He's a wall and one that can't play a decent wall pass.

1483~~~
We won't sign Reus now that we have Di Maria and Vidal isn't leaving. Hummels is a possibility but I'd wager there's probably half a dozen sides that he'll probably move to instead of us at the moment.

1484~~~
Interest from Hull, Villa, Everton and Valencia? The price should go up, at least £15m. Other clubs sell crap player for more so we should do as well.

I know what you are saying and I agree with you. The Cleverly that just broke through to the 1st team looks quite a player, finally looking to seize his opportunity in the 1st team after years of patiently waiting and going on loan. His linking up play was excellent, and he brought other players into the game with his quick passing especially in the attacking areas of the pitch.

Unfortunately he has regressed, and has kept regressing. He became a parody of himself, often passing purely for the sake of it, even when not under any obvious pressure from opposition players. 

I would be very happy for him to make a move to a club where he gets less pressure, scrutiny, and basically be left alone to rebuild his career. A Cleverly in full flow like he did 2 years ago before the tackle from Davis could be breathtaking at times, unfortunately his time with us is over.

1486~~~
Cleverley has loads of qualities that suit the Spanish style. I especially love when he shouts out and holds his hand up to his teammate 5 yards away to pass the ball as if he has some master plan for it, and then when we receives it he passes it backwards/side-wards another 5 yards. That's all those Spanish teams do, it's a wonder they score anything other than own goals, quite frankly.

1487~~~
He's 25 and he possesses barely any ability whatsoever. To prove a lot of people wrong he'd have to develop hitherto unseen skills and also hitherto unseen balls. He'll never develop either.

Five minute Youtube videos, definitive proof of how good/bad a player is.

EDIT: Christ, not even five minutes, he's rubbish!

1490~~~
I'm glad people actually watch games rather than crappy YouTube compilations.

1491~~~
That's right. That's how you judge a player these days as opposed to watching him put him full match performances over the course of a couple of years.

Everyone looks good on youtube pal.

1492~~~
and then his overhit cross against Newcastle <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yes, he has some good moments but they are too rare, he is just frustrating to watch most of the time.

1493~~~
Blimey, they're queueing up and falling over themselves.  Even Woody can't lash this up.

1494~~~
Is this some kind of joke?. Why are so many clubs in for him even at that price. Surely it has to be a Windup.

1495~~~
I would love to see him in Spain. It would be interesting to say the least. If I was him I would jump at the chance to play for a Spanish club like Valencia. Its a great opportunity for him. I've always thought of Clevz as a bit of a Spanish type player as opposed to a typical English midfielder. He could do well over there imo.

1496~~~
Lol... you sound a little bitter.  Whilst I am not happy with his performances for United in the last year or so, I don't let it blind me.  I've watched him closely at youth level then reserve level and finally in the first team and I know he possesses good ability in terms of passing and vision.  He is just not showing it.  I don't think he is good enough to be playing in United's strongest 11 but he is a good Premier League midfielder and has yet to hit his peak.  25 in football terms is young enough to kick-start his career elsewhere. 

People were calling Ramsey useless 3 years ago.  Fickle.

1497~~~
The "useless" Ramsey still demonstrated far more talent coming back from a crippling leg break than Cleverley has ever shown. It's not fickle to say that someone who's barely been decent for more than a year and a half (and was never that good when he was "good") is a poor player, and should be nowhere near Manchester United.

1498~~~
He's obviously a better player than he's shown in the last couple of seasons and miles better than he's being portrayed in this thread. Which is why we have at least two other top clubs willing to pay reasonable money for him. The footballer being described in most of the posts in this thread would be doing well to scrape a living in League 2.

I can see him doing quite well as part of a more fluent midfield unit. It's a pity he won't get that chance at United but if Van Gaal can't see a place for him in our squad then so be it. It's understandable, too, as he won't have followed the early parts of Cleverley's career when he was playing for teams that were less dysfunctional than United in the recent past.

1499~~~
<a class="username" data-user="53037, @ralph250" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/53037/">@ralph250</a> sent me this <a class="externalLink" href="http://news.playup.com/articles/3086401-cleverley-does-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://news.playup.com/articles/3086401-cleverley-does-it</a>

Apparently Mitten has said he is going to run down his contract.

1500~~~
You don't forget how to play football after a leg break, if physically able to, he was always going to return from injury.  I think it is fickle to jump on Cleverley's back when he has demonstrated good form in a United shirt in the past.  Players don't lose ability.  Not at 25 years of age.  Let me reiterate I don't think he is good enough for United.  But to say he has "barely any ability whatsoever" is a bit over the top, as is the constant criticism he receives.  He's a good player out of form, with no confidence.

1501~~~
Valencia <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Making a bid for Cleverley about sums up their transfer activity

1502~~~
That's a perfectly reasonable point, it's easier to play well in a confident well-functioning team.  Or his early promise might have been initial enthusiasm at breaking through and he couldn't sustain it.  Don't think it's arguable that he has deteriorated quite alarmingly.  I'd be trying to convince him that a change of scene could be highly beneficial I'm afraid.

1503~~~
I'm just happy we'd get anything for him. Not a great player and I can see him running down his contract, if he doesn't get his Everton move.

1504~~~
I think he will choose Villa.

1505~~~
Preventing them from recouping 8-9 million so he can sit on his arse for a year is a shithouse move.

1506~~~
It depends! If United are not letting him go to Everton because they see them as competition for top 4, then Cleverley has every right to refuse Villa and instead wait for a better team and especially a better manager, who also happens to know and rate him.

1507~~~

Sky article.

1508~~~
I really don't think we'd stop him going there. If it's a case of getting 8m or nothing, then we'd sell him to anyone.

1509~~~
Unambitious. True to form, TC23.

1510~~~
He should jump at the chance of playing in Valencia. Beautiful city and a good team.

1511~~~
He will probably reject them all and say he wants to fight for his place here.

1512~~~
I wouldn't be surprised.

1513~~~
Please let it be so!

1514~~~
There would be absolutely nothing wrong with that. Providing he puts in 100%.

1515~~~
As crap as he is it's not wise to sell our cms with not buying any... Sure our midfield is crap right now but if we dont bring anyone and let Cleverley and Fellaini go for instance we'll have to play januzaj and similar in those positions. I just hope we're bringing somene, carvalho, vidal or someone 3rd.

1516~~~
Unambitious? Because he want to play for a better club than Villa?

1517~~~
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">Valencia would sit him so much more than West Ham.</span>

1518~~~
Are we missing something here? .Seems to be in demand.

1519~~~
His choice. If he doesn't want to go he doesn't have to but sounds like United want him sold. Get him loaned to Villa or some such ffs just anywhere whilst he runs his contract down.

1520~~~
That's his level.

1521~~~
This is regular England international and Premier League winner Tom Cleverley we're talking about here!

(Shush now...)

1522~~~
I'm thinking this transfer is on hold, pending a new midfield arrival. We'd be crazy to let him go otherwise.

Not sure what prompts all the vitriol, or the glee at the prospect of him leaving.

1523~~~
Jackson says he's on £30k/week. He's on low wages for a United player so plenty of clubs will be able to meet his wage demands I would imagine unlike many of our players.

1524~~~
Antonio ?

1525~~~
People seem to be suggesting his form has dropped off but bar a couple of games early on he's never shown enough ability consistently.
End of the day he's just been taking games away from other youth prospects who deserve a 10th of the chance Cleverly has been given

1526~~~
Unrealistic, then? Obviously very different to being unambitious.

1527~~~
Big boy wages.

1528~~~
That's revising history a bit. There was a long period in 11/12 from November through to around February that he formed a partnership with Carrick and we benefited from the stability they both gave us. It was a bod standard 2 man midfield and it worked well.


EDIT - It was 2010/11

1529~~~
Really wouldnt. 

Parejo and Fuego are much better players and they signed Andre Gomes this summer. He'd have a job on starting at Villa, he wont be at Valencia

1530~~~
Was that the run that ended when some massive cnut from Bolton (Kevin Davies?) did a number on him?

1531~~~
I'd be interested to see him at Valencia. If nothing else than to test the hypothesis that "In spain, this type of player is much more appreciated" (I think it may even have been Cleverley talking about himself who said that).

1532~~~
No that was when him and Anderson played well together for a month I believe?

1533~~~
That was with Anderson at the start of the season.

1534~~~
He did, and if he went to play for Espanyol or someone he might be right. 

But you have to actually do it well if you want to be a starter at one of the better spanish teams not the midtable ones. Both Parejo and Fuego pass the ball, sideways or otherwise, better than Cleverley does. And Andre Gomes hasnt played enough games to know whether he does as well.

They just sold Banega to Sevilla on the cheap and he passes the ball a million miles better than Cleverley does.

1535~~~
I was actually wrong again, it was 2012/13 season that he played regularly with Carrick. It was around the time that his stock had gone down and he came in alongside Carrick and we really got into a rhythm although he obviously wasn't spectacular, he and the team were consistent. As said above that was in 11/12 around October time and he never got going again that season.

1536~~~
Nah, Carrick was amazing that season. Cleverley was alright, I recall Carrick carrying him through games quite a bit. I mean, for large portions of that season he was basically a lone midfielder. It's quite insane how good Carrick was, all things considered.

1537~~~
That 'run' with Anderson was three games....

All he did for that, and the run with Carrick was offer a body in midfield whilst his partner was in great form.

That's what he is, a body, so we don't have to play with 10 men, not much else. Like a generic player on Pro Evo in a team that you get rid of when you patch the game.

1538~~~
This is almost as exciting as an incoming transfer thread, come on TC23 feck off already F5 F5 F5

1539~~~
I don't disagree, I pretty much said as much. He wasn't spectacular but he provided Carrick a partner and was consistent. It's an exaggeration to say Carrick did it alone though, Cleverley facilitated him which is quite funny really because it made Cleverley a facilitator for our main facilitator which pretty much describes everyone's issue with Cleverley.

1540~~~
So how many decent games in total do we think he's had then?

Who wants to open the bidding?  60 apps approx is the total according to soccerbase

Do I hear 15?

10 then?


It's not a lot wherever the bar gets set, for me.

1541~~~
Jebus, listening to some of you you'd think we have a league two player in our ranks.

People are forgetting he was a youth prospect deemed good enough to be promoted to our first team (back when we were dominating English and European football) and one that's played a considerable number of times in our title winning seasons. Granted, SAF's neglect of midfield but have helped him with that, but it hardly means he's an awful player.

The offers he's receiving shouldn't come as a surprise, its just not worked out for him here and there's no shame in that.

1542~~~
This transfer is on par with us getting Di Maria.

1543~~~
Wow Cleverley, Anderson and Kagawa on the way out.  Good times !

1544~~~
Who is taking Anderson? I expected him to remain here until the end of his contract due to lack of takers.

In general I agree that we really aren't in a position to start axing central-midfielders. After the six years that Sir Alex refused to buy a senior central-midfielder, and with Carrick, Herrera and Fellaini injured then our weakest area is looking even weaker than ever before moving on Cleverley and Anderson.

Disappointing that Cleverley hasn't worked out, but probably best for him as a player to move on. If he really has the chance to play in Spain then I'd definitely take it in his position, but my guess is the money on offer here will be better than in Spain at the level being discussed. Also disappointing if he does plan to run-down his contract and leave on a free, but after the Fryers situation then I suppose it shouldn't be a surprise if our youth prospects decide to screw the club for their own benefit - just the way the sport is in England I suppose.

1545~~~
Very harsh on Tom in this thread. I think he could find himself again at a club like Everton or Villa. Clearly there are a few managers out there who think they can do something with him.

1546~~~
Of course it's harsh, he's the United whipping boy. Some idiot claimed that no big teams would be interested in him and yet it seems he has a host of suitors after his signature. He's a good player needing confidence and a fresh start away from negative influences. If Valencia has gone in for him then that's the club he should be moving too unless Everton/Arsenal make bids.

1547~~~
I'd go play under Roy Keane at Villa if I was him

1548~~~
I wouldn't go near Villa at all. They're relegation fodder, also many of the England fans have already made their minds up that Cleverley is shit, so why would he move to Villa and start with negative attitude from the fans? He'd be best to go to Valencia imo and have a completely fresh start. He'll excel in Spain anyway.

1549~~~
Cleverly only earns £30,000 a week which is less than Young's £120k a week. I wouldn't mind keeping him here.

1550~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously though what the teams like Valencia see in him, I'll never know. But then I'd prefer to rid of Young/Anderson/Nani/Fellaini completely before even thinking of selling Cleverley.

1551~~~
I wonder how he copes, do you think his wage gets topped up with tax credits?

1552~~~

1553~~~
If the greedy fecker does that then don't loan him. Let him rot in the reserves. 

We'd be losing £8m if he does that.

1554~~~
Yesterday it was 9m, earlier today 8m, now 7m..... Geez, eventually he'll go for a can of coke and a pack of skittles.

1555~~~
Would still be fantastic.

1556~~~
I dont think hes greedy for wanting to do that. But it does raise the question of who he thinks will come in for him if he was available on a free - I don't think any top 5 PL or top foreign side would, which makes me think if hes that deluded or wants a move to Tottenham.
I think it was £9m including addons.

1557~~~
I bet City would try and sign him if he went on a free. He'll make up the numbers for their home grown quota and they know it'll piss us off, which they love doing.

1558~~~
Silly boy if he picks Villa over Valencia. Typical British player

1559~~~
Surely Villa would offer more than Valencia right?

1560~~~
I'd snap Valencia's hand off to play there if money wasn't in the equation. He reckons he's rated in Spain due to similar styles of play, great club, great league, go and show it. Only problem is they're broke. Willing to bet Villa have offered by far bigger wages.

1561~~~
Are they broke? I'm not entirely sure what the new owner has invested or how rich he is.

1562~~~
Haven't kept up with their struggles, but last thing i remember their stadium was at risk and they'd just sold Villa, Silva, Mata and anyone else decent to ensure they didn't go bust.

1563~~~
They aren't broke, they have Lim & Jorge Mendes sorting them out. He'd only be a bench player there anyway though.

1564~~~
They were bought by Peter Lim who is apparently worth $2.5b.. not the richest owner about but they have spent some money this summer.

1565~~~
Think they've made a profit though considering they haven't directly paid for Rodrigo so yeah it wouldn't be a surprise if they fork out an extra £20m or so yet, however it's more likely to all go on Enzo Perez than some of it on Cleverley.

1566~~~
Fair enough then, glad to hear it.

1567~~~
Given we finished 7th last year, with him "contributing", it would be strange if he was turning his nose up at Villa (or Valencia of course). Along with Newcastle, Villa are the biggest club outside the top 7 in the premier league. If he waits a year to become a free agent, I can't see how he will become more marketable after a year on the bench. But, after setting up TC23 and implicitly claiming he would be applauded in Spain, maybe self-awareness is not his strongest point.

1568~~~
They're not the best though, far from it, so I doubt he'd really be arsed about them having been good years ago when they're more likely to be in a relegation scrap all season.

1569~~~
He'd be crazy to turn down Valencia. With the recent English fan campaign to stop him playing for England the Villa fans will be horrified they are buying him. Far better to start afresh abroad...

1570~~~
They'd clap at his sideways passing over there in Valencia

1571~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1572~~~
They've blatantly asked Jorge Mendes if they can just pretend Valencia are trying to buy Hernandez, Cleverley & Kagawa so we can get other teams to show some interest.

1573~~~
Well for all the stick Cleverley is getting for his comments regarding football in Spain, maybe it was Martinez who told him that and Cleverley is only repeating it? Martinez went as far as saying that there are not many players in England who look like they could have brought up in Spain, France or Holland, but Cleverley is one of those. 
Of course Cleverley hasn't shown this for a long while now but I do rate Martinez and if he says it then there must be some truth in it:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/06/roberto-martinez-tom-cleverley-england" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/06/roberto-martinez-tom-cleverley-england</a>

1574~~~
But most teams below 7th are in some kind of relegation battle in so far as survival is the only real aim. Putting Valencia to one side, I can't imagine Everton would really be interested in him as a first XI player when they have Barkley coming through.

1575~~~
Him and Kagawa were not in training.

1576~~~
Don't forget Nani

1577~~~
I didn't see him at all in the training pictures.

1578~~~
I thought Cleverley said what he said about Spain based on what he saw for himself watching La Liga. Just on memory without looking up the actual quotes I think I remember him saying that.

1579~~~
A bidding war for Cleverley <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

1580~~~
Couldn't agree more. He really should jump at the chance to join Valencia if its true they've bid.
Good post. The exaggeration over how shit he is one here has gone so far overboard. I reckon he will do well at a club preferably who play a midfield three, where he would be first choice every week.

1581~~~
With respect to Valencia over Villa the other factor will be his wife and if he has kids which I cant remember. If he stays and goes to Villa that would be a factor while many would simply think it would be a lack of ambition.

Also the exaggeration of how shit he is just indicates to me how many have absolutely no clue about why a footballer is any good or not.  I sometimes end up defending him not because I think he is right for us but because so many of the criticisms are simply inaccurate.

I dont think he is right for us because what we really need is a CM who is capable of also running at defenders with the ball at his feet.

 His main strength is that he is really good at keeping the ball moving and unfortunately so many of his critics simply dont understand why that is a valuable asset and also simply dont understand when its happening or the indicators to show whats going on.

However we dont need a player who's main attribute is keeping the ball speed up, we need a CM who can both pass and run with the ball.

I hope wherever he goes he does really well. He has been nailed with criticism that far exceeds what he has deserved and is also so often wildly inaccurate and based on a mixture of ignorance and mob mentality at times.

1582~~~
Shouldn't that be the absolute bare minimum for a midfielder? Can you name a midfielder who is considered a good midfielder but is not so good at 'keeping the ball moving'?

1583~~~
OK, he is actually better than most at this, the problem is that we really need a CM who can run with the ball as well and take defenders on with the ball. Thats his weakness. His ability to keep the ball moving is very good. There are tons of CM's who are not as effective at circulating the ball, fecking hell if you cant see the CM's we already have who dont do it as well no wonder people are confused. .

1584~~~
Down to Tom now, obviously been told he can go, but by all accounts if he stays and sees out his contract his signing on fee next season will be big, so it's just where he priorities lie, less money and play, or more money and don't play first team games for 12 months (or many anyway).

Reckon he'll go personally.

1585~~~
Apparently reports in Spain have nothing about Valencia being interested

1586~~~
I think he has a baby. I'm sure his girlfriend will cope. Spain is hardly on the other side of the world. Most of the foreign footballers here have families, as did Beckham when he moved to Spain, and Bale has a partner and a baby. It shouldn't be an excuse to step out of his comfort zone (like a lot of English footballers tend to do) for the betterment of his career. 

I agree with the rest of your post. He was a scapegoat for our poor play and poor results. It all seemed to be Cleverley's fault, even when there were far worse performers on the pitch. I wont pretend he was fantastic, no-one has been over this past year or so, but he's nowhere near as bad as people on here make out.

1587~~~
This is an assumption that I dont think can be made so simply.

He is a product of our own setup and so will might simply want to be a success here. If he doesnt go there is a chance that he simply wants to fight on and see if he can make the grade under LVG.

The thing people forget when assuming players simply go when and where they can make the most money is just how incredibly hard they will have worked to get to be a pro player at one of the biggest clubs in the world. To get there in the first place will have taken from a very young age a massive amount of determination, mental strength, hard work and countless hours of dedication. Those sorts of things are the make up of people who are driven by ambition rather than money in most cases. The fact he is still on an incentive based, low base wage compared to most of the rest of the squad indicates to me that maybe he is driven by ambition.
 As it is 30k a week means that money in the bigger scheme of things isnt a problem for him, he is already a wealthy young man.

I think he needs to move on for his own sake anyway, he isnt what we need and he needs a change of scenery to move forward anyway.

1588~~~
Sure it shouldnt be an excuse but anyone with a family will understand that different people operate with different priorities. Just because we as fans think he should move somewhere ambitious doesnt mean his priority might not be wife, family and the surrounding support networks of family being close at hand. Family pressures arent an excuse, they are a reality.

1589~~~
If we had the league cup, and or europe then yes he might get another chance, but we are playing so few games this season that I would doubt he would get much of a chance to play, and unless he gets a run of games it's not really fair on him to show his best.

1590~~~
Neither of us even know his exact family situation so it's pointless talking hypothetically. We don't know if family 'pressures' even exist in his case.

1591~~~
Yeah thats the point I am not making very well. People will slag him off if he doesnt go to a possible offer from Valencia because they perceive it as a lack of ambition or holding out for a money payout on a free transfer. However other priorities which are perfectly reasonable might also be a reason.

1592~~~
Yep,
 which is one of the reasons why he should move on, he needs to go somewhere that needs his type of player and allows him to be at his best.

1593~~~
You know what is funny about all of the transfer talks with Cleverley? I said a few days ago that it would be quite something if Cleverley meets Roy Keane as a member of Aston Villa. If that ends up being the case, I can't wait to see the result.<img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

1594~~~
Apparently they 
Apparently they have met in the last day or so.

1595~~~
I should also add "enduring Keano on the training pitch and during matches".<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1596~~~
Why?, would it be a problem?.

1597~~~
Well for this instance, I would like to see how it goes when the softest midfielder he had in years has to endure the wrath from the person regarded as the hardest player we ever had... considering that Keano nailed everybody in his way when something or someone was out of his line.

1598~~~
You dont think it is possible that Lambert and Keane want Cleverley for Cleverleys strengths?. If they wanted a hard arse tackler they wouldnt be going in for Cleverley would they?
You dont think Keane is capable of more than just one element of his playing personality?

1599~~~
Of course not!! Sideways Tom doesn't offer anything. 22 league appearances last season and in everyone of those games he was the single reason why the other 10 players on the pitch failed. It's clear United are paying these clubs to take him from us. Wouldn't be surprised if the club he joins goes into administration and ceases to exist because of him.

1600~~~
Ha!

1601~~~
Keano isn't known for tolerating shite.

1602~~~
Its his main talent, but he's regressed considerably in terms of passing with any real ambition beyond retaining possession, and he was never the most expansive player to begin with. IMO its not so much that he's stylistically wrong for us as that he's too limited to merit a regular place in <i>any</i> top side.

1603~~~
They exist for everybody. This isn't a hypothetical, the extent of the pressure is hypothetical. No fan in their right mind should be upset at a player for not wanting to uproot his entire family for a move.

1604~~~
So the mirror are reporting he'd rather go on loan. I hope we tell him to feck off.

1605~~~
His style of play might suit Spanish football but I'd say players like him are a dime a dozen in Spain. Similar to what Guardiola said of Wilshere and Barcelona graduates from La Maria.

1606~~~
Stay classy.

1607~~~
I will. Rather you know the club get money to recoup from him rather than him going on a free.

1608~~~
Loaning him would be pointless. Just sell him.

1609~~~
Oh feck off with your loan move Tom, your're shite and we don't want ya.

Leave your girlfriend though, we can throw her in with 200k/week to coax Vidal.

1610~~~
Plus Keane as a player and a manager is most frustrated about losing possession. As long as Cleverley is effective with the ball I am sure he will not have a major issue with him.

1611~~~
This. Don't think we should be even offering a loan as an option for any of the players we want rid of, unless we really can't shift them permanently.

1612~~~

At Cleverley's level it's probably a penny for three!

1614~~~
It would better to keep him here for depth instead of loaning him out.

1615~~~
If there really was a bid then I'm sure he will be sold in the next few days. No point in sending him on loan, might as well buy his contract.

1616~~~
A bit worse than pointless. He's got a year left on his contract - loan him out and he can walk next summer for free, pocketing a very nice signing on fee to sweeten the deal.

The guy's got more balls at the negotiating table than on the field. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1617~~~
Exactly, whilst we lose £8m. 

Tell him to move or sit in the reserves.

1618~~~
I suppose its surprising to find out he has any at all.

1619~~~
Eh wtf? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1620~~~
We all know she was a bonus from United when we thought he was gonna turn out like Wilshere (before the leg break) <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

1621~~~
<a class="username" data-user="90268, @Red Phoenix Rising" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90268/">@Red Phoenix Rising</a> will defend Cleverley to the death. I hope he fvcks off to Villa but its unlikely now isn't it? Stuck with him. Bummer.

1622~~~
Yeah, it's mad just how obsessed he is about not wanting anyone to have a negative opinion of him. I think he might be a relative. I'd say it was Cleverley himself but RPR seems to be fairly intelligent and I reckon Cleverley would be thick as pig shit.

1623~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1624~~~
Yes, lets all get together and say silly things and laugh at each other. That's what the bestest fans do. Tell players to feck off and call them shit every chance they get. 

Rather juvenile.

1625~~~
How old are you? So uptight my man. Some of us call a spade a spade. Do you rate every player on our team? What do you think of Anderson huh?

1626~~~
He can feck off. He's shit.

1627~~~
You're just being juvenile. Anderson deserves respect!

1628~~~
There's a difference between constructive criticism and just being a bunch of arseholes

1629~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You are the most hysterical, highly strung, bunny boiler currently on the forums. That is some achievement.
Supporting any and every player who wears the shirt, regardless of talent, effort or performances, doesn't make you a good fan or a better person or give you any sort of moral high ground.

If I, or anyone else, thinks a player is shite and wants them to leave the club on that basis then you've no right whatsoever to constantly project your over sensitive, extremely over protective views, without being ridiculed.

So you can keep going and keep getting the piss taken out of your....or accept that people are allowed different opinions and move on.

1630~~~
<a class="username" data-user="90268, @Red Phoenix Rising" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90268/">@Red Phoenix Rising</a> what compels you to stick up for our Tom so much? He's shit. We've all seen it. We should just grab the £8/9million and run. Admit it. It'll make you feel much better, I promise.

1631~~~
Calling a player who has far from justified his wages and hasn't turned up since the 8-2 vs Arsenal, shit, isn't juvenile though.

Cleverley has overstayed his welcome I'm afraid. I would've loved for him to use his beginning of 11/12 form as a platform to succeed, but it's not going to happen, at least at United.

1632~~~
I'm not even sticking up for him. There is saying he's in a bad way at the moment and then there is just genuine rubbish like 'he's shit, always been shit, never been a good player' I mean come on. It's not even constructive anymore. It's just become some weird scene type thing to be in the thread talking codshit about Cleverley and have a laugh with each other. 

The jokes I can handle, fair play on that some witty criticism but the abuse is just bizarre and I don't understand it, that is more the point here than sticking up for Cleverley. He's just such an insignificant player to garner this much negativity.

1633~~~
To be fair, you could probably count the United players who have justified their wages on one hand.

1634~~~
Maybe he's been playing shit because United don't know how to use him. He was excellent before joining the team and a full England international. You build systems around the talents of your players, and you don't shoehorn players into a system that doesn't work for them. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Tom Cleverley thrive at another team. Time will tell, I suppose. Good luck to him, wherever he lands.

1635~~~
You need to get a grip.

I rather the club get £8m for him rather than walking on a free.

1636~~~
I admit his confidence must've taken a massive knock after being made a scapegoat and his own fans taking the piss, but he's never had pure quality. He was decent at Wigan, but that doesn't show much at all. His shooting and passing technique is woeful, too.

1637~~~
I agree that it's also to do with a lack of confidence. His passing used to be stellar.

1638~~~
What is it about Tom Cleverley that brings out a nasty side of our fans?

I mean fair enough he hasn't met our expectations, but he wouldn't be the first nor last to not make it here. The vitriol here is pathetic.

1639~~~
Good Lord, need to watch a few Michael Laudrup clips to get over that.

1640~~~
He hasn't been up to it for awhile really.  Think it's out of frustration that he's still on the books rather than hatred.

1641~~~
I am most definitely not the one who needs to get a grip here.

Good on you for offering a little more insight into why you feel the need to tell everyone he is shit and that you think the club should literally tell him to feck off. The club has just closed record breaking deals for Di Maria and sent a pretty big message buying well over 100m quid of players. Now I could understand if it was a 30 or walk, even a 20 or walk situation here but 8m is just such an insignificant amount of money. They could slap the logo on a few brand deals and make that kind of money.

It just doesn't make sense to be losing your rag this hard over an 8m or walk situation. Unless there is other factors at play here ie. an irrational hatred of the player and a compelling need to put him down every chance you get.

If he is indeed on 30k/pw and it comes down to a situation where United (I do have a strong feeling that this is the situation that he feels he's worth 100k and the club do not etc) feel that he's not worth the wages that he is demanding living to the responsibility that he's afforded in the squad then he'll go and we'll all give him our blessing in his new adventure but the club is not going to turn around and tell him to feck off or act like juvenile fans and push him out the door. The legacy of their academy players obviously means more to them than that as they have shown in the past to graduates. If they are changing that as well? Then fair play.
Agreed, it has graduated beyond fans getting together to discuss a player and his contribution to the club to some sort of dumping ground for nuclear insults and patting each other on the back for a player well insulted.

1642~~~
I probably share that frustration, but reading some of the posts here there's more of a nasty personal angle to it. I mean telling him to feck off and leave his bird here to coax Vidal? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1643~~~
Where did I say he was shit? 

The club have accepted a bid for him and LVG has said he can go. I think that's quite clear we pushing him out the door. 

Get your head out of his arse. £8m is a big deal considering our spending this summer and lack of champions league football income.

1644~~~
Yep, I get you on that count, but sure alot of it could be just humour or an attempt at it.  Reminds me of "he wears a pineapple on his head" and all of that.  But the plain truth of the matter is that he doesn't cut it and we're tired of watching the same old same old from him.  It would be better for him, the club and the fans if he had a go somewhere else.  That's the bottom line really because he's never shown me that he has what it takes to be at a top club.  

Having said that, I'd love to be proven wrong but I genuinely don't think that will happen.

1645~~~
It's best for Tom to leave and find his form at another club. What is more interesting in whether we can actually get £8million for him. Hats off to Woody if he pulls it off.

1646~~~
There would be no room to be proven right if the fans feel he has nothing more to give. It's not like they have the patience already to tolerate it. Part of the lure of football is watching someone turn it around. Even if in the end you have to say - "Well.. He didn't.. What a shame.."

There are genuine wasters in football that are doing it tough. Cleverley seems to be a pretty switched on and driven player in general. I agree with <a class="username" data-user="26736, @Kaos" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26736/">@Kaos</a>  that the flack he gets is just astounding.

1647~~~
Ok, I'll get off the fence just for you:  he wont prove me wrong.  I still wish him well at another club though.

1648~~~
You weren't on the fence though. Either way it is neither here nor there - Providing we have a solution to his departure in terms of numbers etc.

1649~~~
You're jumping the gun. I've probably defended Cleverley on this forum more than anyone. My point is we don't know there is pressure wrt his family moving. For all we know his girlfriend might love the idea of moving to Spain. There are a lot of Spanish, German, French, Italian, Brazilian, Argentinian etc footballers playing in lots of different leagues in Europe who had to uproot their families too but they did it for the sake of their careers. English footballers are far more inclined to stay in the comfort zone of the PL even if it means playing for a smaller relegation battling club than a CL/EL regular abroad.

1650~~~
Well I'll explain what winds me up about him. He's turned into a right coward on the pitch and off it he's appeared to big himself up on occasion. Personally I can't hack the thought of spending my hard earned going to OT again to watch him play a leading role in yet another abysmal performance. Nowt nasty, wish him all the best, want him gone.

1651~~~
I think he's been poor now for a long time and the fact he's been out of form for so long and yet still pretty much been a first team regular is one of the examples of our poor planning and a reason we're in the mess we are now.

The reason I think he's been getting so much abuse recently though is his performance at Sunderland last week. He was absolutely terrible and I think that's clouding a lot of people's views on him. He's generally not as bad as he was last week albeit still not good enough for Utd.

1652~~~
He wasn't even that bad against Sunderland. Evans against MK Dons was atrocious for example. If a below par performance has become the signal for the fans to say 'awful, deserves abuse'.. Then that is bizarre, to me anyway.

1653~~~
Your standards are staggeringly low.

1654~~~
He's been gettin abuse for months/years though. The Sunderland game is neither here nor there. I put the venom down to him being on the receiving end of all the frustration about our central midfield woes over the years. 

The nasty tone of it all is really unnecessary and a contrast with certain foreign imports who might also be leaving this week. When you consider he cost the club nothing, has given us at least some good service and was reared a local, Mancheter United fan. His exit should be more dignified than most, yet he gets personal abuse. Not cool at all.

1655~~~
He's clearly gone backwards over the last 18 months, from England starter to not making the squad for the world cup.

1656~~~
I think the initial reason he started drawing animosity was partly down to his TC23 branding. At a time when he had played a handful of first team games and his form had dipped it seemed like he had started to believe his own hype as he launched his own website and seemed to fancy himself as a bit if a Beckham. 

I think when a player makes such shows of confidence, they are always going to put a magnifying glass right over their head. It just so happened that Tom then went on to be a very average player and rather than being labelled as a trier (like at least Fletcher was when he had similar animosity around 05-07) people were quick to take the piss and view him as a bit of a flash git who actually happens to be a bit shit.

1657~~~
I was unaware of any of this happening, but I am not sure what to make of it. It's not conjuring up seething daggers of hate and negativity.. That is for sure.
Sounds like a pretty down to earth guy, still struggling to garner the urge to throw a big tantrum over it.

1658~~~
He's changed his tune on that:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://therepublikofmancunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Cleverley-Twitter3.png" src="http://therepublikofmancunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Cleverley-Twitter3.png"/>

1659~~~
fecking hell, people have been absolute cnuts to him.

1660~~~
On what?

1661~~~
I think its a genuine shame he hasnt made it here. He had such potential and was a different type of england player than we'd seen for a while.

Unfortunately after his injury, i think what ruined it for him was in his head. He lost his confidence and when he got his chance baack in the squad he didnt have the mental strength to dig himself out of a hole he created for himself.

He's had plenty of opportunities to show he can get back to where he was (or going) but he hasnt shown he'll do that and at a club like utd you have to be able to do that quickly. No young england player will get a better chance to prove themselves at a top 4 club in the premier league than he did here due to our midfield issues over the last 4 years.

Good luck to the lad. At least he tried, unlike others we could point out

1662~~~
This might sound harsh, but would he start for Villa or Hull? Villa fans seem to rate Westwood and Delph while Hull have got Livermore and Huddlestone. I'm not sure what system they play but where would he fit in?

1663~~~
Such a shame what he has turned into. When he first broke through I was very impressed with his quick thinking and pass and move style. Now all he ever does is hide and pass it sideways.

1664~~~
Has he left yet?

1665~~~
Oh feck. Now I actually feel bad for him. 

In honest though, decent player but not United quality. 

It's a bit unfair though, because other players like Rooney/Mata et all has been hiding and are clearly afraid to try ambitious things as well, but since Tom's so short of genuine matchwinning ability and because of our CM woes he's being made the scapegoat.

In truth it's probably about time for him to leave though and get his career back on track. I still think he can turn out a good player for a team where the expectations are a bit lesser.

1666~~~
He'd play off the striker.

1667~~~
Villa plays 4-3-3, Hull plays 3-4-2-1. Aston Villa has Richardson as one of the 3 midfielders, Cleverley is sure better than him. Hull has Tom Ince and Snodgrass as the "2's", I'm sure Tom is better than both

1668~~~
I'd imagine he'd play further forward at Villa considering that seems to be what they lack a bit more.

1669~~~
No i don't think he would be guaranteed to start every game for either of those sides, I suspect he would be used in a few different roles at either team but as he doesn't really excel in any position or aspect of his game he would find it tough going at the majority of premier league clubs especially on current form.

1670~~~
That's very true. The moment he launch his own website marketing his brand, after only handful of first team football, I knew he won't be a success here.

1671~~~
Not if they want to win matches

He's not

1672~~~
Our teams gone backwards over the last 18 months

1673~~~
I wish him well but he's very average and not united class if we want to be winning trophies.

1674~~~
He might not be for a starter here but I'd rather Cleverley stay here as a squad player and Anderson/Fellaini left. At the same time I hope Cleverley kicks on and has a really good career elsewhere though.

1675~~~
I'm in the same boat, but then I'm not insistent on keeping him as a squad player to the point where we should turn down a good price for him. If we're getting decent money, it makes sense to just sell.

1676~~~
I'm sure both Lambert and Bruce will be asked about him in the interviews following their game today, so we might know more soon.

1677~~~
I'd rather have Fellaini stay and get a chance (not saying he will succeed) but unlike the other two mentioned they have had more than a fair chance and both come up way short time and again. Given the choice i'd replace the three of them with Khedira.

1678~~~
Tom will know half the games in the head. He has had a chance to show LVG but he's played it safe to the detriment of the team. Most of the abuse he gets will be from opposing fans and I think obviously a lot of people think they know how much he earns and don't think he deserves it. They might have a point. There was promise there but maybe it went to his head and ultimately, he stopped doing the things he seemed good at.

1679~~~
It's bad how much shite he's had to take. He even has the decency to explain himself to the fans over trivial issues. It's hard not to feel bad for him.

1680~~~
I imagine we want rid of all three of them but no one wants anderson and fellaini is injured, Cleverley can leave for free next year so no option but to sell him, it would be stupid to give someone a new contract when they don't deserve it and the manager doesn't rate them.

1681~~~
Can't believe he's still here, please sell him. If he is still here with the likes of Kagawa and Hernandez gone....

1682~~~
Seems he wants to run down his contract and hence stalling.

1683~~~
Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert admits that a move for Tom Cleverley has not progressed, following 2-1 win over Hull at Villa Park

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2739146/Aston-Villa-boss-Paul-Lambert-admits-Tom-Cleverley-not-progressed-following-2-1-win-Hull-Villa-Park.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...tml?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490</a>

1684~~~
He's going to hang around for a year isn't he?

1685~~~
If he's refusing to go then we should sit him out for the rest of the season.

1686~~~
Stick him on the bench for the reserves every game.

1687~~~
If he does refuse to leave and costs the club £8m. We should just let him rot in the reserves.

1688~~~
Cleverley apologetics.

A curious phenomenon.

1689~~~
I'd much rather him go permanently but at the very least I think he'll head out on loan. We'll get a loan fee and then he'll be a free agent at the end of his contract.

Financially, it's obviously much better that he goes now for us.

1690~~~
I'd tell him not to bother coming in at all and rot at home. Losing 8m after all the chances he's been given and investing in his football education isn't on.

I'll have my ears open for his name tomorrow.

1691~~~
It's not his fault he's not good enough. The vitriol is more directed at the management when he plays, but it manifests as anger towards him. If Van a Gaal offered me a start in midfield I'd take it. You'd all hate me, but that's your problem.

1692~~~
That doesn't say a lot for our reserve team.

1693~~~
This. If he's foolish enough to destroy his own career, so be it. Manchester United owes him feck all until further notice.

1694~~~
I can't believe he could actually be putting a sign on fee ahead of regular playing time in his list of priorities.

1695~~~
The chances of him leaving are decreasing with every passing minute, sadly. When Sky reported that an offer from Villa has been accepted and that there was also interest from Hull and Valencia, I actually thought that we've finally got rid of him. Now I'm not so sure anymore.

There were rumours about Arsenal and Everton wanting him as well, but waiting to offer him terms next summer when he'll be a free agent. Maybe that's why he's ''staying''.

1696~~~
Completely agree. If he's daft enough to put a larger signing on fee ahead of his career then it's exactly what he deserves. He'll be saying goodbye to any chance of an England career as well, at least in the medium term. 

No chance of the likes of Valencia being interested if he pisses away this season in the reserves either.

1697~~~
I thought he was joining Villa?

1698~~~
Still not gone then?

1699~~~
I try to defend Cleverley where possible. However, if he's costing the club £8 million just so he can cash in on a signing fee, then that's poor. No evidence of him doing so, but I guess it is a possibility.

1700~~~
If he does hang around, it would only solidify my opinion of him as unambitious and gormless.

1701~~~
Well it's wither lack of ambition, or preposterous over-ambition... he may be convinced that he can force his way into the first team and become a United legend yet.

Either way we can agree on gormless.

1702~~~
I'll be surprised if reports are true that Roy Keane is trying to persuade Cleverley.  I'm sure he and Richardson were the types that Keane lambasted and now (allegedly) he's recruiting them.

1703~~~
Villa had an offer accepted for him but nothing has been heard since then regarding his transfer there. Lambert said after Villa's game today that no progress has been made. Apparently Hull City and Valencia have also made bids for him (Times said couple of days ago that Hull's bid matched Villa's so I guess their bid has been accepted as well).

No other explanation than Cleverley refusing to leave really (if he doesn't do it tomorrow, of course). One thing is for sure though - the chances of him leaving are looking slim compared to two days ago.

1704~~~
It's quite an incredible situation. Last night, LvG preferred to not even have him in the squad. Anderson was chosen ahead of him! With Herrera and Carrick to come back from injuries and with the addition of Blind and possibly another CM by January, does he really want to stick around at United?

1705~~~
Move stalled due to wage demands apparently.

1706~~~
Well, he's not managing United, izzie? 

He'd have to kick his entire team out if he held them to that standard.

1707~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://vjarmy.com/junkbin/gtfo.gif" src="http://vjarmy.com/junkbin/gtfo.gif"/>

1708~~~
This is what happens when you give a medicore player lucrative contract - it's hard to offload them later.
Same story with Young, Valencia, Anderson or Fellaini - no one even wants them, one and only rumour about Fellaini being linked with Napoli on loan stated they would only be able to pay half of his wages. We're even paying Nani's wages during his loan, otherwise he'd still be here - depressing stuff really.

1709~~~
He's on 30 grand a week now he's hardly on a lucrative contract, it's pretty low compared to what some of the shite in our squad is getting. The problem is he's apparently asking for double that which surely no club could be stupid enough to give him.

1710~~~
The arrogance is outstanding.

Not you, but Tom Cleverley

1711~~~
Can't we just all chip in ?

1712~~~
So let me get this straight, he's waiting for his contract to run down, so he gets a signing on fee while we miss out on a transfer fee? Ronaldo gave us 4 years of unparalleled great performances, wanted to go to Madrid but signed a contract with us regardless because it meant getting the club a large transfer fee. 

I am feeling all kinds of shitty about the club at the moment, thanks to this and the Kagawa transfer.

1713~~~
God forbid he plays for us again, imagine all the boos from our own fans. And then he'll probably cry.

1714~~~
I still think of 'wank ingeniously' when I see his name

1715~~~
I thought it would be more like £50k. If he is asking for double then he must think again on whether he deserves that.

1716~~~
I can not blame him if he wants to stay and fight for his place.

1717~~~
he doesnt want to fight for his place, he just wants money.

1718~~~
If Cleverley <i>refuses </i>to leave, animosity levels will reach new highs on this forum!

1719~~~
LVG has said he doesn't force players to leave and will simply tell them how much football they are likely to get - the player can then decide whether they are happy with that.

Frankly if Cleverley wants to stay I imagine it will be with the knowledge that he is not at the top of the pecking order, and I don't see a problem with that.

I would like to see him go on loan and try to reignite his career. Playing in a different team under a different manager may spark an improvement in him and to get some of his old form back, in shchi case an extension could be on the cards.
If he fails to perform then he is released next year anyway.

1720~~~
What does Keane even know about coaching/managing? His managerial career started well but now its actually worse than Cleverley's career as a player! Looks like the waster is here to stay.

1721~~~
I like how we all would do anything to sit on the United wage bill and not do anything but when we hear about the possibility of someone else doing it, shit hits the fan.

1722~~~
Come on, that would be an appalling attitude to have. Not only does it grossly disregard playing football in preference of money, but it absolutely shafts United who have been good to him and invested a lot of effort into his development.

1723~~~
I don't think mine can rise any higher.

Go away, Tom.

1724~~~
I have no problems with a player doing what's best for him. Clubs do what's best for them when it suits them. As does everyone in football. You look out for yourself at the end of the day.
Not his fault we get ourselves into bad situations with players who aren't good enough. A year from now he'll surely have better/more offers. It makes sense for him.

Just because he's not good enough (which probably still wont stop him getting games this season) and the fans don't really like him doesn't mean he should just hurry off somewhere he doesn't want to go to.

1725~~~
It'll be infuriating if he doesn't leave. I think he'll see sense, though.

1726~~~
You think a PL club will come in for a 26 year old who hasn't played football for a year? This is as good as it gets for Cleverley. He should leave now and show some semblance of ambition.

1727~~~
He's basically becoming the worst possible person for us to have in the team.

Shite, thinks he isn't and is solely thinking about money right now.

1728~~~
Kind of missing the point.

1729~~~
It would, indeed. Hope he'll enjoy sitting on the reserve bench.

1730~~~
I honestly hope we let him rot in the reserves if he is not ready to move so as to get a sign on fees next season. Would be a huge disappointment aftet all the talks he gave of wanting to prove himself. Now is the time Tom.

1731~~~
Yeah, definitely.

1732~~~
I wouldn't be angry with him for taking the club's money as such. I mean we did offer the contract it's his right to see it fulfilled.

But turning down regular football for a *bit* more money is not going to earn him any favours with any football fans, be they United fans or his future club's.

It's not even turning down regular football, it's basically accepting a year out of top level football. He's not going to get any games at all for us this season unless there's some kind of horrendous injury crisis where Carrick, Fletcher, Di Maria, Rooney, Herrera, Blind, Fellaini are all injured at the same time.

One thing is certain - if he takes this year out he's not going to get anything like as good offers next summer. Financially or football-wise.

1733~~~
I'd agree with this except I have no sympathy for someone who doesn't want to prove himself and is solely thinking about the paycheck at the end of the day.

He's shite because of a lack of ambition in absolutely everything he does and this just reinforces that notion.

1734~~~
What's your point then? 

Enlighten us.

1735~~~
Bingo. If anything, he should be pro actively looking for a transfer/loan out, like Hernandez and Kagawa presumably did.

1736~~~
He needs to sling his hook, a wasted season here of not playing is going to reduce his choice of clubs, not increase them.

1737~~~
I'm saying we would all die to be a part of the Man Utd squad and play a handful of games off the bench and collect our money at the end of the week. Seeing someone who is public enemy number one at the moment rumoured to be content with the same thing is seen as one of the greatest sins ever witnessed.

1738~~~
Absolute balls. Just a few days ago he talked about this being his dream club so the suggestion he's going to stay just for the money is ridiculous. It's amazing how easy you people find it to attack a player who has done everything he could to make it here.

Local lad worked his way through the youth teams,  went on three loans, bided his time patiently, ultimately got his chance and contributed to us playing our best football in the last five years. Unfortunately he was never able to make the step up but he made a contribution and gave his all to do just that. How some of you have turned him into a villain I'll never know.

1739~~~
You're opinion held more water before the weekend game. Cause now it appears that he's been told there is no place for him and can leave. If he still wants to hang around, the logical conclusion is the one that guy made.

1740~~~
I'm off to work and when I come home I want him gone.

1741~~~
Agreed.

1742~~~
Born in Basingstoke, lived in Bradford. Welbeck is the local one.

1743~~~
I think he means more growing up in Manchester with the youth teams. Joined United at a young age. We class Giggs as a local kid because he grew up in Manchester.

1744~~~
I'm pretty sure Fletcher turned down a move to Everton at a similar age and I don't think it had anything to do with money.

Ah, he was born down south? feck'em then, he deserves all the abuse he can get.

1745~~~
Every player has worked hard to get where they are, doesn't mean they can't act like dicks.

1746~~~
How dare a player be rumoured to be content with being a squad player at Manchester United.

1747~~~
Well that's what I thought you said and so my response is the same. With the signings of Blind, Herrera, Di Maria, the imminent return of Carrick and Fletchers appointment as vice captain then Cleverley will not be playing for us. United have made that clear by accepting bids for him and letting him leave the club. 

If he is refusing to leave then it isn't because he thinks he will be playing, let's be real. He isn't good enough to play here and we now have numerous better players in his position. By not leaving he's shafting the club though as he'll leave on a free next season, though no doubt he'll expect to pick up a higher signing on fee himself.

1748~~~
So if he hasn't received the offer he wants (which he may get as a free transfer in a years time) he should just take it anyway, just to possibly play, even if it's for a team he doesn't really want to play for? 
Just so that he doesn't deprive United of a fee, even though they agreed a contract with him?

1749~~~
If we could move him, and Anderson on today then it'd be a job well done.

1750~~~
You have prrof the club has accepted a bid or just the reports in the media? Honest question, I have not seen any confirmation from the club saying they have accepted an offer.

He also has a life and future he needs to consider. It's very easy for us to sling shit at players who choose the money but we are not in that position. If we go are in a job that pays us more money than another one, we would probably stay too.

1751~~~
He is stupid if he doesn't leave, the manager doesn't rate him, he will spend the season sitting in the stands and will need a lot of players to be injured just to get on the bench. In a years time he might get a better contract but it will be the same teams interested in him at best, if he wants to make it as a premier league player he needs to start playing regularly.

1752~~~
Absolutely. Yep anybody who wishes to remain in our squad and on our payroll despite being told that they are surplus to requirements and that bids have been accepted should be welcomed. Fantastic.

1753~~~
Again, if you can provide proof that the club accepted any bids, I would appreciate it because at the moment, I have only read papers saying it, nothing from the club.

1754~~~
If we sold him we could get around £8m + £1.5m in wages.

That's an extra £9.5m towards Strootman or somebody. But if he goes on a free at the end of his contract he might get a £5m signing on fee or something.

TC23 is bigger than the club.

1755~~~
It's been reported everywhere by reliable journos. The world and his dog know that Hull and Villa have bid. 

Remarkable wriggling going on in here by the Cleverley apologetics - even stretching it as far as saying he's a local lad now. Leave the poor <i>local lad </i>alone folks it's not fair <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Truth is TC23 has used up most of the goodwill and patience amongst a lot of us. There's nowt nasty about it - we just want him gone and off the books as part of us moving forward and sorting this fecking mess out. He has no future here and he is continuing to do himself no favours by appearing to want to hang around.

1756~~~
I hope he is moved on also but that doesn't mean he isn't entitled to look for the best possible deal for him. If we were in the same position, we would consider the same thing.

1757~~~
TC23 will cost us £8m if he stays for another year as far as transfer fees are concerned, he will cost us the same as Falcao...

1758~~~
But then he shouldn't say he loves the football club, he should say he loves himself. So much for wanting to be a United legend.

1759~~~
You can love more than one thing, and love things in different amounts. As much as he loves United, I'm sure he probably loves his family/himself a bit more.

1760~~~
Several million more, he loves money more than he does playing football.

1761~~~
No, not at all. You've missed the most important part. 

It isn't solely that he's valuing money ahead of United getting a transfer fee, it's that he's valuing money ahead of his football. If he stays in the reserves for a year then he'll stall even more as a footballer and there is no way fantastic clubs like Valencia would be interested him. I doubt even Villa would be, given what it signals and what a wasted year means for his development. 

He can also kiss goodbye to any hope of an England career, which is a shame given the retirement of many older players and the complete revamping of the team. A little bit of application and it could be Cleverley getting a call up instead of Fabian Delph and Jack Colback.

1762~~~
To be fair to Cleverly, if my employer told me this morning they had transferred me to another office on half my wage...i wouldn't be jumping around all jolly either.

1763~~~
It's like another office wanting you but you refusing to work unless they double your wage.

1764~~~
Not in my scenario it isn't! it is like another office wanting me but not willing to match my current wage, worse than that in fact they are not even coming close.

<a class="username" data-user="81972, @Empire" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81972/">@Empire</a> If your phone rang now and someone offered you the same job at half the wage...what would you say?

Answer: No Thanks

1765~~~
He needs to make a move if he wants to progress as a footballer, if he stays here he will spend a year on the bench or paying 15 minutes every other game.

1766~~~
Woah woah woah, we've got important prospects down there, I don't want Tom taking up game time from anyone down there.

Let him go to Royal Antwerp.

1767~~~
Seriously Tom, it's time to piss off. Stop being a greedy git.

1768~~~
Cleverley is on £30k per week, he has been offered this, possibly more, he wants £60k per week or at least that's what I have read.

You are implying Villa are offering him £15k per week!!

Villa don't seem to have a problem matching his current wages but he wants double that.

This is like another office wanting you and your current office wanting to get rid of you but you refusing to work because the new office will not double your current wage.

BTW - this is based on what I have read on here, I have no idea whether that's true or not but I have not read Villa only want to pay him £15k per week.

1769~~~
We should just give him a £1M cut of the transfer to get rid of him the greedy bugger.

1770~~~
Seriously Tom, just leave mate.

1771~~~
Reminds me of the Seinfeld episode when PlayNow can't get rid of George. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1772~~~
Tom, mate, just leave. You're an okay player. Go show it at Villa cos you're certainly not showing it here.

1773~~~
That'll do as well <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1774~~~
For those making comparisons with what we would do in such a situation, most/all of us don't have careers ending in our mid-30s. If he turns down a move over wages, he is a foregoing a slightly lower (but still huge) wage at the expense of a great chance to re-start his club and international career. After 12 months at United frozen out of game time, he'll be a 26 year old whose CV consists of decent loan spells 4-5 years earlier at Watford and Wigan and 3-4 good games for United followed a descent into mediocrity.

1775~~~
ahhh gotcha, i understand your stance now, and i agree with you in that scenario

but in my head the scenario is different hehe but i'll quit with the office analogy now and do some work before my boss sacks me <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1776~~~
I have to say that I think any degree of mutual loyalty changes once the club asks you to leave. Unless they're forgoing a fee or giving you a testimonial, I think the club has made this a business decision and Clev should treat it like one too.

On the other hand, the guy will already retire a millionaire. If he stays and waits out his contract, then when he's in his 50s I doubt very much he'll look back and think what a good decision it was take to spend a whole year of a very short career sat on the bench. I doubt very much a signing on fee will make up for that loss.

1777~~~
He must not think much of himself, if he is not leaving due to Villa not meeting his demands. Fair enough if he wanted to stay because he loves united and thinks he can get into the team, however squabbling over wages when he is going to be a first teamer allowing his to showcase talents is very silly. If he is a hit, he will even get a raise or clubs with a higher wage structure will come sniffing next year

1778~~~
Please just leave.

1779~~~
If anyone ever wants to have a laugh at opinions based on assumption, rumour, spin and wildly off target analogies this would be the best thread to study.

1780~~~

1781~~~
Villa bid for canales. Hurry up and move tom you shitbag.

1782~~~
The little prick isn't going to leave is he? No offence Tom, I'm sure you are a lovely chap blah blah blah but you aren't a Man Utd player.. just leave.

1783~~~
Maybe Falcao and Di Maria will get the best out of TC23

<span style="color: #ffffff">lol</span>

1784~~~
Reckon he'd be decent for us still with some confidence. 

Maybe we'll see that again, but I'd definitely want to fight it out here if I had the opportunity. Don't blame him personally.

1785~~~
SSN were linking in with Everton today. I imagine he would sooner opt to work with Martinez again than the go to villa etc. Well you think he would opt for regular first team football at his age.

1786~~~
Go away Tom. You need a fresh start somewhere else.

1787~~~
I think he'll get slaughtered in the press if he decides to run down this contract for a year. Seems like he is being badly advised. He'll probably get a higher contract if he runs it down but it'll come at a big cost in terms of his development. You would think seeing the likes of Colback being called up for England would give him a shake and realise that it wouldn't take much for him to get his career back on track.

1788~~~
I see Villa have just bid for Sergio Canales. Maybe they're sick of brand TC23 already.

I think Tom's going to run down his contract. Unfortunately. I'd like him to prove me wrong though.

1789~~~
Everton are skint cause of Lukaku. Wouldn't be surprised if it was a loan only...

1790~~~
The hate this guy's getting...

OK all the signs point to Cleverley being surplus to requirements but how do we know what's going through his head? He might think he can convince Van Gaal he's worth keeping about? He might be thinking he'd rather stay around the North, given his wife's just had a kid, than go to Birmingham. I'm probably going to get blasted as a Cleverley lover, even though I think it would be best for all parties if he does go, but there are two sides to this. I'd like to believe the best of a guy who has been with the club since he was a teenager and clearly wanted to make it here, and is probably in bits he's being told to do one. Rather than just think he's willing to sit around waiting for a fat signing on fee (not that he's likely to get one next summer if he hasn't been playing so I dunno where that idea comes from), I'm thinking Cleverley is weighing up other factors.

1791~~~
He needs to leave for the sake of his career, by this time next year he might not find any decent club to take him.

1792~~~
Seems like reserve football awaits our Tom...

1793~~~
QPR have inquired apparently.

1794~~~
He can sign a pre-contract agreement with another club in just over 16 weeks, he won't have to wait until this time next year.

1795~~~
Get the cannon ready!

1796~~~
Maybe another team are signing him and that is why Villa are looking elsewhere.

1797~~~
Go on Arry! Can we throw in Anderson too.

1798~~~
Only foreign ones, if he wants to stay in England, doesn't it have to be May?

1799~~~
Unless Van Gaal has told him that he still has a future here, I fully expect him to be gone by the end of the day. We'll find a way to offload him, even if it's just a loan

1800~~~

1801~~~
If Cleverley stays we have to support him. I don't want a suicide on our hands.

1802~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1803~~~
I think that may be the case for younger players, not for someone in the mid 20s though.

1804~~~
Doesn't he want to get back into the England squad? What a fecking lack of ambition it would be to sit on the bench for a year.

1805~~~
Foreign club, do you honestly see a decent La Liga/Serie A side taking a punt on an average English player who has fallen into disuse and pay him anything close to what he is demanding now ? I don't and after this stunt I doubt if he will see any football at all here for the remainder of his stay.

1806~~~
G'wan Tommy boy, get the feck out.

1807~~~
Another year without football won't make any more appealing than he's now, footballers have a short career there's no need to waste anymore of it.

1808~~~
What makes you think he can't sign a pre-contract agreement with a club in England?

1809~~~
He is never going to make it here, with the exception of 2 or 3 teams he is no better than any of the starting midfield players at any premier league club, LVG knows it and the sooner cleverley accepts that the better. For the sake of his career he should leave and go and play some football rather than spend a year watching from the stands, he had his chance but he wasn't good enough. The idea he would thrive under LVG was always flawed because as soon as LVG strengthened the midfield Cleverley was finished, if you spend three years unable to hold down a place in the worst utd midfield for decades then the writing is on the wall.

1810~~~
Very pertinent.  Even with An injury prone and unfit Anderson a physically recuperating Fletcher and a misfit like Fellaini for competition, he did not get even close to differentiating himself.

1811~~~
No, I don't think that's right.

A foreign club can offer players based in England a contract 6 months before their current deal ends. As an English club however, you cannot offer home based players a deal until 1 month before the end of their current deal.

1812~~~
Excellent summary of the situation.

1813~~~
If he doesn't leave then i don't see why that should automatically mean....<i>he can rot in the reserves!!!</i> I'm sure LVG doesn't have the same hate towards Cleverly as some on here, and realistically all that will happen is Cleverly continues to train and be ready to cover for injuries if needed.

1814~~~
Where are you getting that from?

The Bosman rules state: "With six months or less remaining on an existing contract for players aged 23 or older, they are free to negotiate with other clubs and sign a pre-contract agreement, indicating their ability to move to their intended club o<span style="color: #000000">n a <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bosman</a> transfe</span>r once the next transfer window opens."
<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_transfer_%28association_football%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_transfer_(association_football)</a>

There was no issue with Lewandowski signing a pre contract agreement with Bayern from Dortmund when he had 6 months left on his contract and I can't see how it would be legal for the rules to be different in England.

1815~~~
I can see your points but I really can't see how he thinks he can salvage a career at United. I'm all for ambition but the guy has just regressed really, he doesn't show any quality to be a Man Utd player and whilst he probably has confidence in his ability he must kind of know it himself.

His wife might of just had a kid but it's not like it'd be moving abroad. Bare in mind most days he'll be finished work by the early afternoon it's not a far drive, probably only 2 hours at most. It's not like he's being shipped off to Russia. I'm sure he can afford the petrol and find the time to do it. I agree that it's not nice to be told you're not wanted as well but that's life unfortunately. I'm sure he was made aware of it a few weeks/months ago rather than this afternoon or something so he must of had time to prepare for knowing this way going to come.

He was coming out in the press at the start of the season saying he wants to improve, get back in England set up etc and that's good ambition to have, by lingering around United like a bad smell not getting games he's not going to do that. He's just wasting a year of his career really and that's not beneficial to himself, United or any future clubs.

My only knowledge of that is Football Manager, so it probably iosn't accurate, but on that if you were a Premier League team you could only sign other premier league players on a free with 3 months or less left on their deal. It didn't apply in other leagues just the Prem so don't know if it's something to do with our league.

1816~~~
He's right though.

1817~~~
To be fair most clubs who are interested in him are probably content to wait until he's free. I'm thinking Everton mainly – and he'll probably want to wait for Martinez too.

1818~~~
Where are you geting that info from? I'm happy to be educated!

1819~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1820~~~
Maybe, but with no European games (or Carling Cup), there is no need for rotation and Herrera, Di Maria, Blind, Fletcher and Carrick (when fit) will all be ahead in the pecking order as well as any further midfield signing today and, apparently, Strootmann from January. Fellaini would also probably be ahead of him as well, and maybe even Ando. In other words, his chances of a starting berth are nil and he'll do very well to even get on the bench.

1821~~~
I'm pretty sure the rule applies only in England. I was on another forum and was confused as to why you could only get home based players on a pre contract in May in Football Manager and whether it was an actual rule in real life. Everyone on the board seemed to be pretty much in agreement it <i>was</i> in fact a rule and only enforced in England. I'd also trust FM as they are generally pretty much spot on with these things.

Also, what's the precedent on it? I've certainly never heard of a EPL player joining another EPL team on a pre contract in January.

1822~~~
Personally I saw it on Football Manager. You can laugh.

1823~~~
He wouldn't necessarily rot in the reserves but he would need 2-3 injuries just to have a chance of sitting on the bench and if he isn't in LVG's long term plans he might even prefer to give opportunities to some of the youngsters. For a player who has regressed and is low on confidence the worst thing for his career would be to spend a year not playing any football.

1824~~~
A computer game? Yeah, I think I'll allow myself a <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at that.

1825~~~
FM doesn't get things like that wrong...especially for major leagues.

1826~~~
And even SAF often preferred to play jones, giggs and scholes instead of him, he got three years and 60-70 games to show what he could do and he failed. Our academy will produce better players who will not get as many opportunities, he hasn't been hard done by and the best thing for him is to move on.

1827~~~
Come on Brucie.

1828~~~
Or not considering it's right.

It's an FA rule, other leagues follow the standard bosman ruling of it being 6 months before the end of the contract when any club can approach a player and sign a pre-contract agreement with them.

1829~~~
?

You've quoted a rule about players signing contract extensions at their existing clubs.

1830~~~
The second part, it's about securing employment elsewhere in that time scale. They're shit loads of articles on it but unless you fancy reading pages and pages of shite they're not much use, apparently it was introduced as a means to help lower clubs keep hold of players more than anything, dunno how it'd make much of a difference though.

1831~~~
What would be the point of that? I'd rather see him in the stands.

Maybe he could get some time at left wing since that's his real position. He's never been a CM, imho.

1832~~~
So, is he gone yet?

1833~~~
Just leave seriously.

1834~~~
Just go tom..GO.

1835~~~
You could play him anywhere on the pitch and he'd just pass the ball to whoever was standing closest to him so it wouldn't matter.

1836~~~
I still remember his performance when we beat Arsenal 8-2. Outstanding. I championed him as a player for ages after that. Unfortunately he strikes me as being very flakey confidence wise. Wont try a forward pass in case he gets booed and wont put a tackle in case he gets skinned

I think its a shame he didnt go to Valencia. Couldve been Englands gain. We need our players to gain experience over-seas, and it just doesnt happen any more. I'd have preferred a loan abroad with a view to buy option (so we could nick him back "if" he regained his form)

1837~~~
I knew it, knew he'd sabotage this deal. Complete shyster.

1838~~~
Unless he's prepared to take a wage cut he's going nowhere, apparently Everton are interested as well but can't afford his wage.

1839~~~
Or 'Arry.

1840~~~
Is he definitely being asked to accept a wage cut? I thought he wasn't on much at United?

Just had a quick look and apparently the delay is because he's asking for 60k which no one on their right mind would pay him. He isn't on 60k here.

1841~~~
Yep and nothing wrong with that. Why should he go to Villa for less money when just 4 months later he could join a much better team with a much better manager and earn more money? Ofc assuming Martinez is interested.

1842~~~
I know players have a short career and need to look out for themselves but this guys has some balls asking for 60k a week.

Shame he doesn't show the same balls on the pitch.

1843~~~
Might have been wrong with, can't find anything on his current wage but from what I have is that his next renewal would bump it up to £60k.

1844~~~
I read he is/was on 30k

1845~~~
I rather prefer him to stay than we loan him to Everton.

1846~~~
he used to be capable of more.I think he tried to over complicate things sort of like Hernandez. Hernandez is great at what he's great at but his attempted at evening out his game was not very successful.

tom has his strength but we've never used him in a way that made the best of that. he's no world beater but he could be useful with in the right formation with the right tactics.

1847~~~
Like Nani, Fellaini, Anderson, etc he is another one who's wages we'll have to subsidise I expect if we want to move him on. Nobody is going to pay him the wages we are paying him and he won't want to take a pay cut - who would?

1848~~~
I keep forgetting we've even got Fellaini.

1849~~~
I heard an agent speaking recently and he was asked whether player seek advice which club would be good for them - their game time, chance of trophies, etc. His answer was, no, never, all the players are interested in is the size of the cheque.

1850~~~
This is ridiculous, if he doesnt take a pay cut then we should make sure he has absolute minimum playing time here. He should never be on that wage in the first place..

1851~~~
Meh, underwhelming.

1852~~~
That's the whole point of a long term contract. We are contracted to pay him until the end of his contract. I heard that he was considering whether to see out his contract and then go on a free next summer.

1853~~~
Hull midfield of Huddlestone, Livermore, Diame and Cleverley are not bad if they can get the last two done.

1854~~~
Won't be a United player by the end of the window according to Sky.

1855~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/TonyBarreTimes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Off to Everton as per Tony Barrett times.</a>

1856~~~
Fake account.

1857~~~
Don't really know what to make of this signing if it goes through. The 2 things that go in favour of it is that Martinez has worked with him before and also that I was gutted when we signed Gibson and he has been great whenever he gets himself on the pitch.

1858~~~

1859~~~
Poor guy

1860~~~
Just tell him to feck off.

1861~~~
I bet Martinez makes a real player out of the lad. Maybe a loan wouldn't be the worst idea, even if we have to cover some of his wages. We might well get a bigger fee out of them at the end of it.

1862~~~
Free agent next summer.

1863~~~
Sky saying Villa unlikely to sign anyone now, Hull maybe then?

Edit: And now saying Villa could sign, wages a stumbling block.

1864~~~
If wages are a stumbling block and he's only on 30k, then no wonder we can't offload Young and Anderson. Annoying how Liverpool managed to sell Carroll and Downing though, fecking big Sam.

1865~~~
I imagine he wants a rise.

1866~~~
Delete this thread and try to forget the guy ever played for us ffs.

1867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Based on what performances? He can't be that deluded.

1868~~~
Tbf, Rodwell is getting 58/60k reportedly at Sunderland. So he feels as a England international he deserves more himself too.

1869~~~
If he leaves, who should take his number mate?

1870~~~
This greedy git is just going to run his contract down and leave for nothing next summer and attempt to get a more lucrative deal. Well I tell you what sunshine you won't get the sort of money you're on here elsewhere because you're tut.

1871~~~
LOL The Midlands corespondent on 5Live said he wants 70-80 grand a week <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>.

1872~~~

1873~~~
My god, Paddy Power are so unfunny and attenion-craving it physically pains me.

1874~~~
What an idiot <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

If they gave him that and he didn't hit the ground running he'd get totally slaughtered.

kinell.

Hope Cleverley leaves for his own sake. Frankly I wouldnt be opposed to him going on loan for a season, just to see if he is able to rekindle some of his old potential - who knows, there could be a place at United for him after all if he did really well.

1876~~~
He is staying isn't he<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1877~~~
I really don't see us offering him a new contract next year even if he does well on loan. Looking at the way woody is signing players we might get a world class cm next year leaving no space for Cleverley.

1878~~~
Disgrace.

1879~~~
He's still our 4th best CM (or 5th counting DI maria playing deep). Him staying won't be the worse outcome though loses us financially.

1880~~~
Its possible, but if he does well and is happy to stay/come back to United it would save us a potential transfer fee for a squad player.

1881~~~
Aye, that's what it seems like. He'll get a bigger wage and signing on fee if interested clubs don't need to pay the £8million transfer fee. 

I think he is being very badly advised. A year in the reserves is going to do absolutely nothing to turn around hi stagnating career or help get him back in the frame with England.

1882~~~
That guy is not real. What has he done to deserve 80k a week at Villa? He wasn't even on that at United, he was rumored to be close to signing an extension for 70-75k.

1883~~~
Meh, they're all right. Way more original and witty than shite like FootyHumour or TrollFootball

1884~~~
Jeez that can't be true can it? If it is he must really think he is the English Xavi or something. Hey if Young is allegedly paid 120k per week then I guess he can ask for whatever the feck he wants... I wish he has a fine career ahead but if he decides to rot in the reserves for a year impeding his development and costing us 8mil, then I would lose whatever teeny weeny bit of respect I had for him...

1885~~~
Surprised he hasn't been linked to QPR or something already. They're the only club that'll probably be willing to pay his ridiculous wage demands.

1886~~~
Everton going for him say SSN

1887~~~
SSN are saying a loan deal with Everton is looking likely, hoping we get a decent fee for this as he will be free agent when his loan ends.

1888~~~
Everton should pay £15M, others can have him for the reported £7M/£8M.

1889~~~
Please Tom, be free! Run to Everton as fast as your little useless legs can carry you.

1890~~~
He will end up going on loan to Everton and we miss out on £8m because of his greed. Disgusting.

1891~~~
Clevs obviously wants to earn as much money as he wants, so he will probably end up at Everton. Wish him all the very best, hopefully, the loan fee is not too low.

1892~~~
Or he wants to play for a team that'll be competing for Europe. Don't blame him if he can get the move to go through.

1893~~~
We'll get a loan fee, and the player off the books, better than nothing.

1894~~~
If Everton don't pay up the full amount, then don't let him go.

Sick of those tight scroungers getting great deals off us.

1895~~~
A move would be good for both Cleverly and Utd. I defended him and defended him and now I think that he simply isn't Utd quality.

1896~~~
If the choice is Everton on loan then a huge payrise next year or a permanent move to Hull and less money then well, it's not much of a choice is it?

1897~~~
No doubt about that, his time is up, just up to him whether he wants a gap year, or a transfer tonight.

1898~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1899~~~
Skint cnuts.

1900~~~
Deal to Villa is off! Feck off Cleverley, you greedy feck!

1901~~~
Villa walked away as per Sky now.

1902~~~
Can we ship him off to a club like York?

1903~~~
Say hello to the reserves Tom

1904~~~
Wow, what a greedy prick.

1905~~~
Exactly, but we shouldn't have given him that option because the only ones getting shafted are United if that happens.

Should have been a permanent move or sit in the reserves. Feck letting him run his contract down out on loan.

1906~~~
Don't see the point in loaning him without a good fee. I get he wants whats best for him but we need to consider what's best for us. He is likely to be a backup player but with our injury track record no point loaning him for a minimal fee.

1907~~~
Dislike him even more.

1908~~~
Greedy fecker

1909~~~
Earlier there were a lot of posters who didn't fully get the issues with just selling off our squad players with higher than deserved wages. Here we have the entire issue arising, even if United accepts a bid it is up to the player to accept half the salary all of a sudden and playing for a worse club.

1910~~~
will get his loan to Everton? We could just keep him tbh, he will move on next year if we loan him or keep him so doesnt matter.

1911~~~
Should just release him for being a greedy feck. The Villa move would look a lot more attractive then! Even if we're not getting 8m, at least we won't have to pay his wages for another year. What on earth makes him think he's even remotely close to being worth 80k a week?

1912~~~
He's on 30k/week here. The issue is him demanding 80k/week which no one is willing to do. I'm pretty sure Villa and the like would have given him a pay rise, just not by that much.

1913~~~
problem is we pay him 30.000 a week, he wants 80.000. Cant do nothing about it.

1914~~~
Well within his rights to stay but at 25 if he has any ambition he should move on.

1915~~~
please do the right thing Tommy boy.

1916~~~
Well, I'm fairly sure that to release him we would have to sack him and pay the rest of his contract. Or offer mutual termination for an agreed settlement. Unlikely given that he's only thinking about money.

1917~~~
I think he's on £40k per week. That's a lot of money for a team like Villa. I'm not convinced he's asking for £80k. Media bs. Everton are the only option imo. Not sure whether a loan deal or just leaving him in the reserves is the best option tbh. It will be his own fault if he doesn't accept Everton's offer.

1918~~~
Should just release him and do it anyway. I'd rather see Anderson in the midfield than Cleverley ever play there again. It's not like we'll be paying him to do anything. Apart from being a terrible footballer, he also seems to be a terrible person. I actually felt slightly sorry for him before all of this.

1919~~~
Its collapsed according to Stan Collymore. Spoken to his Villa sources and says Cleverley's camp overplayed their hand and p'd off Villa.

1920~~~

1921~~~
That's not true at all. 

He's on about 30k here which isn't a lot and according to papers such as the Telegraph he's asking for 60k when transferred. According to one source linked in this thread he asked for an absurd 80k. 

This isn't at all a situation in which he's being asked to half his wages. No idea where you have got that from.

1922~~~
I thought he was on more than 30k actually. Still United's wage structure that makes him consider himself worthy of 80k rather than something less. If Valencia/Young/Shaw are getting those figures I see why he'd overrate his values.

1923~~~
He can't even get a transfer right!!! I wouldn't even send him to Everton on loan, f'in cheap cnuts.

1924~~~
Does he have any ambition? Just get out the club Tom.

1925~~~
COME ON TOM. I BELIEVE IN YOU.

1926~~~
If he bollocks this up he should never wear the United shirt again, tell him to go home and wait for his cheque in the mail.

1927~~~
he's probably not in a rush to leave the biggest club in the country, one he's had passion for a long time.

It can be a slippery slope downwards when you leave, so not surprised he's after a huge contract to leave.
Leave it until the end of the season and he can look forward to much bigger Bosman wages.

1928~~~
money grabbing idiot 80k per week, he should be taking a pay cut and getting first team football.

1929~~~
If Everton want him on a loan and get him on a free next season then I hope we reject it and keep him as the backup to our backup..

1930~~~
He's on 30k. What does he think he's done to think he deserves 50k more?

1931~~~
The reality is we've signed a bunch of players we're looking to play CM.

Ander, Di Maria, Blind

And we're not in the champions league or league cup, so there wont be games to go around for people like Cleverley

If he stays its to get a handful of games this season

1932~~~
OK, I've always stood up for Tom, but he's starting to piss me off now.  I know it's not his fault, but Nani, Shinji, Hernandez and Danny all going while Cleverley, Anderson, Young and Valencia all stay makes me feel a bit sick.

1933~~~
If the reports are right he wanted 80k from Villa I hope he gets NO games.

1934~~~

1935~~~
I don't think he'll kick a ball for the first team, unless he signs a new one year contract with the intention of leaving in the summer. There's no way we'll play him whilst letting him run his contract down.

1936~~~
hasn't he gone yet?

1937~~~
Let him fecking Rot in the reserves for a year.

1938~~~

1939~~~
Seriously, he's going to rot in our reserves and be a lesson to youngsters that think with their wallet.

It's probably in the back of his mind that he's got games at United recently and he'll probably get them in the future if he ends up staying. I can't see us having such an injury crisis again.

Herrera, Di Maria, Blind, Carrick, Fletcher and probably even Anderson still ahead of him. Time to grow up and grow a pair.

1940~~~
Cleverley wants a loan move due to being on the last year of his contract. He'll command a good signing on fee and salary if he pulls off a loan signing and proves is worth at Everton.

1941~~~
With the midfielder's we've got in the reserves he'll struggle to get games.

Really disappointing stuff from him

1942~~~

1943~~~
Let him rot in the reserves all year.

1944~~~
His staying... Out of everyone gone. Him and Anderson should have been the first out.

1945~~~
That's where he and his team have got it wrong. Apparently that's a lot more than Ron Vlaar is on at Villa and he's an established World Cup level player. So you can see what Villa were thinking.

1946~~~
Don't forget Fellaini. And our chuckle brothers Valencia and Young. How they managed to stay, I'd never know.

1947~~~
Twitter says it's off.

1948~~~
Bang on! Anderson is making me feel violently angry with his presence and so i'd like to take it out on Toms whiney face! Seriously though, Kagawa and Danny leaving and those four remaining is insane!

1949~~~
No doubt Villa are in the right. We seem to have abandoned the idea of a wage structure at all and Bayern deserves so much respect after our debacle this summer.

1950~~~

1951~~~
5 Live are saying that he will be staying.

1952~~~

1953~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWaLxFIVX1s?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1954~~~
The important thing is, we got Blind in and have Carrick coming back. Cleverly won't get a look in either way.

1955~~~
This is what makes the lack of investment over the last Fergie years all the more baffling. 'No value in the market' yet the massive wages we're overpaying to players who have never justified it is pretty staggering.

1956~~~
Crazy how Shinji, Chico and Welbeck have left but the deadwood have managed to survive.

1957~~~
Don't get the club's stance. Why keep Clev on the wage bill when he's likely to leave on a free next summer? May as well have Everton pick up the tab for the next year, rather than pay him not to play for us and lose him on a free anyway.

1958~~~
No one was saying Villa weren't in the right to be clear - the issue is Cleverley and his absolute focus on getting as much money as possible. 

He's so preoccupied with getting a high wage and signing on fee that he's prepared to piss away a season at United without first team football and run his contract down.

1959~~~
Eh? 

We want a fee for him. Simple really.

1960~~~
They probably wanted us to pay half his wages or something. Anyway we might need him now.

1961~~~
We would refuse that on principal I guess. Everton get him on loan for a nominal fee, then get him for a free in the summer. That's just an awful deal for us and tightfisted by Everton.

I also suspect there was an element of each party waiting for the other to blink first, Cleverley's agent no doubt followed your logic and assumed United would fold and let Cleverley go out on loan and run his contract down.

1962~~~
Fellaini did the old "injured" trick in order to get out of his move away.

1963~~~
permanent transfer > loan transfer > no transfer  
By holding out for the best option the club may end up with the worst.

1964~~~
And before <a class="username" data-user="56404, @#07" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56404/">@#07</a> says oh poor Cleverley, we should let him go. Were Everton this generous over Fellaini? Were they saying poor Fellaini?

1965~~~
Deal off, Cleverley stays

1966~~~
Cleverley deal off says SSN.

1967~~~
Will he get a frosty reception next time he turns out for united?

1968~~~
No deal with Everton. Oh feck off Everton you cheapskates. Martinez you love him so much yet don't wanna pay money for him.

1969~~~
Stuck with him another year.

1970~~~
Sack, bricks, canal. Sort it out Ed.

1971~~~
Everton saying no Tom Cleverley deal.

1972~~~
why should we let him go? Better he warms the bench for us then letting him go on loan to Everton.

1973~~~
Reserves football for Tom

1974~~~
Glue factory. At least I'll still have the pleasure of selling on on FM. Small victories.

1975~~~
Cleverley stays is being reported by SSN now. Everton deal is off

1976~~~
Better him staying than a loan.

1977~~~
We should release him even if it means paying his wages. He doesn't deserve to even be part of our reserves if all this is true.

1978~~~
They are going to get him anyway. It's obvious Martinez has been in Clev's ear, and if Clev wants to go to Everton we ain't forcing him to go elsewhere. He'll sit on our bench, bide his time and go to Everton next summer. We aren't getting money for him. Only question is who pays his wages til next July.

1979~~~
As usual he's fecked it up.

1980~~~
FFS<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1981~~~
Pfft, he'll be off in January instead.

1982~~~
What an idiot, just wasted a year of his career.

1983~~~
If he stays, says a lot why we want rid.

Wants to be paid shit loads or happy to sit on the bench just to say 'i play for Manchester United'.

1984~~~
Stuck with this waste of space for another year it seems. You have to question his ambition now that he is staying. Welbeck and Lawrence have both left to further their careers although I'm sure both would have ideally liked to have remained at the club. On the other hand all Cleverley cares about is the $$$.

1985~~~
He's bought himself a year into the wilderness if the Villa wage rumours are true. 

No problem with him wanting to stay at United but it does seem obvious that he's almost never going to play.

1986~~~
Well looks like he's denying us a transfer fee. Nice <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1987~~~
Poor form if he's riding out his contract and planning on screwing us out of a transfer fee.

1988~~~
That's too good for him. He should be completely frozen out, he's cost the club a lot of money tonight.

1989~~~
Anderson and Cleverley, the dream continues.

1990~~~
Do people not realize that there is still the January transfer window..........

1991~~~
No it's not. At least they could pay his wages (yes it's a small amount) while out on loan.

1992~~~
Sums everything that's wrong with modern day footballers.

1993~~~
Everton the cheap cnuts & Cleverley the greedy cnut if the wage rumours are true.

1994~~~
FFS none of you know the circumstances. Lets just call a youth team player cu nt instead eh

1995~~~
Absolute joke, does he actually think hes worth 80k per week or w.e
Take it to 50/60 and get more football. Deluded and hope he never plays again. 4 clubs interested and none takers all down to the player. Booing is one thing but he deserves it this time ...

1996~~~
Still it is not a big difference. Would have liked a fee for him, guy is useless.

1997~~~
Put him in reserves till January and then sell him cut price there and then. He's fecking shit and shouldn't start another game for us this season. We've only got the PL and FA Cup so there should be no room made for him and Anderson.

Carrick/Blind/Herrera/Di Maria/Mata is probably enough for the midfield for 35-40 games. Maybe a bit short, which is why I wish we'd bought one more midfielder but seeing as we haven't, I wouldn't waste it on playing fecking Cleverley or Anderson. Cleverley literally doesn't do anything whereas Anderson, to his credit, does actually try, he's just shit at it and to add to that, he's a perma-crock.

And Everton are the biggest cheapskates in the market. Wildly overpay for Lukaku but can't even muster £7m for Cleverley. I'm sure we'd have even accepted less. We gave them good money for Rooney and gifted them Neville, Howard and Gibson, getting them as far as they are now. That club is slowly fecking turning into Spurs, scouse cnuts.

1998~~~
So Martinez talks a lot about him. But can't pay a fee.

1999~~~
Anderson, Cleverley, Young all staying. Looks like "The Deadwood Stage " ISN'T rolling on over the hill!

2000~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.tinypic.com/2j166f4.gif" src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2j166f4.gif"/>

2001~~~
He'll have half a year left on his contract by then. No club would pay a fee.

2002~~~
Won't be surprised,  or sorry for him, if some fans boo him next time at Old Trafford.

2003~~~
Another year of paying Cleverley then...?

Seriously just to free up the wages we should've taken the loan deal. Waste of money paying a player that's pretty much certain to walk for nothing next summer.

2004~~~
Can we send him to the U-8's or something? He might look good there.

2005~~~
Cant we just release him?

2006~~~
Yeah, 30k a week they can afford to pay it.

2007~~~
out of contract next summer, he'll be free to sign for anybody from 1st january.

2008~~~
Haha, there's gif for everything isn't there.

Clev will sign for Hull, watch this space

2009~~~
Winston Bogarde V2.0

2010~~~
We'd have to pay out his remaining contract, unless he agreed to waive his rights.

That's why we should've loaned him out. Given Van Gaal don't want Clev, we're just paying him to sit on the bench for a year until he leaves on a free. 

There's a phrase about money up a wall that springs to mind.

2011~~~

2012~~~
A thread title change we can all get behind.

2013~~~
How much would cost termination of his contract ?

2014~~~
Greedy cnut.

2015~~~
Ffs him and Anderson are both still on the books, I was hoping both would be sold today.

2016~~~
Why are people critiscing Everton, they agreed a fee but scuppered because of his wage demands. He wanted to be greedy, no way would I pay thay much for him. They were right

2017~~~
A few mill. Imo it's a small price to pay to demonstrate not to feck us around, but I suppose it might be hard to justify to the shareholders.

2018~~~
5 Live are saying the deal fell through as Everton couldn't meet the asking price.

2019~~~
No it's not, it sets an awful precedent. 

He can rot in the reserves and try and pick up his signing on fee in the summer. Useless fecker.

2020~~~
Greedy Twat, hope he never plays for us again

2021~~~
feck that, terminating his contract is exactly what he wants. Let's him go and sign a deal as a free agent tomorrow which is what he wants to do.

2022~~~

Valencia, Young, Cleverley and Anderson - the deadwood of the deadwood still remain at the club.

2024~~~
Just tell him to stay at home for the rest of the year.

2025~~~
Fair enough I suppose. Let him rot. Maybe tell the reserve coaches not to play him? A year without game time and he'll be even more useless.

2026~~~
Good to see someone who genuinely cares about the club and is willing to fight for their place rather than force a move through to our rivals for 4th spot.

2027~~~
He shouldn't play in the reserves either and take a young players spot, he should simply be left to rot at home.

2028~~~
but the itk s over here are stating otherwise..

2029~~~
I guess the people that said he lacked ambition and motivation are dead right. It's a bit embarrassing for him now, he's not going to play.

2030~~~
Tom definitely thinks highly of himself. We're talking big money over the course of a year at 80,000 a week versus half that, who would happily walk away from that sort of money?

someone like Villa will pick him up next season, he'll probably score against us some day, and that's about it.

2031~~~
I surely forgot about it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2032~~~
Cleverley's camp are ruining his career.

I genuinely thought he had his heart set on working with Martinez, these rumours make it clear it's about the money.

Clev ain't gonna get games this season, next summer nobody is gonna rate him as an 80k a week man. Clubs ain't gonna line up to sign him at that cost.

If he isn't careful he'll end up having no club next August.

2033~~~
90 mins to go, anything can happen.

2034~~~
1/2 hr mate.

2035~~~
Considering I just slated him this does make Clev look slightly better.

Still, I'd wager Everton have been on at him to mess up the Villa deal so United would be forced to sell to them on the cheap.

2036~~~
Honestly dont understand his motives. I mean his wages here are £30k basic with a lot of incentive based extras, but he isn't going to play this season so he isn't going to earn them.

I refuse to believe Villa and Everton are offering much less than that.

2037~~~
Some amusing reactions in here. Nothing wrong with him wanting better wages at Villa. Might be a different matter if no one else wanted him but as things stand he can stay here for a year and then sign with Everton, probably for higher wages than what Villa were offering because there'll be no transfer fee to be paid.

2038~~~
Better to play Pereira, Pearson et al in the reserves.

2039~~~
That's pretty selfish and stupid for a guy who needs to move and play week in, week out. Smacks of a lack of ambition.

2040~~~
No white text?

2041~~~
Cleverley trying to orchestrate a move to Everton who just wanted to drive the price down instead of paying an honest fee . Shameful behaviour by Cleverley and Everton.

2042~~~
thread title <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2043~~~
Apparently negotiations weren't any further forward then when they first started. It just kept going sidewards.

2044~~~
It's not selfish, it's just not self-sacrificing. If it were all about money I'd understand the hysterics but he can land himself in a better situation all round by waiting.

2045~~~
It can't be about the money, he can't be on more than £40k a week at United and Villa would easily be able to match that or at least offer close to that plus he'd get a 4-year deal most likely as opposed to the final year he has on his United deal. Perhaps he didn't want to move to Villa at all or he wants to stay a year to pocket signing on fee he is bound to get next year.

2046~~~
So he'd rather sit around for a year then play week in, week out? I'm struggling to see what better situation he's landing himself in at all.

2047~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2048~~~
Aye there is, he's quite blatantly valuing a bigger signing on fee over his football career to the extent that he's willing to piss away a year of football in order to secure it. I'm not sure how that's a good attitude for a young player. It's shocking.

If he stays in the reserves for a year then he'll stall even more as a footballer when he should be tying to play regularly to get his flailing career back on track. Show a bit of commitment for goodness sake. 

He can also kiss goodbye to any hope of an England career, which is a shame given the retirement of many older players and the complete revamping of the team. A little bit of application and it could be Cleverley getting a call up instead of Fabian Delph and Jack Colback.

2052~~~
The better situation is Everton rather than Villa. The only way is down. If he goes to Villa it's hard to imagine a bigger club ever coming in for him no matter how he plays, he already has the 'failed at the highest level' tag. A club like Everton is the best he can hope for, so I don't agree that it shows a lack of ambition. Worth waiting a year in my opinion.

2053~~~
Villa were offering him similar wages and regular football. He asked for double that. Then drove to Everton apparently after Villa rejected.

2054~~~
Why couldn't Everton agree to loan him for a year and then sign him on a free next year?

NVM just seen that we only wanted to sell him.

2055~~~
Greedy bugger....despite already being a multi millionaire...he'd prefer a season with the reserves so that he can get the sign on fee in a year....disgraceful anderson level behaviour

Reports were saying Everton wanted the loan, we wanted a permanent deal. Everton know they can get him next year I imagine.

2061~~~
Pat Murphy from the BBC said.

2062~~~
Yeah, you can understand why both clubs wouldn't agree but if I was Cleverley I'd be choosing Villa, no guarantee to start week in, week out at Everton either.

2063~~~
It's obvious what happened here. We had the same thing when we sold the likes of Ruud.

We touted Clev around, Clev deliberately screwed up those deals to leave his preferred option, Everton, the only dog in the race.

Everton and Cleverley thought United would be so desperate to sell we'd let Clev go to Goodison on the cheap.

They got it wrong.

Now Clev has been left in limbo. Everton can't afford him, United and willing to let him stew even if it means losing him for nowt.

2064~~~
Tbf think Clev is playing a somewhat risky game if it's down to him. Bar injuries there's no reason for us to play him unless he really gets his head down and shines in training. Whilst he'll likely be able to push for a higher wage being a free player next season a year without football, given where he already is could be pretty detrimental for him. Plus if others step up/shine at Everton they might not want him and certainly might not want to give him big money (for them).

2065~~~
I guess the Everton deal was not attractive in any way to United...so that was that!

As for Villa/Hull, i wouldn't blame Cleverly for not jumping at the chance to play for those teams because it would realistically kill his international career dead! the second he signed the contract.

So the next stage would be for Cleverly to sign a contract with Everton/Spurs when his contract ends.

It is not the best solution for United but when they are signing 55-60 million pound players i think they will cope without a few million from Cleverly's sale.

2066~~~
won't be surprised if he leaves in January for a smaller fee - around 2m.

2067~~~
What?

Delph plays for Villa and got in the squad. Colback is in the squad ffs. There's not many good English CMs.

2068~~~
Sitting in the reserves will kill his England career dead. And it's dead anyway, what Cleverley needs to do is try and revive it by playing regular first team football rather than focusing on securing the biggest contract possible. 

And Fabian Delph just got a call up to England playing for Villa.

2069~~~
Be good to get some cash for him. Guess it'll depend on United being willing to deal, and Everton not wanting to wait til next summer.

2070~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2071~~~
I don't get Everton, for years they spend a pittance on players then all of a sudden find £28m for Lukaku, it has probably bankrupted them, well that and Etoo's wages.

2072~~~
IF the rumours are true about him rejecting Villa, demanding 80k, driving to Everton etc - then I have absolutely no sympathy if Cleverley rots in the reserves for a year.

LVG has obviously told Tom that he isnt going to be getting many games, Cleverley has decided it would be in his best interests to leave. At this point fine, no problem for any party, best result all round etc. If he has then priced himself out of moves etc to try to get into his preferred destination, at the risk of denying the club from making any money out of his sale - that is selfish behaviour and like I said, would have no problems seeing him rot. See if Everton still want him next summer if he has gone a year without any first team football shall we?

Of course, there is always the chance that these rumours are BS, so until we have some fairly reliable confirmation of the chain of events (which I doubt we will get), who knows?

2073~~~
Apparently he never went to Everton.

Still, weird that he couldn't agree something with Villa, but there you go.

2074~~~
Everton are saying he was not not due there.
Wanting 80k a week is a disgrace, should of took the same has he was on here and got the football he so badly needs.

2075~~~
Who cares. Shouldn't take minutes away from reserve team players. 
And hope we don't sell him for peanuts in Jan. Let him sit the year out and leave next summer.

2076~~~
He wanted £80K from Villa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seems like those ridiculous agent demands you get on FM aren't as unrealistic as we all thought.

2077~~~
Aye, best approach right now.

It's a shame really because everyone has lost out in this. I suspect there was a real sense of who would blink first within both parties, but as a consequence of no body budging Cleverley gets no first team football at all and we get no transfer fee.

2078~~~
Who changed the thread title? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The funny thing is I wouldn't play him for our U21s. No point taking their game time. So he wouldn't get any minutes for me, but he's done it to himself.

2079~~~
This is only ending one way, and that is with him signing a pre contract agreement in jan and leaving for nothing in the summer.

2080~~~
Why would we even bother to play him in the reserves? Surely we've got some young prospects who need to make the step up to reserve football and needing game time. 

No competitive football at any level for the next year could ruin his career.

2081~~~
Bets on him starting next game? <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2082~~~
Poor fecker rotting in the Reserves on 30k/week. Poor Tom... Shopping at tesco's tomorrow.

2083~~~
Probably scared Keane would shout at him or something.

Sad that someone his age would turn down first team football and a chance to get his career back on track.

2084~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2085~~~
If he wants to stay to fight for his United career fine.

But he has to fight, he gets into the team on merit not because he's here and 'needs games'. 

And if in a years time he's still useless then he's gone. No bullshit contract extension because 'he adds to the squad'.

2086~~~
Hope he never sees the field for us ever again, and that's including reserves. Greedy cnut.

2087~~~
He's gonna feel a bit awkward in training tomorrow!

2088~~~
Yea playing in a United team laced with top players, those five yard lay offs are going to feel a tad inadequate.

2089~~~
Signing-on fee or not, who is going to pay him 80K a week when his contract runs out?

Unless he reckons he can win over LVG, it's a stupid or risky move, considering now is a great time to stake a place in the international team.

2090~~~
I had forgotten about that. If it turns out that TC23 chose to stick it out with next to no football until the summer because of money, it shows a shocking lack of ambition on his part. Two or three midfield slots in the England team are up for grabs.

2091~~~
Why? It'll be a great day for everyone to showcase their greatest trait.

Falcao can show off his bicycle kicks
Di Maria can display his running ability 
Rooney can pop off some class free kicks
Cleverley can... Pass it sideways and make a run into unavailable space.

2092~~~
By all accounts we pay him 30 k per week, if he now spends the next 12 months in the reserves then he will lucky to get near that at another club, the only hope for him is a January move.

2093~~~
Poor old Tom, just hope he doesn't read twitter, or this forum for a while.

2094~~~
I wanted him gone and him staying just makes it awkward. It's not as if he came out saying he wants to fight for his club. He went to Villa, asked for high wages and was rejected. Went to Everton, and they didn't feel as if he was worth the transfer fee asked. 

It's absolute bollocks and it's annoying that he's still with us. He was clearly told that he isn't part of our plans, so he prefers a good wage rather than trying to make something of his plateaued career. 

No respect for him right now. Hopefully we won't be forced to using him until January.

2095~~~
Bless him, he actually responded to someone on twitter regarding the TC23 concept, and it was something he created when he was injured and had nothing to do! The players with the strongest mentalities either block out these criticisms or use them as a strength. Sadly Tom hasn't really done this over the years and has seemed to regress into his shell. He showed such promise when he broke into the first team too, which is a shame.

2096~~~
The old open both hands, scream for the ball, receive and pop it back move, quite clear why he's still here really. Hardly his fault in the grand scheme of things but he's done himself no favours hanging about, the lack of trust in his own ability is clear on field and with his decision to stay rather than go elsewhere for less and show why he's worth more.

2097~~~
It is a shame, but you would have thought he would have pushed things through today for his own good, and to avoid the inevitable, if unnecessary lash back from united fans.

2098~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2099~~~
Some good ideas from the newbies

2100~~~
I wonder if Tom realizes the backlash he's going to get from this... I kinda feel sorry for him in a way

2101~~~
We're making an example of him. Sit him on the reserve bench for a year (or at least until next January) and the next player in that position thinks twice.

2102~~~
I don't think he cares.. Nor should he.
Maybe he didn't want to play for Villa. His decision.

2103~~~
He's being unrealistic if he thinks Villa or Everton can afford to pay him 80k a week. The fans of those teams are not crying though. Villa fans are actually celebrating not signing him. Cleverley is deluded. He should've accepted a loan or a perm move on the same wages he makes at United, 35k a week, and worked on having a good spell in the team and earning that pay rise he wants. I dont feel sorry for him.

2104~~~
So does he earn 35k a week at United, and demanded 80k a week at Villa or Everton? Is he for real? Absolute mug.

I obviously never rated him as a player but he's also gone way down in my estimations as a person, too. He can't just demand over double his current wage when he hasn't shown he's earnt it what so ever. He should be happy that two decent Premier League sides wanted to take him on!

2105~~~
Louis Van Gaal has said all along that it is the players decision to whether or not they want to be at United. Maybe he feels that he can still make an impact this season. He doesn't have to sign for another team if he doesn't feel like it is suitable for him, but history shows it is very rare for a player to work them way back into first team plans when they are deemed surplus. He always has the chance to still leave this window if he wants to ply his trade in either Finland or Romania that is.

2106~~~
Is he still here?!?

2107~~~
Yep. He was supposed to sign an extension under Moyes in 2013 to bump him up to 70k but for some reason it didn't happen. I guess United hesitated.

2108~~~
Hope he doesn't get much game time this season and he finally ship him out in Jan.

2109~~~
He might want to hang on til 15' when his contract ends and leave on a free. He'll get a better sign on bonus and more teams to choose from if this happens. Disgusting.

2110~~~

2111~~~
The title <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brought it upon himself really. Had the chance to go to Villa, turned them down right when he heard Everton were interested.

2112~~~
Prisoners on life terms have higher ambitions than this one.

2113~~~
Nice to see someone not just jumping on the bandwagon. Cleverley wants to move to Everton rather than Villa which collapses because we refuse to give him a loan. Not sure how that results in more abuse for Cleverley.

2114~~~
The Ducker tweet makes sense. He's going to get slaughtered without people really knowing the entire truth on why he didn't leave today, simply because they wanted him to leave today.

Honestly, if it was between going to Villa now or waiting for Everton why we he not wait for Everton? He'll be training with world class players and a world class manager in the mean time, there are worse situations for a player.

Though if it all was about wages he definitely deserves some of the abuse he'll likely get.

2115~~~
Why would Everton sign him in Jan? They can just sign a pre-contract and get him for free in the next window. Those greedy bastard, they sold Fellaini for twenty fecking seven million pound, give some back.

2116~~~
This is how I see it.
He'll have no problems getting offers, even if he doesn't move to Everton in January. He'll be free be then, so no problems at all.

People just don't like him. But I genuinely don't think he actually thought he'd be moving away just a few months ago. So he wasn't going to rush into the first offer, especially not to a club he doesn't want to play for.

He'll almost certainly move to Everton within the next year. They're looking positive going forward, and the manager rates him highly, So fair enough if he doesn't want to go to Aston Villa.
People often forget how complex transfers are. And United just want the cash for him; they aren't necessarily going to look out for his best interests. So he needs to look after himself.

2117~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The title.

From all the players we sold today. Lawrence and Welbeck. Why are we still keeping this guy instead of keeping the two we just sold? Positive thing that his wages is very low compare to Anderson.
Still think that Tom should focus on getting more games and try to breakthrough for England squad. He should have just move to Everton straight away and I think it's the best club for him at the moment.

2118~~~
Unless they were going to throw him in a car boot or release him, what else could they do?

Everton want him, but he isn't/wasn't their biggest priority. They've pretty much spent all of this year's (and probably half of next year's) budget on a striker. They couldn't afford Cleverley.
Apparently we only wanted to sell, so even a loan there was out of the question -which frankly makes no sense, unless we're banking on Everton finding the money for him by the end of January. He may end up going there on loan in January, when they have a few injuries. 

I don't blame him for waiting. Why join Aston Villa, when the manager of a better team rates you highly?

2119~~~
Nothing, we can't do anything thanks to him asking high wages to Villa and Everton. The only thing we can do is try to convince him that you want games or no. If he wants more games then the best choice is to leave. This is probably what Sir Alex did on Gibson.

2120~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2121~~~
He is in the last year of his contract anyway right?

2122~~~
Certainly you can't blame him for looking out for himself even though he is completely unworthy of wearing the United shirt.  Anyone in his position would wait for Everton either in January or when his contract runs out so he can join them on a free next summer.  Who would want to join Villa at this juncture when they are under such turbulence.  That said, he should just train with the reserves the rest of the year.

2123~~~
Can we change the thread's name?I don't want him to take game times from some of our very promising U21s.

2124~~~
He didn't. He never entered into person contract talks with Everton. It is the clubs that couldn't agree a deal as Everton couldn't afford to match the 8m or so that Villa were offering and we weren't willing to drop the price.

You really can't blame Clevs for wanting a move to Everton who are in Europe, play great football, look really strong and have a top manager who has worked with before and rates him really highly over Villa who although have looked decent these first 3 matches have been getting worse and worse, have an average manager and have uncertainties in regards to ownership.

2125~~~
I guess I read it wrong since I heard the reason why the deal was collapsed because Cleverley asking the wage which both clubs couldn't afford it.

But still, we could at least sell him cheaper if we can sell Kagawa with such a price. So doesn't make any sense why we can't downgrade the price. Still more sense about the wages problem.

By the way I wanted him to join Everton because I think it's the best club for him to get games and getting back to England squad again.

2126~~~
Bit annoying that he didn't accept a move away, but I'm not going to get annoyed at him over it. It was his choice and we just have to accept he will be with us for another 6 months at least. We only miss out on a small fee anyway, so not a massive loss.

2127~~~
Err... Thought I'd wake up to see him gone but it isn't to be. 

Loan window is still open yeah? If he isn't begging and groveling for a loan today, I'd not know what to say.

2128~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2129~~~
From what I've read from apparent reliable Everton sources are that he never went to Everton to hold talks as the clubs never agreed a deal. He did go to Villa to hold talks but apparently was asking too much and when he heard of the Everton interest likely didn't want the Villa move. 

I don't know either as it seems it was either take a lower offer from Everton or let him go for even cheaper in January or nothing at all next summer plus the wages we'd save selling him now so I don't really understand it either. 

I'm a big fan of Cleverley myself and was hoping he'd get the Everton move too. Now he'll get minimal play here and when he does he'll just be on the end of dogs abuse.

2130~~~
Football League loan opens back up on the 7th or 8th I believe. Absolutely no chance of him taking a Championship loan. Premier League loan window shuts with the transfer window.

2131~~~
Reopen from 8 Sep but only to Championship and below.

2132~~~
Oh dear. Cheers guys.

As it is, we play fewer games this season. If everyone is fit, he isn't going to get much of a sniff at first team action, even if LvG decides to be kind to him.

2133~~~
Surprise!

2134~~~
Used to defend him in matchday threads, but he can seriously feck off right now. Unambitious goblin just looking for more money instead of progressing his fading career. People now see why he didn't make it at United, he's an unambitious money slave who doesn't give two fecks about the club that nurtured him. 


Spanish football my arse, cnut.

2135~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I love the passion of the post.

2136~~~
Can't stand the sight of this Beckham wannabe now even more so than before.

2137~~~
I am not so sure about the reports of him wanting more wages which resulted his transfer to other clubs not happening. 

However, I always feel his attitude is questionable. He was deemed as a potential youngster to take over the United midfield but due to his injury, he was never the same. He then went on to become more shite under Moyes and never regain his confidence on the pitch.

What he did during these couple of years was why I never like him. He was given chance after chance to regain back his fitness and capability but more often than not he let himself down on the pitch. He then go on and try to defend himself off the pitch with social media stating that he is not as bad as people think. Making those statements didn't help him at all when he prove to be useless/harmful to the team. Out there saying he has been wrongly blamed as the scapegoat but he did not do himself any favor to prove his doubters wrong. Saying La Liga players passing sideways are the way to go. 

I believe he overrated himself to a certain extent that he did not feel he was so poor in the first place.

2138~~~
Cost the club 8-10m. But then again, he has the right to look after his best interests.

2139~~~
Pretty sure Martinez and Everton had something to do with him backing out of the Villa deal and I presume he has a handshake agreement with them to sign a pre contract in January. Kind of shady just like the Zeki Fryers and Daniel Levy situation but I could care more if he was actually any good. Now he'll spend a season doing feck all.

2140~~~

2141~~~
What a sad waste. Just like on the football field, no bravery or conviction. There's no way he should be taking minutes off the U21s in the reserve league going forward.

2142~~~
Could we send Cleverley and a few reserve/fringe players on a season long world tour to recoup some money?

The Manchester United Tom Cleverley Traveling All-Stars!

Woody would make millions and millions.

2143~~~
Great shout <a class="username" data-user="78347, @Kag" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78347/">@Kag</a> . i wouldnt even play him in the reserves. Let him rot. He is all that is wrong with the modern footballer. More concerned with his bank balance than actually doing what he is paid to do.

He wanted 60 grand a week. Villa offered 30 and first team football.
Will there really be any difference to his lifestyle had he have chose to earn 30 grand over 60 grand? He would still be earning more money than sense.

Little rat faced idiot.

'Im more of a spanish type midfielder' on what basis Mr Cleverley? i would love to know.

2144~~~
Imagine he started the next game?

2145~~~
Love the title change.

2146~~~
its good but it should be bench reserve team performances

2147~~~
Threat title <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2148~~~
The side-pass globetrotters. I like it!

2149~~~
Send him to Spain, so they can applaud him.

2150~~~
Might see a turnaround in Tom. Pressure is now off him. There's a good player in there just a better player when not under the microscope.

2151~~~
The pressure is off him because he knows he won't play anymore. He can now sit back and enjoy the money he's making for doing feck all.

2152~~~
Pressure is off? It will be more on than ever if he plays because he rejected a move.

2153~~~
I can't be angry at him not wanting to move away, it's his right to see out his contract at the end of the day. Perhaps he feels he has more to offer and will work his way back in - possible but not likely.

It's a shame though he doesn't share the same ethic as Welbeck does.

2154~~~
Goes to show Cleverley's ambition. Hes willing to sit on the bench for a team that does not want him. At least Welbeck had the courage to take the next step. Clev demanding high wages not justified one bit.

2155~~~
Someone needs to explain to him that he's been dumped. He's like a needy clinger who just keeps crying they can do better.

I guess this is the downside of LvGs approach to give them an indication of game time and let them decide

2156~~~
I think people here are overly personal when it comes to Cleverley. He's not the player we need for our midfield, but as an England international (however that came about), he's entitled to feel he's worth the kind of wages most players in the England team are on, which I daresay is a damn sight more than 30-40k. He's also entitled not to want to move to a team of little ambition like Villa. He doesn't have to go just cos United want him gone. He may well suffer now though because I don't see many chances ahead of him - I would guess in Jan he'll sign a pre-contract with Everton and move there for nothing in the summer. He's not obligated to facilitate a return for United at all - that was Woodward's job. 

I think people need to lay off him and accept that he's trying to do what's best for him medium to long term.

2157~~~
But Cleverley isn't even in the England team...

Colback and Delph are, who earn the same amount. Surely he wants to play regular football and get back in the team.

2158~~~
I'd imagine higher wages are a higher priority to him than getting back in the England team.

2159~~~
Some of you need to wise the feck up and try and put yourself in his shoes. If we take the DM article as gospel, he was negotiating personal terms with Villa when a bid came in from Everton so he gave up on Villa and tried to chase the Everton opportunity. Which makes sense. It would be a far better move for him, working with a great manager who really rates him. Then Everton tried to beat us down on the fee at the last minute and that move fell apart. Is it really the worst thing in the world that he decided to see if he can prove a few people wrong at United, with the option of getting a move he really wants in a years time if that doesn't work out?

2160~~~
And there lies the problem. You not going to get many fans sympathise for him.

Well quite a few journos saying he wanted Villa to pay him 80k. Which is absurd.

2161~~~
This. It's pretty simple really and a bit of a shame for the player.

2162~~~
The thing is if he leaves on a free he'll get a decent signing on bonus and better wages. You can't really blame him for thinking a year on the bench is worth it when he'll make a lot more personally on his next contract. The fact is his career will be over in 7-8 years and his next contract will be the one that he hopes will set him and his kids up for life. The difference between that contract being worth say £8m over 5 years and being worth £17m over 5 years is huge for him and his family.

I could even see a January move for him, giving him the 60k a week he's after as the transfer fee will drop to around £3m. That'd work for both parties.

2163~~~
Maybe his refusal to go is a reflection of his character- he seems happy to do the simple stuff on the pitch just to be a part of the team, he never really looked like someone who wanted to become something more for us. He is one lucky bastard to play for United at this period of time, when we are (were) lacking top quality in midfield.
I was hoping he will leave us, what would be the best for both parties. I’m sure he will get a few games (Anderson got 2 games…) but he won’t be part of the main action, so I don’t know what good will sitting on the bench/playing in the reserves do for him in a year time. He won’t get another Everton offer I’m sure. IMO this was stupid for him.

2164~~~
Everton are also in the NW, and apparently he wasn't keen on moving anyway. Think he's got a kid now too.

2165~~~
Poor in terms of the clubs wanting to sign him and from us, if we were prepared to sell why didnt we tout him around earlier. Now we have him on our books when clearly he's not in LVG's plans. For me this just highlights how ridiculous football clubs are, Everton couldnt conclude the deal as they didnt leave enough time (or tried to push the price down, which we may have accepted if they bid 2 weeks ago). Really poor, feel sorry for him as it would have been good to see how he could have done with some first team football as 24 months ago he was playing well for us, and looking like a first team player.

2166~~~
The thing is that he needs to realise, he is not a 60k p/w player. He is awful yet somehow has this ultra high opinion of himself. Surely he has watched the games he has played and thought '' im actually pretty w@nk''

2167~~~
I'm sure he wanted to be paid as much as possible. I know I would, in his situation.

2168~~~
He'll sign a pre-contract with them in January and join them on a free next summer.

Unless he can radically turn his United career around in the next few months, that is.

2169~~~
This thread title (<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>) is going to look harsh when Fletch gets crocked and we start Clev & Anderson in the centre MF.

2170~~~
I don't think this is best for him in the medium to long term - it's better financially, but a year with no first team football is just going to stagnate his career further and stall his development.

2171~~~
If you people don't want Tom playing in the reserves, my Sunday league team could use a centre midfielder.

2172~~~
The cheek of Everton, to ask for a loan for a player on the last year of his contract <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Hope we add them to that list alongside Spurs of clubs we should no longer do business with, stingy cnuts.

2173~~~
Won't get much playing time. Still an option from the bench though or when others are injured which is exactly his level

2174~~~
He'll wont get any games this season. Maybe get some in the FA cup but as long Herrera, Blind, Fletcher and later Carrick are fit. He's not gonna get a sniff near the starting 11 or even bench. He should of cut his wages and joined up either Villa or Everton, too greedy.

2175~~~
This may well be a blessing in disguise. Training with the first team under LvG, watching the others etc. He may well get some confidence. I remember in his early days with us he even played a few times as a full back. Maybe LvG and the coaches can turn him into a long term replacement for Carrick.

Always felt some of the abuse/criticism he got was unfair. He may never of been good enough for us but the way he was treated by fans for someone who plays for us, nevermind the fact he came through the ranks too, was horrible. However, if these stories of him not wanting to take a pay cut are true I've lost all respect for him. I've never understood why footballers hoggle over a bit of earnings when they are going to be earning ridiculous amounts anyway. His lifestyle would not of been much different had he been earning 30, 40, 50 or 60 grand a week, surely? The most important thing for him surely has to be first team football and trying to cement his place in the England squad. He's probably ruined that for himself now.

2177~~~
It is a bit of a fecking liberty. Can't blame them for trying though. I'd really like to see us be a bit more ruthless and cunning in the transfer market, instead of just throwing money at people. A bit more like Juve and a bit less like PSG.

2178~~~
I thought he was asking for £80k per week and Everton refused.

2179~~~
You're right, obv.  But pro footy is all about the bravado/macho cobblers - 'look at my ££££ wedge' etc.  I'd settle for 10k a week meself.

2180~~~
He will be a 60 grand a week player though. Which in today's world translates to a mid table first team player. Why would anyone accept 30 grand a week when 12 months later they will earn double.

2181~~~
If you knew you would be forced to retire from your current job in your mid thirties, you'd fight bloody hard to earn as much money as possible every single time a new opportunity came up. I know I would.

2182~~~
Their's no chance of that happening, he doesnt fit in LVGs philosophy. He cant play deep midfielder, he is shocking when it comes to long balls as he simply hasnt go the vision and confidence to pull it off, and he's simply not defensive minded. Keeps making silly challenges, cant out muscle players, cant win aerial duels and his confidence is just even worse. IMO he is not premier league standard, simple as that. He has made 78 appearances and has scored only 5 goals and 3 or 4 assists.. and this guy is on 60k a week and demands the same from other clubs? outrageous.

2183~~~

2184~~~
He's dead to me.

2185~~~
I agree you'd definitely want as much as you could get. Cleverley is playing a dangerous game though.

I can appreciate his circumstances, Villa isn't as appealing as Everton. In terms of quality of team Everton is much better for 1 but also if he didn't want to move for example it's far easier for him to get to Everton than it would be for Villa (though for 80k a week I'm sure it's worth the journey!)

I think the risk ifh e sticks around at United is his stock falls quite a lot. I doubt he'll play much in first team games and he's not exactly a hugely marketable player...he won't be able to demand 80k a week and the like anyway after next year. He can leave on a free which fecks the club over a bit but I just can't see how it benefits him sticking around, the risk being he ends up getting offered a lot less than he would of done this window.

The problem he has at United is he's not progressed and just isn't good enough, if this was a regular player turning down the deals no one would be arsed, peoples views are clouded by the fact he is just lingering around and isn't good enough to be in the squad. It's frustrating as a fan to see it....in his defence it's easy for us to say we'd leave etc to salvage our career but the money will play a factor for him, football is a short career. Whilst they SHOULD have disposable income you never know what their money on, it's not that much different to us getting pay rises, still find a way to spend it. It's just their "luxury items" cost a lot more than ours.

2186~~~
Why is he getting so much stick?

Why would you move to Aston Villa from Manchester United, AND accept a massive pay cut, when in 6-12 months time you know that worst case scenario you can pick whatever club you want? Only an imbecile or someone with an irrational love for Aston Villa woul do this.

He hasn't done anything wrong at all apart from refuse to let Woodward bully him down a potentially poor career path choice.

If you want to blame anyone, it's the club's fault for trying to flog a player to teams like Villa when they only have a year left on their contract. He's not a fecking trading card.

2187~~~
Paycut? They were offering the same wages as he was getting here. Plus more importantly playing time.

2188~~~
Fabian fecking Delph have been included in the England squad and Cleverley is no where to be seen.
The England midfield for these qualifiers is largely disappointing.

That should've sent signals to him that he needs to be playing regularly.

2189~~~

2190~~~
I bet they werem't, and even if they were, that reflects worse on him how exactly?

He can be pressured into signing for Villa or wait 6 months and sign for anyone he wants, which he already knows will include Everton.

Why do you think Everton refused to offer a fee and only wanted a loan deal?

It's not that hard to work out really.

2191~~~
Erm Everton did offer a fee. Then they for some reason tried to haggle it down.

2192~~~
Agree with noods - the fact that he's getting slagged of for this is ridiculous.

Why go somewhere he doesn't want to go for not enough money, when he can go somewhere he does want to go in 12 months for a lot more money? This isn't rocket science, and Cleverley doesn't HAVE to leave our club if he doesn't want to... which is no one's fault except United's, as we offered him the contract in the first place.

2193~~~
So when Everton low-balled United and fvcked up his preferred move, he did everything possible to try and sort out a last-minute loan move (including, presumably, agreeing the reduced wage they were offering) so he could at least play a bit more football?

How un-ambitious of him...

2194~~~
We should sell him but put in some sort of weird non compete clause. Buy him and he's yours forever.

2195~~~
They wanted a loan deal.

"for some reason" ..he's got less than a year left on his contract. It's really not hard to work out.

"Yeah, we could pay you £7m now, or we could wait a bit, pay you nothing and get the player anyway"

Would you pay millions of pounds to get Tom Cleverley slightly sooner than you would by paying nothing at all?

2196~~~

2197~~~
Tbf, he still lost us much of the transfer fee probably so he can run down his contract and basically get a bigger pay packet next season.

Anyway, we left it too late with all these players. So got to take the blame there too.

2198~~~
Yeah yeah, as if all of you honest and loyal employees would immediately hand in notice at work to take the first possible option when told by your current employer that you are not needed anymore. Noway would you bite your time and go for the much better career opportunity 4 months later. 

We have wasted so much money on fees and wages over the years on some absolute garbage, but no, let's abuse a player who cost us nothing and is on the lowest wages at the club.

If the club was so concerned about missing out on money, they were more than welcome to loan him. This way at least they might have received a small loan fee. At the very least they would have saved in wages. But nope, let's give all kind of abuse to a guy who is - shock horror - doing what is best for his career.

2199~~~
How dare he have the nerve to consider his own career when the club try and flog him around like an unwanted piece of meat.

2200~~~
Btw, i am not sure why we are so keen to offload him at any cost anyway ?

He's still better than Fletcher, Fellaini and Anderson right ?


Guess Villa might be paying decent loan fee till january but still.

2201~~~
Not sure where these comments about Villa offering him a pay cut wage are coming from.

All accounts I read suggest United are paying him around £30,000 and he was asking for at least £60,000 from Villa which they quite rightly refused to pay. 

I don't think they would have been offering him something like £25,000 because that wouldn't be a discussion, such a difference in valuation would make the whole thing pointless. Besides, I've not seen anyone report that was the case.

2202~~~
Feel for the guy (to the extent that you can feel for someone earning £30k a week for playing football).

His mate Welbz, who he's been with since they were 13, is off to the bright lights of London. He's been told that he's surplus to requirements at United himself.

It's like the childhood dream is over for them, and now they have to emerge, blinking, into the cold light of reality.

2203~~~
I always wonder where people get these figures from. I've never found a plausible source for any players salaries. You do read speculation about the really big money signings, never seen anything about what we pay homegrown squad players though.

2204~~~
It's just what all the papers were reporting the salary as, which could be wrong but it's a better estimation than any other considering there are some sources behind it. Seems the right amount as well.

2205~~~
Hope league approves this deal. Will be good for him. We will be missing out on 8-9m in transfer fee though.

2206~~~
I know we might miss out on a fee due to loaning him but for his sake i hope the league accepts the loan. He needs to establish himself in the Villa team and who knows,maybe he can get a place in the England squad.

2207~~~

2208~~~
No point sending him out on loan. Why should we help him? We've lost 8m on him after we've given chance after chance while the CM rotted away.

2209~~~
Yeah, we should have loved him more before selling him.

2210~~~
Fingers crossed that it goes through.  Life is short and no footballer should waste a year sitting out.

2211~~~
Thankfully United are business and not a teenage girl so they're not going to throw away money just to spite him.

2212~~~
Oh, I don't know, because he's been at the club since he was a kid? Or how about the fact that Villa will subsidise his wages? Or because the main reason he didn't leave originally was because he dared to choose Everton over Villa? Grow up.

2213~~~
I heard £60k but you could be right. If he was asking for £80k. Was he on £30k? If true how does he value himself as going up by £50k by effectively moving down to - and although they aren't a small club - a small<b>er</b> club like Everton.

 You're probably right, shame really. & I'd probably settle for £10k myself. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> More money is always nice but if I'm earning enough to have a nice lifestyle then I wouldn't be too bothered.

2214~~~
Because he might think to himself

''hang on, im 25 now and everyone apart from me thinks im sh1t. I can sign for Villa and be a first team regular and show everyone that im a good player and rebuild this reputation i currently have. Hell i might even get back into the England team seeing as both Lampard and Gerrard have called it a day, i mean, if Delph and Coldback are getting call ups then why can't i?
If i stay at United then im probably not going to play more than 5 more games for the club. LVG obviously doesnt like me so i might end up being the forgotton man of football and when my contract is up ill be lucky to get anywhere near 60k at another club.
The best thing for me to do will be to sign for Villa, take the 30k, try to prove my worth and if i am good enough, i will be on a new contract in no time anyway.''

He basically wants money for doing F-all.
Complete and utter tit

2215~~~
Come on Villa! You can do it!

2216~~~
Let me edit that for you "''hang on, I'm 25 now and everyone apart from me thinks im sh1t (but then a lot of people are idiots) I can sign for Villa and be a first team regular and show everyone that im a good player and rebuild this reputation i currently have... or you know what, I can wait 12 months and I can sign for Everton, a team with bigger ambitions, with better players, and a manager who I have worked with before and who has genuine faith in my ability. Not only that, but I can make a lot more money for myself doing it this way... and in the meantime, I can see out my time whilst training with world class players at Manchester United. Hell, considering how many actual midfielders they have on their books, a few injuries might mean I'm right back in with a chance.

The best thing for me to do is wait for 12 months and go to a club that I want to play for and that who want me to play for them"

2217~~~
I feel bad when I look at this. It's always a shame when it doesnt work out with a promising academy player, but he simply isn't good enough.

2218~~~
Or the far more likely option of waiting 4 months and signing a pre-contract agreement with Everton whereby he gets the transfer fee they would have paid us (say £4m) as a signing on bonus and still earns a higher salary than what was on offer at Villa, at a better team with a manager that seems to rate him highly.

Hes making the decision any person with an iota of common sense would make.

2219~~~
So people are idiots for having a negative opinion of a player??? Wow

2220~~~
Or lack of desire to play.

Football is a short career. Even shorter when your out of your depth.

1 year in the wilderness is a hell of a long time and wont do his international ambitions (if he has any) any favours

2221~~~
Yeah because that was the main point of my post.

What I was actually refering to was people who start online petitions to get him out of an England squad. They're idiots. Also, from Tom Cleverley's standpoint, I imagine he doesn't really pay attention to the opinion of millions of people who call him shit (and I've been one of them), because he probably has complete faith in himself.

2222~~~
Exactly, so best make a shed load of cash out of it whilst you can.

Also, 1 year is nothing. Do you really think Jack Rodwell has no chance of ever getting called up for England again?

2223~~~
Same..

2224~~~
Good example, Though Rodwell probably took a paycut to gain first team football. Something i dont think Cleverley will do and thats the difference.

2225~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2226~~~
Can't blame them for not wanting to outlay 8m on Cleverley. He's worth about 3.

2227~~~
How's about you don't slag off homegrown Manchester United players based on hypotheticals? Just a thought.

2228~~~
I dont blame Cleverley at all. Im sure nearly everybody on here would do the same in his position.

2229~~~
But its okay for him to do the same to foreign manchester united players?

2230~~~
Ironic!!

2231~~~
That picture's sad actually. But such is life.

2232~~~
Cleverley did what?!

2233~~~
Why any feels sorry for anyone in this instance is beyond me. Cleverley is a homegrown United player, who has come up through the ranks. At the end of the day it hasn't worked out for whatever reason, but he's still played for the first team countless times, won premier leagues with his boyhood club (same as Welbeck). 99% don't make it, so he's done alright!

United finished fecking 7th last year and we have lost our opening game of the season and subsequently drawn two more. Inbetween these results, United have also managed to get knocked of the league cup in spectacular style to a team that has only existed this century. Cleverley played his worst game for us against Sunderland - sorry pal, shame it didn't work out and all that but time to pack your bags and get the feck out!

They are professional footballers, who have had a chance to play for their boyhood club. I love it when it works out and I used to feel immense pride knowing that our team was made up of complete locals but we are in a different situation. Cleverley has to go and I'm sure he knows it, he's had his chance. Welbeck didn't ever set the world alight either and while there's talk of doing a "Sturridge" look how well Chelsea have done in the mean time (albeit they had a season with shit strikers - we don't have that problem). 

Not ideal, but good business all round - for them and us.

2234~~~
What's all the moralising about, he isn't good enough, and got enough chances to show us otherwise.

2235~~~
Uhh.. What? You really think "homegrown" was the key word in that sentence.

2236~~~
No one is moralising about us wanting to get rid, you'll need to go to the Welbeck thread for that.

2237~~~
Nobody is feeling sorry for him. I guess it's a little bid sad when any young footballer realises they're not gonna cut it at the club they grew up playing for but he's still getting offers from other PL clubs. Not as though his career is over and he can't say he didn't get a fair crack of the whip at United.

There's been some really spiteful stuff posted about him as a person, though. Which is what some people are taking exception to.

2238~~~
Villa is the right move for him because he would a better chance of playing regularly there than at any of his other options. England are so short of midfielders if he could hold down a place at villa he might actually get back into the squad, the alternatives are either sitting in the stands at utd or struggling to get into everton's starting line up. He needs to play to improve his game and confidence, he would only be a squad player at Everton and he could end up spending a lot of time on the bench there especially given his current form and confidence.

It's a shame it hasn't worked out for him but he is nowhere near good enough and was given more opportunities than he deserved, i have more sympathy for lawrence who has been sold after just a couple of games I am sure he would have loved even just a third of the number of games Cleverley got.

2239~~~
It's already kind of worked out for him.

He's been a starter for United for 2 years atleast and in a championship winning run. Most academy players don't even get close to that.

2240~~~
If Cleverley is was half as good as he thinks he is, then he would still be twice as good than he actually is

2241~~~
I can't imagine the fall out at the club last night after he fecked around and wasted everyone's time.

Looks like we just pressed the button on him and got rid no matter what.

2242~~~
Don't know how you've come to that conclusion. A loan deal couldn't happen without his cooperation.

2243~~~
Fair enough, there has been some disgraceful behaviour towards him - that England petition and our own fans being knobs. My post was mainly in response to that picture of him as a United youngster. It's always a shame that they fall, but he's had a greater chance than the most and failed. 99% don't step foot on the Old Trafford pitch for the 1st team.

2244~~~
What? In any case how can he be twice as good as he <i>actually</i> is?

<span style="font-size: 22px">

2246~~~
He lived his dream playing for his club and fair dues to him, but he is an average midfielder who contributes little to the side. Villa for a year will be good for him.

2247~~~
jesus 

What the feck is wrong with some if you people?

2248~~~
Anyone having a go at him as person is not worth acknowledging.

2249~~~
TBH I think this place when it comes to Cleverley is an utter embarrassment.

He takes all manner of shit on here after every single game, as if he somehow chooses to not be good enough at football to play for United. This despite there being any number of more talented players at the club who over the past 12 months have performed little or no better than him.

I mean if a player who should be good enough underperforms then by all means have a go at them. When a player just genuinely isn't good enough, the fault is with whoever keeps putting them in the team.

Not only that but now he gets loads of shit because theclub tried to flog him, and he had enough about himself to make the decision his own. If he considered himself above Villa, he wouldn't be trying to go there on loan. He's done nothing wrong at all.

2250~~~
He was never the same after his injury that stopped his good run, but I also think he was never as good as often claimed during that run either.

But he isnt 'shit' , hes a good footballer, will do really well at Villa, will do well at Everton, he isnt good enough for a team expected to challenge for the title and the CL though, he just doesnt have that extra bit of belief to do the risky things when the pressure is on, Scholes always look for the simple passes too, but he knew when to try something else as well. Tom only does the simple stuff, he will keep a team ticking over, but against the very best he doesnt bring anything else.

2251~~~
I said the other day he's a victim of circumstance more than anything. Like you have said above, he isn't picking the team he's just selected and gets criticised as if it's his decision to be there. The problem he does have is that when things go wtrong at United it's player like him that we have to improve on and therefore his name will come up in the "shit" pile and will probably get stick. In fairness I don't see people criticizing him personally for playing more the selection of him. Him being a regular in our team shows a shocking lack of depth. Compare it to City or Chelsea and I'd guess he would struggle to make their 2nd or even 3rd choice starting 11s. It's not his fault but when he's there he will probably get some degree of stick.

I think he takes more stick than others because there was a degree of hype around him when he first came in. He did play up to it to with the branding stuff etc which is either stupid on his behalf or very badly advised. He therefore gave himself an imagine, whether fair or not, that he thinks he has made it somewhat despite him barely (if at all) playing for Man Utd. People will therefore expect more of him than was expected. Whilst in his defence he had a reason for doing it people will always be judgmental about stuff like that.

It's only natural people will get frustrated at the player, especially in the heat of the moment if they've had a good game. I think a lot of frustration with Cleverley comes from the fact he did have potential to be good enough, or better than he was, and he never progressed. Whether it's bad coaching, management or how he is himself none of us will ever know but it was disappointing to see.

2252~~~
Gone at last, gone at last... Clev is gone at last!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/11069986/Aston-Villa-and-Manchester-United-agree-loan-deal-for-Tom-Cleverley-12-hours-after-transfer-deadline-day-closes.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...hours-after-transfer-deadline-day-closes.html</a>

2253~~~
yep, wow

2254~~~
For someone who is so average he seems to inspire such extreme opinions, it is too harsh to describe him as a coward or shit but i also have no idea how anyone can think he is good enough to even sit on the bench here. His best performances are massively exaggerated and you can count on one the number of times he has had two good performances back to back. 

He only survived here because SAF was waiting to retire and moyes was so indecisive, as soon as he was assessed objectively he was forced down the pecking order, not offered a new contract and we have made every effort to get rid of him. Good luck to him at villa but we are a better side without him and in all honesty he should have gone a while ago.

2255~~~
Wish him all the best.Never quite fulfilled that potential for United . Young will get all the heat in the matchday threads now.

2256~~~
Good luck at Villa, Cleverley. That's about your level. Having said that, the little scrote's still cost us £8m.

2257~~~
Maybe not. I think at the moment only way of shifting him out is loan (i think i read somewhere you can still send players on loan after transfer deadline day) and we could agreed with Villa that we loan him until January and they buy him in January. It is unlikely but possible.

2258~~~
That's still talking about Lambert being 'hopeful' it'll go through?

2259~~~
Ive read 2 reports online that both say he is off on loan...we'll see if there is an official announcement coming.

2260~~~

2261~~~
Until January? Whats the point in a 4 month loan.

2262~~~
So we can sell him for a few million in January.

2263~~~
His level, all the best Tom.

2264~~~
Good luck to him I say. Losing two (Welbeck) from our youth system is a shame, but considering the players brought in to replace them..... I'll cope

2265~~~
Reading Percy's article, I imagine it's so they won't need to pay his full wages perhaps?

He'll go permanently in January either way. Him, Hernandez and Nani have played their last United match.

But: Anderson? Seriously? And Young?

2266~~~
Best outcome for everyone. We all know Cleverley's leaving and, at least this way, until he does United won't be covering his wages. 

It's a shame it didn't work out for him. I remember being excited to see him on the pitch. Hopefully a change of scenery can resurrect that player.

2267~~~
No one's going to take Anderson. Also people on here are way to harsh on Young,he's been descent this season.

2268~~~
He's been on descent for a while, aye.

FFS did you watch the Swansea match? He isn't a wing back.

And he's poor as a winger.

2269~~~
As much as you may not like it, we simply couldn't offload everyone in one window.. the ones gone were all wanted by others, the ones who have stayed weren't. I expect in the coming windows those that are still considered to be deadwood will also leave.

2270~~~
That's a fake account. Deal not done yet.

2271~~~
Some of the abuse he gets is just plain stupid. Good for him and United that he's gone but too much hate

2272~~~
Bugger, I've been had.

The abuse he gets on here is justified simply because of the guys attitude and poor performances over the last 12 months.

2273~~~
That's good for him, if he gets this loan.

2274~~~
Be surprised if the PL let a loan deal go ahead. I'm sure other clubs couldn't get deals through as it was too late.

2275~~~
Sadly yes but he wasn't anywhere near the worst player on the pitch

He's been ok really. I know he's a great but I've never got the hate he get's

Anyway er... have a good one Tom.

2276~~~
So is that a fake account or not? Has he left? Cleverley cannot say he wasn't given enough chances. He had the best chance anyone would get to stake a claim in our midfield and establish themselves but he decided to hide instead which is very disappointing after his fairly impressive first season under Fergie.

2277~~~
Fake.

2278~~~
Don't worry their next, Amos, Fletcher and Anderson will be out of contract and Fellaini, Valencia and Young will be shown the door in Jan.

2279~~~
I feel like the hatred/ill feeling towards Cleverley comes from the clubs perennial lack of addressing the central midfield positions after Keane left and Scholes retired twice (I'm not including the current management structure in that).   In the same way Fellaini sums up everything that was hated about the Moyes era, Cleverley represents a long period where our club has settled with mediocrity and failed to address vital positions within the team.  As a result fans annoyance at the club for not sorting out the problems gets directed towards the players that symbolise it.

2280~~~
Oh FFS! What do we have to do to get rid!!!

2281~~~
I don't disagree with anything you say here but you initially said that the club are<i> "trying to flog him like an a wanted piece of meat".</i> Why this need to make the club sound like bunch of evil goons all the time? I know it sounds dramatic and makes your point more hard hitting but also makes it looked completely one sided and biased. 


We wanted to sell a player who wasn't performing and were as entitled to do that as he is to decide which offers he accepts.

2282~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That account got quite a lot of you.

2283~~~
I'll probably watch a few games to see how he goes for Villa. Should be interesting.

2284~~~
Feck.

2285~~~
Sort of my thoughts as well. He'd had four games (inc. the charity shield) where he looked good as part of a team that was great going forward, but a bit dodgy at the back. He then got the injury at Bolton, and was out for a while. But I think it's a stretch to say the injury - which wasn't *that* serious - curtailed his career.

It's more like he was just being judged on a very small sample of games, and when he returned to play many, many more games, his proper level became more apparent.

And his proper level is 'Average Premiership midfielder'. I don't even mean that as a criticism, because the Premiership is a high quality league, and to be 'average' in it you do actually need to be pretty handy.

But he's never really looked like genuinely Top player to me.

2286~~~
I would say its things like the following, that brings people to dislike the player;

Labelling himself as a Spannish type midfielder - claiming we dont understand what he brings to a English team
Promoting his TC23 brand before he had earnt any right to do so - like he was Pele or some sh1t
His permanently angry face did himself no favours
His lack of footballing ability and lack of visable passion - just seemed happy to hide behind others when the going got tough.

You could maybe forgive all the above if you heard stories about him staying late at training as heard with Beckham, Cole, Keane, Nevilles. For 3 seasons he has been getting worse and worse and nobody ever got the impression he cared. Unlike Chicharito, who - while still not being very good - you always sensed he cared.
Clevs developed into an awful player very quickly, so awful that i was pinning for Darron Gibson to come back.

Cleverley would have done well to discuss with Fletcher how he could have turned his united career around

2287~~~
He really angered me.

I defend and defend and the cnut does that. fecking money loving spanish goblin.

2288~~~
Hasn't got the "On loan" banner on manutd.com.

2289~~~
he is gone

2290~~~
No it's not. He's a United player after all and eventhough he was poor for United, some of the hatred was just way OTT

2291~~~
not yet he's not

2292~~~
He deserves this abuse for not playing well?  Do you think if he could magically make his performances better he would not do that?

2293~~~
Any thoughts on what Villa will be planning to do with him?  Will he get to be the no10 he always wanted to be?

2294~~~
Probably just El Ahmadi's replacement who returned to Feyenoord. A squad depth signing.

2295~~~
Somewhere in the midfield 3 I'd suspect. Will be good for him.

2296~~~
Villa wanted Canales. So I'm guessing they want Cleverley as a number 10.

2297~~~
Sky: We're hearing reports that <b>Aston Villa's</b> loan move for<b> Manchester United</b> midfielder <b>Tom Cleverley</b> has been approved by the Premier League. Cleverley had also been a target for the likes of <b>Everton </b>and <b>Hull City</b> before yesterday's transfer deadline.

2298~~~
His loan to Villa has been approved...

2299~~~
is this official anywhere?   Just see twitterati so far.

EDIT: OK, Sky probably have good info here

2300~~~

2301~~~
I won't miss him.

2302~~~
I've been missing him for about 2 years. Shadow of his former self and what he could have been.

2303~~~
Glad to get rid.
Hope he does well at Villa, decent player just not for United.

2304~~~
Just looking, we still possess a tonne of homegrown players. Which is good to see.

Rafael, Evans, Januzaj, Fletcher, Lingard, Vermijl, Janko, Amos, James, Blackett, Pereira, Keane, Wilson, Johnstone...

2305~~~
Annoying we ended up with nothing for him, would have covered almost half our Falcao fee. Going to be very, very difficult bringing in money for the rest of our deadwood next January or summer.

2306~~~
Good news. Him sitting in the reserves wouldn't help anyone and hopefully he can restart his career with actual first team football where he isn't in the spotlight. Not good enough for us but good luck to him.

2307~~~
Well Anderson and Cleverly will be released next year. How long does Young have on his contract? I'm sure we'll find a buyer for Fellaini, albeit at a discount price. We're nearly there.

2308~~~
Hopefully it's until January so we can at least try sell him for a mill or two.

2309~~~
so are Villa going to pay him 80K per week ?

2310~~~
Loan can be broken off in January by either club if need be.

2311~~~
Good for him. It's crazy the expectations we put on how players should be and frown upon anytime one chooses themselves. Overall he's tried here, kept his head down for the most part and it just hasn't happened. Villa might be more his level, I think the expectations won't be as high and think he'll end up like Gibson at Everton where he just is just good - not a world beater but, a solid player for them.

2312~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> another local lad gone.

^^

Says Redcafe folk who have been calling him shit for the last year

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2313~~~
Monies. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2314~~~
Villa play last seasons top 5 in a row next. Hopefully he does some damage.

2315~~~
So, it's done. C'est la vie.

2316~~~
Good move for both clubs, and the player. He hasn't been up to much for a couple of years now. hopefully he can resurrect his career at Villa. Best of luck to him.

2317~~~
Don't mind him going for the loan deal fee to be fare. Has it been confirmed yet, by either club?

2318~~~
Think Young's runs out in 2016. Fellaini probably the year after that.

2319~~~
I don't think anyone's disappointed from a footballing perspective.

And he's from Bradford anyway isn't he? In fact I am pretty sure he didn't just screw us out of any fee for him yesterday, but he screwed Bradford City out of about seven or eight hundred-grand, as they held a 10% sell-on clause I think.

Far more of a loss for them than us.

2320~~~
So Everton or Villa can come up with the fecking money to get him.

2321~~~
Good news. Hopefully it's confirmed by either club soon.

2322~~~
We'll get a reasonable fee for Fellaini (12 - 15 m). I think Young will probably survive the cull due to versatility and be an overpaid back up for at least another year. Diving aside, I now find him less offensive than Valencia.

2323~~~
This is ridiculous.

2324~~~
You can always start a petition, or organize a march.

2325~~~
So thats 7.5 mil we'll likely not see.

2326~~~
Why?

2327~~~
Well he got what he wanted and can leave on a free. No one would pay for him in January. Just wait it out.

Glad I never have to see him again in a red shirt.

2328~~~
Are Villa mad or something? His contract expires in the summer no? They could get him for free in the summer.

2329~~~
Well they can have him for little to no fee now too?

2330~~~

2331~~~
What? Liverpool fans can't use the "at least we don't have Cleverley" argument anymore?

2332~~~
Yeah I'm referring to this January option of £7.5m. Is there any point of having that?

2333~~~
When you see that photo of Cleverley as a young boy in a United kit, it brings it home that top level professional sport is a fundamentally Darwinian business. And Cleverley made it here to the age if 25 - god knows how many fall by the wayside before they get anywhere near the first team. I always remember G Neville saying that his main fear at United was whether he'd survive from year to year (including when he was already an England international), or Steven Gerrard saying that his cousin was more talented than him but lacked the application to knuckle down when in his late teens. So good luck to Tom - he made it further than most but all the while having the public pick apart his failings as an elite level player (including me on this forum). They get paid a lot so long as they keep passing the various hurdles but, in the context of that brutal selection process which players go through, it's not easy money.

2334~~~
done dealio.

2335~~~
Best of luck Tom.

2336~~~

2337~~~
Thank goodness.  Did PL just ratify the deal?

2338~~~

2339~~~
Hope he gets his game back.  Showed so much promise...

2340~~~
Wish him all the best.

2341~~~
Good luck Tom, hopefully you turn your career around at a level that's yours. There is player in there, just needs to have some confidence.

2342~~~
So I guess his Man United career is officially over as I really doubt he's going to sign a new contract at the end of the season. Hope he does well and definitely didn't deserve the hate he's gotten. Might flourish without the pressure of playing at a big club.

2343~~~
Excellent news. Wish him all the best at Villa.

2344~~~
Season-long?

2345~~~
I'm sorry but you have to laugh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anyway, I think Cleverley will do well there. He's talented and can become a good player. He's better than he has been for us.

2346~~~
how are the villa fans reacting?

2347~~~
Wonder will Villa be tempted to play him further up the pitch? Roy Keane may not like him as a deeper midfield player.

2348~~~
Good luck to him. 

Sad to lose another of our own products but this one probably had to be done. 

Unlike Welbeck i can clearly hope he does well now.

2349~~~
Good luck to the lad and thanks for the service.

Hope you regain some mojo back.

2350~~~
Sounds stupid as his contract expires but it gets him of the wage bill I suppose.

2351~~~
Just checked and the lad was actually born in Bassingstoke but grew up in Bradford. Either way, like you said, he's not a local lad.

2352~~~
Didn't City put some clause in the Barry's loan meaning that Everton had to pay something to them if they did want to sign him, despite his contract running out? Perhaps this is just something similar.

2353~~~
Hope he does okay. Always shit seeing our players struggle.

2354~~~
You gotta wonder how much time the Villa marketing department spent photoshopping that

2355~~~
Good luck lad, try to kick the ball forward once every now and then.

2356~~~
That's what they needed the extension for. Took hours to remove the Utd stuff.

2357~~~
Good luck to him.

2358~~~
Haha. We finally got rid of him, sort of. And its a season long loan deal. And next summer we can sell him to Everton.

2359~~~
Mate of mine is apoplectic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2360~~~
Picture used is from when Cleverley scored against Aston Villa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> They photoshopped off the United badge. Sponsor I understand, but the United badge?

2361~~~
He's in last year of contract.

2362~~~
If that 10% is true, that's shit. That kind of money would have actually helped Bradford.

2363~~~
Madrid had no problem showing Chicha in full United kit, albeit photoshopped pink.

2364~~~
Even better then. We will be getting rid of him one way or the other within the next 12 months.

2365~~~
Two academy products offloaded in two days. Manchester United has truly lost it's soul.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Any biters?</span>

2366~~~
all ill say for the lad is, theres no reason why he cant reach the level somebody like henderson is at. he can still do it if he wants it.

2367~~~
Glad he's not gone to Everton as they are potential top 4 rivals and already strong.

Good luck Clevz! Prove me wrong please

2368~~~
Henderson has far bigger balls than Clevz - metaphorically speaking of course.

2369~~~
So we turned down a £5m bid from Everton to send him on loan to Villa for little or no fee. It sounds as though Woody is still pissed at Everton for the Fellaini deal last year.

2370~~~
Be happy for us for once, Barney!

2371~~~
Why would they pay for him when they can get him for free six months later? Its not like there are teams lining up to sign him.

2372~~~
My mate is fuming haha!! Serves them right for laughing at us RE Young.

2373~~~
there is at least one other team - Everton

2374~~~
Best of luck to him.

We're not going to see that agreed figure paid for him in January obviously, but I suppose a loan fee (hopefully) is better than what we were looking at this morning.

2375~~~
Delighted for him...and the team. Seriously though it's a shame it didn't work out for him here but I think he can still do a great job for a team like Villa.

2376~~~
I noticed that too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> not that they had much choice though

2377~~~
I'm pretty sure Fergie won't be best pleased atm, he persisted with Cleverley and Welbeck for so long ensuring they had gained the correct experience before being brought into the first team setup, both have now gone inside 2 days. Good luck to them both, can't say I agree with the Welbeck deal.

2378~~~
What a fantastic window. Stuff dreams are made of.

2379~~~
Both of them don't have the money. And even if Villa come up with £7m, TC is going to reject them and go to Everton for free.

2380~~~
Well our midfield got ran over by weaker opponents week in week out for years, and Cleverley does represent large part of it.

2381~~~
Fron 'Joe Allen with guts' to 'Joe Allen' and finally on to 'not even as good as Joe Allen'. That's the evolution of Cleverley.

2382~~~
We'll hardly be in a position to demand a large fee.

2383~~~
I wasn't talking about a larger fee. I was wondering why either Everton or Villa would want to pay anything for him if he has less than 12 months left on his contract?

2384~~~
It's strange. We treated Cleverley poorly and at the same time coddled Welbeck.

2385~~~
Excellent. Everton can feck off after ripping us off with Fellaini. Pay the asking price or do one!

2386~~~
Most on the Villa forum I am on are pleased enough with the signing. Some are a bit upset about him seemingly preferring Everton though.

2387~~~
Good luck Tom! 

Have to say though, I'll be much calmer about the potential team sheets now. Seeing his name on it never filled me with confidence. Now if we can just offload Young, Valencia, Ando and Fletcher sooner rather than later, the worries will be completely gone.

2388~~~
He is going there for a free next summer, which is worse.

2389~~~
Happy for Tom, I think this is a good deal for all parties. Hopefully he can gain the confidence that has so obviously been lacking in his game there and rebuild a reputation as a Premier League level midfielder.

Best of luck to him.

2390~~~
Keane is at Villa => I like Villa.
Happy they got the player they wanted over Everton.

2391~~~
Yeah but it's out of our hands then. We agreed a £8 million deal with Hull and Villa but Cleverley refused to move, prompting Everton to try and steal him on a loan or a cheaper fee. In the end he moved on loan anyway!

2392~~~
Laughable innit?!

2393~~~
Good luck to him, I don't understand the bickering about his loan move. If he goes on a free next year, it'll help his salary as well. He's been at this club since he was a kid and surely he deserves a good contract next up?

2394~~~
Best of luck to him. If he attempts to resurrect his ridiculous "TC23" personal brand though he can get to feck.

2395~~~
Bye Tom, best of luck. Can we loan out Fellaini too now..

2396~~~
Unlike Danny, I can hope that this goes well for him without a hint of cognitive dissonance. He can help Villa against all our rivals, they won't pose any meaningful threat to our prospects of CL football and maybe, just maybe, he can resurrect his United career. If only football was always this simple.

2397~~~
No there was talk about us rejecting a £5m bid from Everton. Something is better than nothing in this case.

2398~~~
The club didn't want a loan deal, it was late in the day when he decided he wasn't going to permanently transfer.

In the end they got rid regardless, and let him effectively go for free, in January he can sign a pre contract agreement with whoever and that will be that.

2399~~~
T-Shirts with "Save TC23" you could have one of his long range passes stretching from sleeve to sleeve in actual size sideways across your chest.

2400~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Did you say that when we sold Richardson.

Good luck Clever's hope he turns into a seasoned prem pro.

2401~~~
Good luck to him and hopefully he joins Martinez next year. He will do well in Martinez' system, especially as an attacking midfielder.

Most United fans here and at OT can now hopefully sleep well again, now that Cleverley, who cost us a fortune on wages and fee and who is the sole reason of the state of our midfield is gone. (that bad state which started several years before Cleverley actually started exsisting in United's 1st team squad).

Now let's all appreciate in midfield instead (everytime Blind and/or Herrera are not available) our vice captain who is as uninspiring as Moyes and worse than Cleverley at the moment, and the super bargain Fellaini whose real potential we will only see now the evil Cleverley is gone, who was of course holding him back.

2402~~~
Oh and btw, it seems the deal to Everton yesterday also didn't happen because our club was busy with Falcao and Welbeck. But yeah, let's continue abusing Cleverley without knowing what's going on!

2403~~~
I really did think he showed a lot of early promise. But his confidence went and I don't think he was ever going to get it back playing for us. Good luck to him.

2404~~~
We might be the best club in the world at getting as little money as possible for our players. He'll go for free after the loan

2405~~~
Has any United player in recent memory been hated by his own like Cleverley. Fellaini and Nani get booed but saying Cleverley's name just seems to set people off.

Its mad.

2406~~~
Thank god he's gone. His very presence on the pitch winds me up.

2407~~~
Harsh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2408~~~
Spot on - that's all about supporting your team and players I suppose...

2409~~~
Hope he does well

2410~~~
So after all the meltdown last night when it looks like he was staying and now he's finally gone. Would have rather we got a fee for him, but ah well. At least he can't frustrate me any more.

2411~~~
Case in point:

I just find it a little strange. We are all frustrated Cleverley didn't become the player we wanted him to be, and I could understand people getting miffed last night when it seemed like Cleverley was trying to do the club over on cash, but the hate...

I used to be petrified when Silvestre got near the ball in our box, but I didn't hate the guy. This reaction of pure, almost fanatical hate...I can't remember it from Man Utd fans towards our own players.

And its not just the internet fans. Match going fans also seem to have it in for him.

2412~~~
I really hope he goes on to have a good career. We had high hopes for him a couple of years ago, unfortunately his performances recently have been absolutely dire. I couldn't believe how poor he looked struggling to pass the ball more than 5 yards. Sad to see him and Welbeck go, but things had to change.

2413~~~
According to re-tweets and favorites on the official United announcement on Twitter, 574 fans "hope he dies because hes shit anyway". Stay classy lads, remember there were 11 players on the pitch last season, not just 1.

2414~~~
He wouldn't even get in the team at Everton he would be used as a squad player in a few different positions and he lacks the ability to be effective as an attacking midfielder. I see your point about fellaini and fletcher but their days are probably numbered too and Cleverley isn't really any better than either of them. This is the best solution for everyone involved and I am glad we won't see him in a utd shirt again because he isn't good enough, the same could be said about other players but there was no option but to let him go.

2415~~~
That is unfortunately too true. He wasn't good enough for United, but as a squad player he was OK. Anyway, the hate, as you say, is simply over the top and something I just cannot relate to concerning our own players.

2416~~~
I think it angered people that he was chosen to play by Fergie and Moyes even though in their mind he was beyond shit. When he played and we lost he was the cause of it and when he played and we won he had no part in it. You would have thought the poor guy personally went round to United fans houses and called them cnuts or something...

2417~~~
People are going way over the top. Also, during Fergie's reign, he was still young and promising and also a local lad, so it would be madness not giving him chances considering he had impressed at times. Now, the ship seems sailed for him. I feel bad for the lad, but ultimately I think it is the right move for him and the club, although I wouldn't mind keeping him as a squad player.

The thing is probably different with Welbeck as people have much more faith in him becoming a top class player.

2418~~~
I can't believe we got rid of Tom Cleverley.
We'll regret this.
Our identity is broken <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Good luck to him...
For his sake, I hope he does well. Keano will not have the same patience Fergie or Moyes had

2419~~~
Exactly. Given LvG's requirement for thinking footballers, I don't think Tom ever had a chance.

Those high hopes were built on 3 1/2 matches at the start of the 11/12 season. The Caf being what it is, Cleverley got the raves during that little run while it was actually Anderson who provided the quality (he was the highest rated midfielder in the PL for the first 4-5 games that season).

2420~~~
Glad this deal has happened albeit rather late. I'm hearing conflicting reports on the terms of the deal, is it a loan until January? Or the season? Also is there an option to buy?

2421~~~
One of plus points on this was getting fed up with getting the shot ripped out of me when Cleverley used to play or come on etc. mid table mediocrity should suit him down the ground.
Good luck Crab

2422~~~
Oh FFS, Cleverley gone too?!

I don't recognize Manchester United anymore.

2423~~~
Frankly I'd have rather we kept Cleverley as cover until we signed a midfielder. At worst, he's better than Fletcher IMO because he can at least get about a bit.

2424~~~
Keano is being talked about like he's the manager, he's not, Lambert ffs.

2425~~~
Oh I know. 
I mean't in terms of losing the plot 
Not in a management capacity

2426~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Why would he agree to sign for them when he'd be a free agent in a few months? I'm sure he'll think that £7.5M would sit better in his own pocket. 

Does Woody understand how football works?

2427~~~
I don't..  Hope he fails big time along with Welbeck.. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2428~~~
Yeah I know, but its annoying because he's no the manager he is the assistant!

2429~~~
Hope he does well. Not nearly so bad a player as he's looked the last while.

2430~~~
True that

2431~~~
I don't know whether this question has already been asked. Why didn't we subsidize his wages if Everton were ready to pay 8m? We could have then made a profit at least? This way he leaves for nothing at the end of the season.

2432~~~
Got a ridiculous amount of stick last night for the heinous crime of not being sold. Feel a bit sorry for him, so I hope his loan goes well.

2433~~~
Massive shame things have gone downhill so quickly for the lad. I really liked him when he burst through into the first team, and even in his second season I thought he defiantly had enough to be a long term squad player in the ilk of O'Shea, Brown, Fletcher et el. Not sure what really happened.

Good luck to him. Hope he rebuils his reputation.

2434~~~
It seems to happen to every academy player that gets brought in to the first team but doesn't look to be quite good enough for United. The Gibson hate was similar as was Richardson's and even Fletcher before he turned it around. Maybe its part of the United way. It probably seems even worse now due to the constant expansion of the internet and social media. Amongst the match goers and fans you meet in the pub the levels seem similar to the other examples in my experience.

2435~~~
Perfect move for him, without the pressure I think he'll do well at a mid table club.

2436~~~
Yeah, you're right. I forgot the Fergie's son jibes about Fletch. I guess time makes the memory hazy and, as you say, social media takes what's said drunkenly down the pub global: you get polls calling for Cleverley never to play for United or England again etc. etc.

2437~~~
Lambert and Keane will get some courage into him and build him up again. Talent wise this is his level but no reason why he can't be an important player for them.

2438~~~
Very true. What happened to the Cleverley that came on against City in the Community Shield and turned the game around.

2439~~~
With regard to the thread title I'm rather hoping that him fecking off means i don't have to "watch" him at all now

2440~~~
nope but I take my opportunities where I can..<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2441~~~
"Aston Villa reserves loan watch"

2442~~~
Hope he does well and gets a good move after the loan expires. He has real potential and has shown it several times, but for whatever reasons he hasn't been able to perform nowhere near consistently, and the last two seasons have been pretty bad. Injuries (Kevin Davies<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>) haven't helped for sure.
I remember when he was on loan at Watford and Wigan, and did really well, especially at Watford (11 goals/33 games), and everyone was thinking he had a bright future ahead of him. Hopefully another loan can bring back the Cleverley of old. At the end of the day he just didn't make it here.

2443~~~
.....<i>now </i>who are we going to blame....

2444~~~
Jonny Evans is my guess. Most seem to have already started.

2445~~~
ah yes, you're right....he's really starting to get the serpents venom...

2446~~~
Talent is half the battle. Couldn't handle the mental pressure.

2447~~~
Fellaini, Anderson, Evans, Valencia and Young are still at the club. 

So. Many. Scapegoats.

2448~~~
Best situation really; hopefully he can rebuild the character that he used to be and come back after a year hungry to take back his spot.

2449~~~
absolutely deserved.

2450~~~
I wish Tom the best.  Seems a good guy.  As much as I would like to see our youth players feed into the first team, he simply wasn't good enough.

2451~~~
you and your mama

2452~~~
Is his contract running out at the end of the season?

2453~~~
Yes.

2454~~~
After that stutt you pulled on her she aint all that happy..

2455~~~
That sucks. Instead of getting the 7mill fee from Villa we're loaning him to the same club and then eventually going to lose him on a free presumably to Everton.

2456~~~
No I think we accepted the £7m fee from Villa. But he rejected them once he knew Everton wanted him.

2457~~~
That's not what the two of yeas said when I waved goodbye

2458~~~
could be. The scum lurking on twitter and even here is insatiable. My only hope is that one day, same thing could happen to them....

2459~~~
Man, Cleverley has done himself no PR favors in his career.

Wonder if he'll be forced to play more midfield or if he'll get to attacks out wide or as a no.10.

2460~~~
Man those were not pillows!

2461~~~
Been a defender of him, so truly wish him well and hope this can kick start his career elsewhere. Some real hypocrites in here though.

2462~~~
Poor show by Cleverley and his agent. He's probably definitely going permanently to Villa in January.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/11071474/Tom-Cleverleys-agent-tests-patience-of-Aston-Villa-and-Manchester-United-as-deal-goes-to-the-wire.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...nchester-United-as-deal-goes-to-the-wire.html</a>


<b>Both Villa and United were said to have been “furious and frustrated” over Kennedy’s conduct during the entire negotiation process, which started early last week.

En route to Villa’s training ground for a proposed medical, Kennedy is understood to have told United that Everton were prepared to pay Cleverley’s wages and the transfer fee and made alternative arrangements to travel to Finch Farm, the Merseysiders’ training base.

However, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright told Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, they could not afford the deal so the move was scrapped.
</b>

2463~~~
That doesn't make much sense at all.

2464~~~
Don't see what's wrong with that, to be honest. If you were on your way to Villa and Everton came calling, you'd do the same. The only question is why did his agent think Everton were willing to pay the fee? Perhaps Everton wanted to negotiate.

Other than that this is pretty much what Berbatov did to sign for us.

2465~~~

2466~~~
Berbatov did it while being sold as well IIRC.  

First he was off to Fiorentina and everything was agreed, and they had even paid the first guarantee or something and paid for his flight to Italy which he had boarded. Then Juventus came in and hijacked the move leaving Fiorentina furious and they released a open statement.

Funny thing is before Juventus could sign and he went to Turin, Fulham came in and hijacked that as well and he decided to return to England and stay for family reasons over footballing. Now Juve were furious. 

Was such a hilarious mess.

2467~~~
Thank God he's gone. Villa can have that TC23 mess

2468~~~
I see that his biggest supporter on here, <a class="username" data-user="90268, @Red Phoenix Rising" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90268/">@Red Phoenix Rising</a> has been banned. I wonder why.

2469~~~
So does anyone know how this deal will work out for us? Is it a loan that will become permanent automatically next year in which we receive the fee Aston Villa originally bid for him? Or do we miss out on the fee, lose him on a free next year and also pay him a loyalty bonus because he saw his contract with us out?

2470~~~
I think they have the option to buy in January.

2471~~~
Is he not free to speak to any clubs in January as he would have entered the last 6 months of his contract? Hence no need for Villa to make an offer as they can already discuss terms with him.

2472~~~
Can only speak to foreign clubs.

But let's be honest, if he's on loan at Villa and they want to keep him, it won't be hard to engineer a move that works best for them i.e. offer him a pre-contract deal behind closed doors for when his United contract expires.

2473~~~
They could definitely engineer some form of deal, but I'd imagine Villa will be wary of testing United's legal team.

2474~~~
Who gives a crap? 5-8m won't make much difference for us, long or short term.

2475~~~
Don't forget Fletcher.

2476~~~
Whats up with that?

2477~~~
Good summary of his career so far and how and why it didn't work out with us.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.stretford-end.com/2014/09/united-failed-help-tom-cleverley-fulfil-potential/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.stretford-end.com/2014/09/united-failed-help-tom-cleverley-fulfil-potential/</a>

It's a strange one. He was thrown into a position of responsibility very early into his united career in a time when our midfield has been at possibly it's lowest point in decades and decades. On the other hand, few young midfielders, get so many chances at such a big club to improve themselves and make the spot their own.

If he can get his confidence back, as well all the things that made him exiting at the start, he'll do very well in the premier league for a long time.

2478~~~
Wonder what number he'll get?

2479~~~
Why do you wonder about such things?

2480~~~
His TC23 brand. 

By the way that's a decent article on Cleverley holding a lot of truth, it just loses itself slightly at the end when it picks up the latest stick to beat United with, losing it's identity selling it's youth products declaring that some have "lost sight of what their football club represents". 
If I was sceptic it's almost as if the whole article is geared towards getting that message out there.

2481~~~
Now watch him play like Xavi next time he comes to OT (or not)

2482~~~
Fixed.

2483~~~
He played more shit than gold. I remember only his duet with Anderson at the start of the season a few season ago.

But so far he doesn't seems to look arsed, not developing, and not worthy of being a Manchester United. His display against Palace is abysmal, no passion at all, feels like watching a fat kid flat track bully who play because the other kids can't say no to him.

Good F'in Riddance.

And no, I don't hate him as a person, but his ability

2484~~~
Agree on that bit regarding the article.

2485~~~
Cleverley says that bigger boys made him leave...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11677/9465443/premier-league-tom-cleverley-admits-man-utd-career-over-after-aston-villa-move" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...ts-man-utd-career-over-after-aston-villa-move</a>

While I feel bad for him since he has been at the club for many years, he didn't help himself much by saying that he was happy with his game and that the booing was only from people who didn't understand how important he was to the team. I hope he does well at Villa but his comments here make me think that he's going to do an Anderson and just settle for the ability that he has right now.

2486~~~
I thought usually players who are loaned can't play against their parent clubs?

2487~~~
Hope he does well so that someone will buy him. He is done here. Never really warmed to Cleverley at all.

2488~~~
Yes, he cant. It was more of a sarcastic comment

2489~~~
His contract expires next summer. His United career is over as of now.

2490~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78226, @Sb_16" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78226/">@Sb_16</a> Didn't realise his contract expires next summer. Silly business on the clubs behalf if that's the case. Apparently Everton offered cash for him in a permanent deal but we wanted more. Seems like a senseless act, if true of course, considering now he will walk for nothing.

2491~~~
Now, all that is left to scrap is Fellaini, Anderson, Evans, Smalling, Valencia, Young, Mata, RVP, Carrick, Fletcher, Rafael, Lindegaard and bring in som new blood!

2492~~~
It was his wage demands that held that up, apparently we had (or were fine with) accepted the offer.

2493~~~
Im sure his agent told him that he can get a better sign on bonus as a free player next summer. 

Wanker!

2494~~~
Hopefully he has a great time at Villa up to January. That way it could put Villa in a bit of a pickle - either sign him permanently or compete against Everton and hopefully a few others to sign him for free next summer. All depends on him putting in the performances to generate such interest though, so i'm not completely confident.

2495~~~
Ah cheers! I read somewhere that we demanded more from Everton. So he's looking for a scramble for his signature in order to get a bigger payday. He's becoming a dislikable chap.

2496~~~
I like how when a player we like looks for the best deal he can, the reaction is, well it's his career, he has to look our for his best interests. When it's someone we don't like, it's what a fecking wanker, it's all about the money.

2497~~~
You know this as a fact?

2498~~~
Close enough. Everton came in and tried to low-ball us. We refused. Cleverley would have preferred to go to Everton to work with Martinez so almost walked away from the Villa deal when he thought Everton was an option.

Basically he did absolutely nothing that any other footballer wouldn't do in the same circumstances but for some reason people on here (and on social media in general) are intent on portraying him as a greedy wanker who is fecking over United.

2499~~~
His agent has taken a hit in the media. It's quite rare journalists would go to print and actively blame the agent, name included. Almost like the agent is taking the hit for his client? 

I'm glad we didn't let those arseholes on Merseyside low ball us anyway. It's about time we stopped gifting them.

2500~~~
Ermmmmmmm wut? Did you read the rest of the posts? I thought we refused the offer from Everton and not Cleverley rejecting the contract. Take a look back before you reply next time.

2501~~~
We were and so we should. They made a pisstake offer after being we aware of his going rate. For all the hassle they gave us last year.. I'm glad we didnt accept it.

2502~~~
From a business point of view it's a-bit silly though if he moves for zilch when we could have made a few million.

2503~~~
This. Everton can piss off really. I'm glad Chelsea took them to the cleaners with Lukaku and I hope so does Cleverley, if they look to buy him next season.

2504~~~
I really hope he finds his confidence and has a fantastic season at Villa. No footballer deserves some of the abuse that has been directed at Tom over this past season or two. Hopefully he can prove his doubters wrong.

2505~~~
Anyone read the article on Sky sports?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11677/9465443/premier-league-tom-cleverley-admits-man-utd-career-over-after-aston-villa-move" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...ts-man-utd-career-over-after-aston-villa-move</a>

2506~~~
Agreed

I cant think of many  Utd players who have received the abuse he has. Some of our fans are dicks

2507~~~
Martinez has had a dig today saying we didn't loan him to Everton because they're our rivals and they finished in front of us. He's awfully cocky after one season isn't he.

2508~~~
Yep. He might not be the greatest footballer but it is not his fault that we were too stupid to buy some first class midfielders and had to play him as a starter. This petition against him playing in the WC has been a really awful action.

2509~~~
Wow what a smug prick.

2510~~~
Wishing him all the best, there has been some disgusting comments by some fans not to mention that stupid petition (which lets face it could be applied to any England player in the last 20 years!). It seems the comments have not stopped.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villas-tom-cleverley-twitter-7750212" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/spo...ws/aston-villas-tom-cleverley-twitter-7750212</a>

2511~~~
I'm sure Tom Cleverly will think 'Good riddance' even more when he reads some of the comments on this very long thread if he can be bothered.

I really cannot understand the outpouring of hostility against the lad. Tom did well enough for us during his time here but some of you are acting as if he should have just sucked up any old offer that came his way instead of having the self-confidence to wait and see what could transpire. There are times when waiting your chance is rewarded, other times it will not get you anywhere.

The Telegraph at present has an online article about how Tom is tired of the stick he has gotten. His perspective seems right - he doesn't feel he deserves it but it's time to move on. I disagree with the Telegraph's subtle dumping on both Tom and Louis Van Gaal by making it look as if Louis and United are desperate to get rid of Tom.

The fact is Louis Van Gaal said honestly that Tom wouldn't be playing every week if he stayed and as a lad with ambition he has to move on. Thanks Tom, some of us think the stick you received was unnecessary, hostile, and at times puerile. Best wishes.

2512~~~
Some people are just sad stupid cnuts.

2513~~~
Fans are just bunch of dick-head but If you can't deal with pressure at the top level, you ain't going anywhere. Mentality is also one of the factor separate great players from the rest.
Do people really think Cleverly got abused by fans more than Ronaldo  ?

2514~~~
It's true. Remember Ben Foster? Simply couldn't handle the pressure at United, he went to Birmingham and became Birminghams player of the season and the Players player of the season.

I hope Cleverley does impress for Villa, even if I have been pretty hard on him when he was at United.

2515~~~
The difference is rival fans hated Ronaldo because he was so good, but Cleverleys own fans hated him because he was so crap. You can understand why that would wear you down. 

I don't endorse any of the comments he received though, I really hope he finds done form for Villa. He's better than his last year with us would suggest.

2516~~~
same here. never understood the abuse he got.

2517~~~
if he walked on a free in the summer, would we get that up to 4mil compensation because he was a youth team product? or do you have to be much younger, i dont really know how it works.

2518~~~
Ronaldo got booed by Real Madrid's fans in his early day as well, for various reasons but mostly because he tended to disappear in El Classico and other big matches but he's got much better over time . 
 The point here is players is human, their performance get affected by emotion true that but the important thing is how they react to it. If Cleverly believes he's crap just because other people say so then he's really crap. I agree no one deserves to be abused from his very own fans but United don't need that weak mentality at this level.

2519~~~
Good deal for Villa if they get him on a free next summer. Certainly not a brilliant player but will do a job for them, certainly. Good business for them and I wish him all the best.

2520~~~
Did Cleverley ever get abused at matches? I can't remember hearing about it. If he doesn't like anonymous idiots abusing him directly (as opposed to non-direct criticism on this august forum) then maybe he should close his twitter account?

2521~~~
Pretty much. Having a twitter account as a footballer leaves you open to all kinds of idiots, it isnt for the thin skinned.

2522~~~
He said a bit more than that.

Not that this should be a problem. I think it's kinder to be honest with young footballers, rather than create false hopes.

2523~~~
I hate booing but if booing is what it takes to get rid of shit players then so be it.

2524~~~
The feeling is mutual. You See,  everyone wins.

2525~~~
Booing individual United players is a cnuts game.

2526~~~
So lets do a bit of resume of what happened. Cleverley is a United lad which means this club made him. This same club stick to him for years despite him being absolutely cack. Thanks to us, he became rich, he shaped a career for himself at OT which career will never be taken away from him. He thanked the club by refusing to move elsewhere for a fee and will leave, next year, for free.

Now he blames booing as one of the reasons why he left? Seriously? Why not calling a spade a spade and accept the fact that he was never good enough and that he should be thanking his lucky stars that the club had made him the player he is now and has insisted on him for so long? Average players like Cleverley are the reason why the biggest club in the world ended 7th last season.

2527~~~
He doesn’t deserve the abuse he received on Twitter and the petition but too much is made of it, he never got abuse at games and that is a much better reflection of the fans than social media where all anyone and everyone can be subjected to unnecessary and over the top abuse. Aaron Ramsey was booed by his fans after coming back from an injury that could have potentially ruined his career but he just got on with it and was strong enough to come back and let his performances on the pitch do the talking. Cleverley on the other hand was given his chance but just wasn’t and isn’t good enough and that is why he is no longer at the club, maybe the negativity didn’t help him but he also needs to look at himself and realise the majority of his performances were poor and he can’t justify it by saying people don’t understand his role or the type of player he is etc. 

Good luck to him at Villa, if he applies himself there is no reason he can’t be a decent player for them but if he doesn’t improve his performances he will find himself not playing there as well and if that happens he will find that being a free agent isn’t as good as it seemed.

2528~~~
Could be wrong but from Tom's utterances one gets the impression that he's unwilling to take his performances up a notch and is perfectly sound in his own assessment. For the record he's a very talented player, was that when he first broke into the first team and that natural ability doesn't desert someone so easily. But perhaps with him setting the benchmark at a moderate level, it's getting more in alignment with his inherent mental fragility as the same manifests itself on the field.

Might be harsh but I didn't enjoy reading these comments in particular :


No Tom you didn't have a fairly good pre-season mate. It was quite disappointing to be fair and that reflects in the manger's willingness to cut the cord. And even if you did, you shouldn't settle for that - fairly good is not the standard.

And second - the better ones are never satisfied with their own achievements nor rest on their laurels of winning a league or getting a dozen caps. You must continually seek to improve at a club like United or the halbred's gonna fall inevitably. And that's what happened.

Wish him luck though. He can still be a quality player elsewhere. Needs to be a bit more ambitious though. And hope the Villa fans are more sensitive towards him. Seems quite shy and can't take much abuse. Maybe their patience will be rewarded in due time. Or atleast that's what we hope for the sake of Tom.

2529~~~
He also said "Football is a game of opinions and you can’t please everyone." I wonder whom Cleverley pleased with his performances at OT. Apart from his family of course

2530~~~
Yeah we'd never move a player to a team that finished above us the season before who we're competing against for fourth this season... Where has he been the past 12 days?

2531~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">Its never a good thing for the reputation of a club when departing players speak of the abuse they received from their own 'fans', especially from an academy graduate. Even apart from the fact its hugely embarrassing, it can harm the club in the future when it comes to trying to sign players. If you had a choice you would rather go that extra mile for fans who you know will stick by you through thick and thin whilst you wear the shirt. That used to be part of the privilege of playing for United. Not any more it seems.</span>

Its evident United have an incredibly large number of spoiled cnuts following the club who clearly do not understand the meaning of the word 'supporter'. Every club has their percentage and we always have no doubt but nowadays with the internet and social media it feels like the minority has become the majority. These pathetic leeches are too stupid to understand directly abusing our own players does more harm to the club than it does good.

Our jobs as fans is to give support, encouragement (and if earned ..adulation..) to the players we can see have pride in wearing the badge, such as Cleverley, in order to bring the best out of them. Trust the club and leave them to decide who's good enough and who isn't.

Just to be clear this isn't a rant aimed at anyone on here but to those lowlifes who are sad enough type abuse to players directly through various forms of social media as well as those shite blogs etc.

2532~~~
What is with you text slowly getting smaller?

2533~~~
Halfway through my rant the font size got a mind of its own. Evidently didn't manage to get all of it back to normal. 

Apologies, especially if you thought you stumbled across a vision express advert.

2534~~~
I do feel bad for him. Imagine playing for your boyhood team and being the best the team could offer at that specific moment but still being hated by your fans? The guys was first choice in a season where we drew first and lost on goal difference and the season where we blitzed the league. I really hope he goes on to become a good player and honestly if he gets played regularly behind the striker I don't see why he wont.

2535~~~
I agree with the sentiment of what you are saying but the stuff on social media is pathetic and fickle most of the time and I do feel Cleverley and the media are putting too much emphasis on its importance. The real issue here is Cleverley’s performance were not up to scratch, that is something he needs to recognise and correct at his new club rather than deflect attention onto comments made on social media, negativity etc. 

He made 55 Premier League appearances for United but how many really good games did he have? I would say about 5 or so with 25 odd mediocre games and 25 where he was poor or worse. That just isn’t good enough and that is down to the player, it doesn’t mean he deserves abuse but it’s the reason why he has been subjected to it and there will be much better players who will get the same sort of abuse from their own or opposition fans.

2536~~~
I don't like Tom because after a good run a few seasons ago he never decided to push on. He's been a mediocre - sometimes worse - player who has an attitude to match. From the quotes he's served up over the past year he obviously sees himself as a misunderstood genius who would be more suited to the Spanish game. Obviously none of this is the case, he's a poor footballer. I think Aston Villa is too good for him.

The only shining light of his United career is he gives other mediocre footballers and athletes the belief that they too can play at the top level for a while and steal a living.

2537~~~
Do you lot think he'll start against Liverpool?

2538~~~
Players shouldn't be subjected to any abuse, but the truth is, players like cleverly would never get as much time any other top club in europe, it's part of the reason why we've finished 7th last season.

Cleverly is a good player and he could've been a decent squad player for us, but he simply couldn't handle the pressure of being at a top club, he crumbled under the weight of expectations. He'll make a good career in the premier league without a doubt, but he'll never go back to another top club.

It's a shame he had to face so much abuse, but that's the price you pay when you play for a top club.

2539~~~
I actually don't think he was capable of much better. I beleive that to reach the level he reached in his good games consistently he would need confidence from the support of the fans to some extent.

2540~~~
When he had his good games for United it was always further up the field. When him and Ando were killing teams at the beginning of 10/11 he was playing much higher up the field. He simply doesn't have the ability to play from a deeper position and thus his entire role in the team was the ferry the ball about to the players who could cause damage. At a lesser club playing as the number 10 he will do good with or without the fans support.

2541~~~
Paul Scholes was written off by youth coaches who saw him too small and with asthma problems to make at United. He was 13 at the time. Diego Armando Maradona was written off by Barcelona after picking a career threatening injury and ended up recovering at his own home in Argentina before moving to Napoli were the magic happened. Fabio Cannavaro was considered 'too old' and a 'liability to the national team' prior to his amazing run during the WC. Thats how great players react.

I believe that in the past years the standards has fallen at United. Coaches, Scouts and players were kept not because they were really good but only because they were fun, homegrown talent or had a good relationship with SAF. Too many had underachieved and were able to get away with it for far too long. When the fun fare was over they weren't really happy about it. Hence why all sort of excuses, 'opinions'  and talks about 'identity' are popping out from all directions about why they failed, what needs to be done at OT.

Clev should focus on his career at Villa and do his best to achieve with them. The fans weren't really the reason why a 36 year old Scholes or a 40 year old Giggs were better options then him and would probably still be better options to him in 5-10 years time

2542~~~
A player who's scored 2 goals during his United career, one of which was meant to be a cross and always chose the safe option over a forward pass is not going to be fine playing as a #10 at any premier league club. He got plenty chances to play further up the field especially when he played alongside Carrick and did nothing of note to prove he could handle the job.

2543~~~
Translation: I'm glad to be at Villa where I won't be held to a high standard. 

Don't know why he needs to come out with that to be honest especially when he's still actually contracted to us. By and large the English footballers don't handle themselves with much class, why can't he just he was disappointed he wasn't able to help the team to success last season and with the manager wanting to bring in world class's midfield talent he thought he was at the point he needed to play regularly and that wasn't going to happen. 
Instead he's just took a dig at the manager and the fans whilst making excuses for himself.

2544~~~
I think the press are making a bit of a meal of his comments in this context, and he is hardly likely to say that "LVG got rid of me because of my desperately limited performances over the last 18 months". But, all in all, he's doesn't seem cut out for the hothouse that is United and, like Ben Foster, he might prosper in a less pressurized environment. And, to be honest, I'm sure a lot of us in our work or study lives feel more comfortable at the equivalent of Villa rather than United.

2545~~~
This is what he had to say - 

I absolutely loved him when he broke into the first XI but boy this guy things too high of himself. He feels he has made it already and somehow it is the fan's fault that he hasn't been able to perform. Would love him to have a good career but I can see him get lost into mid-table mediocrity with his attitude here.

2546~~~
He's like a scared little child in that interview and clearly thick as two short planks. Just like he plays on the pitch. He just doesn't come across as a man, he doesn't talk like one and doesn't play like one. He's a 25 year old teenager.

2547~~~
Hope he can get his career back on the upward curve at Villa. Talented but timid

2548~~~
No balls, no guile, feeling hard done by.

The upward curve he thinks is coming, he will be lucky if his flatlining career doesn't take a nose dive into the championship if he doesn't pull his finger out.

2549~~~
Thinks very highly of himself, doesn't he?!

2550~~~
Dunno about that...

Could a guy with no balls single handedly win the league like TC23 has?

2551~~~
Had high hopes for him at one stage. Now, well, I just couldn't give a toss. He's turned into quite the prick

2552~~~
England's brave TC23

2553~~~
Thought they were fairly reasonable comments but of course Cleverley has never really been able to say anything to the media without getting abuse for it.

2554~~~
When you've got a agenda, even the most innocuous comments can be made to seem more than they are. Nothing wrong in what he's said but, plain to see how they can be turned into more by some of the posts.

He just couldn't find that next level for us and has moved on (will move on). Wish him the best - he tried his best but, his best wasn't good enough for this great club.

2555~~~
While I would have thought him too talented for that, his attitude has left him devoid of his early form.  At this rate he may well find himself there--a shame, really.

2556~~~
Doesn't it cross your mind that maybe, possibly, what he says attracts that abuse. Just think, ''I still got a league title and thirteen England caps'', ''the year before I won the league'', like many have said he's set his bar too low and now it's cost him his chance at the big time. Rather than say, I realise that my performances have not been good enough for some time but I aim to convince LvG through my performances that I have a place in his team, that slim chance I have I aim to utilise it bla bla bla.

2557~~~
Endless self promotion allied with being pretty average at what you do. own worst enemy.

2558~~~
No, what he says does not attract the abuse.

Well, actually guess it does, but it should not.

2559~~~
Felt sorry for him when he was still at United. He got a lot of the blame when there were others far worse, but he really does need to shut his mouth and prove himself first before he starts blaming everyone but himself.

2560~~~
Clearly showing (not that we needed much help) that he does not have the mental strength to be a Manchester United player.

2561~~~
What's wrong with what he's said here?

2562~~~
I'm really glad he's gone.

2563~~~
Listen Tommy lad, you may have a league title but we won it despite of you not because of you!

2564~~~
There's a lot of unjustified big-headedness around the England scene, isn't there?

2565~~~
I still to this day cannot understand why our fans despise our own players. The club has indeed lost its identity!

2566~~~
Twat the scousers tommy laaad.

2567~~~
Look I'm not saying it's right but when you wait every week (some even pay money for it) to watch your team play and week in and week out the same player gives gutless performances you're bound to despise them. It's not about losing or not doing well; some of us feel they aren't worthy of being a Man United player. Hope you get what I'm saying...

It just makes it worse when Tom thinks of himself so highly. This guy is the one player who I was totally wrong about. In his youth days I thought he'd be a proper midfielder for us for years to come.

2568~~~
People don't like cowards, Cleverley is the personification of what people despise, just look at Anderson, everyone knows that he won't make it, but we love him, and it's probably the same with Rafael.
Cleverley isn't a likeable player, he is always whining about his condition and never gives everything on the pitch.

2569~~~
Some of our fans behaviour towards Cleverley has been disgusting. He might not be world class but he was also nowhere near as awful as he was made out to be. I cannot see what is to be achieved from abusing one of your own players, its completely pathetic, and not just one of our own, one who was raised here from 11 years old, who loved the club and whether it was good enough or not is a different debate but he always tried his best. He wasn't one of our worst players. If we could have I would have preferred Fellaini, Anderson and Fletcher (unfortunately) to leave before Tom who is a decent squad player but was simply a scapegoat for our fans who seemed to blame him almost entirely for our poor play and poor results.

I really hope he does well at Aston Villa once he gets his confidence back.

2570~~~
Gibson did not get 5% of the opportunities Cleverly did and never played half as bad when he did get a chance, yet he received even worse abuse from the fans. Its a cruel profession when things go against you. However to the credit of the match going public they never booed a player on the pitch, internet fans are an entirely different animal.

2571~~~
Was the abuse really that bad? A few boos, and jeers and some twitter abuse, I'm not saying for one second it's right but was it really that bad?

Fellaini got similar treatment when he came on against Valencia, and has been the subject to many 'hurtful' comments from alot of fans, but to his credit he just wants to stay & prove himself, Ashley Young is another one, he gets some nasty treatment from fans on twitter but doesn't mention it, Eboue at Arsenal got some shocking treatment one game if I remember correctly but I don't recall him moaning to much about it when he left Arsenal, sure there are many others who have suffered a similar fate.

Tom just needs to move on, drawing attention to it achieves nothing, other than maybe admitting he is of weak character, like you say he isn't a bad player and should do well at Villa.

2572~~~
Every job who involves outrageous amount of salary is cruel. We're talking here about people earning 40-80k a week. That's big money. 

As said I think a number of people at OT had it too easy, too soon and for a long long time. As Scholes said, something must be wrong when a 36 year old is the best midfielder you have.

2573~~~
Pat Murphy interviewed Cleverley yesterday and didn't give him any softball questions.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026hbdg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026hbdg</a>

2574~~~
I'm amazed how out of touch the guy is with his contract on-goings. Surely as your agent works for you, he would give you regular updates on how it's going. Timeless etc.

2575~~~
He is just shy in this interview and don't want to say yes a wanted more then i earned at Manchester. And he should want more. As much as i know he was not on big contract and if we decided to keep him he would got a new contract which would be probably a double what he is earning now. Since he signed the last contract with us he became England international footballer and intergal part in title winning side just one year ago. Yes we all think he is shit and all that but he will probably be one of the better players at Villa and he should be payed for that.

It is clear to me that if Villa do not wanted to pay more to him than Everton would he will rather be at Everton and i think his agent just said ok i will try to force a move to Everton. It didn't happened because we didn't want to loan him to Everton and he is at Villa now.

2576~~~
If he wants more money, then he should cop to it, no need to tiptoe around that crap. We all want more money, sure some deluded people will call him mercenary etc like they donate their time but it will happen regardless.

2577~~~
He was really stammering through the interview and was quite intimidated by the interviewer. If an interviewer can easily intimidate him through a interview on radio, imagine playing against the likes of Toure, Gerrard, etc.

2578~~~
What a stupid post. That's like saying "woah did you see how uncomfortable Tim Henman was on mastermind? No wonder his backhand volley wasn't very good."

2579~~~
The treatment he is still getting from United fans is very poor. There was a day when United fans would give their full support to those struggling, not anymore I see.

2580~~~
Did you ever see James Rodriquez do an interview?

2581~~~
Now that social media websites such as Twitter exist, it's easy for people to directly tell people like Cleverley what they think. I think if you're a player for a big club like United, you either stay away from it or you have to learn to ignore the idiots. Valencia closed down his Twitter this week due to abuse, he isn't the first and won't be the last.

2582~~~
Damn, that was a tough interview. Thought he handled it okay to be fair, it was a difficult line of questioning.

2583~~~
This kid just needs some good PR advice.

1. Turn that frown upside down.
2. Repeat after me "I'm happy to be at Aston Villa and excited to be working with my new teammates."
3. You're 25 now, get a grown man's haircut.
4. "I can't talk about other clubs, I am only focused on the present and want to help Aston Villa in every way that I can."
5. Delete Twitter account
6. Don't mention Manchester United
7. Stop giving interviews
8. Fire agent
9. Practice and try to improve, it's a contract year

2584~~~
No doubt, stay away from it or ignore it, I agree fully but regardless of that, it shouldn't prompt United fans to hurl abuse at him.

2585~~~
He makes no sense. The buzzword in this thread and for most of his time at United is confidence. But if you listen to his interviews he comes off very confident and clearly thinks he's doing wonderful things on the pitch (the La Liga comment for example). You've heard from players who've had a rough go of it like Kagawa and Fellaini, who've come out and said they need to do better. But with Tom he genuinely seems dumbfounded as to why people don't rate him.

2586~~~
People act differently when there's anonymity through the internet unfortunately, at Old Trafford (despite what happened to Fellaini in that friendly) it's normally a different story. I was in the Stretford End with one of my brothers when we lost to Sunderland on penalties earlier this year, someone started chanting some negative stuff about Moyes and was quickly told to shut his mouth by everyone around him.

2587~~~
Agree that most, if not close to all inside Old Trafford have been great. But like you said, through social media, fans have direct access to the players and can affect them through social media. Again, the easy option for Cleverley is to stay away from it but in my opinion, that's not the issue, he should be allowed to go on an interact with his fans not expect them to turn on him.

2588~~~
I think this is a good advice to both Clev and Welbz, shut the feck up and stop make a fool of yourself. To be honest I'm amazed how careless they are, both aren't older then 25 and they both are burning bridges. Why pay their lazy agents if they don't get some decent advice about how to handle these situations.

2589~~~
First I doubt all the critics are from legitimate United fans. Secondly he has to accept that supporters have had to put up with a lot - heck even Sir Alex hasn't been immune. Thirdly if you're getting stick it's wise to get off the social media. We're in a society where the gulf is getting wider and the average Joe doesn't give a shit what Cleverly says because there is a lack of respect. Tom has not progressed and if he thinks he has, that's part of the problem. Forth lots of people are influenced by stats. Toms stats will be pretty but this is why I think some footballers are thick and if Cleverly reads this I'm sorry if it reads harsh.

You sit by LVGS side and he backs you. He told you, what he wanted and you say you could be his type of player. People walking around bemused why we're not creating when we've a group of players who time after time play the easy ball. Going sideways and backwards just to bump up their stats at the expense of the team. The reason Cleverly is out the door is because he got found out and it's a shame. Maybe the hype went to his head or he has too much money but there are very few English players who deserve any respect because very few of them actually improve year after year. They talk a good game but don't play it.

There are one or two others who are lucky to still be in the squad. I wish Cleverly well but you have to have alittle courage on the pitch and get off the social media because you will get abuse. It's obviously not just United fans as he's got stick from England fans too

2590~~~
I bet Rooney bricks it every time he plays a game, if that's the case.

2591~~~
Well, yeah.  United fans have their limit.  Naming his child Nevaeh pushed everyone over it.

2592~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I love how high that is on the list. Anyway, will he play against Liverpool? Might have a watch just to see how he goes.

2593~~~
Except for that time when Clevs said that he hasn't been good enough and needs to step it up.

2594~~~
Shhh! Doesn't suit the argument.

2595~~~
Jesus, it sounds from it as if the agent told him where to move and when to move.

'Tom, I've got you a loan to AV'
'pls m8 can i go to everton to tata martinez? he barcelona'
'No, shut up Xavi, you're not going to Everton.'
'ok'<span style="color: #ffffff">i tried my best
</span>
Plus all this stick, negativity, no winning talk. Surely, nobody supports bunch of fecking morons who went apeshit on him on the twitter but it's nowhere near being boo'ed by your own fans like Nani or Fellaini were. He's such a pussy. If he was getting e-bullied then he should've taken Tyler the Creator's advice.

2596~~~
That interview was awkward. He was clearly intimidated and didn't really know what to say. Was some difficult questions. Needed to just 'block' the questions with some dull and cliche answers (which he did try to do a few times, needed to just repeat them though).

2597~~~
That interview, wow.

2598~~~
I'm glad he's gone but I wish him luck at Villa, he will be a decent player for a mid table club. Just Anderson (going next summer at the latest) and Young now and I'll be happy.

2599~~~
Good on him for not backing his agent.

Blocking or dodging the questions, he would have been said to not being honest enough but it was refreshing to hear that he thought his agent didn't do a good job.

I have to say, I much prefer that type of interview over your typical scripted bullshit we normally get.

2600~~~
I never thought that United were a sort of half way house. I always believed that it was a top club with ambitions of being the best in the world. With such attitude no wonder why we ended 7th

2601~~~
What does that have to do with giving a player shit that is only going to make him worse not better? It takes less time and energy to get behind him than it does to give him the shit he gets. To me, it would have made more sense to support the player. Do I think Cleverley has a future at United? God no but if he was wearing a United shirt, I would support him.

2602~~~
Way too much (shit) was said about him. Yes he's not a very good footballer but let's move on. The morons who abused him all the time really made me feel sorry for the lad and that pisses me off

2603~~~
Honestly if booing was what it took to get rid of him then im glad it happened. However shit players should be offloaded before fans take matters in their hands

This is a highly earning but brutal job. Better players got criticized and rose to the occasion. If he cant handle the pressure then hes in the wrong sports. Jeez with such mentality no wonder why england do so badly in international tournaments

2604~~~
Just because the club has kept him on their books or he hasn't found a move (we would all stay at United for more money) doesn't mean he should be abused.

Questions can rightfully be raised over his mental strength and other players have used it differently but in my opinion, it still doesn't excuse the poor treatment of fans.

We were happy to stick by him in 12/13 when we were winning when he played over 30 games probably. I know he has regressed since then but the point stands in my opinion that fans should get behind the players, especially the players that need it. It was such a strong trait of the club in previous years but is slowly deteriorating with the modern game. I don't know, maybe I'm too old school to be a football fan.

2605~~~
I think that british talent are over protected and overrated. This doesnt help them to develop the character needed to become the quality players they need to become at this level.

Criticism is part of the game and its unconcievable that a 30-50k player would be immune to criticism (as long it doesnt breach the law like for example racism). An italian/spanish player wouldnt come with this BS but would work hard to do well and reclaim his place. (Except balotelli)

2606~~~
Why would they mention that when it doesn't suit the agenda? Apparently he thinks he's Xavi, and the fact that he found an interview difficult is evidence that he's a shit footballer.

2607~~~
No doubt they deserve criticism, 100% they do. I never said anything suggesting they don't.

However, there is criticism and needless abuse that helps no one. It doesn't help Cleverley, it doesn't help the next young player coming through thinking he will get that treatment if he doesn't fix our midfield issues, it doesn't help the reputation of United fans. Criticise all you want, it's an important aspect of a players development but the pointless abuse, I'm sorry but I just didn't see a need for it or how it helped the situation.

2608~~~
We live in a very precious age were players can't receive warranted criticism, it seems. If I worked in a company well above my capabilities, was extremely well paid and got criticised; I would accept it.

I agree that the abuse some trolls give him is out of order. But so what? It's clowns on the Internet, that's what they do and always will do. He needs to grow up.

2609~~~
It's the modern way. The rise of social media has made it possible to actually speak your mind to players directly. Once the bandwagon has started it's exceptionally hard to stop it, nearly everyone jumps on it. It's like the moron who started the internet campaign to get Cleverly banned from the England team. He did an interview on Talk Sport and couldn't answer why he did it. He was just being a tw@t because he could. All he could say was "he didn't think Cleverly was good enough to play for England. When asked if he thought that was up to the manager to decide he just went back and said, "well yeah but Cleverly shouldn't play for England" The guy who started it is an absolute tool. Just because he can be. And he get's 10 mins of fame from it. 

To be fair, some players thrive on this type of abuse and use it to their benefit. Beckham after the world cup came home to people burning effigies of him. He rose above it and came through it and proved everyone wrong. Ronaldo did the same and so has Rooney. Other players can't take it and it works the other way and destroys their confidence and they never really come back from it. Fellaini did similar recently when scoring after taking some of the nastiest abuse I have ever heard from a crowd at OT. Where they the same section of supporters that sang "Fergie Fergie sign him up" when fat Ronaldo scored 3 goals against United in the CL? I think not. That lot would have rather berated Uniteds players rather than recognise the genius of one individual in front of them.

Quite honestly, I think Cleverly would be best to just shut up, delete facebook and twitter or make them private to only friends and family and then just get on with his career. He really doesn't deserve the stick he has got, but unfortunately it's the way of the world where everyone wants their say and many want to be a keyboard warrior. It's really quite sad to be honest.

2610~~~
Everyone needs to comeback on earth here, as fans we shouldn't abuse him, and i don't think that outside Twitter or Facebook he received a lot of abuse, at least less than Young, Nani, Rooney or Fellaini, but he is the one putting himself in this situation. 
He has a big head for such an average player (in term of performances, not potential), he is always talking about his achievements or how he is going to improve (and emulate the spanish players) but does nothing.
In 2012-2013 he wasn't good, he played a lot in the first part of the season but disappeared almost completely in the second part (he was good against Madrid and City).

2611~~~
Criticism affects everyone. They're footballers but they're people with feelings as well. And it isn't just English/British players who are affected by criticism (which is a stupid claim), so I'm not sure why you're trying to make out that it is. 

Mario Gomez: ‘The recognition and appreciation is higher abroad than back home. They think I’m a very good player. I felt a lot of pressure before our first game against Portugal because of the criticism in Germany.  I felt under observation and didn’t play as freely as I wanted.'

Sergio Ramos: "We respect the critics, but it hurts that a section of the fans criticise you after all that we've done."

It's natural, and probably more hurtful for Cleverley as he was here from a child and loved the club. He's not using it as an excuse for not playing well either, but his performances last season were no better or worse than some of our other players who get far less criticism because they aren't used as the scapegoat by large sections of our fans.

2612~~~
No, the fact he's  shit at football is evidence that he's a shit footballer.

2613~~~
As if this thread is actually a discussion about his footballing qualities. It's far more important that he stuttered in an interview or started a brand for charity or has a shit haircut.

2614~~~
I have never said that it doesn't affect them, actually that is exactly what it should do. Nowadays players don't need the money. An average player like Cleverley is already settled for life. One of the very few ways left for a player to strive to get better is to be criticized and questioned whenever he's doing wrong. Ego is the only weak point that a young  and famous millionaire has to do better.

You may not notice but the best midfielder in England in the past 30 years has been written off since he was 13, he moved to a position which wasn't his, he had to compete with one of the best midfielders in the world and even when he made it he was (unfairly) criticized and compared with two players who weren't even near to his level (Gerrard and Lampard). The best midfielder in the world (Diego Armando Maradona) was written off by Barcelona and allowed to go home when he picked a career threatening injury only for him to come back and become a legend. Zidane was constantly criticized for his inconsistency in Italy. Gattuso was laughed at during his first season at Milan and considered as a brute with little talent. These are the defying moments that change talented players into legends.

As I said, British players are overprotected. If they do something good they are called the white Pele and all sort of BS and every excuse are made to justify why they are not playing up to the required standard. That is not good. A player need to be constantly challenged to improve. He need to feel that every bad game at a top club may be his last. That's how players improve.

Returning to Clev. I was expecting him to come out and say that he wasn't happy with his performance with United but he can do better and will utilize his time at Villa to gain VG's trust so that he would give him another chance. That's what a person with the right attitude would do. Instead he criticized the fans 'who can't appreciate his style' and found time to praise his 'fairly good preseason'.

There are plenty of examples of players who may lacked the crystalline talent but who still made it at a top club. Gaz, Fletcher, Puyol, Gattuso, Sebastiano Rossi the list go on and on. However if a person lacks the attitude and the will to prove everyone wrong then he's pretty much fecked up at this level.

2616~~~
At lot of what people think of players (generally people in the public eye) is how they're perceived/portrayed in public. How do you for instance know he's a coward? Because he kept his dignity despite torrent of abuse? And when he speaks out he's suddenly arrogant and thinks of himself highly? Which footballer doesn't? Also how you know he doesn't give his all on the pitch? Truth is, fans are frustrated at the team's bad play so in picking our scapegoats we pick on the players who are more reserved, because it's easy to.

2617~~~
As a player he acts like a coward, Cleverley "the person" is unknown to me, but the player is a coward, he refuses to take any risks on the field, he shy away when things gets complicated. And blamed everyone for his one performances. But in the same time he is proud to explain to us how he was instrumental in a title winning team (which is not true) and how he is a 12 time international. 

But maybe i am in the wrong and he is a brave hard worker with a lot of character.

2618~~~
Your comments say more about yourself than they do about Cleverley. 
BTW, he never said he was "instrumental" in a title winning team.

2619~~~
Probably, and what did you learned ?

2620~~~
I learned you get basic facts wrong and then dream up dumb conclusions because of it.

2621~~~
If Cleverley scores against Liverpool this thread will go crazy with positive vibes/

2622~~~
After listening to that interview, I'm convinced he shouldn't do another one ever again.

2623~~~
Such as ?

and maybe you're right.

2624~~~
"But in the same time <b>he is proud to explain to us how he was instrumental in a title winning team</b> (which is not true)"

You said this. He never said he was "instrumental"

2625~~~
Ah, my bad i didn't explained myself properly, he played half of the game that year and has been "ostracized" by Ferguson during a long period, he shouldn't talk about it or his 12 selections it's not a personal achievement. 
I'm maybe wrong but i think that it was Berbatov who said that he wouldn't have considered himself as a CL champions in 2011 since he was in the stand.

But yeah you're right this sentence was wrong.

2626~~~
Cleverley to score a 25 yarder against the scum today, and celebrate by running up to Balotelli, lifting up his shirt, revealing 'why always us?'

2627~~~
Has there been anymore about his contract? Last i heard was Villa can sign him on a free in the summer or for 7m in january. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2628~~~
Starts against the scousers.

Come on, tom!

2629~~~
Good luck Tom. Go rediscover yourself.

2630~~~
Looks a lot more further forward for me in the first 5 minutes or so. Is that tactical or is he trying to combat the issue of bravery he has been lambasted for?

2631~~~
I love cowards. They make the rest of us seem so much braver by comparison.

2632~~~
There is a certain irony of someone on a computer hidden from identification by an online nickname, referring to someone else as a coward

2633~~~
It's only true for the people who attacked him personally, i don't and i won't.

2634~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://images.soulpancake.s3.amazonaws.com/6bc609ef138305c96f26bd84cfece84e.jpg" src="http://images.soulpancake.s3.amazonaws.com/6bc609ef138305c96f26bd84cfece84e.jpg"/>

2635~~~
Indeed.

2636~~~
I'm happy for him. Hope he does well.

2637~~~
Playing like Iniesta reborn our Tom! 



Seriously has had a decent game so far.

2638~~~
A typical Cleverley performance, passing the ball backwards and square to keep the ball. Nothing else to say

2639~~~
Looks efficient but as usual, pointless in building attacks.

2640~~~
Here is Tom's Villa initiation. Gotta love his dulcet tones. 

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/s29eCSts0K/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

2641~~~
Good debut from Tc23. Pleased for him.

2642~~~
Tidy but little else. Usual stuff then, just doesn't look quite so blah in a weak team.

2643~~~
I think he has found his level, he played well in a system that seems to suit him. When he gets confident I anticipate him getting forward a bit more and getting a decent number of goals + assists.

2644~~~
Exactly this.

2645~~~
I dont think he'll get goals and assists, but he'll keep the ball better than most of Villa's players and that can be useful in front of Delph and Westwood. Westwood will be the one to get a few assists

2646~~~
Good shift from Cleverley... He seems to do well in a 3 man midfield..The temperament part of his play is what holds him back imo, more than technical. He is not a midfielder who can give lots of goals/assists but he can keep things ticking over. I always thought that his problem for us was that he tried to do too much all the time and never mentally looked settled during a game. Always rushing into everything. The chaos was even obvious from his facial expressions when he used to play for us. That is no excuse though and for his personal career it will be better if he plays for team like Villa and do well.

2647~~~
I think confidence will make a massive difference to his game once he re-finds it. Really felt sorry for him with how some fans spoke about him. Especially England fans such as the knobheads who started that petition. You could visibly see the lack of confidence in his game towards the end of his time at United.

Can't see him ever returning here but I wish him all the best for the rest of his career. His work rate and professional commitment has never been in doubt, so he deserves a PL career for that alone as far as I'm concerned.

2648~~~
Andros Townsend is superior.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4QPqwPkw6s?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2649~~~
Listening to that interview, Tom doesn't sound convincing at all that Villa is where he wants to be. 
Pretty much this.

Btw, anyone catch Keano on the AV bench?  Might have more grey in the amazingly awesome beard he's growing, but still looks like he could feck some shit up.

2650~~~
He really didn't seem happy when he got subbed. Didn't even smile or seem to care when he got hugged and praised by the manager as he came off. He will definitely be using this season to put himself in the window so he can get a move to another team.

2651~~~
If I were his trainer I would make him change two things immediately,

1. i would stop him from kicking the ball with a follow through like beckham. he needs to learn how to use his feet (both of them) to pass the ball in different ways..not just in one god awful style. 
2. i would make him stop pointing to his feet and asking for the ball. he should expect it to come to him. instead he should use that energy to sneak a look around to see whos coming to tackle and who he can pass to when/if he receives it.

2652~~~
Many people don't realise how good Cleverley could still be. I tend to think he himself is one of them. He has gone off track and lost confidence but technically he is very good.

2653~~~
That's what i think too, he has everything except the mental, if he can find a coach who believes in him and is capable of changing his mindset he could be very good.

I really hope that Martinez will come for him, next year.

2654~~~
Yeah, it's a bit silly. Sure, it's stylistic, but it really hinders his game. He doesn't pass quick enough, and he's far more dependent on his right foot to pass as it's the foot he uses to follow through to do so. It's fine from a dead ball, but in attacks and recycling possession he really needs to stop it.

2655~~~
Can't believe he (reportedly) turned down Valencia. Think he would have really flourished there. Beautiful city as well.

2656~~~
It doesn't sound like there was any truth in that rumour.

Otherwise, I agree; it would have been perfect for him.

2657~~~
Probably didn't fancy being on the bench every game as he's nowhere near as good as their CMs

2658~~~
He is better off at villa because he will actually play, he wouldn't get in everton's team and if he is going to improve he needs to play. I really don't get the idea that he is technically a very good player, he is average and I don't think he will ever develop into anything other than a solid player for a team like villa. The role today suited him, keep it simple, stay in position, work hard etc, he can build on that and improve but there just isn't loads ability or potential for any manager to unlock.

2659~~~
I'm sorry but this is completely fecking stupid. So players shouldn't talk and ask for the ball? They should be silent and expect everything to happen telepathically because talking uses up so much energy? feck me, he should stop asking for the ball to feet. Mind blowing training right there.

2660~~~
So many hypocrites wishing him well now. I didn't see the match but nice to see him play and do a good job, especially against Liverpool.

2661~~~
He's still not United quality. Never was and never will be. I still wish him well though and hope his career is fruitful, I just hope it's at another club.

2662~~~
I don't think that those who were critics of him at United that are now wishing him well at AV are hypocrites by default. I didn't see him as a United first teamer, but am sure he did his best for us, it just wasn't to be. If he can go on and have a good career elsewhere then great- much as most of us are happy that Howard is doing well at Everton and Ruud won La Liga with Real, for example.

2663~~~
Not his critics, I think everyone was critical of him but I mean the people saying they wish he would just feck off and never want to see play again, coward this, coward that etc.

2664~~~
Ah OK, fair point, but last season did bring out the worst in a lot of fans. Hopefully in the cold light of day they are realising that he is not a bad guy and are genuinely wishing him well. Hopefully.

2665~~~
Agreed.

2666~~~
That being said, it does seem to some weird kind of nervous tick with Cleverley. Of course, if he were any good, it wouldn't be annoying...

2667~~~
He seemed so good mentally when he first broke through. Always seemed like he knew what he wanted to do with a ball before he received it.

2668~~~
Potential was definitely there for young Tom 3-4 seasons ago but there's not much potential left in him any longer.  He was meh at best today and he clearly looks like a footballer who believes he's too good for Aston Villa.  Unless he gets his head out his arse, he's going up slide down to the likes of Palace.

2669~~~
I still blame his reality-TV wife for all this..  I've always stood behind him(kinda) and wish him well at Villa. The start was magnificent and hopefully he can stay healthy and prove his worth.

2670~~~
Cannot believe I'm saying this but...He had a better debut then Welbeck....Despite being invisible in the last 40 mins of the match!

More importantly, Keano's beard <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2671~~~
agent tom.

2672~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What is it and us when a player is sold??!?

2673~~~
Oh man, that is already an old news. Keane is Keane. Keane is probably feck all AV players and now they are turning into way better team than previous seasons even without Benteke.

2674~~~
I didn't watch Aston Villa yesterday. But I thought Welbeck did well. He put a pressure on Kompany and tried to win it which lead Arsenal first goal. His chance hit the post was unlucky since it was inside the post. Some decent movement from him as well.

2675~~~
Him bouncing off Kompany, while Kompany sneered.....Them times?
His chip, instead of smashing it home?
His movement was static up front...He' not a stirker unless Wenger changes him.

Wrong thread though

2676~~~
I thought that was good for him to do it on Kompany since no Arsenal players were trying to give a pressure on him.
Yeah he should smash it. But Danny is Danny. He loves chip the keeper. Wenger might need to do something about this. 
His movement wasn't that bad. But wasn't great as usual. Decent I would say. 
Yeah wrong thread. lol

How did Cleverley do then?

2677~~~
Talk about Welbeck another time....

Cleverley literally was his usual self.....So ordinary and average....He played a forward pass in the first half and I lost my shit over it...Says it all

2678~~~
If that's what you saw from Cleverley. And judging for the one I saw on Welbeck. I don't think Cleverley had a better game than Welbeck yesterday. How about the other AV midfielders? Did they play any better than Cleverley?

2679~~~
Do we really need to rank players or rate certain performances above others. Cleverley now has what he needs (distance away from the scrutiny of playing for United), from all reports put in a decent display but we are all trying to find a way to discredit it. Good on him I reckon.

2680~~~
I'm glad he did well. He looked comfortable in the Villa team - put in a good defensive shift too.

2681~~~
Much better

2682~~~
you need to watch football. go and watch the best players play and see how often they point to their feet and ask for the ball - how often scholes, xavi, iniesta, zidane did it. and then go watch cleverley do it as if its pathological. and then come back and we can have a discussion about how players should ask for the ball and how cleverleys hands perpetually pointing to his feet is probably not the right way to ask for the ball.

2683~~~
never played or coached have you?

2684~~~
have..i know that making yourself available for a pass and asking for it is different from always yelling at players while pointing at your feet. never watched cleverley play have you?

2685~~~
clearly you have never played. Stick to playing FIFA14

2686~~~
yes you know me personally so you would know that.?!! its funny how people here have trouble making a coherent argument without trying to insult people.

2687~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTuqqn3Ym2o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This video reminds me of what we all saw in Tom. When he's playing well he's such a good pass and move player with such good energy. Hope he comes back to us able to influence games like this again. The diamond and it's fluidity was made for him

2688~~~
The mobility was completely sucked out of the midfield in the last few seasons. I honestly think he could do a pretty good job with our current setup deputizing for the midfielders advanced of the anchor. Herrera or Di Maria. That anchor itself needs to be more of a mobile player than Fletcher and Carrick.

2689~~~
does anyone really think he will come back? I cant see it, especially after probably going for Strootman. He wont be happy to be a squad player here, he will go to Everton or another midtable Premier league club. In his place i would go to a La Liga club or Bundesliga club, some clubs will surely have interest in him from these countries.

2690~~~
Of course he isn't coming back. We wanted to flog him but only had loan offers. He's out of contract in July and can talk to clubs in January. Hes gone. Thank god.

2691~~~
Just replied to the guys before me, they seem hopeful of him coming back. I dont want him near our team too. He had his chance and failed miserably.

2692~~~
Theoretically it can happen. The club might offer him a contract if he does play well for Villa, who knows? I mean it isn't going to stone wall happen. He was hung out to dry a little bit last year by Carrick playing this hand holder role for the two CB's and being asked to do literally the entire middle third pressing and defending and when we had the ball he was often left isolated by Carrick who refused to show for any kind of return pass on the quick one two transition. Then I think he was torn off the line and dragged behind the shed by the dog in this 3-5-2 system that misfired with Fletcher. He did more defensive work in the Sunderland game than the actual deep lying defensive midfielder. (Fletch)

I don't see why he couldn't deputize like I said for Herrera and Di Maria. The way the contract and the loan have panned out he's virtually backed into a corner now and more than likely leaving.
Fashion statement.

2693~~~
'Who needs Wesley? We've got Cleverley' 

good times

2694~~~
What a ball, should be 1-0 to Villa.

2695~~~
He puts in a great corner. I don't know why he never got to take them here over the dross the likes of Young and Nani consistently delivered.

2696~~~
Good corner but showed his true colors again later. From what I'm seeing, he's really not United qualaity

2697~~~
Put in a few Beckham-esque set pieces today. One that should have resulted in a goal. Since Arsenal scored 3 goals, they've controlled the game, and he hasn't really seen much of the ball.

2698~~~
Was he injured towards the end? Hard to tell the difference to be honest. Villa's about his level - hope he never comes back.

2699~~~
Iirc he took quite a few corners for us, most resulting in hitting the first defender.

2700~~~
He took plenty. His corners for us came down with snow on them.

2701~~~
Didn't stand out in a distinctly average Villa midfield, selling this guy is going to be a challenge.

2702~~~
Tom's contract is expiring next summer.

2703~~~
The only player for Villa who shouldn't be too disheartened with his performance on the day. He was decent.
Positive with his passing, secure on the ball, involved in a good bit of whatever play Villa had, and the most active defensively of all the midfielders.

2704~~~
I feel now that he's on another team, his good moments will stand out more even if nothing is actually any different

2705~~~
Sometimes I wonder if people actually watch the game or just come in here to make the usual fashion statement comment about how hard it will be to sell him, passed sideways, cowardice etc. I mean even more daft that we won't be selling him seeing as he's out of contract at the end of the season. So, well played there.

He actually played really well. The extra responsibility that he has now is making him a little more free, he wanted to take people on and take the ball forward whenever possible and also play those snap pass one twos on the counter and surprisingly enough people were actually passing back to him after his advance. A few solid deliveries into the box as well which is a bit of a change in his game, had not really known him to be solid over a stationary ball. This three man role is going to help him alot and if he can maintain his form and not get bogged down if the team start to decline as a unit then he'll have gone some way to getting back some of his lost credit.

2706~~~
He'll be at Everton next year. Martinez loves him and will give him a chance.

2707~~~
He's always had quite a mean cross on him, but rarely got to try it for us.
Odds on, gotta be.

2708~~~
1 good free kick, a few decent corners. He was in a midfield that had 29% possession the whole match and contributed 2 shots on target, 1 of which was his set piece delivery. Yeah that's a good match...

Only thing else I remember from him was failing to pick up Welbeck in the lead up to goal one when Welbeck dropped into midfield to pick up the ball and the other midfielders were pressing.

Maybe I am suffering confirmation bias and only remembering his non moments but as I said, did not stand out for me in average midfield. At least Delph drove forward and produced the only other shot on target when Villa has some impetus.

2709~~~
Im watching the Villa game now...hes been wank.

2710~~~
He's been tut in this match. If he thinks he's going to get loads of clubs after him as a free agent next summer he needs to think again because he's no good.

2711~~~
I barely noticed he was on the pitch. Harsh/difficult to judge while he's playing in that game plan though

2712~~~
I did notice him. Gone hidding. Im sure Keane will go ballisitic over his effort to prevent 1st goal.

2713~~~
I did ntoice him. Did nothing to prevent first goal. Gone hidding.

2714~~~
He wasnt that bad in that match. City dominated the midfield and were very tight at the back. This is a match for defensive midfielders (for villa) to shine in my opinion. He did delivered one very good cross for Weimann.

I think villa lost that match due to the removal of Richardson and Nzogbia. They were wasteful indeed, but they kept City midfielders back a bit.

2715~~~
I noticed him once when he got fouled.

2716~~~
I noticed him when he was angry that the ref gave a foul against him.

2717~~~
Once I heard his name three times in15 seconds or so, before he pit a cross in which weimamn missed. That probably was his best spell in the match.

2718~~~
He's doing alright at Villa. His level.

2719~~~
I'm starting to think he's not even good for the likes of Villa. It's disgraceful at times when he walks around the pitch like Cristiano fecking Ronaldo!

2720~~~
Just seen the Toure goal on MotD and Cleverley has to do more there. I've never really had a problem with Tom because even if he didn't play well for us he always tried his best but looked like he didn't care there. One of those moments where your average punter from the street could have done better simply by making a nuisance of themselves.

2721~~~
He was okay. I think that sums up his ability in general.

2722~~~
his level is the relegation battle but he doesn't have the stones for it. Championship title contenders is maybe his level.

2723~~~
I think Villa's performance against Shitty sums up Tom Cleverley, put in 110% and still not good enough.

2724~~~
Only caught the last 30 minutes but genuinely didn't know  he was playing. In fairness, the same could have applied to all of Villa's midfield from what I saw. The first goal was bizarre. I initially thought Toure must have dribbled through a challenge or shifted the ball and got the shot away too quickly, and that it was a really good goal. On the replay though he just sort of jogged forward and casually kicked the ball into the goal when he realised no one was going to bother getting in his way.

2725~~~
Faded towards the end but I thought he did quite well until then.

2726~~~
How dare the world class talent of Manchester City play better than Tom Cleverley in an Aston Villa. Some people need to take their agendas and do one.

2727~~~
He was poor for their first goal, but lack of reaction from few other Villa players was embarassing too and they all could be blamed equally, altough that can't be an excuse.

2728~~~
He's mediocre in one match for them against better players when he's been fine for them previously and now he's only good enough for the Championship. Interesting.

2729~~~

2730~~~
The PL runs scared.
Gives me a warm glow everythime I think and realise that we actually sold him.

2731~~~
Seems to be taking the step down in the right way. If he actually held the same opinion of himself as a lot here do he'd have given up football this summer.

2732~~~
You must lead a pretty sad existence if that is the case.

2733~~~
He is on loan so technically still our player. Although his contract runs out at the end of the season and he can join Villa for free.

2734~~~
Strange guy from internet that must be a right laugh at parties has to know right?

Don't spoil it.

2735~~~
Funny that Cleverz wants a more attacking role, because I personally see him more of a defensive minded player, and it's no surprise that, even with Delph in the team, Cleverley has made the most tackles and interceptions out of the Villa centre midfielders. 

I do agree that he's better in a midfield three, though. Ironically, his best performance last season come against Villa, in my opinion, when himself and Giggs rotated between the holding and box to box midfielder role, and it's in one of those  positions I personally feel Cleverley is suited to more than the advanced role. He's energetic, he gets stuck in and keeps the ball ticking over, with his short, quick passing. I just think he hasn't got that final pass to become the more advanced role.

2736~~~
Why did we loan Cleverley and sell Welbeck...

2737~~~
We wanted to loan Welbeck out but Danny wanted a permanent move.

2738~~~
WUM?

2739~~~
<i>“I want to be more advanced in that three and hit both boxes.”</i>

2740~~~
And we wanted to move Clevz on permanently but could only find a team willing to take him on loan.

2741~~~
Does he ever turn down an interview? Less talk and more assists, son.

2742~~~
Aye, was just gunna say he certainly knows how to talk a good game.

2743~~~
People would appreciate Tom's inverviews more in Spain.

Where nobody would understand what he's saying.

2744~~~
Well done Clev. I'm going to just go and read an Ander Herrera interview now to remind myself that we finally offloaded you and brought in a real midfielder.

2745~~~
This guy is a joke. He leaves United and still wants to try and better himself? Jesus Christ this guy is a disgrace to football. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes out and pays people to interview him!!!!~""£"$

2746~~~
Wow, the guy goes to a new club and a local newspaper wants to interview him. A disgrace to football?. Your comments say more about you than they do about Cleverley.
The guy isnt good enough but really the hate just continues. Its as though he slagged off the Utd fans, the club, his team mates the way people continue this shite.
He is gone, get over it, I am sure you are perfectly capable of finding a different player to hate now.

2747~~~
I thought his post was sarcastic...

2748~~~
All this local talent, Man Utd identity only applies to Welbeck. Some of our fans are blatantly idiotic.

2749~~~
Good point, I have probably got this completely wrong

2750~~~
He is indeed being sarcastic. IIRC Blue always red is a fan of Cleverley like myself and because of the constant shite spouted about Cleverley from others he now makes sarcastic comments like above to mock the idiots who are serious with their shite.

2751~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's actually hard to tell nowadays.

2752~~~
and I owe you an apology!!

2753~~~
Nothing wrong with whatever Cleverley has said here. Some people need to give him a break, the bashing of Cleverley is extremely tiresome.

2754~~~
Why is it that everytime I read an interview for Tom he's trying to make excuses for himself? I really think he just has this odd inflated image of himself as a footballer. His skills are very average and basic, that leaned on the edge of potential coming through a United academy. No it's not the system of the team, no it's not the lack of a midfield 3 holding you back from 'hitting boxes' and no you wouldn't do better in a spanish side. A good professional footballer has the technical and physical capabilities to ADAPT. Cleverley just seems like he's in serious denial. He's working hard to stay relevant though, props for that.

2755~~~
Well, you never know, he might remember back to when he didn't shit himself every time he reached the opposition's box at Watford and Leicester and start scoring a few goals.

2756~~~
Yeah, standard interview really, not sure how it has managed to annoy people.

2757~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px">Tom Cleverley could return to Manchester United after Aston Villa loan, says club's academy director Brian McClair </span>

Manchester United academy director Brian McClair has refused to rule out Tom Cleverley making a successful return to Old Trafford when his loan spell at Aston Villa finishes.

Despite being allowed to leave the club on loan this season by new boss Louis van Gaal, McClair has suggested Cleverley could resurrect his career at United. 

Upon joining Villa, the 25-year-old vowed to put the negativity that marred his final season at United behind him, and prove wrong those who doubted his ability. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2794557/tom-cleverley-return-manchester-united-aston-villa-loan-says-club-s-academy-director-brian-mcclair.html#ixzz3GGxRx69c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...emy-director-brian-mcclair.html#ixzz3GGxRx69c</a>

2758~~~
I was getting worried, it had been at least a week since the last "Breaking News" on Clevs.

2759~~~
He really might come back. Wouldn't this make sense as our midfield rotation next year if we're in the CL and playing this diamond we seem to be into now?

DiMaria--Herrera
------Blind------

Signing--Cleverley
------Carrick------

with Valencia, Fellaini and Anderson all gone, maybe Pereira on loan getting 30 starts playing against adults and Fletcher as depth and still around to provide a veteran presence while playing as often for Scotland in qualifying for Euro 2016 as he is with us?

2760~~~
No. It's completely nonsensical. He's a 5-6/10 midfielder on a good day. Even our backups should be 7-8/10.

2761~~~
Not just Clevs. Evans, Smalling, Valencia, Young, have regressed. That's worrying, because they had potential when they started.

2762~~~
He won’t come back, he is only on loan because permanent moves to Villa and Everton fell through, if we could have sold him we would have done and his contract expires at the end of the season anyway. He would really struggle in the diamond, he isn’t suited to it in the slightest, Valencia is a much better option as backup until we add more options in midfield. It would make no sense to bring him back no matter what formation we are playing because he just isn’t good enough and he doesn’t have the temperament for this level.

LVG had a good look at him and decided he didn’t rate him and even though he has been ok at Villa it’s fairly clear that he is playing at his correct level and he isn’t even any better than Delph or Westwood. I hope he has the sense to sign for Villa so he can play regularly and carve out a decent career for himself as it is the best option for everyone involved.

2763~~~
I'd be delighted to let Cleverley go on a free and get Delph on a free.

2764~~~
Didn't Cleverley look good in the diamond the few times Ferguson tried it in his last season?

2765~~~
'He came from Bradford when he was 12. At 16 we didn't offer him a scholarship. He stayed at school and he worked as hard he possibly could, while still at school and at the end of that two-year period, because he had developed more physically, he had a professional contract.

'He's gone on from that to represent his country and to play many games in the Premier League.'

He's actually made a good career for himself when you stop acting like he's pissed on your kids. Not good enough for us eventually but good enough for a decent premier league career.

2766~~~
ll this talk of him coming back after his loan, but isn't his contract up at the end of the season? This would imply we'd offer him a new contract. Seems unlikely, unless we just want to get a fee; but why would Cleverley put himself in that position? He can get much, much higher wages if he goes on a free. Probably the only chance he has of matching his Utd salary at a mid-table club (that or a hefty signing on fee).

2767~~~
Correct. He made a spectacular prediction last season that Cleverley will become a top 3 midfielder on the world on a few years. And yep, he was serious.

2768~~~
I thought Cleverley and Kagawa looked good as right and left midfielders in the diamond, personally. I wrote at length on my desire for us to continue that formation.

I thought it was a good fit to his attributes in midfield. But we did struggle at times to deal with width when defending.

2769~~~
It is. After reading this thread i'm actually about to take a nap

2770~~~
Am I the only one here who don't longer care about anything related to Cleverley? He won't play for MUFC ever again (as his contract ends and won't be prolonged for sure whatever McClair said). Neither he's United legend like Neville or Solskjaer. Well, not even Welbeck-like controversial transfer it is.

2771~~~
That's how I feel. He won't play for us again and isn't good enough to strengthen a rival. I'm happy to forget about him tbh

2772~~~
I care. I'm always interested in our graduates. Not being good enough for Manchester United does not mean he is some kind of failure, in fact we should be proud of the amount of players we have with other clubs. They continue to be representatives of our establishment.

2773~~~
So, don't come into his thread?

2774~~~
I remember we played it against Newcastle, we tore them apart the first half an hour or so, they then changed their formation and it was a pretty even game.

2775~~~
Cleverly hasn't set Villa on fire has he. I think we may end up giving him away.

2776~~~
I don't think we have a say in the matter, his contract is up next season, he can leave on a bosman and I'm more than sure Uncle Martinez already gave him a pre-contract agreement to keep under his pillow until January to avoid paying us any money to buy him this summer.

2777~~~
Anderson played at the tip of the diamond and scored a goal didn't he? Fun game.

2778~~~
Can't see Martinez wanting him. Unless he sees something we don't.

2779~~~
With all due respect I'll go into whatever thread I want.

2780~~~
Well then you're not going to forget about him are you?

2781~~~
Come to think of it he did, though I was thinking of a different game against Newcastle. When Cleverley scored a cross at St James' Park.

2782~~~
Yawn. Please stop talking to me.

2783~~~
Good post.

2784~~~
We can't let him go, think of our identity. Won't someone please think of our identity!

2785~~~
He will go to Arsenal on a free and become their next Viera. And then this place will explode!

2786~~~
He's exactly what Arsenal need too. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">sarcasm</span>

2787~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> imagine this place if that happened

2788~~~
I think Cleverley gets a lot more stick than he deserves simply because of how weak our midfield has been in the last few seasons. Worse players have played for us before but because we weren't really dependent on them it didn't really matter. It's only because Cleverley was a fixture in the first team due to lack of better options that he's held in such disdain. If we'd signed someone like Herrera a couple of seasons ago and Cleverley had remained a squad player I reckon he'd still be pretty popular.

2789~~~
I think LVG agrees with you, or he wouldn't be on loan right now, but I think he'd be fine as our 6th CM, though his contract expiring is another massive reason against it.  

If the plan is Di Maria and Herrera in front of a CM, we need another starting quality player (Strootman and Vidal the most linked names) to rotate/compete with them/combing with them when LVG wants to play differently in certain games.

But we also need depth. Either one or two of Valencia, Fletcher, Fellaini or Anderson stay, or we sign a player who is willing to play sparingly, even if we promote one of Pereira, Pearson or Rothwell rather than loan them out to get 30 starts.

2790~~~
Cleverley to make an emotional final swansong return to United, I think not!

2791~~~
Yep. Always nice to see our graduates doing well in other teams. Usually, commentators would always mentioned United's name when talking about them.

2792~~~
I'd rather have Cleveley in our team than any of Fletcher, Anderson, Valencia or Fellaini but I don't think he's coming back. He's better of seeing out his contract and signing for Everton in the summer. That would be an excellent move for him and his career. May even get back to the England team.

2793~~~
I think he was a beneficiary of the lack of quality rather than a victim of it, he won a league title and made over 50 appearances in the Premier League only because there was such a lack of quality, if he had been competing with better players he would have been sold a long time ago. He got an opportunity he didn’t really deserve and our academy has/will produce better players who won’t get as many games as he did. 

It does look nailed on he will join Everton but I think Villa is a better option for him, he has more chance of playing every game there and more chance of getting back in the England set up as a first team regular at Villa than he will as a squad player at Everton

2794~~~
That's true, I suppose it works both ways. I do however think that had he not been thrown into the mix in the way he was he'd be a better player now. The knock to his confidence he got when it became clear to himself and the fans that he wasn't up to the job is what really saw the rot set in. Before that he wasn't outstanding but he was easily good enough for a bench-role.

Anyway, I hope the Villa move goes well and he has a good career from here on in.

2795~~~
That is a fair point he did regress and there was clearly an issue(s) with his temperament or attitude which affected his performances, maybe that could have been dealt with differently and prevented the regression. At the big clubs now it is very much sink or swim though and if you don’t take your chances eventually you don’t get any more, rather than dwelling on things he needed to look at how Darren Fletcher went from being ridiculed to a key big game player who’s suspension form a Champions League final was seen as a massive blow.

As you say hopefully it all goes well for him at Villa, he can play every week, go under the radar a bit and rebuild his confidence so he should be ok.

2796~~~
That makes a lot of sense. I think an on form and confident Cleverley, as we've all seen in recent years, can do a good job as a box to box midfielder, especially with Van Gaal's philosophy. Unfortunately, I don't think Cleverley will be happy with a squad role, and like Welbeck, wants to get more starts.

2797~~~
I have to say that the open loathing towards one of our own players is baffling…

Personally, I hope he finds form and comes back a better player.

If not, then I hope he finds a club and has a good career.

2798~~~
Totally agree on loathing bit. The chances of him returning are remote unless he has a stormer of a season. His contract runs out in 2015 so it will be up to him anyway.

2799~~~
Thee single greatest insult I have seen aimed at Cleverley is the fact he closes down players. When Rooney does it, lord Jesus Christ what a team player but when Cleverley does it... Even if he becomes a revelation in the 10 role at Villa I don't think he particularly wants to return, given the fan response to hearing him leave.

2800~~~
Typicsl fam mentality. Ruled by heart and not by head. He was not the only one to get the stick too. Most of those who were slated to be stars under Fergie, him, Welbeck, Hernandez have been for one reason or other shuttled out of the team. The frustrtation with Moyes rubbed off on the team and given the big opportunity, Cleverly in particular disappointed everytime.

2801~~~
Yes, he was disappointing in quite a few games. I think most fans would agree.

But do you think slating your own player is logical?

I don't.

</ul>Tom Cleverley may have called time on his <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> career after selling his custom-engraved club watch.

The midfielder, who is on loan at Aston Villa from Old Trafford, has sold his one-of-a-kind Manchester United timepiece to a pawnbroker in Blackpool.

Cleverley looks to have cashed in on the Hublot watch which is engraved with his name and United squad number of 23.

The Blackpool-based pawnbroker is looking to sell the watch for £17,500 and advertising it as the only one ever made.

Cleverley has been at Manchester United since he joined as an 11-year-old back in 2000, but looks like his career at Old Trafford may have come to an end after he signed for Villa on a season-long loan deal.

The midfielder has featured in five games for Villa this season – but only been on the winning side once, in his first game against Liverpool.



Bit weird if he sold it for the reason he wasn't going to play for us anymore, considering after he captained us on the pre season tour he even said "Despite what happens now (obvious reference to his future) I can now say I have captained Manchester United, nobody can take that away from me" so it's a bit weird to sell a custom player only watch, obviously not for monetary reasons, who knows why he did it..

Who really cares I suppose tbh, it's a watch.

2803~~~
He'll have loads of United stuff. Probably just clearing stuff out and thought he'd get rid.

2804~~~
Why people sell that. He earns that money in a week, why then sell a your watch for 17k?

Less than 17k if the broker is selling for 17k.

2805~~~
Probably lost it in a card game

2806~~~
Obviously bitter about how he's been treated since Van Gaal came in. You'd think that would be a treasured possession for a young player that's been at the club that long but similar to Danny, being rejected by the club you love can be painful.

2807~~~
He's actually done well at Villa and is their most frequent ball winner, showing a vast improvement to his defensive game. He averages winning the ball over 5 times a game with tackles and interceptions so far in his games for them. He's unlikely to save his United career but if he keeps it up he can still be a good CM in the premier league and for England.

2808~~~
Thread name change to Tom Cleverley - sell watch.

2809~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2810~~~
Who the hell is going to spend 17k on that?! Fair enough it's a genuine Man Utd watch that maybe would tickle the fancy of some ridiculously rich United fan who likes pointlessly expensive watches, except the fact it used to be Tom Cleverley's which then removes all of it's value to any United fan.

2811~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yes.

Cleverley just sold his watch. Cleverley just SOLD his watch.

2814~~~
Can he sell himself next

2815~~~
I don't like him as a person even

2816~~~
Why would he sell his watch when he probably makes more than he got for it a week? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2817~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2818~~~
Usually, footballers are good eggs with stuff like this and auction it for charity.

Bad form.

2819~~~
Forgot he existed until the commentator suddenly mentioned his name tonight. How has he been doing?

2820~~~
He was ok tonight. Nothing special, but was effective. Basically he's performing at a decent level for a club who are mid table.

2821~~~
Did his part defensively, held his position and made one or two good tackles. Aston Villa didn't see much of the ball, instead they defended very deep and you could say that this kind of games don't suit Cleverley. But the truth is he didn't try to get on the ball and help his team ease the pressure off a little bit by recycling possession in the midfield. He attempted two dangerous through balls in the second half but they got intercepted.

2822~~~
Basically he's performing no different at Villa than he did with us but at Villa with far less scrutiny he can get on with it. At United or any big club if you're out of your depth you stand out. Doesn't mean he can't still go down a level and be an asset.

2823~~~
Doing the same sort of thing for Villa as he mostly ended up doing for us (averaging out the better and worse spells): can pass the ball, can run around a bit, rarely makes a bad mistake, rarely produces a standout moment. Which is good enough to be a regular starter for Villa at the moment.

2824~~~
How has he been in relative to the other midfielders there like Sanchez, Westwood and Delph?

2825~~~
Pretty nothing player, its clear now. He's no better than the other mid table to relegation team's midfielders.

2826~~~
He's improved his defensive workrate (or efficiency) because he's been Villa's main tackler this season (Lowton averages more, but only played 3 games)

On the ball he's Tom Cleverley

If he continues to add to his game defensively he could probably come back and make it as a squad player. But will he be okay with a couple of games a season and no England career to speak of? Unlikely. Expect someone to take him though

2827~~~
He's definitely found his level I think. But I hope he does well with them.

2828~~~
He runs around a lot, doesn’t really do anything of any significance good or bad, gets too close to players demanding the ball with his arms out then passes it back to them or sideways too much but has a good work rate and is doing a decent job. 

Hopefully he joins Villa permanently, he can play every week, have a decent career and we get some money for him, I think he will leave for Everton on a free in the summer though and end up on the bench there. For 10 teams in the league he is probably a decent, solid CM, for the other ten he is either a squad/backup player or someone who shouldn’t even be used unless there is no-one else.

2829~~~
Hope he goes to Everton in the summer, I think a new lease of life under Martinez could be just what he needs.

2830~~~
Hope we sell him in january, so we get some money for him.

2831~~~
He's not coming back - at the moment Herrera is not even getting a game so we have no need for him at all.

2832~~~
He is one of Villa's best players. Not sure whether that is a compliment though.

2833~~~
Not happening and I struggle to see why anyone would welcome it. He failed here despite numerous opportunities. 

No team thats expecting to challenge for EPL and CL trophies has room for a Cleverley even as a squad player. He's so average I'm nodding off as I think of him....

2834~~~
If we need a squad player and an academy graduate who know how to defend, let's play Ben Pearson.I'm sorry to see it happened but Cleverley is done at this club.

2835~~~
He's not good enough for Everton.

2836~~~
Spot on, why bring him back to sit in the stands every week and get in the way of other promising players coming through, it's still hard to believe anyone would think he could or should come back based on his performances for us or Villa. Good luck to him but pleased he won't play for the club again as he just isn't good enough.

2837~~~
One thing about him that really annoys me, he screams for the ball, demanding for a pass. Then when he gets it, he just gives it back to the player who passed to him. I mean, what's the point of shouting for the ball when you don't do anything with it?!

2838~~~
He doesnt seem to stand out for Villa - the term "found his level" seems to be very apt.

Shame given he seemed to have such potential a few years ago, but thats football.

2839~~~
I'm glad he is not at United anymore and surely van Gaal will not want him back from loan. He is just a fitter and slimmer Anderson with less skill. I hope his career improves but he is what I have always thought since he broke into the first team set up, very average.

2840~~~
Was thinking the same, don't see how he'd get into their team atm.

He never really had what it takes to make it at this level. Even by general PL standards he an ordinary player.

2841~~~
Watching him today, at home against one of the worst teams in the league, you'd think he'd really be trying to take the opportunity to show what he can do. He's just become a midfielder who does nothing, doesn't really play forward passes and thinks he's doing well because he keeps possession. But then when teams actually press rather than stand off, he's not the one to show any strength, skill or intelligence to keep the ball in a difficult situation and allow his team to get forwards.

2842~~~
I thought he'd thrive for a mid-table/lower table team and actually do well, but he seems too tentative to do anything. Just looks like a complete nothing player a lot of the time.

2843~~~
Pass 'n' move, pass 'n' move, pass 'n' move, move 'n' pass to vary it up a bit . . . but to what end?

2844~~~
Just doesn't really add anything; it's obviously a completely mental thing, he's a decent player technically, but he's just lost the capacity to take responsibility for doing anything difficult.

2845~~~
Yeah, he's nothing special but has some half decent passing ability and is okay on the ball. Just lost the will to do anything with it when he plays it seems, lacks any risk to his game.

2846~~~
It's like a really devolved form of Herrera, really.

2847~~~
I wonder if his personality off the field is just as devoid of any character as he is on it.

He might be the ultimate nothing person if so.

2848~~~
He would not suit a relegation battling club at all. He's the type of player who when a new manager comes in and sees him, instantly out of the team. He's got no character to survive at that level.

2849~~~
Funny you say that, because from what I've seen from Cleverley today, he's actually tried a lot more adventurous balls than he normally does.

2850~~~
He's been fairly good today. I'm all for varying opinions on this forum, but if people can't see that it's been a fairly good performance from him today then they're clearly not seeing things objectively. 

And now he's just been subbed looking slightly injured.

2851~~~
So, will we get some money for him in Jan?

Can't believe Villa tabled an £8M bid for him and it didn't go through as he wanted to go to Everton. Ended up at bloody Villa anyway.

2852~~~
Can't believe some people on here have said he's playing well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He doesn't stand out in a very average villa squad, I really can't imagine why any United fan would want him back here.

2853~~~
Didn't he see him produce absolutely anything today. Saw him try a few passes that weren't on, and lots of sideways and backwards stuff. Against a poor side.

2854~~~
He's been anonymous. Only heard his name mentioned once or twice.

2855~~~
Had the most touches of the ball on the pitch, the most passes of anyone on the pitch and more key passes than anyone. If you didn't see him then I have to question if you are actually watching the match.

2856~~~
That because he is playing in the EPL. In Spain he would be considered the next Iniesta and Xavi all wrapped in one player.

2857~~~
Yep watched the entire match. Can't say he was particularly influential.

2858~~~
Not sure what opta consider a key pass, but if he produced anything worthy of that name I must have missed it.

2859~~~
Today was particularly bad, he's mostly done a good job as a ball winner for Villa this season (and sideways passing on the ball) but today he made 0 tackles and 0 interceptions so he cant really point at that for being his contribution to the game...

2860~~~
Agreed he wasnt that good today, but it was nice to see him try a few through balls.

Still the only reason i would want him back is to have him ahead of Anderson but i don't even want Anderson here anymore

2861~~~
I only watch bits of the game today but I've watched him a good few times for Villa this season so far. I was one of those who defended Cleverely the longest on here because I believed in his potential and we had seen it in bursts, also there were games where I thought he was good for us but was unfairly criticised and singled out at times.

 I expected him to rise to the challenge at Aston Villa, after shrugging off the pressure he was under here but he's added very little to their team, when he should be embracing being one of their better players. He's not a player who will ever be impactful or particularly influential, games simply tend to drift him by and he does a few ok things here and there but he's not really standing out in any way. Maybe it is a mentality issue because there are several examples of average players standing out and making a difference at smaller teams.

2862~~~
He isn't good enough for Everton let alone us, even if Villa are ahead of them now.

2863~~~
He was poor. Today showed for me why he's not more adventurous in his play because when he did try a difficult ball it rarely came off and he was wasteful in possession in terms of passing forward.

I think we all expected too much of Clev after his successful loan spells and the hyping up by managers. When he started playing for us he was very tidy and intricate with his passing and most people were saying how when he becomes a feature of the team he will impose himself more and look to create openings and take players on but the more time went on the less it seemed to be likely to happen and in reality all we had was a tidy player who kept things simple and could come up with the odd goal. Also in his loan spells, he did play further forward almost as an attacking midfielder, here he was asked to play a much different position and was dropping deeper and deeper which didn't help his game. For England, he was allowed to push further forward and he looked good for them.

2864~~~
Hopefully both will be gone in January or summer neither should be anywhere near our club tbh.

We could use both their wages to give de gea in his new contract it would put de gea on about 180-200k a week which is far more deserved

2865~~~
I doubt it - there's no point for anyone paying for him when his contract is almost up, plus it seems he rejected the chance of a permanent move in the summer in favour of either a move to another club (Everton?) next summer, or more likely a bigger wage/signing-on bonus, so if that's correct then he probably wouldn't co-operate with a move anyway that sees us get a transfer fee for him.

He'll go for free next summer and we'll get feck all.

Hopefully his injury today doesn't keep him out too long though.

2866~~~
He looks like an Aston Villa player playing for Aston Villa.

Still not sure why he gets so much stick on here considering he's never actually done anything wrong other than try hard but not be good enough. There's a massively long list of people who deserved more shite than him for United's season under Moyes.

2867~~~
I completely forgot that it was only a loan deal and not a permanent transfer.

2868~~~
Out of contract in the summer so it may as well have been.

2869~~~
I haven't seen the most recent Villa game but I saw the one against Burnley. Thought he was pretty good offering movement and passing. Made me think that he could be of use here when the loan finishes, but that was just one game. 

Edit: have always been a believer in Clev, and believe that he would work well under the system LVG is trying to implement.

2870~~~
His refusal to leave permenantly last summer leaves a poor taste, the outcome will be the same but we won't get any money for him now as well as paying his wage.

Fair enough he could say he doesn't want to leave and think he can make it at United, he'd just be wrong.

Doesn't even stand out remotely in the Villa team.

2871~~~
I'm not sure how that's his fault at all either considering it's the club who let his contract run down. He can do whatever he wants, which happened to include not letting the club shoehorn him into a permanent deal with Villa when he knew Everton would be interested in getting him on a free next summer...adding to that Martinez is someone he's worked with and played well under before.

Why would you tie yourself down to a permanent deal with Villa, with a pay cut, when you know you can carry on with the same wage for a year, play for Villa anyway, then sign for whoever you want in a year's time? Only an idiot would do this. So much so in fact that the fact the club even tried it makes Woodward look like a thicko.

Not to mention that according to Manchester United "money is no object", so why does it suddenly becomes an object when trying to offload Tom Cleverley? So much so that the fans feel the need to direct abuse at him? What's he actually done to harm United by not leaving on a permanent deal?

2872~~~
He's already gone, in my mind. That loan was the end of him and he's not winning a new contract so I couldn't care less how he does, just like Welbeck. He's an average footballer who looked pretty good once but hasn't stepped up since and actually regressed. Cost us at least £8m and a squad position for a number of years so I'll be glad once he's officially gone. Simply not good enough for a team like Manchester United. We can't afford to carry passengers anymore now you've got a very strong Chelsea and City around, and (a lot of) the rest of the PL has better midfielders than him.

2873~~~
Villa doing better without Keano. Hope it'll benefit Cleverley too. He can still contribute to United until his contract runs out or he's sold.

2874~~~
It's not that he's doing bad at Villa, in fact he's one of their better players but the problem is a Manchester United midfielder should be looking like a star within that team, especially someone who is played in a creative position with Westwood in behind him.

2875~~~
I'm not speaking about fault, I just find it irksome, of course he is totally entitled to see out his contract and make decisions that have the best financial and footballing impact... But we took him at 11 and gave him his career in football, even when he was out for 7 months at a young age and being debated for renewal  Fergie stuck with him right the way through his loan spells and ultimately rewarded him with the career (club and international) that he has.

We give a lot of players careers in football, not always with United but in the premier/lower leagues, he seems bitter of the situation (pawning his club ring?) and I always get the impression he thinks he's better than he is and deserves more... When in my opinion he's already been given more than most.

Money's no object is a statement directed almost entirely at the intake and retention of new or valued players - cleverly is neither... So of course we want the best economic outcome.

If you're abstracting the money is no object argument to keeping sub standard players in an overstocked area then why don't we just decrease ticket and shirt prices? Money is no object!

Nice chap, very average footballer, 5/6 in all areas... Not good enough for United and not willing to accept it with grace, rubs me is all.

2876~~~
I thought his contract ran out at the end of this season, so if by contributing to United you mean not playing for us for the rest of the season, then yes, I'd have to agree with you.

2877~~~
It was a watch and we don't know if he pawned it or not anyway. The pawn broker never said he got it off Cleverley himself. The players likely get new watches every year or even several a year, he could easily have given some to friends and one of them pawned it.

2878~~~
A minor point!

I also heard he called Cathy a slag and said he was twice the player Keano was.

2879~~~
He doesnt look out of place at all at Villa. That says enough.

I dont think circumstances at United ever really helped him - he doesnt fit very well in a 2-man midfield because he doesnt do anything particularly well. But if you put him alongside a couple of specialists (eg a Ball Winner and a Goalscoring midfielder) then he will tick things over pretty nicely and add to the team, he just cant be relied on to make the impact himself.

2880~~~
yeah he always looked like he was born to play for Villa.

2881~~~
Apparently, he's serving his yellow card ban against us, even though he's not allowed to play against us anyway.  Well timed that.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2876018/Tom-Cleverley-serve-suspension-against-Manchester-United-despite-banned-playing-against-former-club.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...tml?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490</a>

2882~~~
Surely his ban should carry over to the next game if he's not eligible to play anyway?

2883~~~
thought this too.

2884~~~
Might be a tricky fixture for us now

2885~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2886~~~
He's been very poor this season when I've seen him for Villa. To the point where I wouldn't be surprised if he falls further over the next couple of years.

2887~~~
I have seen him against QPR (for about 40mins) and I think that he was their best player....

2888~~~
Over the course of the season he has been their most consistent player. His recent two performances have been poor, but he's the only player (I think) to start in everyone of their games this season.

I've come to terms with the fact he's not United standard, but he's definitely a lower-half PL footballer.

2889~~~
I just saw something about Keane blaming Cleverley for cooking up stories about a player bust up at Villa. Its the Sun and I can't read it. Stupid paper talk?

2890~~~
There's a thread discussing this incident if you care to look around.

2891~~~
Think we should change the title to "Tom Cleverley Neighborhood watch"

2892~~~
Thanks.

2893~~~

2895~~~
if that story is true, i'd have been shitting bricks if i were tom. the thought of keane storming my house, including hopping a wall to get at me is enough to keep me awake at night.

2896~~~
Finally pegged him. Cleverley is basically a shitter version of Jamie Redknapp.

2897~~~
I've seen some comparisons on here before but crikey, poor Tom <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2898~~~
He's one of those players that'll be playing in the championship in a couple of years then he will just disintegrate into nothing.

2899~~~
Can this be true?

I'd bite their hands off for that money!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-set-sign-manchester-4845067" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-set-sign-manchester-4845067</a>

2900~~~
That sounds ridiculous. £7.5 million to make sure that he doesn't sign with a foreign club before he's allowed to put pen on paper for Villa?

2901~~~
More ridiculous than the fee is the assumption a foreign club would want to sign him.

2902~~~
Very good! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2903~~~
Or that Villa do.

He's not stood out there, in fact one Villa fan I know describes him as 'the most average player he's ever seen' and can't stand the fact he plays regularly.

2904~~~
Quite a few Villa fans on their forums criticising him for passing backwards too much.

2905~~~
The loan deal was rushed through instead of the permanent deal that fell through so I assume there was a fixed price Villa would have to pay to keep him beyond January, I still expect him to run his contract down and then sign for Everton though.

He isn’t good enough to get in their team though so I hope he signs for Villa and we get some money out of him, £7.5m for someone who would struggle to be in the first team of at least half the teams in the league would be a great deal for us.

2906~~~
Well, I'll have to hold my hands up if it does happen. When that loan deal was announced last summer, I laughed, thinking there was no way the clause would ever be activated, and it was just an example of Woodward's lack of footballing nous.

£7.5m for Cleverley? It's like that old gran-uncle, whose existence you'd forgotten, dying and leaving you his house.

2907~~~
He may lack football nous, but he's great at collecting money. If they actually spend that much on him, I'll piss myself.

2908~~~
7.5 million pounds for a player who will be free next summer? Never mind the fact that AV are allowed to agree terms with him in a week and half from now...

Just as true as the 24 million we appear to be willing to spend on Miranda when his release clause is 29m and he will also be free in 6 months...

2909~~~
No, between two English clubs in this situation, they're not until a few weeks before their contract is up.

2910~~~
That doesn't make sense. Have you interchanged the figures? Why wouldn't we make a lower offer?

2911~~~
Thanks for the clarification, i didn't know that. Even if that's the case i'm sure that when we send him out on loan to AV there was some kind of a gentlemen's agreement to inform them of any offers from European clubs in January so that they will be able to make a counteroffer.

I checked again and the truth is that his contract expires in 2016. Still that's a lot of money for a 30 yo player imo.

2912~~~
What about the possibility of Moyes signing him on a free transfer? I could see that happening. Some have even said his game would suit the Spanish style and if I remember correctly Moyes really liked him.

2913~~~
If Cleverley was signed and started over Granero or Canales that be a travesty.

2914~~~
Looks like Lambert wants to keep him at Villa.

2915~~~
Clevz could be a solid squad man for a club like Villa.

TC23's head got too big and wasted promising talent.  Clevz can blame Davies for that vicious tackle but the rest is on him.

2916~~~
I think it was him who said that himself.

2917~~~
How exactly did his head get too big?. What was it that he did that was so big headed?

2918~~~
Not sure what happened to him, he was very promising, played for England, but he went backwards at such a rate.

2919~~~
The clothing line, the website, the brand.

2920~~~
Yeah that darn clothing line and brand that doesn't exist.

2921~~~
Not any longer.

2922~~~
Not ever, the clothing was for charity and having a site is no different to having a twitter account or blog.

2923~~~
He made his website after his 3rd start for the club and started the TC23 brand at the same time. It's very different to having a Twitter account, I've got a Twitter account, if I had a website for myself it'd be ridiculous just like it was him making his own website after 3 games.

After he closed the website due to all the criticism he received for it he claimed that he only made it for something to do when he was injured and was trying to set something up for himself when his short career is finished. Considering it was a professionally commissioned website it's hardly a project he took on when injured and as for setting something up for his retirement, it just goes to show that he was trying to create a brand for himself. After 3 starts.

2924~~~
What a heinous crime, feck me people do find the most pathetic things with which to pass judgement on others with......

2925~~~
It's a bit annoying for all us people without good hobbies, but nobody really knows if him telling someone to do it affected his play. So lets not pretend it did

2926~~~
I don't think it got in the way of his football or anything daft like that. Look at the level Beckham played at with the all the shite around him. I think it does give you a pretty good idea of the opinion he has of himself though and if you've heard him speak he comes across as self assured to the point where any of his failings have been down to others. The leak he gave about Keane carried a very poor line where he basically said the Villa players don't get paid enough to work to Keane's standard. 

He'd do well to take a bit of responsibility for himself and get his head down and work because there is some talent there and at the moment he's wasting it.

2927~~~
Wasn't he out injured when he had his website made. Why does 3 starts matter? He had free time and not much to do as he had a foot injury. 
And of course it was professionally made. I don't think Cleverley could make his own website. Even the reserve team players are filthy rich. Spending some to get a website made is hardly a crime.

Complaining about his website is idiotic.

Players regress/or even stop progressing quiet often. Cleverley never got to where he should have been. Nothing to do with a fecking website

2928~~~
Pretty harsh in my opinion but it Christmas Day, so who gives a flying turd.

2929~~~
If you read what I said, it's not the act of making a website that anyone criticised. Nobody is saying he spent too much time working on his HTML coding and neglected his shooting practice.

It's the fact he tried to brand himself like Beckham did when he had done absolutely feck all to warrant it. Who exactly did he expect to buy his clothing range? It was a really weird and egotistical act from a young player who shouldn't be concerning himself with enhancing his celebrity profile when he had yet to make any sort of impact on the first team.

I think the reason he never got to where he should have is down to his attitude.

2930~~~
I don't care what our players are doing in their free time (as long it isn't something illegal or against club rules)

2931~~~
Seems like a lifetime ago we had a midfield 2 of Anderson and cleverly, winning 3-2 vs city to the 8-2 battering of arsenal. Then they both got injured and the rest in history.

2932~~~
You can't be serious.

Tom was flying high at the one if the biggest clubs in the world, but it was still at the beginning of his career.  Marketing his TC23 brand was at best premature.  He needed to keep his head on his shoulders. Which he failed to do.  The self-branding thing could have waited until after he accomplished something.

2933~~~
Criticising a player for trying to seize an opportunity for selling merchandise and making money while their status is at its peak - Utd starter and England international - is weak at best. So what if he's not achieved anything individually? He's a premier league winner and can do whatever the heck he likes off the pitch providing his personal actions comply with club regulations.

Criticise on the pitch by all means, and let's not shy away here as there's a huge scope to do so, but let's not pick at a man for trying to monetise a potential revenue stream from a situation he's in through hard work and a little luck. He's not the first and isn't the last. Move on.

2934~~~
That would be fair enough if it was true. We're criticising him because he did it when he had made just 3 first team appearances. He hadn't earned a single England cap at the time and had made just two sub appearances and one start for United.

It was hugely premature to the point of ridiculous and is absolutely right to be called out on it.

2935~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Btjolh0IYAAk0FI.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Btjolh0IYAAk0FI.jpg"/> 
Came across this on Twitter. How on earth was he captaining us against AS Roma just 6 months ago?

2936~~~
It was made out to the make or break match for him. And if I remember it correctly he was subbed off in the second half.

2937~~~
Reading the Villa forums and they calling him average. Saying he offers nothing and hope he is dropped. 

And to think some people thought he could make it here.

2938~~~
I'm stunned, thought he would blossom into Zinedine Zidane going there.

I lost hope on Cleverley years ago, just never good enough and we kept playing him and playing him.

2939~~~
Has done himself no favours at Villa. He is struggling and isn't stand-out at all.

2940~~~
Because he was the only one that was going to play the full 90. LvG made that pretty clear.

2941~~~
Shit I totally forgot about Cleverley, hes not going to come back right? Please sat no ...

2942~~~
I wonder if its a mentality issue. He just seems happy to coast through games without being particularly impactful or influential. I feel a bit sorry for him. I expected him to rise to the challenge of being a big fish in a smaller pond at Villa, when their own smaller fishes are outdoing him (sorry for the awful analogy!) 

His contract runs out at the end of the season, so no.

2943~~~
He has, he's their best ball winner which is a string added to his bow this season. And if he had won the ball quite as often in his United career he'd have been a far more useful player.

He hasnt made much of an impression on the ball, but thats not too surprising since he had a grossly inflated and over the top reputation for his passing. It was safe and reached a teammate most often, that doesn't make it good. Having said that he's one of their most accurate and creative passers this season - it just doesnt mean much because of the distinct lack of creativity coming out from the side that means 1.1 key passes a game is 2nd most for this team.

Overall he doesnt look out of place at Villa. This is probably his level just about mid table

2944~~~
And then was subbed off early in the second half.

2945~~~
Was he shite in the game? That'd explain it as LvG categorically stated that he intended Clev to play the full 90 and thus had to be the captain.

2946~~~
Not really a surprise a mid table team is his level. Delph looks miles apart from him. He's a Sidwell, or a Colback level player.

Amazing we won a league with him next to Carrick. Goes to show how good Sir Alex is.

2947~~~
Amazing to think that he several years ago he and Wiltshire were England's bright new future.

2948~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> it's hard to believe how average he is. There was definitely something there at the beginning though, right? I mean he can't possibly have just fluked his way to Manchester United first team for a few years.

2949~~~
lol

2950~~~

2951~~~
When I was a kid, having a tom (Tom Tank) meant wanking, so whenever I see this guy's name I think 'Masturbate Ingeniously'

2952~~~
I think it was 90% mentality with him. He was a very decent prospect once and then something seemed to just go in his head, I think it was after he got injured, he retreated into this safe player scared of taking any risks. He did have the ability once.

You cant even say hes a rubbish passer because he doesnt try anything other than sideways anymore. I had hoped for his sake being out of the spotlight at Villa might have helped, but looks like the last couple of seasons of crucifixion in the press have put to bed any chance of him ever coming out of his shell.

2953~~~
Inaccurate article; says that he would snub Villa and Everton would make a 7m bid for him at the end of the season, when actually his contract with us comes to an end then. 

If he is unwilling to sign for Villa in this window, then we better bring him back and let him sit on the bench. Will we be eligible for a compensation since he is homegrown?

2954~~~
I watched Leicester-Villa. He looked less composed on the ball than I remember. Just sort of chipped it forward at times, which never worked. I don't think he'd really help Everton much and he definitely wouldn't help us. Too bad. He looked promising for a while. 

Swansea would make some sense. They play pass and move football and Caroll and Britton are their backups CM's and they are on loan and old.

2955~~~
The measure of the man  is that he looks at home in an average way in a team that has managed 11 league goals all season.

2956~~~
Still can't get my head around the abuse he cops for not being a great player. Why don't the players at the clubs said to be his level get the abuse from us?

I for one, hope he finds a club where he can have a good career.

2957~~~
Are you using the word 'abuse' misleadingly? There was a time when our fans were giving him abuse on twitter, which was nasty, unnecessary, and led to him closing his twitter account but I'm not sure I've seen him on the receiving end of any abuse since. Have you? Perhaps I'm wrong. 

I always liked Cleverley and spent lots of time in his thread defending him when he was here. I think some of the criticism he's getting now at Villa is because people know his potential (because we have seen it), and he's not playing anywhere near it, even in a far less pressurised environment. Most people, even his critics, expected him to become one of Villa's better players, when he's just blended into the background, rarely affecting games, whilst more average players (at least on paper) are putting in better performances. I questioned whether it was a mentality issue because even when he was here I never thought it was a lack of effort (and still don't). Maybe a stint with Roberto Martinez again would be good for him. A coach who believes in him and was able to get the best out of him before.

2958~~~
Well he isn't being sent the abuse now but fans on here giving it to him is close to the same thing, I just don't get it. Maybe abuse when it's not directly sent to him is the wrong term but I don't get why he is criticised for not being a great player.

People go out of the way to try and prove what a bad player he is and I just don't see a reason for it.

2959~~~
You don't have to go out of your way to prove he is bad, he is doing a fine enough job of it himself.

2960~~~
Criticism of his performances and abuse are surely different? I also don't think criticism of him is because he isn't 'great'. It's because he's playing some way below his actual ability level (which we have all seen). I was effusive in praise for the type of player Cleverley was, he just isn't showing anything near it atm.

2961~~~
It's just the biggest echo in this thread though, some people are far too obsessed all because he didn't meet their need for a world class creative midfielder.

2962~~~
If it was actual criticism of a performance, that's fine. Not just he is fecking shit, he is a coward etc. That doesn't go into much depth.

2963~~~
Our entire squad were abused last season then.

2964~~~
Such a shame the whole business really. Still remember him in the Charity Shield making mugs out of City. Thought we really had one for the future.

2965~~~
If he went to Everton he'd be their 7th best central midfielder after McCarthy, Besic, Barry, Osman, Barkley and Gibson. Seems like an unlikely move even though the manager liked him in the past. He also played him wide.

2966~~~
Yeah, he is pretty wank to be fair.

2967~~~
So Villa fans cheered when he came off. And there is Ekeke saying he doesn't look out of place for them.

He's been awful.

2968~~~
He is not good at anything.

2969~~~
He's good at not being good.

2970~~~
He doesn't give a feck anymore. Won one Premier League medal more than Gerrard, been there, done that, got the t-shirt.

He's just not ambitious as we think he'll be. Doesn't mean he can't be a decent league player, someday...

2971~~~
who cares about him?  He is nowhere near good enough for us, and maybe most premier league sides...

2972~~~
Its not like our captain "fantastic" has been much better than Cleverley in the midfield.. If anything Cleverley is a better passer. Im not saying that Cleverley is good tho. Both of them doesn't create much. Unless if its free kick or corners.

If it had been Cleverley instead of Rooney playing in Rooney form last few games everyone here would have criticizing him for playing bad but it seems many fans doesn't o the same about our captain.

2973~~~
You must be blind or something.

Nearly everyone on the forum has been saying Rooney isn't a midfielder and should swap with Di Maria.

2974~~~
Rooney. 8 goals. 5 assists.
Cleverley. 0 goals. 0 assists.

Rooney isn't a midfielder, but he's still been better than Cleverley.

2975~~~
Nail on the head, lost motivation after he started making big money.

2976~~~
I mean, he didn't even invited Keano for tea. Got the haircut almost like Beckham, though.

He was that close to being United player for years. Had some good moments, too... gotta admit that.

2977~~~
I think I would choose Wilson and Persie/Falcao over Rooney as striker, At least for next games. No one should be undroppable!

Also there is still too many fans who wants to have him in there lineups instead of for example Mata and Herrera/Fellaini.

2978~~~
He had good moments, and could have been a good player if he concentrated on the football. Remember when he launched his own brand and website etc? Was wearing poncy clothes like Becks also. At least Becks had made it on the football pitch before he started acting like a tit off it.

2979~~~
Indeed. He wanted to be cool and unfortunately became Vanilla Ice of Manchester United.

2980~~~
His website is gone. For sale now. Like him. <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s14.postimg.org/meee7v4ld/clever.jpg" src="http://s14.postimg.org/meee7v4ld/clever.jpg"/>

2981~~~
Maybe Martinez would be good for him. Needs a manager who can get the best out of him.

2982~~~
Quite pricey

2983~~~
'30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee'.

Yup. That's pretty much his average season consistency right now.

2984~~~
He's not even one of Villa's best players. He'll never be a decent player, he's just shit

2985~~~
I was just reading his thread on the Villa forum. He's taking a battering, they don't want him on a permanent deal and apparently he was boo'd when his name was read out at a recent game. 

Where would he go from here?

2986~~~
Maybe pitching his crappy TC23 line of clothing.

Seriously, the punk just threw away a promising football career and deserves to recede into oblivion.  Had he had an ounce of heart he would have been a decent journeyman footballer.

2987~~~
Reminds me of kieran richardson. Thought he made it because he wore our t-shirt and lacked what was needed to take it to the next level.

I thought he looked good with Anderson as a 2 man midfield until he got injured against bolton. But looking back, that was only a few games (spurs, arsenal, City second half Community Shield, and beginning of Bolton). Oh and of course the leadup with Wigan where he built his confidence to be a positive player. Hasnt been positive since.

2988~~~
I can't see Everton still being interested, they have McCarthy, Besic, Barkley and Barry for the 2 CM roles in the system Martinez uses.

2989~~~
They probably need another fringe player but he won't play that much there. Didn't Martinez play him out wide at Wigan anyway?

2990~~~
I'm so delighted he's a part of the pathetic Aston Villa squad this year, such a cnut not agreeing to be sold at the summer forcing the club, which made him everything he is and more, lose money for him. 
There aren't many players I genuinely hate and hope they're career will be fecked, Cleverley is definitely one of them. I hope he'll remain club less for the rest of his career

2991~~~
And to think certain people on here used to get grossly offended if anyone dare suggest that he's, well, not very good. I remember getting slaughtered when I said that McCarthy was a better player.

2992~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jesus

2993~~~
Hard to believe we walked the league with this guy starting almost every game. Don't wanna be too mean, he's still one of our own and is probably a good guy,just a shit footballer

2994~~~
wow.....

2995~~~
I said something similar about Anderson years ago and got battered by some, but that's the way it is with some posters. They defend everything United so fair play to them but it is a forum!!

2996~~~
Our fans can be so nasty.
It's as if people think he is playing poorly by choice. As if he isn't trying. He hasn't fulfilled his potential (for whatever reason) and I think it is a shame. I certainly had high hopes for him. Some of the things that he did well when he was here such as passing and moving, and always making himself available, he isn't even really doing much anymore and maybe it's a lack of confidence, but I don't for a second think he's playing this way because 'he thinks he's made it'.

2997~~~
Yeah he did so I guess he could be a replacement for Mirallas.

2998~~~
He's banging your bird, isn't he?

2999~~~
He is such an utter cnut and with his huge lack of any manhood I'd be surprised if he'd be banging anyone.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Am I doing it right?</span>

3000~~~
Very nearly got me.

3001~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3002~~~
Bloody hell.

Need a hug?

3003~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

3004~~~
I don't agree with the personal attacks but he has turned out to be a really poor footballer. At this rate of regression, he'll end up at a top half Championship club.

3005~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> All this hate. 
Now you just need to see the pic of his missus and you'll have a fine day.

3006~~~
Attacking midfielder at an upper championship club would probably suit him. Can't see him making any serious impact at Everton so somewhere like Derby might be his next stop

3007~~~
That's armchair shrinks for you. He clearly has zero confidence right now. He's a far far better player than this.

3008~~~
I don't know about confidence but he was clearly all over the place last night. Didn't do any defending and was always caught high up the pitch. If that was Lambert's plan that he play further up then it is understandable but otherwise that was a shambolic performance from Cleverley.

3009~~~
I remember I posted something about how he was caught partying and dancing on the streets a day or two after United got knocked out of the Champions League last summer, and I got major slag along the lines of "personal private lives don't really matter."

Well, I'd say there's your evidence. You got guys like CR7 working like a slave to get to the level that they're at, and CR7 is starting from a much higher starting point, whereas you have Cleverley just putting in his hours on the training grounds, doing what is expected of him, but nothing more, nothing less - all while trying to have a good time. Well look how that's worked out for him. Maybe he should have lived like a monk for a year or two, he'd probably be a much better footballer now than he is currently. No sympathy for the lad, had the world at his feet and more opportunity than most of us will ever have, and wasted it away.

3010~~~
I just don't think that the upside people thought was there ever actually was.

He isn't an exceptional passer and that is the core element of his game. He isn't a goalscorer; he doesn't create a lot of chances and he isn't a great tackler. He doesn't have exceptional pace or strength and he isn't a intelligent player in terms of reading the game or positioning to make up for his lack of physical attributes in his position.

I am just curious as to where the potential actual was?

3011~~~
What are you talking about? Do you have some insight into exactly how hard Cleverley trains that the rest of us don't?

3012~~~
How do you know this exactly? Moyes said he was always the first out to training, and Martinez praised his attitude, work ethic and and mentality in training. Just because he isn't very good doesn't mean he isn't trying. I'm seriously baffled at the way people make things up on here to suit their agendas, then convince themselves it's the truth.

3013~~~
Some of the abuse he has received has been way out of order. He isn't very good, but he doesn't deserve any abuse. I never bought into the Cleverley hype but he did look a good prospect during his loan spell at Watford. He started his United career well but he became a victim of the Ando / Cleverley axis of hype (brought to you exclusively by RefCafe). Some people then preceded to compare him to the likes of Xavi and when he ultimately failed to reach these heights, he was slated and his confidence suffered.

I'm not sure what level he should be playing at and have no idea how his career will pan out. His career at a top level club and his international career is effectively over at 25. He badly needs to find a club that can give him his confidence back or he may well slip into obscurity.

3014~~~
yeah but he went out drinking that time

3015~~~
There is something that Cleverley does exceptionally well.
He allows us to see who on here is irrational and bitter.

3016~~~
Yeah how could any of us know that? He always seemed to be trying his best to me, was usually knackered toward the end of the game. Maybe his flash haircut that slightly odd interview he did give people than impression idk.

3017~~~
tbf, if you believed everything you heard, everyone is first out at training.

3018~~~
It's truly amazing when you really think about it.

3019~~~
Could see him ending up in the Championship after Villa if I'm honest. Has failed to impress big time at Villa, he was booed at a few Villa games.

QPR when they go down beckons for our Tom I think. Which is a shame, because I don't think he is a bad footballer. He has decent technique, a good engine, the problem with him is more mental side of the game. Seems to never have any confidence whatsoever.

3020~~~
I never understood people getting angry about these things. Do you expect a player to mope around their house for days after suffering a loss? You think that would be a healthy way to cope? Professional athletes are not robots. Like most people professional athletes are going to like an occasional night out.

3021~~~
Fulham fans boo'd Bryan Ruiz, he was and still is their best player. Utd fans boo'd Ryan Giggs

3022~~~
In my opinion he was another victim of the massive hype which was present if not encouraged after the class of 92. Any player who was able to kick the ball straight was hailed the new this or the new that from Ronnie 'the new Steve Bruce' Wallwork to Philip 'the new Duncan Edwards' Jones passing right to Wes 'whose worth twice then Rio' Brown and the fat Brazilian who allegately shits on Fabregas and has more talent then Wayne Rooney.  

The period between a players debut and his first few years are vital as the player need to grow up quickly in terms at all fronts (technically, physically and in terms of maturity). Hyping a player at that age is madness considering how much work he's yet to do in such short period of time.

3023~~~
Not looking good for him, Villa don't want him:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/report-man-united-to-recall-cleverley_202994.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/footbal...rt-man-united-to-recall-cleverley_202994.html</a>

3024~~~
What are we calling him back? What good would that do.

3025~~~
It doesn't really say that they don't want him, just that we might recall him if they don't sign him, to try and put pressure on them to make the deal permanent.

3026~~~
Pressure Villa into buying him. I'd imagine the two Clubs may have had a gentleman's agreement that Villa no longer want to uphold - all guess work of course.

3027~~~
Perhaps, £7M would be good money if we could get it.

<a class="username" data-user="65267, @RedMachine03" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65267/">@RedMachine03</a> if they don't want him, or refuse to buy him, then we have to take him back until the end of the season.

3028~~~
Didn't the transfer go as a loan initially because we couldn't get all the paperwork done in time?

It all makes sense now, Villa have seen him in the team and want to renege..

3029~~~
Can't we loan him to another club if Villa don't want him? He might not get a Premiership side but surely there's a Championship club that'd take him on.

3030~~~
No, he's splayed for two Clubs this season.

3031~~~
A player cannot play for more than 2 teams in a year. This applies to Championship and abroad as well, I'm not really sure though.

3032~~~
It was always an odd deal, and makes you wonder whether Woody understands how football works.

Why expect Villa to avail of an option to pay £7m in January for a player they can get for nothing in June - unless Cleverley was sex on wheels and Villa were desperate to keep him, why would they fork over £7m; and why would Cleverley sign now and forgo a bigger payday in the summer?

3033~~~
Some of the replies in this thread..but not so different to the Villa fans.

3034~~~
It makes no sense, therefore it must have something to do with Manchester United.

3035~~~
Wow. As average as he became for us, he should be more than good enough for a team like villa.  At his best, I would have thought he'd one of their better players. His confidence be completely gone.

3036~~~
If he's lacking confidence at the moment I'd suggest he's been lacking it for well over 2 years. He's not played well consistently in a long time. If it is a confidence thing then unfortunately for him you'd have to suggest he'll never make a top flight footballer as having confidence is an attribute you'd probably associate with that trade.

3037~~~
How many defend United? What I see is more everything thats wrong with the club these days. Anyway Cleverley looked good those few matches in 2011 but since he's not been near good enough.

3038~~~
If you're an attacking player, Villa isn't exactly the best place to kickstart your career.  It seems every time I come across a Villa game on TV it always says 'AVL 0' on the screen.

Liked him when he was first with us but he badly needs to sort out his game.  Don't know where that might happen.

3039~~~
He might have to drop down a division to be honest. He's been playing so badly for so long I don't know if any Premiership team would want him. He offers absolutely nothing, he seems to be below average at every aspect of the game.

Outside of that initial month or two when he broke into the first team he's been pretty poor.

3040~~~
No sooner we get rid of the largest piece of driftwood in the squad and it looks like a similar piece is about to return.
I hope he doesn't come back, it wouldn't be good for either party. He won't get game time yet he may potentially stop younger players a space on the bench (LvG being as he is).
Don't see why the club doesn't just try and terminate his contact and let him sign for someone else. We won't get much of a fee is window.

3041~~~
Aston Villa can get him for nothing in the summer......they would be stupid to buy him now for 7m.
The same goes for Ben Arfa....he has played for Newcastle and Hull this season....so he must wait for his Nice debut til next season

Hatem Ben Arfa look away now. Micah Richards appeared for Manchester City in the Community Shield in August and has played for Fiorentina in Serie A this campaign too. But he would be allowed to play for Inter as well because Uefa count the Wembley fixture as having happened last season.

3042~~~
We should just pay him the remainder of the contract and let him walk if it comes to that.  All of the players who were shipped out - Cleverley, Nani, Hernandez, etc. - should stay out.  We need to move on and not cover the same territory again.

Some interesting perspective BTW: Herrera and Cleverley are both 25.

3043~~~
Surely we could have gotten 5 mil or so from Hull or whatever this past summer. Seems like another selling feckup from us.

3044~~~
Kenwright will continue Everton's scrounging off us and get him on a free in the summer. No way would he get in their starting CM, but it's a freebie.

3045~~~
Yup, I'd swap for Barkley and pint of bitter.

3046~~~

3047~~~
I imagine he wants decent wages after being at United. Do Everton really want to invest in a benchwarmer on biggish wages while their defence is in sore need of regeneration?

3048~~~
And not for the first time...

The intent was obviously to strong-arm Villa with the threat of taking a relatively important player out of their squad (whatever the opinions on here, he generally starts for them when fit) Of course, Villa know we couldn't loan him elsewhere and wouldn't want to pay the wages for a player who we don't need and will be letting go on a free at the end of the season. Unsurprisingly, Woody blinked first and Villa can have their cake and eat it.

I suspect getting fecked over in negotiations like this will be a theme so long as Woody is in charge. Until he learns the ropes anyway. He needs to realise that buying and selling players is very different to sniffing out sponsors for our shirt.

3049~~~
TBF he was subbed off early in a lot of his 18 starts in the league. fergie just couldn't get rid of him. i think saf thought he may come god but nothing pointed to that. should never been in the side , shows how blind fergie was watching a midf play later in managerial career.

3050~~~
Cnutish from him to be honest. He know he will be in a better position to negotiate wages on a free.

3051~~~
So do we get any transfer fee then? Plus unless his form takes a drastic upturn why would Everton want him, they have better options already, & by all accounts he is wanting a massive pay rise too, just can't see it.

3052~~~
No. Out of contract in the summer so will be a Bosman free.

3053~~~
How dare he. 

It's a perfectly understandable decision while he's getting games at Villa

3054~~~
I can see him being Martínez type player, holds onto the ball tried to keep it ticking over. In fact its a type of player they lack.

Still good luck to the guy, wasn't good enough for United but i can see him establishing himself in a side like Everton. At Villa he just doesnt offer them that creative spark

3055~~~
So we set-up a 'gentleman's agreement' for £7 million with Villa, they say we don't want to pay and we just leave it at that? 

Madness, we should have recalled him and flogged him for whatever anyone would pay, we're not a charity.

3056~~~
I think we blew any chance of a fee last summer, when we agreed the fee with Villa but he wouldn't go permanently because he wanted to join Everton, who then wouldn't match what Villa would pay.

I think the loan was just to get him off the wage bill and a last resort when the permanent deal fell through then. No club would pay a decent fee for him now with him being on a free in the summer, unless he'd been outstanding, which he hasn't. I see what you mean though, it has been a bit of a mess.

3057~~~
I just find all these players leaving for peanuts a bit annoying, Anderson, Cleverley, Zaha, Evra, Kagawa, Lawrence, Henrique, Keane, Fletcher for a combined £15 million (roughly), yes a mixed bag there, but still some really good players, it just seems were more keen to get them off the wage bill.

For the summer you would think players like Hernandez, and Nani would be worth £10 million + each but it wouldn't surprise me if they go for peanuts too.

3058~~~
I don't think Everton will want him in the Summer.

3059~~~
Kagawa went back for £12 million Keane for a reported £3 million and Zaha for an initial £3 million  as well so im not entirely sure where you have got your figures from

3060~~~
I think they will. Hernandez definitely as he'll only have a year of his contract left come this summer. I reckon we'd get about £7m each.

3061~~~
Who would he be replacing in the Everton team?

3062~~~
Roberto Martinez apparently.

3063~~~
Kagawa went for around £6.3m
Evra £1.25m
Lawrence £1m
Keane £2-3m
Henriquez supposedly has a buyout clause for around £1m with his loan.
Fletch, Anderson and cleverly will go on a free.

3064~~~
Was that ever confirmed? I thought it just ended up being a rumour?

3065~~~
Any links for that ?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/manchester-united-transfer-news-shinji-kagawa-returns-to-borussia-dortmund-after-disappointing-twoyear-spell-at-old-trafford-9702411.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...ng-twoyear-spell-at-old-trafford-9702411.html</a>

3066~~~
If we sign him... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3067~~~
For a free he's not bad. Can replace Barry in the "do nothing in midfield" role.

Plus Martinez has gotten the best from him in the past.

3068~~~
I blame Martinez for the whole Cleverley fiasco anyway, he talked about him at Wigan as if he was going to be a great player...

3069~~~
He dopesnt have to replace anyone. Its a squad game these days and teams need depth to be able to live higher up the EPL table on a consistent basis.

3070~~~

3071~~~
What amazing insight <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> journalists get paid for this. It's unbelievable.

3072~~~
As a club both buying and selling we buy players for way over their prices compared to their quality, and our resale value on players is very pitiful as well

Dont know how they do it, but under Mourinho, he gets players for good money and sells them at great prices too

3073~~~
For a start, Chelsea have sold a load of players we wouldn't have. 


Them selling De Bryune or Lukaku is like us selling Januzaj.

3074~~~
No it wasn't and the Dinamo boss/owner who claimed it was is meant to have previous for chatting bollocks. Some journalist on twitter said Henriquez told him he plans on coming back next season and feels he is better than Wilson. Think the tweet might be in the Henriquez thread.

3075~~~
Neither do I his stock is falling that fast. He's on the slippery slope to oblivion.

3076~~~
I guess the dream of running the midfield of the World's greatest team is gone, anything after that would be a let down.  He's clearly struggling for motivation, and if he can still earn £30-£50K a week for the next few years, at least he can secure his future.  It's not very professional, granted, and anyway, have you seen his Mrs?

3077~~~
Has he actually done anything noteworthy at Villa?

Though that's harsh, considering Villa haven't done anything noteworthy at Villa for quiet some time.

Yes, what a twat he is for trying to make more money for himself in his (relatively) short career as footballer, instead of trying to make money for Manchester United instead - a football club who don't want his services any longer.

3078~~~
Just had a look. What a cnut.

3079~~~
The problem isn't Woodward; the problem is giving Cleverley around £60k (dependent on the source) a week in the first place despite him never really proving anything bar the odd game. In recent years we've had a slightly strange policy of giving massive pay hikes to player's who've only been performing for a very short period of time. We did it to Hernandez around 6 months after signing him, we also did it to Welbeck, Anderson, Smalling, Jones, Januzaj and to Cleverley when they hadn't proven to be quality player's.

Obviously this effects our ability to sell these players if they fall short, as the vast majority of their value is tied into their salary, rather than a transfer fee. You can bet that if Cleverley were on £20-30k a week Woodward would have had a queue of clubs looking to pay £5-10m for him in the Summer and we wouldn't even be discussing the possibility of him leaving on a free (see Spurs selling the likes of Naughton for £5m, Livermore for £8m, Huddlestone for £5m, Caulker for £8m). Most reports had Everton in for him, but unwilling to match his £60k weekly salary and pay the fee we wanted. In the end we were lucky to get a couple of £m loan fee out of Villa and them covering his salary.

There is a fine line between rewarding a player for showing form/promise and giving them a contract that says "you've made it", despite that being far from the truth, I think in recent years we've given our player's too much too soon. You look at Harry Kane just signing a 5.5 year contract at £30k a week and then look at the aforementioned list and think "what the hell were we thinking". Hopefully this'll change under Van Gaal; I'd much prefer to see a big disparity between the player's who have cemented themselves as quality first team regulars and those aspiring to be as such, I also think it'd be a big fat dangling carrot for player's to work their hardest to fulfill their potential.

3080~~~
Yet if any one of them hadn't signed that new contract, we'd all have been up in arms about letting them get so close to the end of their previous contract without renewing. Have you already forgotten the drama when this place discovered Januzaj hadn't long left on his previous contract and the excitement when he renewed?

3081~~~
Expect him to join Everton in the summer, villa move was just a way of getting him off the wage bill with a small chance of a fee. He just isn't good enough, he never has been some people just got too carried away with  3 or 4 good performances. 

Will only be a backup at Everton but if he prefers that to playing regularly at a side in the bottom half then fair enough but he may well be playing in the championship before he turns 30.

3082~~~
I don't know if your being sarcastic or not but we stuck by him for a fair few years while he obviously crap but gave him time to develop regardless to ability. He had an offer to join Everton for a fee but lower wages and refused, ended up going to villa on loan with a gentleman's agreement that hasn't gone though and that more Likely because of him than anyone else. On a free he will be in control what he can get in wages, the cheap twat.

3083~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You need to take a step into the real world.

3084~~~
Honestly I think he isnt good enough for Everton. However, if they lose McCarthy or Barkley then he isnt bad to get on a free.

Dont see the reason for the hate on here - Cleverley is simply a player who isnt good enough. His contract is running out and we dont want to renew it, so he is leaving. Whats the big problem?

3085~~~
Lol, I am in the real world, I live by principals and I don't bite the hand that feeds. It just goes to the character of the lad, he's a sell out. 
He's from Bradford right, says it all

3086~~~
What on earth is that meant to mean?

His character is that he's a sensible human being, who is doing whats best for him and his family by trying to make as much money as possible in what is a relatively short career as a professional footballer. It's completely logical and it makes 100% sense. 

If United wanted a fee for him, they should have extended his contract years ago.

3087~~~
Obviously there's a fine balance between losing good prospects and paying competitively. However would Cleverley/Welbeck/Hernandez really have left if our final offer were for £30-40k a week instead of £60-70k? The fact that player's of similar talent aren't being paid that kind of salary elsewhere and that United has a reputation for standing by their youth player's suggests that they'd still sign. 

As I said Spurs seem to have a pretty good system. They don't seem to regularly have good prospects leave for low value, but also don't seem to end up paying someone like Kane £60-70k a week after half a season of good performances. The problem is of course that you set a precedent. If Hernandez signs a deal for £80k a week, Welbeck/Cleverley/Anderson/Januzaj are all going to push for a similar fee.

We either watch what we are offering these type of player's more carefully, or accept that we're going to have some demotivated players sat on large contracts, with no buyers who will take them off our hands. We certainly can't have our cake and eat it. Obviously a key part of this is not letting the contracts of our young talented player's run down so that we are in a stupid position of "pay over the odds or let them go on a free".

3088~~~
Strange timing to be bigging up Spurs's salary structure when they've spent this transfer window desperately trying to find someone who will take Adebayor off their hands on loan. Even offering to pay well over 50% of his salary, before being stuck paying 100k/week for someone who simply can't be arsed. Not to mention trying to offload at least some of Lennon's salary by sending a clearly unhappy player to Everton and finding it so difficult to shift BAE that he ran down every last month of his salary before walking out a free agent.

No club gets it consistently right when it comes to contracts and wages. You have to bear in mind that Spurs are a much smaller club. Hence the salaries tend to be lower, across the board. That just reflects the huge difference in turnover between the two clubs. Players that play for Manchester United should expect to be better rewarded than those at Spurs. We're a bigger, wealthier club. That's part of the reason why we've been able to sign their best players a couple of times in the not too distant past.

3089~~~
look at the poor Aston Villa midfield stats, just awful. He will struggle at Everton, still too challenging level for him.

19 games, 0 goals, 0 assists

3090~~~
He'll be a decent squad player at Everton, which is probably his level.

3091~~~
Not a great indicator seeing how profligate in front of goal Villa have been this season.

What about chances created?

3092~~~
and if that doesn't work then what about the chance he made to a guy who made a chance?

3093~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 

I was expecting to hear that the chances created was also low, in any case. I can't think of many from highlights I've seen. And Villa haven't had many anyway..

3094~~~
He'd fit in with Real Sociedad.

3095~~~
I think the difference is that Lennon, BEA and Adebayor were "proven" when they signed their contracts; they had the performances under their belt to justify being among their best earners. If they were 23-24 year olds who had shown a bit of promise and were rewarded with their current contracts you'd have a point. There is a difference between someone turning shite due to injury or mental weakness and paying someone the salary of what you expect they will become, before they've become it.

Of course we should pay better, I just don't believe we should pay better across the board. Our promising 20 year olds should not be paid better than Spurs', because they haven't proven themselves to be better. Obviously it's a case by case basis and special player's should be paid their market rate; I just don't agree with the likes of Cleverley earning a huge salary merely because they were the best of a mediocre bunch of youth team player's at that time and therefore got a chance in the first team. 

The only difference between United and Spurs should be that you can go from earning £5k a week to £500k a week if you're good enough, rather than £5k to £150k. Not that you're automatically paid twice what an equally talented Spurs player earns, just because your employer is richer.

3096~~~
Extend his contract?? That's why we were stuck with him for years in the first place....
I'm from Bradford, I know what people are like here....

3097~~~
He made a run in the match vs Arsenal. They showed it on MotD!

3098~~~
Get in!!!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cleverley-newcastle-620x350.jpg" src="http://thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cleverley-newcastle-620x350.jpg"/>

3099~~~
Kagawa was £7 million.

3100~~~
Late to the party as I watched a recording. 

What caught my eye was his movement and positioning.  He'd drift into a little space, and the defender would take a couple of steps and have him covered.  Cleverly would glance over, see himself marked and just stay there.  The whole time he was on the pitch he did this.  Absolute passenger.  He made them even more static than they would otherwise be--no mean feat, that.

He didn't track back or trouble anyone that had the ball.  He was pretty much just there.

His passing was maybe a little more adventurous than we've seen of late, but nothing eye catching.

I am still lost how he got to this point.  I don't think he could stand out in the Championship at this point.  Surely he's depressed.  He hasn't shown much that a decent League 1 footballer couldn't.  It's sad.

3101~~~
That Anderson Cleverly partnership of 8 games is beginning to look like some weird twilight zone ish.

3102~~~
Saw him today against Chelsea and it is hard to recognize the guy from 3 years ago. 

He seems to have gone the same way of Jones, Greening, Richardson and co. Looked to have promise but once they get to the top level they don't have the confidence or competency to stay at that level.

3103~~~
Anderson was actually a good player at times. With Cleverley, that initial adrenaline rush and eagerness to impress when he first got into the team made him raise his level. Possible that oppostion found him out after that too I guess. To be fair even in that spell he didn't do THAT much it was just that he looked confident and positive on the ball which was impressive given he was new to the team. Kevin Shithouse Davies didn't do him any favours but it wasn't like he broke his leg and put him out for a year, he was out for like 4 months IIRC

3104~~~
Not really. They had great potential from such early age. Wasn't unexpected. But they just then regressed dramatically.

3105~~~
I actually noticed him on MOTD last night, which is an improvement.

3106~~~
He's not good enough for Everton. If Barkley has been benched lately, there's not a hope for Cleverley.

3107~~~
It was funny on MOTD that Murphy seemed to think Cleverley choosing a safe sideways pass when he had two forward options on was down to confidence, he mustn't have watched TC23 very often.

3108~~~
Cleverley was OK but I always felt Anderson, on his good days, made a huge difference - much more than Cleverley. Just having that burst of energy and power through the middle and the eye for a clever pass (I did say on his good days) were big additions we've been sorely lacking in midfield for the past few years, partly because Anderson's only shown glimpses of it.

So, he had a few of those games at the start of 2011/12, which was a big reason for us and that midfield looking good and attractive. It was never going to last as a partnership because it wasn't sound defensively.

Just goes to show how much we've missed in the last few years by not trying to replace Anderson with someone who could offer those abilities on a regular basis. City, meanwhile, got Toure.

3109~~~
Would you take him back?

3110~~~
No

3111~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Eric Harrison best get his snorkel out as well.

3112~~~
A few months ago, the majority thought he was better than Fellaini xd.

3113~~~
fergie thought he was better than going into the transfer market for a real midfielder. and he's supposed to know better.we had both of those sh!t bombs in the team at the same time , jesus wept

3114~~~
Reminds me of Kieran richardson in a way. Seemed to do more work to get into the team then once in the team seemed to think he had made it.

Will always remember when he came on as a sub at Wembley and helped turn the 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 win (was involved in that sexy Nani goal)

3115~~~

3116~~~
Enjoyed this quote:

3117~~~
He is the footballer equivalent of lettuce

3118~~~
feck me, it comes to something when a manager has to try and justify picking you in one of the worst performing sides of the past 10 years.

He needs to sort himself out or he could spend the next 5 years plummeting down the leagues into further obscurity.

3119~~~
I still maintain he's a good player. Not a great one like we'd hoped but his confidence is through the floor and he's playing in a genuinely awful side. He'll move to Everton in the summer and look much better.

3120~~~
Hes not that good, funny that

3121~~~
Villa fans cheered when he was subbed. What a nightmare this guy is having.

3122~~~
too much substance - IMO closer to parsley , on the plate but why.

3123~~~
I'm not too sure even Everton would want him if they have watched him this season.

3124~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3125~~~
Looks proper on it tonight, as do most of the Villa players, to be honest.

He just seems a lot more confident. Demanding the ball, playing it at a quick tempo, putting himself about. Looks lively.

3126~~~
As I said that he gets taken off. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3127~~~
Yeah im sure he's having a huge nightmare checking his bank account every week....poor lad

3128~~~
I thought he had a good game.

3129~~~
And waking up every morning next to his gorgeous wife.

3130~~~
As a free agent in the summer I guess it would be fun to see Villa taking him while being relegated. He will still become lower table premier league quality player and we should have cashed in for him.. 

Shame his playing time wasn't given to any other prospect that's what's sad about this not the money. We spent so much money and time developping him and won't get a penny for him but I guess that happens..

3131~~~
Haven't seen much of Villa this season but I assume he's continued to prove his averageness? I know there's talk of the player preferring a move to Everton on a free, but I'd rate McCarthy, Barkley, Besic and Gibson ahead of him. Even an aging Barry would contribute more throughout an entire season.

3132~~~
The real shame is that we're told that our club is monitoring the character and attitudes of players more thoroughly than some others and yet our staff believed Anderson and Cleverley to have both of those qualities and have a big say in the future of our midfield. In reality their characters and attitudes might not turn out to be good enough for a top half premier league team let alone the biggest club in the league. So how can those members of staff have got it so very wrong?

Its not like either player has abundant technical skill and ability either

3133~~~
Anderson did. Plus Anderson did help us win 4 league titles and Cleverley helped us win one as well.

3134~~~
He really doesnt. He's quite fast with pretty average technical skills

3135~~~
I dont think you know what technical ability is or what the difference between technique and skill is.

3136~~~
I think you're doing as bad a job identifying his skills as our staff did

3137~~~
There was never anything all that special about Anderson.  Cleverley less so.

3138~~~
Anderson and Cleverley won contests through one of those singapore Noodle companies Woodward/Gill/Kenyon signed as a sponsor. Neither have talent, everybody knows that, Stack.

Who cares anyway, theyre both rich and in Tom's case at least, have stunning wives.

Football talent? None.

3139~~~
He was named the best young player in Europe back in 2008.

3140~~~
Excellent, me neither, should I get Tim Sherwood on the phone ?

3141~~~
You and I have a real shot at this!

3142~~~
He has appeared in 23 of 27 games this season. Not too bad. It should be noted that he has been getting subbed a lot more in more recent games, nonetheless, he should get a PL contract next year.

3143~~~
I'm not clear why this thread exists. He's at Villa until his contract with us runs out. We're not going to offer him another contract so why does anyone care what he's doing.

3144~~~
Don't be so harsh... shitty players deserve threads too you know.

3145~~~
Anderson had a lot of talent, its a combination of reasons that saw him totally fecked. Clev was never as obviously talented though.

3146~~~
Not much much of Villa or Cleverley this season but when I have they and he have been fecking shit. Played well last night though, hope this is a turning point for him.

3147~~~
I know that the book on Ando, but was there ever a 20 minute spell where Ando showed all that talent?

3148~~~
Which book? I'm going by the talent he showed before his move here.

3149~~~
I can understand our shitty players having threads but, at this stage, Cleverley barely qualifies as one of ours. We're never going to see him again - just let him go.

3150~~~
I fully agree. This is like torturing insects. He's left us and is now playing at a level where he might get to warm the bench.

3151~~~
I must confess I never saw Ando before he came to United, but he never looked anything special when he arrived at OT.

Perhaps 15 minutes of decent play here and there, but if Ando was something special before he arrived his devolution into complete disgrace is even more shocking.

3152~~~
I hadnt seen anything live either. Just seen clips and read a lot once he signed. Some of the Portugese posters posted quite a bit about him as well later. If I'm not mistaken, he won the golden boy of Europe award too which goes to the biggest young talent.

His injuries have played a part but the guy never came across as a proper professional to me. Always seemed way too easy going. Our attempts to convert him into a CM didnt help either. Has no one to blame but himself though.

3153~~~
Cleverley looked to have a lot going for him and looked like cementing his place at United prior to his injury at Bolton. He has since become such an insignificant player. He was pointless again today.

3154~~~
Villa fans seem to completely disagree with you with many calling him one of their best players before being subbed off. He has been praised by all Villa fans since Sherwood has come in.

3155~~~
Poor Villans.

He's not scored or hardly created anything all season. Today was a typical Cleverley performance.

3156~~~
He epitomizes average.

3157~~~
Aye, Villa Talk have been raving about him since Sherwood took over. He's changed a lot of peoples minds by the looks of it.

From this page onwards:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.villatalk.com/index.php/topic/11920-tom-cleverley/page-183" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.villatalk.com/index.php/topic/11920-tom-cleverley/page-183</a>

Some even called him future captain material. Good on him. He's not United quality, but I'd like to see him do well in the Premier League.

3158~~~
He has no influence in a team but ball retention, so glad he's gone.

3159~~~
Yeah its nice to see him doing good. Frankly, I find it a bit embarrassing that United fans seem to find the need to continually talk shit about him.

3160~~~
no surprise....

3161~~~
The Everton links still alive and well. He's been playing well apparently? I have watched Villa a-few times lately, including yesterday, and I honestly can't say I've noticed him at all.

3162~~~
yes - was watching yesterday , but not really paying attention to it , but truly didn't know he was on the pitch. would a team like everton benefit from paying him even on a free? i mean he's sh1t.

3163~~~
Journeyman, at best.  "TC23" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3164~~~
The way they're playing, Everton will be lucky to stay up, can't see Cleverley going to a Championship club at this point in his career.

3165~~~
Some nice comments. I hope he does well. If Sherwood is giving him his confidence back then it might be best for him to stay there and fully regain his form before eventually moving on. He isn't a bad player. Might not be top level but definitely has it in him to have more of an impact on games than he had been.

3166~~~
Needs to have more confidence in his passing. If he does that he'd be regarded as a good player. He can't continuously pass the ball square and expect to be rated highly by anyone.

3167~~~
Saw him being tracked back, dispossessed, then left on his arse by one of the WBA midfielders. That was the only time I noticed him during the match.

3168~~~
It's easy to find fault with Clevs but I think a lot of his games are based upon his manager's demands rather than him thinking out of the box. He did moderately well, it's not easy playing for a side without confidence or scoring goals. After he came off WBA seemed to get more room in the midfield which indicates he had some influence in the game.

3169~~~
Aston Villa fans praising him, Manutd fans not noticing him. What to believe?

3170~~~
He is just a very ordinary player, I thought he was ok at the weekend but given his previous perfromances for Villa and the level of a lot of their other players their fans have a different outlook and rated him a bit higher.

He is playing at his correct level now and nothing wrong with that, personally I never rated him as being anywhere near good enough for us and wasn't at all surprised to see him shipped out straight away by LVG.

3171~~~
I remember him coming on at half time against city in the charity shield about 3 years ago and though he was fantastic. Didn't think it would be all down hill after that.
We desperately need classy midfielders to come through the ranks.

3172~~~
Read an article about TC23 possibly moving to Everton in the summer. My initial reaction was something along the lines of "good that we got him to sign an extension, now we can at least make a few million out of selling him".

<a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> has apparently broken my brain. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3173~~~
That seems like a strange dream from another lifetime!

3174~~~
This!!

I find it so sad that so many people have this incessant need to step on other people in order to make themselves feel better.

TC23 didn't rob us or anything. He's an academy product who dreamed of playing for his favorite club, almost made it and even won a PL medal playing consistently in midfield for us, but in the end, things didn't work out. He just wasn't good enough in the end. 

Sure he's not Xavi or Carrick, but he wasn't an evil parasite like Tevez as well. I hope he moves on to another PL club and does well over there. Like how I wish all our ex players who have tried their best to serve the club well.

3175~~~
Signing players from United in the past has served us well but I dont have a good feeling about this one, he is such a nothing player.

3176~~~
i rember that game. they way he and Nani dismantled City's defecne for the 3rd goal was just awesome.

3177~~~
I still think he'll be a decent player for a europa league team. Still wont be your star player or anything but a solid squad member.
There has to be something good about him. Ferguson picked him for years, moyes seemed to like him (for a while at least), martinez has always seemed keen.
Even Hodgson seems to rate him.
I dont know. The balance in our team was horrible for years. No one looked particularly good except van persie and our defenders

3178~~~
He should probably stay at villa and establish a name for himself. If he had more confidence in himself he'd be a much bigger name really. He's got some talent, just refuses to use all of it.

3179~~~
Yeah, needs a kick up the arse and to take more risks really. Kind of the opposite problem to barkley. Still think he'll do well at Everton tbh.

3180~~~
All of us who criticize him secretly love him and want him to do well. If anything it is our high expectations from him that influences the criticism. Also his attitude didn't do him any favors when he kept giving sound bites to the media which always had the undertone that he is good at what he does and fans are abusing him without reason.

3181~~~
Definitely will do better at Everton than at Villa. Not saying much though.

3182~~~
He's so much better than he's shown in the last 2 years. Would be a good signing for you I think.

3183~~~
I just wish this thread would go away. It soaks up energy that could be going to threads relevant to United.

3184~~~
At Everton he's going to have to start by establishing himself and that'll be a problem considering they are littered with players of his level. At Villa he's an established first 11 starter and with a new manager who seems to want his players playing dynamic offensive football, it could help him reach the next level. Vs QPR I though he played the best football I've ever seen from him and you could see that the coaches style is helping him somewhat.

3185~~~
I remember him impressing me for Wigan one time but that was as a defensive winger doing a 'job' on Baines. To be honest i just don't know what he offers and what he excels at.

3186~~~
Sideways passing, calling for passes without putting any effort into being in a position to receive a pass, and has a fit wag.

What the feck more do you want?

3187~~~
We might aswell have kept Rodwell.

3188~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> True.

3189~~~
Cleverley is good technically, but he hides in games and looks lost at times. More of a mental/confidence issue imo. Technique wise he's actually quite good.

3190~~~
I don't know where the idea that he hides comes from. I can remember him demanding the ball at times, only to receive the ball and pass it sideways, backwards or to the opposition.

3191~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/11536694/Aston-Villa-manager-Tim-Sherwood-ready-to-take-Man-Utd-midfielder-Tom-Cleverley-on-permanent-deal-after-loan.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 22px">Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood ready to take Man Utd midfielder Tom Cleverley on permanent deal after loan</span></a>

3192~~~
I hope so.

Whilst he was slightly overrated by our own fans at times, he was criminally underrated and used as a scapegoat by everyone else.

Hes perfectly capable of continuing a good career at a club like Villa and good luck to him. Will be sad to see the back of his missus though.

3193~~~
The back of his missus is probably quite a pleasant view

3194~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3195~~~
According to Sky there are 9 clubs interested in him, 5 Premier League clubs Villa, Spurs, Everton, west ham and Arsenal! Two clubs in Spain and one Italy, no names given and then Schalke. Contract offers have been given from the European sides.
Wow, how he got so much interest from his last two seasons worth of piss poor showings?

3196~~~
Being a United player counts for a lot to be fair... though I imagine it'd be more like 3 or 4 clubs rather then 9!

3197~~~
Hope he goes to Arsenal to play with his goalscoring mate Welbeck.

3198~~~
Definitely the wrong thread, but no idea where else to put this. Anyone see on Sky Sports that Arsenal are interested in signing him in the summer? Surely that's a piss take.

3199~~~
After seeing van Gaal improve Young and Fellaini I am curious to know how Clevz would have gone. It's the right thing for him to go though. Hope he goes well at Villa (or wherever he ends up).

3200~~~
Cleverley had the wrong mentality, I remember in the last 2 seasons he was willing to push his teammates under the bus when under pressure, by getting rid of the ball to a teammate who was under even more pressure.

3201~~~
Would like to see him off in mainland Europe.

3202~~~
I won't <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3203~~~
This is true. I actually forgot about comparing his mentality to Young's and Fellaini's when I made my post. It probably wouldn't have got any better for him.

3204~~~
Seems like everyone is after him now:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/436672/Arsenal-SHOCK-move-Tottenham-Man-United-outcast-Tom-Cleverley-Aston-Villa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/fo...-Man-United-outcast-Tom-Cleverley-Aston-Villa</a>

LvG even improves players who aren't even playing for him.  Maybe we should have kept Bebe after all...

3205~~~
Big turnaround for him. Failing upwards instead of just failing.

3206~~~
Arsenal wants him? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3207~~~
The Arsenal story is surely nonsense. 

I hope it isn't. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I can just picture Cleverley, all smug: "Told you so."

3208~~~
If Flamini can play there, everyone can.....

Good luck to Clevz if he goes, he is a good player who just went through the rough patch(like most of our team n that period) and was victim of retarded fans which he couldnt deal with it. That showed us that he probably isnt mentally good enough to be a United player which is a shame as he is our youth product and a talented player.

3209~~~
Oh thats prob the best transfer talk all season. Every Arsenal fan I know have now gone very quiet on this whilst they dig around.

3210~~~
Late april fools day joke? Surely <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3211~~~
I literally just logged on here to post about this! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3212~~~
If you look at Tom Cleverley the footballer and not the man he's actually very good. He's demonstrated a footballing brain, passing range, technique and fitness. If someone can take him, instil confidence into him and get him playing in a team that suits his strengths, like Fellaini, he'll do well. I think his biggest problem is his personality and self-belief isn't strong enough to deal with criticism and make himself better from it.

3213~~~
Think they're trying to assemble the team that beat them 8-2. They'll be trying to get Evans and Anderson next.

3214~~~
He wouldn't get a game at spurs or arsenal, there were similar links when we were looking to get rid of him at the start of the season but the only teams interested were villa and everton and it will probably be the same story this summer.

3215~~~
arsenal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Will end up at Everton. Didnt Valencia want him in the summer? I cant see him going to another league.

3216~~~
Sanchez, Ozil, Cazorla... Cleverley. Yep, seems about right.

3217~~~
We did try and sell him had an agreement in place but his salary demands killed it.

3218~~~
If Schalke are really interested in him then i hope he goes there.

3219~~~
Does anyone think LvG can have a similar impact on him that he's had on Young, Felli et al?

3220~~~
I think that Louis could elevate most players to the unconscious conscious state of flux. I don't think that Cleverley will get the chance though.

3221~~~
I would rather Louis to spend his effort on more talented players.

3222~~~
Didnt he say pre-season "im a LVG type player".

I bet Welbeck recommended him and tbf, they had a good understanding as you could see when they first broke into the team. Its a shame brand TC23 took over (and of course that Kevin Davies injury).

3223~~~
Arsenal could do with some depth in centre midfield and Cleverley will be free agent so why not?

3224~~~
Because he's shit

3225~~~
Good for us then.The interest does make sense though.

3226~~~
Young and Fellaini, though, were a different situation.  Both had been good players in the past and just needed to refind those abilities.  Cleverley I don't think has ever really shown that he can be more than a very decent squad player.

3227~~~
This all day. Cleverley has a lot of talent but just completely melts under any pressure.

3228~~~
I think his time was up on the pre season tour last season, when he talked about this been his time to shine and was given the captaincy in a pre season match which resulted in him being subbed off at half time. 

Like Welbeck he's a good player who was managed by a exceptional manager.

3229~~~
Disagree on the first two, agree ohnth second. His touch is actually pretty damn good, rarely have any complaints about that. You just don't notice its good cos he never does anything with it once he's brought it under control. Even when he played quite well for Wigan and had a good little run of a few games before Davies he wasn't really making long range passes

3230~~~
If you listen to him speak its not confidence he lacks. He comes across as needing a slap across the face and a reality check. He's got too much of an opinion on his ability, he could do with getting his head down and actually getting up to the level he thinks he is at.

3231~~~
I get the impression that he's convinced that if he played in Spain, he would be lauded as a great player.

3232~~~
Imagine Cleverley and Welbeck storming it next season at Arsenal.

3233~~~
People will talk about Delph's performance today, and rightly so, but I felt Cleverley was outstanding in Villa's midfield too. He pressed well, kept the ball and put in some really good and important tackles.

3234~~~
Awesome today. He'll do great with Herrera in tandem.

<span style="color: #ffffff">:-p</span>

3235~~~
Please Herrera would be his understudy
<span style="color: #ffffff">lolz</span>

3236~~~
I fully agree. He looked a lot sharper than in his final months with us. I wonder if LvG wants him back. And if he does, I look forward to seeing what Louis, the man that brought back the real Young, the real Fellaini and the real Valencia, can turn him into. Happy days. <span style="color: #ffffff">No white text...I'm serious!</span>

3237~~~
Pleased for him. Hope he chooses the right club and does well.

3238~~~
Has he still have a future at our club? Can he still contribute?

3239~~~
He's going to be laughing at us all with his F.A Cup medal in a few weeks. Then he'll have shown us what we're missing, and all we'll be able to do is look on like a jealous ex-boyfriend.


<span style="color: #ffffff">Maybe. Not really. Whatever.</span>

3240~~~
He's out of contract in the summer, we tried to sell him in January to Villa. So I doubt it

3241~~~
He has a good game, but loads of average players do. He has no future here.

3242~~~
You lot think Wenger would really take him to Arsenal? Would he get on much?

3243~~~
nope.

3244~~~
He was very good today particularly in the first half. Good energy and good ball retention and an eye to keep things ticking. 

Problem is he is either incapable of shooting and defensive splitting passes or he chooses not to which is equally as bad.

As we've seen with Herrera it is important for our midfielders to score and create opportunities consistently.

3245~~~
Best game I've seen from him for a long time.

Hope he wins it.

3246~~~
One of the only United players who might get some silverware this season. Who would have thought?!

3247~~~
It almost seems unfathomable but Cleverley could actually fit quite well into LVGs possession based system, as a backup for Herrera.

Personally I wont shed any tears if - as is expected - he doesnt get a new contract, but if he doesnt mind being a backup, we could use a few squad players to flesh our squad out next season.


I always felt Cleverley was not suited to the systems we played under Fergie and Moyes, specifically the 2-man midfield. He doesnt contribute enough in any particular area - he is a jack of all trades. In a 3-man midfield where he isnt expected to be the main creator, the main defensive midfielder, or the main anything else, I think he could actually prove decent.

3248~~~
Chicharito's still out there...

3249~~~
Neat and tidy but nothing more. Maybe it was just me, but I noticed loads of times in the first half when he showed a bit <i>too </i>much energy. He'd literally run towards the ball and then start pointing at his feet when he was no more than a couple of feet away. Reminded me of when Herrera said LVG wanted him to learn to stand still and not go charging around.

3250~~~
Welbeck too... Who will win the final? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3251~~~
He won't and shouldn't come back, we don't need more backup players in midfield we need genuine quality and Cleverley clearly isn't that, he looks decent in an average side, as soon as he steps up to a higher level he won't be good enough and won't play so hopefully he has the sense to stay at villa.

3252~~~
Welbeck's no longer a United player. Cleverley still is.

3253~~~
Ah of course.

3254~~~
Nani also has a chance at a medal I think.

3255~~~
Good performance. Hope he has a good premier league career. If he has a career similar to say Darren Bent I'd say he's done well. He's a solid midtable premier league player but I could easily see him moving up or down a few rungs.

3256~~~
Nice try

3257~~~
I can definitely see him going to Everton this summer. Martinez is a known fan from his Wigan days and that move was rumoured to be reasonably close last summer if a fee could have been agreed with us.

3258~~~
Didn't watch the game today. 

I thought he was a good player anyway his confidence just seemed to be completely shattered for whatever reason.

I think he wants to play. If he wanted to stay and be a squad player, I'm sure he could have done that this season. Looks like he'll be going to Everton and I hope he does well there. 

After he helps Villa to beat Arsenal in the cup final that is. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

3259~~~
Angelo Henriquez too...

3260~~~
Hes really picked it up since Sherwood came in. I think he should probably stay at Villa because Sherwood likes him, has him playing well and he'll be a guaranteed starter. Although he should find out if the likes of Delph are going to be sold first and if any money is going to be spent in the summer. No point signing for a sinking ship.

3261~~~
If we had him yesterday, we could have played Rooney up top and possibly not broken the Herrera/Tony/Mata trio :P

3262~~~
I think that Sherwood is like Harry in that he creates a lot of positive energy and buzz around the place, I think Cleverley as a fragile character for a footballer feeds off that.

3263~~~
Said it before, but technically there is nothing wrong with Cleverley. Good technical player.

He just seemed to lack the balls/ have the confidence far too often.

3264~~~
He'd be a good squad player. I remember him always being effective in champions league away fixtures when we set up to get a result, was also very good against real madrid. He usually turns up in the big games and is effective at breaking up the play. He would need to work on getting the team moving forward.

3265~~~
I agree. This is a team reborn!

3266~~~
Amazing how after a good performance, people will give calm, measured opinions. If he has a poor game (for United), he gets an avalanche of abuse.

Was pleased to see him do well, always had a lot of time for him but looks like he will move away and start a career elsewhere and I like to see any youth product to go on and do well in the game.

3267~~~
Good for him.

3268~~~
Only just saw the match. I thought he was good. The entire Villa midfield was good though (or made to look good by a poor Liverpool). Anyway, I hope he wins it!

3269~~~
I didn't get to see the game but I'll catch the highlights later on. But by all accounts, I have seen plenty of Villa fans singling him out for praise. Sounds like Grealish and Delph stole the show but Cleverley was very good.

Good to see him gain some confidence and I would say he has pretty much found his level, for now anyway. In saying that, he will no doubt attract more admiring glances if he keeps impressing until the end of the season.

Reading some of the Villa fans comments about him, it seems they had the exact same issues with Cleverley as our own fans had: he plays with no balls, passes the ball backwards etc. His technical ability was never really a problem, it was the fact that he generally played completely within himself. But it seems he's turned a corner. I wish him the best at whoever he ends up at.

3270~~~
Scored a goal against City <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3271~~~
I take credit for this. Went for a piss and City scored. Came back and sat down and Clevs scored.

3272~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eWhJ712OlJe/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

3273~~~
New possible gibson?

3274~~~
The passion he showed celebrating for that equaliser there he absolutely loved it.

3275~~~
ffs

3276~~~
He's looking like a different player. Just goes to show how important confidence is.

Pleased for him.

3277~~~
Has found his level.

3278~~~
I think it is the pressure. At United people were expecting him to dictate the tempo and also create chances on his own. That too at a time when the squad was very short on midfielders. Not all players can perform with that kind of scrutiny.

Happy for him though. He has found his level.

3279~~~

3280~~~
Yes. He's got a good thing going on at Villa. I think he'd be silly not to sign permanently so he can sit on the Everton bench.

3281~~~
Good goal today, has been great lately. Tim Sherwood has the whole squad turned around and playing good stuff. If they can keep Delph and Benteke then Clevs should be signing on no doubt.

3282~~~
Found his level. Hope it works out for him.

3283~~~
if you look only at central midfield area Everton are not really blessed in that department, probably the main reason why they had such a poor season this campaign. Cleverley would walk into their first eleven but i agree it would be better for him that he stays at Villa specially with Delph deciding to stay.

3284~~~
I don't think he'd be a regular. Barkley will play more regularly, McCarthy is one of their best players and Besic, the player most at risk of being replaced, is better defensively and shows promise.

Cleverley would get games, certainly, but Villa seems to make more sense, primarily because he looks to be enjoying his football now more than he has in a long time. He shouldn't give that up, in my opinion.

3285~~~
Missed the game. How did he play?

3286~~~
Barkley, McCarthy and Cleverley would start in my opinion and think they are more then good enough defensively specially because they plan a is to defend through possession. 
I dont rate Besic at all to be honest, if he was only focused only at defending i would rate him as a solid player but the problem he has is that he thinks he is much better in offensive part of the game then he actually is(the problem many players have). He probably thinks he is Verratti....


As for the second part, i agree with you, he should stay with Villa.

3287~~~
Yeah, a lot of passion when the equaliser went in. Happy he's enjoying his football again.

3288~~~
Did well to score but then went completely to sleep for City's 3rd. Not sure who he was marking but it was probably Fernadinho who scored. He just stood there watching, not sure what he thought would happen <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3289~~~
Found his level, You know.

3290~~~
Fair play to him, seems to have found a home again, can't wish anything but the best to him.

3291~~~
It wasn't. Sanchez was marking Fernandinho.

3292~~~
Can't believe how some are saying they are pleased for him, the abuse he copped from those people last season was crazy.

3293~~~
Ah, he was rubbish for us, but it's always nice to see an academy player doing well in the PL. It also helps that his replacement in the team, Herrera, has been sensational.

3294~~~
No doubt he was poor but he didn't deserve the abuse, no player does. Now those abusing him are trying to take the high ground and wish him well, why weren't they wishing him well last season?

Just a pet hate of mine I guess.

3295~~~
True, we should never abuse or boo our own players. What happened to Fellaini was embarrassing. I think now it's just fine to look back and say that Clevz wasn't good enough for us and that he is doing well in this Villa team.

3296~~~
I still can't believe the cop he got during Carrick's Q and A on twitter and then newspapers even printed some of the garbage directed towards him. I'll never forget the one who asked Carrick if he could go back in time would he stop Hitler or Cleverley's mom having Tom. Then there was pricks on here thinking it was hilarious and saying he deserved it. It was fecking disgraceful.

3297~~~
I had completely forgotten about that; it was horrendous. The United 'fans' on twitter and facebook can be very different to those in the stands and even on here though. Every Facebook post by someone on our team is inevitably followed by someone who purports to be a United telling players to injure themselves or to never play for the team again. Young, Fellaini and Cleverley got a lot of that for pretty much anything they posted.

3298~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3299~~~
Stupid if he Doesn't. Sherwood is a great coach and will get the best out of him. Signing with Everton is a gamble if you ask me. Martinez has enough contacts in Spain to get some midfield maestro which would keep him out of the team if he signed for them.

3300~~~
Remember Darron Gibson? He basically got bullied off twitter after like a week because of our fans (though he's back on it now).

3301~~~
Another goal for Tom today

3302~~~
Villas winner, he's coming good at a crucial time for Villa.

3303~~~
I'm happy for him but it's so typical that he can't stop scoring and we can't buy a goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3304~~~
Wasn't just a great finish. It was a great run bursting into space too.

3305~~~
How many has he scored 15?  20?

3306~~~
Tim Sherwood is the real deal...

3307~~~
Two. The man cannot be stopped.

CANNOT.
BE.
STOPPED.

3308~~~
<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3309~~~
Really happy that's he's started to find some form. Great goal he scored against Everton. 

Not sure what he's going to do next season, but hopefully he'll get back to where he was when playing under SAF.

3310~~~
To be honest, watching Rooney in midfield last weekend was really reminiscent of old TC23.

3311~~~
Get him back in, the lad is a goal machine.

3312~~~
Incredible United midfield scoring this year, even loaned guy can bang in


As soon as the United guys stop scoring, he starts his streak...

3313~~~
So stupid to let him go on a free. Chelsea would have got £15m for him.

3314~~~
Glad hes started playing well again, hes a decent player, not United level though

3315~~~
Fixed.

3316~~~
Still a bucket of shite.  Another Robbie Savage

3317~~~
Needs to stay at Villa. A very good player as he always has been.

3318~~~
I second this notion. Chelsea could get a scarecrow, put a pair of football boots on it, and get the equivalent of the GDP of a small European country for it.

3319~~~
That is too funny <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3320~~~
That's not funny at all. 

Weird you have such a strong stance in the N word thread because of its history but then seem to think this is funny.

3321~~~
Happy for Cleverley. He could become an important player for a mid-table team, which Villa should be next season. The likes of Everton and Southampton will also be interested.

3322~~~
It's a joke at Cleverlys expense...wtf. I don't think its intentions where to belittle the deaths in world war 2! Very odd comparison really

3323~~~
Its not an odd comparison at all, you are against using the N word because of its connection to hatred and death but then think it is funny to compare a footballer to Hitler who was in charge of the killing of 6 million jews, hardly a joke. You say white people can't say the N word in any context, but comparing people to Hitler is ok? To paraphrase you if a person wants to defend their right to compare a footballer to Hitler then they are a piece of shit in my eyes.

3324~~~
You could put anyone as the other subject in that joke. Genghis Khan, Atilla the Hun, Stalin, Mau Zedong...the joke has nothing to do with the holocaust. This is bizarre. Do you feel the same when people jokingly go 'that's how nazi Germany started'?

3325~~~
Somebody on Soccer Saturday last week mentioned that he'll be playing in London next season. West Ham seems like a decent shout. 

I'm glad for him and Sherwood, proving a lot of people wrong.

3326~~~
Good lad TC. Good player, doing well in the prem.

Some people genuinely used to get offended by his existance. Weirdos..

3327~~~
Sign him up, Louis! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3328~~~
Indeed Twigs. Looks to have real confidence in his play at the moment. Happy for him, he should stay at Villa though. Sherwood gets the best out of players like him.

3329~~~
Happy for Tom but a bit disappointed that we missed out on a decent transfer fee for him

3330~~~
Bradford would have been due a percentage, since we pinched him from their youth setup. Would probably have been a nice windfall for them. 

A few million doesn't really mean anything to us, though.

3331~~~
I'm happy for him, I always liked him as a person but for his time at United senior level he was a pile of shite. 

He has a long career ahead of him in the PL, just not at a top club unfortunately, but hey, at least he's already won the league.

3332~~~
Really pleased to see him getting his confidence back and hope he has more belief in his own ability the next time he has a rough spell.

3333~~~
I still just laugh at how some people say they are pleased for him. <a class="username" data-user="87628, @Trizy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87628/">@Trizy</a> two posts up says he always liked him, earlier this season was a different tone though

3334~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3335~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3336~~~
He can't stop scoring <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3337~~~
We were never going to get much for him

3338~~~
Annoying that we aren't going to get a penny for him. I think he would do well at Everton next season.

3339~~~
Seeing as we seem to be missing a 'right sided midfielder', although maybe not at the required level for United, im surprised Van Gaal let him go on loan. I mean, apart from Herrera, we have no one who can play that 8 role. Cleverley would have been ideal to fill in for him if/when injured for this season. 

That aside, I'm really glad he's started to score and do well. Long may it continue.

3340~~~
He is a confidence player. United is too big of a stage for him. We need less players that go missing when things go wrong.

3341~~~
Probably second to Carrick as the best United CM over the last month or so.

3342~~~
Glad TC is picking up but would be a massive step back to see him back in the fold. Would rather see one of our youth squad taking his place in the squad. TC just falls short imho.

3343~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You can still like someone who's shite you know? Just like Falcao, he's a big bag of shite but I really like him as a person.

3344~~~
Yeh, I'm sure it was meant that way. I like my mum but tell her to feck off all the time <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

No harm done though, just making a point how many are taking the high ground with Cleverley now that he is doing well. Wasn't personal, you were just above me and a quick and easy target.

3345~~~
To get the best from Clev's I've always thought you needed to play a 3 man midfield, and have him arriving into the box as often as possible.
He can do the disciplined, donkey work to an extent but he's nothing special in the role, you'd ideally want him going the other way as much as possible.
I hope he does well with his career and pushes on, it was dissapointing how much stick he recieved from fans the past few years.

3348~~~
Shame that our best striker over the past month is playing for Real Madrid too!

3349~~~
Its funny, if Cleverley was playing as he is currently and didnt have prior experience at United, people would be linking him to a move to us and Liverpool.

3350~~~
I think it's fair he's found his level. He would be stupid to sign for Everton or somebody else purely for higher wages. He is back to playing good football for a manager that is getting the best of him. He could quite easily go to Everton and end up falling back down again, hopefully he will continue to get his career back on track.

3351~~~
And then he'd move and end up being a flop. It's amazing how he got in the England team when he did but if he stays at Villa and carries on like this he might not have had his last cap.

3352~~~
I've always liked Tom. Hope he stays at Villa. Better for him to play under Sherwood than Martinez, if you ask me.

3353~~~
You wont be saying that in August when we line up for our first CL qualifier with Clyne, Cleverley and Ings.

3354~~~
If he was likely to play like this for us I'd have him back here in an instant, but I think he doesn't have the mentality to make it at a top club. He also seems a bit dim and LVG likes players who think.

3355~~~
Seems to be liked by the Villa fans now.






And this was all on one page. I couldn't be asked to read the next page.

Edit: I love seeing the praise he was getting ^^ and thought I should read the other pages

3356~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3357~~~
Cleverley or Welbeck to get a cup winner's medal.

3358~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Mad isn't it. Hernandez or Paddy could lift the Champions League as well.

3359~~~
No, no. They are all not good enough, like the rest of our squad.
<span style="color: white">white text</span>

3360~~~
Glad to see him doing well.

3361~~~
He certainly doesn't deserve to go on a free transfer. Some club are getting a good PL player for nowt.

3362~~~
he has found his form again, its great to see.

It will not happen, but I wouldnt mind if LVG offered him a new contract

3363~~~
Wonder if LVG will give him a look in the preseason this summer since he's recouped some of his form.

Not expecting it to happen, but it would be good to see if he was given another chance.

3364~~~
this is my favourite post in this thread

3365~~~
feck it.

#BringCleverleyBack

3366~~~
His contract is up in the summer.

Do not want him back here. Hides when the going gets tough and we don't need more players like that in our team.

3367~~~
Yeah people often will jump on a players bandwagon after a handful of really good games and lets face it that is what we are talking about here a handful of games where Cleverly has done well lately.  Before that his performances did not do much to make anyone notice.

3368~~~
I'll cheer for Villa in FA Cup Final.

3369~~~
My word people here cant stick to their prev statements at all...they change tune week in week out...Its like Soccer Saturday panel.

3370~~~
Good luck to him hope he settles at Villa. He seems a good fit at the moment. Hope his career gets back on track always good to see one of the Academy lads coming good even if it is at a slightly lower level.

3371~~~
I hope he doesn't come back, I couldn't care less about getting some money in Cleverley's case. We have wasted so many millions in the past on some players so why now cry not getting a few millions for an academy lad out of all ppl? 
If he comes back he will get abuse from the same ppl who abused him before and somehow made him responsible for our 7-years-non-existent-midfield. For his own good I hope he stays at Villa for now or goes to another club as if he continues to be the player some United fans still know he is, there will be other clubs interested in him, too. 
I hope he has a great career and gets a huge signing on fee and mega wages.

I am sad it didn't work out for him here, but I am proud that he is our academy product and wish him all the best.

3372~~~
If he would come back, he would be the same after the first few shite performances. He just isnt good enough for us to play most games.

3373~~~
Thought it was nailed on he'd go to Everton this summer but he seems to be enjoying it under Sherwood. Might end up staying at Villa.

3374~~~
He'll be daft to sign for Villa on the basis of signing for Sherwood. I doubt he'll last past Christmas.

3375~~~
I am right in thinking we won't get anything for him now?

If the guys got any sense he'll stay where he is.

3376~~~
Based on what?

3377~~~
In his short time as manager, he has looked very good IMO

Not sure why people think he isn't cut out

Don't think he has ever even signed a player.

3378~~~
Based on it being an unforgiving job. They won't invest in the squad once more and it's already a tough job as it is. I don't think he's good enough to keep this purple patch going on very little fundamental it's him the owners will scapegoat.

3379~~~
Will make a prediction now

Villa will be comfortably mid table next season

3380~~~
Not if they sell Benteke.

3381~~~
Fair enough. I think they need investment and Lerner won't give it to them and it'll be a tough job.

3382~~~
He has done well playing further forward, in a similar role to what Herrera does for us. Glad he has done well at Villa but we have better options and shouldn't be considering recalling him.

3383~~~
Considering his contract is up we can't recall him

3384~~~
I have faith in your ability Thomas. Go out there and lift the trophy.

3385~~~
I think there's a lot more to come from you and I believe you've got what it takes.

3386~~~
Is that you Brenton?

3387~~~
No doubt Clevs is reading the caf at half time so we'll see a boost of confidence from him here.

3388~~~
*Cleverly inexplicably reacts with anger and starts complaining to the press*

3389~~~
I appreciate your efforts, you were just unlucky today.

3390~~~
He was absolutely rubbish today.

3391~~~
He was worse than rubbish, I had hoped we might get a few bob for him, not on that display.

3392~~~
We won't get *anything* for him. His contract is up.

3393~~~
Yes I know, I meant before his loan.

3394~~~
Ah right, my bad! I know what you mean though, would have thought if he'd had a few years on his contract we'd be able to get a decent fee from an Everton or Spurs. 

Was poor this evening, but he has been one of Villa's better players recently (although that doesn't say a whole lot).

3395~~~
It's okay everyone, you don't need to pretend to have always rated him (or something along those lines) anymore.

3396~~~
It's good that he's found his level, but he really needs to stop doing that thing where he asks for the ball as though he's going to make something happen. A lot of the time, he has space ahead of him but he refuses to move forward. Weird...

3397~~~
Delph and Grealish were guilty of that too. A really bizarre performance from Villa today.

3398~~~
Probably the biggest match a lot of those players will have played in/will play in. Looked like the occasion got to them big time.

3399~~~
I guess he must not have signed the contract and Sherwood stuck to his word and didn't play him in the Cup final, tough one for TC23.

3400~~~
The club will save 60k a week. 

He looked a player for about 6 games when he first broke into United's first team. Never recovered his form since being injured in the Bolton game by Davies.

3401~~~
Good lord how many times does it have to be said he is out of contract in the summer?

3402~~~
We tried to sell him but his contract demands screwed the deal

3403~~~
When Villa were two down and he received the ball a few times just outside Arsenal's box but kept passing it backwards, I actually sighed. Damn it Tom.

3404~~~
He was tidy enough yesterday and worked hard but, christ, if he can't even take it on himself to try and do something positive at Wembley in an FA Cup Final with 2 goals down and nothing to lose, rather than giving an easy pass to the left or right every time, then he never will.

3405~~~
He was garbage yesterday, all those lazy sideways passes he plays are tiresome.

3406~~~
My least favorite Utd player in 27 years as a red. Absolutely no balls at all. Constantly waiting for someone else to make something happen, no drive or daring yet thinks he is the second coming of Zidane.

3407~~~
I honestly dont think he thinks he is... But one thing that still dumbfounds me is after watching him play for a few years now i still have absolutely no idea what his best position is. Its like hes a mix of several positions but not dominate in any.

3408~~~
He has clearly learn a lot from Rooney. Too many easy passes.

3409~~~
So, looks like he's off to Everton....

Assuming he starts for them who will he be replacing?

3410~~~
Probably the last clunker they bought off us.

3411~~~
Gareth Barry.

3412~~~
He's not good enough for United. A pity we didn't sell him last Summer and get a few bob.

3413~~~
I asked about this in the Twitter thread - didn't we accept an offer from Villa to buy him last summer, but he turned-down the permanent move so he could move for free this summer and pocket the money himself, or was that proven to be nonsense?

3414~~~
Think they bid 7m, he didn't want to go there on a perma transfer and Everton weren't willing to stump up the cash. They knew he wanted to join so just waited a year.

3415~~~
We tried his wage demands got in the way

3416~~~
from this Guardian article: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/02/tom-cleverley-aston-villa-loan-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/02/tom-cleverley-aston-villa-loan-manchester-united</a>

3417~~~
Why didn't we take the 5 million quid and run? How does he think he deserves 60K a week?

3418~~~
Because you can't sell a player if he doesn't want to be sold.

3419~~~
It says we rejected the bid though.

3420~~~
Ah, I see.

3421~~~
I don't know why but I really struggle to like Tom Cleverley in anyway.

3422~~~
Villa had an offer accepted. Cleverley wanted to go to Everton. They put in an offer of some sort that was rejected. Cleverley and his agent thought United would be willing to loan him to Everton but we weren't so he made a desperate last minute, or perhaps extra time, move to Villa on loan. 

I think it is a bit of a leap to say Cleverley rejected Villa for financial reasons, especially given it all happened at the end of the transfer window. Everton probably spent more on Lukaku than they expected and therefore didn't have the funds for Cleverley. The last few days of the transfer window are chaotic with several parties all waiting for each other to change their offer.

3423~~~
Hope he does well at Everton. Not good enough for us unfortunately. Just feel sorry for the lad really.
