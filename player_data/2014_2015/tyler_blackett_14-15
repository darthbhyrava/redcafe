So, what do people think? Will he feature a lot this season? Looks imposing and could be an ideal cover as the left sided center back in a back 3 (even a back-up left back)

Would be amazing to see 3-4 youngsters get properly into the fold this season
(couldn't find a thread on him)

edit: Didn't see the other thread on him. Never really had great success with the search engine on the caf...

2~~~
I thought he was one of the dew players who looked poor yesterday. I can understand the nerves but he gave the ball away on a couple of errant passes, showed no urgency in retrieving the ball and generally looked very lethargic. That's pretty harsh assessment but he really looked shaky to me as a defender.

3~~~
I don't think he had an amazing outing, but nor did Shaw for that matter. The word Warren Barton (commenting) used to describe Shaw was timid. I'm inclined to agree.

Last I saw Blackett he was physically weaker, looks like he's getting bigger and Van Gaal had a few center backs who managed to execute this system perfectly in Brazil despite, perhaps, their lack of technical ability. 20 years old is young enough to enroll into the Van Gaal education program.

4~~~
I don't like to be overly critical of young players but I don't think he has a chance at United. He's a good athlete but doesn't have enough quality on the ball to play at this level. His discomfort in possession was painfully evident last night. I don't think it would have come as a surprise to anyone who is familiar with his game.

It's no slight on the lad. I think he will make a reasonable Championship player which is nothing to be ashamed of

5~~~
Said in his reserve forum thread that aside from one mistake where he got caught under the ball, he didn't do an awful lot wrong and was growing into the game as the 2nd half went on.

Time is on his side, if he listens and learns he can occupy that LCB role, even if only as cover for LB as well. Reckon he might surprise a few.

6~~~
Based on what? Barring athleticism what do you feel he offers?

7~~~
He seemed a natural successor to Evra a few years back, then his development seemed to stall a bit. Hope this is the start of him getting back on track.

8~~~
Call it a feeling, his athleticism is a good starting point though, he has the experience of playing both LB and CB and if he can marry those two then he can excel in a back 3. As I said though he will need to listen and he will need to learn. I don't think he is as far away as some suggest.

Opinions eh ?

9~~~
I don't think he has really excelled in either position and he's not a good enough ball player for the first team imo. Anyway let's wait and see. It's never nice criticising young players so I'm going to stop now.

10~~~
I thought he was the poorest of our players. Misplaced a pass a few times and looked very uncomfortable in possession. And this is with a poor Galaxy barely posing any threat.

11~~~
Been back and watched the second half again. It is as I thought, a decent performance from a young lad in a new role.

A couple of times when he ceded possession he was left with little he could do, one of the balls played to him took a nasty bounce and he got it safe. One was an attempted through pass which I'm not going to eat his lunch for. 3 I would put him at fault for. (Michael Keane had 2 for balance sake)

He looked good with the ball at feet bringing it out, doing that started the move with Ashley Young's deft flick that Herrera over hit the return on. He rode a challenge beating a man in doing so for that one.

Made a good near post clearance from a set piece and snuffed out a Rob Friend chance near the end, used his body well a couple of times to end attacks from them as well.

Nothing amazing, and against a side we are clearly better than, but in no way should people be as down on his performance as they have been.

12~~~
Maybe for a young lad it wasn't that bad, I just think the rest of the players were better. Still early days - lets see how he performs against better teams the rest of the pre-season.

13~~~
No, he wasn't bad. Although to me, he stuck out the most as a player that wasn't ready. Keane for example I think will be a good PL CB. Blackett will end up in the Championship.

14~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett.393668/page-2">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett.393668/page-2</a>

he hasn't made it yet!!

15~~~
He was on the tour a few years back, looked ok. Nothing more. Just another person coming along to enjoy the ride. Thankfully he'll remain a minnow, similar to that of Phil Barsdley

16~~~
Looked shaky on the ball, which is too bad since he's a more natural fit as an LCB than anyone else we have in that he's left-footed, sort of quick and has played left-back and center back.

17~~~
That reminds me that Fryers would have also been in a good spot to fight for LCB minutes now, had he not left.

18~~~
Fryers hasn't exactly been a revelation at Spurs. As of last season he's still struggling to get into the 1st team.

19~~~
A few pages of comments in the Reserve Forum...

20~~~
I keep seeing these same kind of comments whenever it's mentioned that Fletcher, Young, Blackett etc had a good match. It's almost always the Galaxy were crap, in order to lessen their contribution. Which I suppose could be valid. But maybe I missed it, but no one ever mentions that Herrera had an outstanding match cause the Galaxy were shite. That his through balls were splitting a crap, poorly positioned defense. That anyone would look good against that Galaxy side, especially in the second half . . .

21~~~
You don't see these comments about Herrera, because it was obvious that he is head and shoulders above the opposition. Blackett on the other hand had some shaky moments and more or less played on the same level as Galaxy. Anyway, I'm willing to cut him some slack with him being a young lad and all that, but I have to say from the three youngsters the other day he impressed the least and doesn't look ready for the first team yet. However it's early days, lets wait and see...

22~~~
I saw him playing with Spurs against Toronto F.C. the other night. An absolutely turgid affair - Spurs were awful, with the exception of Lamela, who looked very good.

23~~~
Such as ?

You don't see the comments about Herrera because it's in vogue to play down our own products performances whilst over-rating others. I have seen Tom Cleverley get stick for his performance bizarrely.

They both must have been terrible, to be rewarded by van Gaal with 90 minutes this evening.

24~~~
Impression I've always got of Blackett is strong and quick but loses concentration too much, haven't seen him since he was captain of the U18's mind.

25~~~
I've always thought he was pretty good technically. He's always impressed me with his attacking play from left back and that volley he hit in last years reserves final was a near perfect execution of an incredibly hard shot. I can only assume his incredible physique is what's leading some to write him off as just an athlete. I'd agree with others that his main problem is his concentration in defence and his attitude didn't seem great at Birmingham.

26~~~
What 90 minutes?

27~~~
Against Roma, van Gaal confirmed they were both playing the full 90

28~~~
Blackpool? Was he at Birmingham too? He's got a real good technique too, scored a great free-kick or long ranger once in the U18's I'm certain.

29~~~
Swansea in the FA Youth cup.

30~~~
Looked very calm and composed of what i saw of him.Can fully understand why Van Gaal wants to take a good look at him.

31~~~
Yeah, he was on loan at both clubs. At one of them he had a bit of a strop after being subbed, possibly in the first half, and seemed to be frozen out after that. Nothing too outrageous for someone who was 19 at the time but far from ideal.

32~~~
Hmmm, I always thought he had something about him a few years back but I thought he had stagnated. Thorpe and Keane are ahead of him in terms of backup CB's I reckon, let's see what Van Gaal can do with him.

33~~~
Hopefully he takes his chance. It's always great to see the kids playing

34~~~
Oh, ok. I haven't watched the press conference yet. Let's see how he performs. As I said before, I wasn't impressed by him, but i'm keeping an open mind.

35~~~
The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that LVG has decided that our top CBs shouldn't play on the left of back three. Jones and Evans in the middle and Jones and Smalling on the right. It's 95% sure we are getting a left footed CB. Blackett is being evaluated if he can cover as a backup to the new CB. Let's see how he does. Roma will play with two wingers and I can see them targeting our left side, especially in the second half when Blackett tires. It's going to be a big test for him.

36~~~
I'm surprised people are suggesting he looked shaky on the ball.

Watching the 2nd half twice I felt he was composed and assured on the ball and even played his way out of trouble. He slightly overhit a long pass that started the move for one of our goals too. He reminded me a bit of Bruno Martins Indi for the Dutch side this summer.

At the same time I felt he did probably the least defensively of the players used in the back 3 in that match

37~~~
Was gonna say that but didn't want to be accused of racial stereotyping <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

38~~~
Great match from him!!!!

39~~~
He seems to be growing in confidence as the tour goes on.

40~~~
Him and Keane have both been impressive.

41~~~
I like the look of him, quite the imposing figure on the pitch. Better technique that I expected from him too in regards to his frame.

42~~~
Looks like Kid Cudi, not bad, not bad.

43~~~
I like him. Very good on the ball, fast and good positioning. Any chance of trying him in midfield? He seems very calm under pressure.

44~~~
Really hope Blackett or James will be our 2nd LB, Blackett has played terrific.

45~~~
I really like what I see. Plays with a lot of confidence, makes few mistakes, has pace, and is comfortable with the ball in his feet.

46~~~
Impressive half from him, looking more and more settled and he is comfortable with the ball at his feet.

47~~~
Looks quite decent. Strange I haven't heard more about him up until this tour.

48~~~
Almost flawless performances during the tour so far. Van Gaal's methods of training with youth definitely speeding up development process.

Surprised by his confidence with so little games in the first squad. (Same goes to Reece James.)

49~~~
Starting to like him. On the ball he was excellent tonight with at least 1 peach of a long ball. Did have one misplaced header on 88 mins

50~~~
Had a good pre-season so far, taken his opportunity well. Dodgy header at the end aside I don't think he put a foot wrong all game. Will be interesting to see whether he stays or goes out on loan again next season.

51~~~
Really impressed me tonight. Could have a big future.

52~~~
Really impressed with the young players this tour, they've shown a lot more hunger to impress the manager. Blackett has just been superb so far.

53~~~
Good performance. Van Gaal obviously seems some potential in him to give him al this playing time.

54~~~
Very assured performance from him again today, him and Shaw look good down that left hand side.

His vision and execution in his passing is brilliant for someone so young. Usually you get one or the other at his age. Very promising.

55~~~
Pretty impressive today tbh.

But his weakness is players running off him off the ball and his awareness in relation to that plus recovering when he loses them. In that area he wasn't tested today really as Inter didn't really commit players forward.

56~~~
He played in the preseason tour before the last. Very impressive this tour.

57~~~
Where are all his doubters now? Class again. Refreshing with a CB who can actually pass the ball, yes Smalling and Jones, I'm looking at you.

58~~~
Why does the Daily Mail say he was shaky against Roma?  Was he at fault for any of the goals?  I don't remember.

59~~~
Hes a better options than Vermaelen. I'd keep him as our 4th choice defender and not buy a defender this season. He was incredibly good tonight imo, very good on the ball and very calm when under pressure.

60~~~
I think LVG will like the look of him so far. Could make a good ball playing CB.

61~~~
Smalling also passed the ball well today

62~~~
Could he be <i>the</i> youngster that van Gaal develops into a great player? He certainly looks composed in the back there, coming up against the likes of Roma and Inter which is not an easy task for a 20 year old only just getting first team action. I certainly like the look of him, and with the right development could become an absolute beast of a player.

63~~~
Was really good tonight, even though he gave away 2 silly balls at the end. He seems very composed.

64~~~
He shouted to Pjanic "Bet you cant score from there"

Looked nervous on a couple of balls in behind the defence, to be fair Evans was caught out with one of them as well

65~~~
He did let their striker run off the back of him a couple times. Although I thought one or two looked offsides that weren't given. Other than one chance it led to little for Roma.

Didn't put a foot wrong in the second though.

66~~~
To be fair, he did.

67~~~
Really good today. Even joined the attack and worked well with Shaw out the left side.

68~~~
Good performance all around and his passing has been good all pre-season.

69~~~
Perhaps it's a good idea to wait one season for Hummels and play Blackett, then divert funds into midfield and wings for this window.

70~~~
It is nice to know we have two really comfortable ball players at centre back in Blackett and Evans, we need it after Rio has gone.

71~~~
This. We don't play in Europe this season. He can be our 4th choice easily and that doesn't mean he's going to play week in week out, although I think he is capable.

72~~~
Vermaelen has experience on his side though, a bit underrated here. Was very good at Ajax and had an impressive first season at Arsenal. Just the fact he's so feckin injury prone, which puts people off. I agree with Blackett though, looks a player.

73~~~
He did okay, Inter didn't challenge him though. Still think Keane has enjoyed a better pre-season.

74~~~
I was confused by some of the positive reception for him he had gotten to this point.  So I guess I would've agreed with them to an extent. 

Showed a bit more tonight, IMHO...

75~~~
Well, we can spend money on Vermaelen because of his experience but is he more experienced than Evans, for example? He is too injury prone to be worth purchasing and Blackett comes with the homegrown tag as well.

76~~~
Looked great tonight and I watched back the first game and I thought he wasn't as bad as he was made out to be by some. I think, to borrow a phrase from Tom Cleverley, he's the sort of player who could really suit Van Gaal's philosophy.

77~~~
I'd agree. Being a left footer is working for Blackett though.

78~~~
It is about even for me, Keane edges it defensively, Blackett has been better in his distribution. But very little between the two in either aspect.

79~~~
Keane is a typical Mancunian, playing very good but going unnoticed, hasnt put a foot wrong.

80~~~
Blackett's clearly coming on in training as he looked much more certain of himself at centre-half today than last weekend. This is what I've been saying about our 'trainer-coach', he has the ability and philosophy to really develop young players. If Blackett just does what Van Gaal tells him to do he'll grow into a steady centre back in this system.

81~~~
Happy for the lad, did really well. Good passing and good dribbling too. Had the Inter players in his pocket.

82~~~
His distribution can be useful when playing against inferior opposition so I can see him getting a few league games this season if being kept.

83~~~
I wouldnt mind giving him a run in the first team this year. He doesn't have to go out on loan. CC and FA Cup games he can start and in the league, against the lower table teams, he can get a run. Thats the brilliance of playing 3 at the back. Players like Blackett can easily get an opportunity because we have an extra defender.

84~~~
He did really well today. Impressive. I haven't impressed with him against LA and Roma. But this time he is more solid and confident.

85~~~
Not watched the game, where did he play? I watched him a few times in the academy and i know he played LB, but Shaw occupied that side of the pitch right? 

I'm guessing he played CB?

86~~~
Yeah left CB of the 3.

I think he may be more suited to that position than left back.

87~~~
Nice one, sounds like Michael Keane had a good game too.

Evans/Smalling/Jones/Keane/Blackett maybe we aren't that desperate for a new CB afterall.

88~~~
We definitely need at least one. 5 players for 3 positions isn't enough. We need at least 2 players for each position. That being said, Blackett has been great so far and I don't know if Van Gaal will still feel we need Vermaelen as he was probably looking at him as either backup for Jonny or to replace Smalling. With Blackett ready to do either, perhaps that transfer is no longer necessary. Keane doing well also.

89~~~
I have been impressed with both Keane & Blackett i would like to see both promoted to the first team squad. Still think we need an experienced CB though especially if we are going to permanently play 3 at the back. Signing a CB would give us 6 to cover 3 positions. At some point during the season its likely all of Jones, Evans & Smalling could be injured at the same time.

90~~~
Blackett looks like a proper player in the making - very good on the ball.

91~~~
Will he be good enough for this season so we dont have to go for a new CB?

92~~~
We need an experienced Center Back, preferably a left footed one.

93~~~
We should still be looking at bringing one more defender in if him and Keane are promoted.

94~~~
Reminds me of Rio how calm and composed he seems on the ball,Thought he did ok in the other two matches to.

95~~~
I was a little surprised he was brought on the tour but his taken his opportunity and will probably be in and around the first team next season. But I still think Van Gaal will look to bring in another left footed central defender.

96~~~
Blackett wasn't really tested by Inter. When he was in the games before he looked vulnerable, which quite normal to be fair. I hope gets his chance in the first team but we shouldn't have to count on him especially in big games if one or more of the only 3 PL proven defenders has one of his regular injury problems.

We must sign at least one top defender who also stays fit! So I do not talk about Vermaelen. The decision in terms of Vermaelen is him or Blackett as squad player / cover at the back.

97~~~
On Blackett's loan and U21s role:

Blackett is listed on transfermarkt as having played 1 game at CB during each loan (2 out of 13 games).

The first game he played at CB, Blackpool lost 5-1 to Derby. The second, Birmingham lost 4-2 to Blackburn. So when he played CB last season his teams concede 4.5 goals on average. In the first he played 90, the second he was yanked at halftime (where all 4 goals were conceded in the first half).


Blackpool: 5 games (all starts)
LB - 3 games
CB - 1 (second to last game)
LW - 1 (last game)

Birmingham: 8 games (6 starts)
LB - 5
CB - 1 (last game)
subs - 2 (position not listed)


In both cases he started out as a LB and moved for a game to CB, suggesting they didn't prefer him there, he may have been injury cover as well. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.com/tyler-blackett/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/134414/plus//saison/2013" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.com/tyler-blackett/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/134414/plus//saison/2013</a>


When he played CB for the reserves in 2012-13 he had 3 games at CB, during which we conceded 5 goals, which was the worst rate of the 11 players who played CB that season.

Obviously such a stat is far from comprehensive for analyzing performance, there are 10 other players on the pitch too who influence goals conceded. But I don't doubt it's meaningful data either.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/reserves-statistics-2012-13.359329">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/reserves-statistics-2012-13.359329</a>

98~~~
He was very good yesterday I thought. Very calm and composed on the ball.

99~~~
Thought he played really well last night. Really composed on the ball and uses his space well. Rarely got caught out defensively. I want to see him get more chances because I think he has a lot of potential.

100~~~
This position really suits him. I don't think he's ever looked as good as this consistently as a full-back in the reserves.

101~~~
So calm and composed on the ball. He played as part of the back 3 last night, but is he better in the LWB role?

102~~~
Or he could simply be raising his game because he's playing with better players. Some players thrive on pressure. Love young lads breaking through, the first of several imo.

103~~~
That too.

Yeah, if LVG's approach so far is anything to go on, there'll be plenty coming through over the next couple of seasons. The ones on tour aren't even necessarily the most gifted, just the ones who we currently have squad positions available for. Wait till he gets a look at the likes of Lawrence and Wilson, and eventually Pearson and Rothwell.

104~~~
Agreed. I think we'll see a fair few of our youngsters given a proper go. I know he said that he wants to concentrate on the First Team, but he strikes me as the type of man that can't help but get involved and after a few weeks he'll be assessing the players left at home. He gave Alaba minutes in the First Team when he was 17.

105~~~
I was a little confused when he said this, surely a way of looking to improve the first team is to have a look at the reserves and U-18's first ? 

I am sure what he meant was the structure of the academy was what he didn't want to get involved in initially.

106~~~
Looks really good

107~~~
I assumed he was basically just talking about pre-season. He wanted to use it to sort out his first team squad - including some spots that might be filled by youngsters like Keane, Blackett and James - and only once he's done that will he start looking at youngsters like Wilson etc who aren't strictly <i>needed</i> in the first team just yet.

108~~~
Been great since he's come on so far.

109~~~
I have doubts about him but TBF he's looked really good on tour.

110~~~
He's looked really really good on this tour.

111~~~
LCB in a back three suits him perfectly. More comfortable on the ball than our senior defenders too.

112~~~
He's ace. Didn't have him down as one of the potential reserve players who could make an impact this season.

113~~~
Excellent since coming on against Liverpool. Considering we were behind at the time and low on belief his composure has been very impressive.

114~~~
I can't recall him doing a single thing wrong/poorly in any of the games.  Reminds me of Smalling's early appearances.

115~~~
He looked a bit nervous against Galaxy but looked better every game since then, he should be given a chance to make a breakthrough.

116~~~
Looks like Blackett will be one of the players Van Gaal will Schweinsteiger. Never taught he would seemlessly adapt to the centerback role. Albeit, I taught that he did seem to heavy and strong to be a proper fullback.

I also remember that he has a strong left foot. We have not gotten to see it this pre-season, but hopefully we can utilized that ability sometimes in the future.

117~~~
Impressive again.

118~~~
I thought since he came on second half we looked much calmer at the back, looks like a very strong defender, perhaps we can save a few dollars and give guys like Blackett and even Keane a chance has back ups to our main 3, and under van gaal he will not be shy from putting younger players in the first team

119~~~
Will be happy for us to give youth a chance and allow Blackett to be 4th choice CB. He looks like a very composed player.

120~~~
Our 2nd most convincing CB today after Smalling and clearly our best ball player in the backline. He looks ready

121~~~
want to see a lot more of him after this showing.

122~~~
Very impressed, will feature for the 1st team this season surely?

123~~~
Hope he's pushed like Van Gaal did with Badstuber. Looked very composed again.

124~~~
Very impressive and composed performance. Credit to him for taking his chance this pre-season, didn't think he had a future before the tour.

125~~~
I know nothing of him from the reserves/youth team but I've been very impressed during pre-season.

He should definitely get games this season.

126~~~
Should start against Swansea if Evans and Jones can't buck their ideas up. Both of them were shocking and Blackett looked so assured when he came on.

127~~~
Better than Jones.

128~~~
Crazy that he was getting torn a new one in the Championship with Birmingham just last season.

129~~~
Given him a lot of stick for his lapse in concentration - but his showings in this tournament have been brilliant.

130~~~
He looks like 30 year old who has been playing LCB for his entire career. Impressive. 
His ability in one-on-one situations will be very useful as neither of Jones and especially Evans are good in these.

131~~~
This role suits him, not are I'd want him as a CB or LB un a back four. But the back three seems to be ideal for him. 1st reserve at the very least for me at the moment.

132~~~
The lad did well. Good to see youth team players doing well, hopefully he gets game time this season.

133~~~
Honestly, I think he's better than Indi who played in the same position, under LvG.

134~~~
Was good at Blackpool for the most part and wasn't terrible at Birmingham, just inconsistent.

135~~~
Putting some stank on it, this lad

136~~~
He is so calm with the ball and always seems to take the right decision. Deserves to start against Swansea ahead of Evans based on the preseason games.

137~~~
Playing on the left side of three centerbacks he only really has to worry about one side, and I think this gives him the confidence to aggressively charge forward to make interceptions and challenges.  I don't think I would trust him in a flat back four just yet.

138~~~
He looks a real talent. Solid, pacey, decent on the ball. Doesn't look rash at all so Phil Jones would do well to watch him.

Definitely needs to play if we're not buying anyone else because he's left sided so it adds much needed balance to the back three.

139~~~
He's given me confidence in our CB issue, still think we'll need another CB but we've got some nice depth in there now. 

Not just depth though, at this rate he deserves to start.

140~~~
Great game again by Blackett. Very impressive and self assured. Great passing too. Hope he plays first team games this season.

141~~~
He's the only one in our back 3 that doesnt leave me nailbiting when he is on the ball. SO much composure and good defensively. Very impressed with him.

142~~~
Well no, he wasn't just 'not terrible', he was dogshite and had an absolute nightmare at Birmingham. He was a liability at left back and I honestly had no hope of him coming back and having a successful career at United, but he's done that and so far excelled at centre back where he looks a much better prospect.

143~~~
So impressive once again. Get him in the first team as soon as possible. He looks fantastic. I do agree that the back 3 system appears to suit him.

144~~~
Fearless, but not in a brain-switched-off way like Jones is much of the time.

145~~~
Hasn't put a foot wrong this tournament, has he ? With 3 at the back this year it seems obvious to me that he'll get his chances here, especially given their injury records. Looked faultless today, definitely the best centre-back we've had on the pitch tonight.

146~~~
Think this is what's going on.

147~~~
What I liked about him today is that he was very aggressive in his defending without going to ground. He was stepping out and applying pressure to attackers as soon as they received the ball. Also he looks like he has a great turn of pace, and of course we all can see how good he is on the ball. Looks like this guy will become a top player.

148~~~
He's been one of the best players on the entire tour. The kid has a lot of talent. Very composed too.

149~~~
He's quality on the ball.

150~~~
Smalling RCB, Evans middle, Blackett LCB for me for the Swansea game if we sign no one else.

151~~~
And thats the clincher. He's intelligent in his movement.

152~~~
Yeah, excellent player. I know it's only pre season but you can just tell he's class. Instantly improved our defence today.

153~~~
Spot on. On the basis of the preseason, we should play Smalling, Blackett and one of Jones/Evans as CBs.

154~~~
He had a big impact on settling our back 3 in the second half, he brought the ball out with confidence, read situations well and even stepped up centrally to head away one or two balls. Very impressive and has improved game by game on this tour.

155~~~
This.

Except for the first half vs Roma very impressive. 

Not sure what to make of him now though as he does't have experience of doing well in the first team anywhere so far.

156~~~
Great player, surely he'll be in LVG's smaller squad this season. Also removes the need to buy 2 CBs, just need 1 now.

157~~~
I'm sure that he will become one of LvG's favourites, if he isn't already. He has really impressed this pre-season.

158~~~
Very impressed with him. Think he can become better than Smalling.

159~~~
He's been too consistent to not be considered a top young talent imo. Today was his best performance (no mean feat considering how good he's been in the rest of the pre-season). He looked such an intelligent defender today, didn't tackle from behind (Jones) and marshalled his man perfectly. He was especially good in one-on-one situations. I'm really excited for him. He'll definitely get chances this season imo. Hope he continues his pre-season form into the Premier League.

160~~~
Is it was to much of a stereotype to say that he reminds me of a young Rio?

161~~~
I'm not convinced that he is reading the game very well, but he has played well these past two matches.

162~~~
Looks that way

163~~~
Been really impressed with him. While he still needs to work on his positioning, he seems so calm and assured on the ball, and I can imagine he's the type of player would want to bring through.

164~~~
I don't think this changes the fact that we need a CB, but he has done well on the tour. Was a surprise addition really.

165~~~
Thought he was great, yet again. Not going to say he changed the game, I don't think you can ever say that for a CB but he gave us a lot more composure to deal with their press (I know it dropped off in the 2nd half a little). He has had a great tour and should start the season in the first team squad in my opinion.

166~~~
Yup. Would still like to see a veteran CB brought in (Hummels or Vermaelen, though it looks like it will be Vermaelen) who can help shore up the back line. Though I'd like to see Blackett get some time in for the first team this season, he's deserved that with his performances on the tour.

167~~~
Why? He's read the game extremely well imo, better than most of our cbs on tour. Really composed and excellent positioning. Doesn't commit himself unless the time is right. I'm really not sure why you would think this.

168~~~
Looks like the calmest defender we have. Nothing seems to faze him, the player with the least amount of experience.

169~~~
No it just makes you a racist.

<span style="color: #ffffff">White text.</span>

170~~~
Very composed yet again.

171~~~
More like ledley King for me

172~~~
Rio and Ledley King taken.

There's still the Sol Campbell comparison to be made, if anyone is interested.

173~~~
More technical on the ball and with his passing than either of those two. He's something else

174~~~
Pleased for him, acquitted himself really we'll and must be in the managers thoughts, I know he's been in the academy a fair few years, so I presume he's a local lad (as local as you can with the 1 hour rule)

Anyone know where he's from? It would be good to get another Manc in the team.

175~~~
He looked far more comfortable than Keane has looked on tour, and might have just earned a spot in the squad too.

176~~~
How tall is he?

177~~~
Young
Mcgrath maybe?

178~~~
Not sure, but he looks like he's filled out a lot in the last year or so.

179~~~
Well maybe that was exactly the experience he needed (in hindsight). Sometimes these situations give you so much more. Let's see how he develops when it really counts in the League

180~~~
Yesterday was played at a good tempo, much higher than your run-of-the-mill pre-season match.

I'm quite shocked that LVG seems to get so much out of some of these players. Blackett suddenly looks like a squad option for us.

181~~~
For a start, Blackett seems like more composed on the ball, and has good footballing brain on decision making. I'm just glad we didn't pursue Indi (like few suggested), when we have a potentially better gem already (in hindsight).

182~~~
I think his weight of pass is actually sublime, at least with the normal low passes and not the longer high balls. Its like the passes Carrick will sometimes do into the striker's feet in space, only because Blackett is doing it from CB he is finding the CMs in advanced areas, in space and with really good weight of pass so they can move it on faster.

183~~~
I was surprised he came on tour here and thought his United career was going to be over after the Birmingham loan. He was dreadful there, even though Birmingham were really struggling last year. Pleased to have seen him play so well on tour but not going to go OTT. He's good on the ball though and I think he'll be part of the first team next season.

184~~~
Been very impressed with him, seems very calm on the ball. Hope he pushes on and keeps improving.

185~~~
his positioning and man-marking against Roma was poor but apart from that he looked promising. Still has a lot to learn but I like how calm he is. As he is left footed and good on the ball he seems made for LvG.

186~~~
Roma brutally exposed him but in all fairness, young defender in a new formation and a new manager against a caliber of opposition he has never faced before. It was expected.

187~~~
Just watching the highlights back.

Very tidy, another very impressive display.

188~~~
TBF Zaha looked like a world beater on tour last season. 

Let's see how Blackett does in competitive games. I'm still not convinced he's good enough.

189~~~
I've been very impressed with him in preseason, we'll see how will he cope in the PL, depending of course how many chances will LVG give him.

190~~~
I reckon he will get in ahead of Micheal Keane

191~~~
I think he looked better than Keane so I agree. In any case even if he'll get promoted and get a chance or 2 we still need another CB but that theme is talked about in numerous threads. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

192~~~
As like most, i've been impressed with Blackett on tour and that game was his best yet. He's still not ready yet but he looks a far better prospect than Keane, i'm not quite sure why the latter has been rating so highly tbh by some with Blackett being somewhat of an after thought.

193~~~
Totally agree, I've watched Keane for a while and I still don't see what it is he offers that makes him deserving of a place on the squad.  Yes, he was dealing with Bale in his last match which was a tall order but he should at least have some idea of how to position himself.  It looked like his legs were in a swimming pool.  He's been on the tour multiple times now and IMO he hasn't shown enough.  Blackett has progressed much farther.

194~~~
Both Blackett and Keane have done well this pre-season, don't understand why people are making it into a One Vs. Other situation.

195~~~
Impressive in the pre season. Was very good last night. But as LVG said this is only pre season and can he do it week after week?

196~~~
Wasn't too impressed by him in his first pre-season game where he was awkward with the ball and looked out of sync with the team. He seems transformed in the past few games, but would have loved to see how he would have fared against the high pressing Liverpool in the first half. Lets see if he can carry his form and performances into the season.

197~~~
Both have been on tour twice now and Blackett made bigger errors for me vs Roma first half getting caught out by simple balls over the top vs Destro than just being outpaced by a Sharp Bale due to not realizing how quick his acceleration is.

Keane actually has experience of performing consistently and well over 2 seasons in first team football elsewhere and even though This tour and the new position could be the making of him,  Blackett doesn't have that same experience in his belft, infact he wasn't even a starter for our U21s at times last season before his loan and played left wing for game time.

Infact i'd say Blackett was on tour ahead of Tom Thorpe due to being a Left footer primarily. He made most of it so credit to him for that though.


It's not Keane vs Blackett for one slot anyway, so pointless debate. Both were impressive but i'd say Keane would be ahead of Blackett for either the central or Right sided role if one had to play as of now in a back 3. Even today/Yesterday he was gonna start if Smalling was unfit going off training squads. Blackett can be backup for LCB.

198~~~
I don't think it's a "2 players for 1 slot debate" it's more discussing which one has the most potential, considering neither are in the first team. Already you can see Blackett has outstanding qualities. He's quick, he's composed, good on the ball and great in 1v1 situations. I don't see any in Keane to be honest.

199~~~
Exactly. Blackett is left footed so he will have it easier to play as we have no natural left sided footed CBs (Evans comes close, but it seems Blackett does better in one-on-one). Keanse also looks good but he has Jones and Smalling who can play on the right effectively.

200~~~
Keane is composed and just as good on the ball, decently quick as well and has better reading off runners off the ball than Blackett. Also has improved a lot aerially in the last 2 years or so along with having a knack of goalscoring and carrying the ball in attack. He can also play RB.

His weakness is vs Quicker and stronger players one on one at times down the side while Blackett's weakness is being too one footed, having more concentration lapses and not as good awareness of runners of the ball.  Both have improvements to do to their games and both have potential, but i think Keane as a player is ahead right now.

201~~~
Well that's always the case and it remains to be seen. However, on tour, he has done very well and deserves a chance in the first team based on that

202~~~
We are looking to buy a Left footed CB though as per reports.

203~~~
I disagree with the first point. Blackett looks like a better technical passer than any of our centre halves tbh. I don't think Keane's as composed as him either; there's times when he's been put under pressure where he looks to have lost his nerve, i never feel that way with Blackett as nothing seems to phase him. Keane may be better at tracking runners, good in the air and no slouch pace wise but they aren't outstanding qualities which is what my point is.

204~~~
I think Blackett's been the most impressive youngster throughout this tour. Deserves a first team place.

205~~~
Definitely should be starting carling cup and early rounds of FA Cup, plus back up if Evans/Jones/Smalling gets injured.

But we still need a more experienced CB.

He's impressed me the most on the tour, I wasn't expecting anything of him, if anything I was expecting Keane to out do him. 
But his physicality, combined with the way he reads the game is a great combination.

206~~~
I would second that. Made Evans look a donkey last night.

207~~~
And Blackett is quick. Yesterday, early in the second half some Liverpool forward ran past him with the ball but Blackett caught up to him within a few strides and the got the ball. He did it again later in the second half.

He got all the high balls that came his way amd did some great forward passing. On once did his pass get intercepted.

During the Inter game he also shone. Really, really impressed with the lad.

208~~~
Tbf though, the teams we played last year were far worse in terms of quality than those we've played this year. Of course we have to see how he does in the league, but he has performed against top players. Zaha really didn't have that opposition at any point last season. Sevilla were the most difficult opposition and you wouldn't consider any of their players to be comparable to Bale, Ronaldo, etc. He's definitely done well enough to warrant our support and some game time once the season starts.

209~~~
Young lad, done well.

LVG said he can play at this level, that is good praise. He'll be used as backup for sure for the inevitable injuries that'll come along. He'll grow and no doubt be given at least a cup run, and if we have injuries may have a run at the back for a number of games.

I still think we need at least 1 more central defender though. Probably only 1 now that we can have Blackett and Keane as cover - previously I'd have thought we definitely needed 2 central defenders.

210~~~
It's always been that way. Last summer it was Januzaj vs Zaha

211~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

How about Sol Campbell?

212~~~
I can see van Gaal counting on him just for his distribution. And anyway, he is still very young, he can improve defensively.

213~~~
if we consider both Keane and Blackett firstteam player as of now, on the paper 5 player foe 3 position seems enough. But we won't real competion but more a clear situation who is starter and who is backing. You need competition to get better or even keep your standard as we saw with Rafael. I still want us to sign a proven CB for competition and covering injuries as well

214~~~
when with the ball at his feet, he reminds me a bit of Dante

215~~~
He's done well in all games to date, I can't really recall anything he could have done better on through 3-4 games now, he's always done quite well from the left in the youth, will be interesting to see if he can step up, prior this tour I'd certainly have doubted it.

216~~~
they havent really being tested.   I would still bring in another experienced CB.   And a good MF

217~~~
He's a solid first team option now as far as I'm concerned.

218~~~
`
Nah - Rio was different. Rio was always focused on the game, his problem was that he kept the ball to his feet a bit too much - eventually getting robbed by a striker. Overambitious I guess you could call it - but that was also what eventually made him a superb defender, that he always played his way out of trouble.

Blackett (esp at reserve and U18 levels) appeared not to have his head in the game always - exactly like he did against Roma a few times.

219~~~
Surprise of the tour alongside Young.. Didnt expect him to make the tour ahead of Thorpe/Vermijl, and much less as cover for the LCB position.. Thought he was going so that LvG could evaluate his LWB options.

Made the most of his chance and there's a very real possibility he'll be with the 1st team squad even if we sign a left footed CB.. Evans is so much better as the central CB in the back 3, expecting to see him start there should we sign a LCB and Blackett be in the swuad as the backup LCB..

220~~~
I would say that a young Rio struggled with this from time to time and was prone to lapses in his concetration.

221~~~
A good tour for the lad, I have been impressed with him.

222~~~
If going by what he is shown on tour, his main strength is his ability to impose himself on his man... If LVG see him as a project he has immense potential and he seem built for this formation, not sure he is the type to cover a lot of ground defensively.

223~~~
Blackett takes a wicked free kick as well. Not much skill or anything, he just launches rockets.

224~~~
From a average fullback to a central defender fighting for a first team spot in 2 weeks. I am impressed.

225~~~
I've really been impressed with his composure....

226~~~
Easily the most impressive kid on tour. Seems really calm and patient in possession. And TBF Van Gaal has a knack for finding young diamonds that aren't rated as highly by most. Maybe he can "Muller" Blackett. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

227~~~
He baffles me ever so slightly; he looks big and heavy, and his movements quite cumbersome. Then, all of a sudden he bursts into one helluva sprint and he is fairly agile as well. Also, his calmness on the ball, which is making me slightly nervous every time, is uncanny for such a young, inexperienced player at that level. He, Smalling and Jones/Evans may be a brilliant trio at the back. Evans is of course ahead of him at the moment, but he is certainly a good understudy, as Keane is a good understudy to Jones and Smalling. 

With the pace at the back with Smalling, Blackett, Jones (in that order for me), I wonder if Van Gaal shouldn't allow the defense to sit a little higher up the pitch though? I still think our team is a little stretched between the attackers and defense.

228~~~
I don't see this at all....at all!! He's tall, well built and very fit.  Big and heavy sounds like you're talking about Anderson.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/23/article-2400994-1B6DD9EA000005DC-371_634x780.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/23/article-2400994-1B6DD9EA000005DC-371_634x780.jpg"/>

229~~~
more like being "badstubered" than "mullered". still a nice thing to happen. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

minus all the injuries of course.

230~~~
He was born in Manchester, cool.

231~~~
I think he's ready for the first team lads. He didn't look out of place at all in that 3 CB formation. I rate him above Keane.

232~~~
He will be a squad player at least imo.

233~~~
Bit of a surprise, by the got his chance and took it. Doesn't look out of place. Good luck to him this season

234~~~
By big and heavy, I mean that he looks too muscular and strong to be as fast and agile as he is - not fat in any way - and he also looks slightly slowish in his movements before he gets going, which basically means that I didn't see him as fast before he actually started running.

235~~~
Pretty much agree with this. Jones, Smalling, Evans will probably be first choice, but then I would have Blackett as back-up and then Keane, who is a little slow I think.

236~~~
What part of town is he from? United fan?

237~~~
I would rather give this kid a season and see how it goes than spunk 10M on Vermaelen. 

He has shown against some big club's that he is more than ready, I say weed him into a few matches at home against the less dangerous teams and go from there. 

On the tour he has looked probably our most composed defender on the ball; something no doubt LVG will love. I think the fact he replaced Evans at half time shows how much faith he has in Blackett.

238~~~
I wouldn't. It would not be fun going to Emirates or COM with Jones and Smalling injured - and we have to play Blackett and Keane. That is not fair on them - and not good for us

We need at least 1 new defender.....there will be plenty of chances for those 2 youngsters anyway

239~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbkMnzoHWv4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

240~~~
The resemblance in playing style with Abidal is uncanny. Also love how he diagnoses plays, very got anticipation skills for a young lad. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

241~~~
I think he is going to be the left footed central defender that LVG has been asking for. If we are getting someone let it be someone as big as Benatia or Hummels. If we are going for Vermealen, might be as well stick with Blackett.

242~~~
He's from Hulme, and yes he is a Red.

243~~~
This.

I'd like this attitude with regards to all the spots in our squad for which there is a promising youngster ready and waiting. Either buy top, top quality or stick with the kids, please.

244~~~
I would say that the athleticism and composure is more in common with Sol Campbell. Like Campbell he started out wide on the left, and was tried as a left back and left winger, eventually being made the center back.

Of course, it's not to suggest that Blackett will be as good as Sol, but if he does turn out that well we would have an absolute rock for a long time.

245~~~
I still maintain Keane enjoyed a stronger pre-season up until the final game or so. Different centre-backs though, and the need for a left-footed defender certainly suits Blackett. Both will remain with us this season, I'd imagine, but I don't think either are ready to consistently start.

246~~~
very impressed with Blackett.  Sure he will make it with us. no hesitation...brave and is focused.

247~~~
Wasn't around to see Campbell at leftback TBF.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

248~~~
I might have agreed with this if he had any proven record of performing consistently in the first team for anyone, or had any sort of previous record of totally standing out and looking above everybody else and a real big talent.

You just don't throw young players who have been underwhelming before into the first team directly on back of a pre season, especially defenders. 


This maybe a turning point for him, but he isn't ready to be a starter just because he did well in 3 halfs of pre season football against good teams. Backup maybe, but we need a starter.

249~~~
He can't <i>get</i> a record of performing consistently for the first team until we play him in the first team. If we did it your way, we would never promote anyone.

Of course we're talking about back-up. No-one's suggesting he should be getting in ahead of Jones, Smalling or Evans. But I'd say he's shown enough to be on the bench if we need him to be, along with Keane.

It's true that he's never stood out in the reserves or youth sides. But then he's never played this position for them either, and it's looking more and more obvious that he wasn't entirely suited to the fullback position that he's always played for us before this pre-season.

250~~~
How come? I am more comfortable promoting Michael Keane than i am with Blackett as he has a record of performing consistently whether it be for our U21s at CB or loans over 2/3 years.

Defenders need consistency particularly more than attackers as well, who you can take a gamble on.

He's played CB as well for our U18s/u19s and reserves and looked dodgy tbh. But that was in a 2 man central defence.  Last time he looked  a real good prospect was when he was England's best defender at u17 level and then he was just dropped. There's been suggestions of some attitude issues in the past as well though don't know how substantiated.

I am fine with Keane and him both being backup. Maybe Tom Thorpe could play a part too in this formation if really required, infact he's been unlucky not to go on tour ahead of Blackett due to not being left footed mainly which worked for Blackett.

Anyway, thing is Evans doesn't seem as good as he can be playing at LCB and limits his distribution as well. Blackett isn't ready to be a starter there so we need another defender in who can play that role as a regular.

251~~~
Taking your points in order:

I rate Keane higher too. I think he's got the potential to be a top class defender. But that doesn't mean I don't think Blackett is ready to be a back-up for us.

He only briefly played CB in the U18s, and as you say playing CB in a two-man central defence is effectively a different position to doing it in a three anyway. It's the latter that he looks particularly suited to. I'd never heard about any attitude issues so I can't comment on that.

Agree on Tom Thorpe, as a tradition two-man CB I rate him higher than Blackett, probably equally as highly as Keane. On paper he's arguably got the more convincing record than Keane. It's this quantity of promising youngsters in the position which makes me confident we'd be fine relying on them as back-up. You never know who might quail under the pressure of the PL, but if one of them does, there'll be two more ready and waiting to take his place.

I've been really impressed with Evans on tour. He was shite in the Liverpool game, but then so was most of the first-half team. Until that game he'd been excellent, particularly standing out against Madrid. That said, I do think his best position is at the <i>centre</i> of that 3-man defence. The central man is the one who can step out, interrupting attacks early, bringing the ball forward with freedom, and almost acting as a DM at times, and that's an obvious strength in his game.

My attitude stays the same, though. If there was a top-class left-footed CB out there, someone at the level of Hummels or Benatia (both righties), then I'd be all for it. But if we're looking at mid-range options who aren't guaranteed to do well themselves, like Vermaelen, I'd rather we just stuck with promoting the kids to support our existing three.

252~~~
I think it'll be good for him to be a back up for us and play for the U21s this season. He'll definitely get game time.

253~~~
Good to hear. Nothing better than a local and a red making it and let's hope he nails his place down.

254~~~
Just a few things.

Regarding Evans I have seen the Liverpool game twice on a big screen in HD and as far as I can judge he looked ill or had some sort of concentration problems. He was almost scared and dizzy the first 20-25 minutes. Probably temporary but it looked really weird. 

Regarding Keane I can't say I was totally impressed, to many simple slips or errors for being ready playing at this level. There are also question marks regarding his pace and acceleration. Maybe I'm over critical but we need defenders with the whole package, even if they come from our academy.

Then the best part - Tyler Blackett. He was really impressive and I can see LvG promoting him as a back up to Evans/new signing, but I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up to be regular later on in the season. This guy have the whole package and loads of potential. You know more then me regarding his concentration problems but as far as I saw in our pre season games he looked ok. Future will tell.

255~~~
Blackett has taken his chance on this tour, where as Keane has not IMO. 

I know players like Bale are difficult to stop but when he gave that penalty away it really showed his immaturity.

256~~~
Bale is going to torch much better defenders than Keane, so that's not really much of a black mark. Keane's problem is that there are a lot of much better defenders around - he's not outstanding at anything and he's weak in some areas. Blackett is an outstanding passer of the ball and looks to be a better one on one defender than Keane. He also seems a lot more comfortable in a system that is new to both of them. It remains to be seen if either of them has the uncompromising  (i.e. nasty) streak that van Gaal likes in his defenders.

257~~~
Nowthat we've missed out on vermaelen, I hope this lad is given a chance.he impressed me on tour.

258~~~
I wonder what Blackett would do if he's in the same situation as Keane. Jones is also another player we can say still show his immaturity.

259~~~
Blackett made bigger errors vs Simple straight balls over the top vs Destro like 3/4 times over in the first half vs Roma with then getting into awkward retrieving positions in the first half when he played 90 minutes. It didn't cause goals as Destro fluffed the chances or the GK other defenders bailed him out but it was kinda terrible that first half before he settled better in the 2nd.

Getting outpaced by a Sharp Bale's acceleration is hardly the biggest sin going around either for a young defender especially. He's done it to Rio and Rafael before amongst others. And to someone that said above Keane doesn't lack pace that much even. Bale is just rapid.

Anyway, what happened to Keane and worse happened to Hummels 3 times over along with another mistake in the WC final vs Mesis and Lavezzi and twice in game vs Ghana and Gyan.

260~~~
You can't stop yourself being outpaced, but you can be clever and stay on your feet and Shephard them into a non lethal area. Keane made the mistake of purely getting too tight and actually trying to win the ball, he should have just stood him up and showed him down the line and let the rest of the defence reinforce him. 

It's a simple thing but he would have been better letting Bale go and try to shoot than take him down. DDG may have saved Bale's chance, if that's a league or cup game it's the difference between winning or losing.

261~~~
Better back him and Keane because we'll be relying on them at some point this season.

262~~~
He is usually decent pace wise and can match majority of people for pace with little head start inside so no surprise he thought he had Bale in control until he just used his acceleration and strength which is probably the quickest in the world. If you haven't played against him before he can do it to most.

Anyway, yeah both made mistakes and it is expected for Young defenders and Jones probably made even bigger ones vs Liverpool but you have to go on their pedigree and record beforehand as well.


And re the bolded here you go -

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kq2oBu1LOb8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Missing couple of isntances vs others as well. 0.16 pretty similar incident and Messi could have gone down to try his luck instead of carrying on but would have been a soft call for WC final.

263~~~
Awesome. Wonder what school he went to?

264~~~
Ducie, I think. I'll have to ask my neice. He lived next door to my sister, who was always moaning at him for playing footy in the back garden. Silly cow!

266~~~
Good find.
My sister is not being helpful, though I know he went to Royce primary.

267~~~
The boy just has a natural confidence on the ball, similar to John Stones. We badly lack that and he'll be a big help if we start to build play up from possession football in our half.

A couple of things from the posts above...

1. Blackett has played at centre-half for most of his Academy career...he also switched to left fullback and left wing on occasions. When we bought Fornasier and McGinty he found it hard to get regular games in central defence but was a year younger than some of the others. 

2. I've never heard anything at all about any supposed 'attitudinal' issues so no idea where that rumour came from. 

3. Watching him regularly when he was younger his biggest weakness was concentration and being too casual when on the ball. His physicality has never been an issue although personally I think his heading is also an area for improvement.

4. Some players just perform at higher levels while others don't...we won't know unless we give him a chance.

269~~~
What you call being casual could also be called being confident. The sooner we start training young defenders to be confident on the ball instead of hoofing it the better. It takes more courage to use the ball and retain possession for your team than play a long 50/50 ball.

270~~~
This is a very good point. Some personalities just raise to the occasion and find an inner joy to take on the challenge instead of getting nervous, sometimes they don't even know themselves that they have this ability.

Without knowing it looks like Blackett benefit from a clear structure and strict instructions instead of the usual whenever you have a chance "express yourself". Not a dig at anybody just that some personalities needs individual coaching to get the best out of their talents.

271~~~
Would love to see him involved against Swansea. Even just on the bench. We need to buy at the back, no question but he deserves a chance on the back of preseason.

272~~~
We're talking about men kicking a lump of leather around a pitch, not f*ckin Doctor Phil.

273~~~
I'm pretty sure we already do that considering Evans, Keane, Blackett and Thorpe are all pretty good on the ball.

274~~~
I suppose I meant in the country as a whole, good to see some of the young coaches trying to introduce this as it's important for the future of the national team.

275~~~
Starts later today.

To me it's a massive sign that LVG rates him.

276~~~
That's fantastic news <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

277~~~
Hard not to rate him, has been impressive each time he's played so far.

278~~~
He looked good on tour, shall be interesting to see how he does tonight. Still would prefer an experienced leader at the back, I wouldn't want to put all our hopes on the kid this season given the importance of it.

279~~~
Blackett and James. They seriosuly may help to restore some balance in this club.

280~~~
Didn't notice James is starting too. Probably cause Shaw's not fit enough or something, but Van Gaal clearly rates Blackett and James and rightly so!

281~~~
I think he is starting this because Evans has a knock or something. Not even on the bench.

And he's the only other player whose sufficiently left footed to play LCB.

282~~~
Another reason he could continue to be playing so much is so that we get used to having a left footed CB in the system. But LVG has said he's ready to play, just not sure he can play every single week so he clearly rates him and intends to start him this season a bunch of times

283~~~
Not sure it's a genuine quote but..



I'd normally agree, one of the reasons I support Utd is because of our traditions when it comes to producing talent etc but I can't agree with Gary on this occasion. We simply can not replace two of our best ever defenders in Nemanja and Rio with young Tyler as talented as he may be. We also can't rely on Chris, Jonny and Paul to stay fit for the whole season.

There is room for one/two new signings in the defensive area along with Tyler around the squad as well.

284~~~
Based on Ferdinand's form last season Tyler has enough on him to do better than that.

Smalling,Jones and Evans are supposed to be Vidic and Ferdinand long-term replacement in the first place, not our young defenders.

285~~~
I'd still rather have an experienced Rio in our back line even if he was out of form than a youngster whose only experience is in a lower division. None of the three you've just mentioned are nothing like Nemanja, maybe Phil's willingless to through his head in where it hurts makes him the closest thing.

My point is the amount of experience we've lost losing them two and the leadership qualities they brought to the table, we can't replace all that with a kid who has played a handful of championship games.

286~~~
I like what I've seen so far and hope he gets a good amount of playing time this season but it'd be risky to rely on him as a bonafide back-up to Smalling, Evans and Jones and unfair to place such a weight of expectation on a young defender.

287~~~
Happy for Blackett.  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

288~~~
Again he's impressive, also loving the bursts forward!

289~~~
He's a refreshing defender to watch. Lots of energy and skill on the ball. I'll be shocked if he doesn't feature often this season.

290~~~
Why are there 2 Blackett threads ?

291~~~
One in the first team forum and another from the reserve forum.

292~~~
Been very impressed with him tonight along with James, though to a lesser extent.

293~~~
Wasnt convinced by him on the tour, But very impressive today.

294~~~
Good one

295~~~
Based on pre-season, he deserves his chance in the team

296~~~
Dutch commentator on my stream called him Welbeck in the first half. 

Racist,

297~~~
They should have called him Paul Pogba.At least they are (were) on the same shirt number.

298~~~
Why unfair? I bet he'd be thrilled to have the chance to be relied upon as a proper first team player.

299~~~
While Reece James looked like a typical youth player in the first team with a few hesitant moves in the game, Blackett actually looked self assured and composed. He looked very good.

300~~~
Had 2/3 dodgy moments defensively (Particular one where SMalling bailed him out with a brilliant tackle) but pretty impressive overall again.

301~~~
Blackett with another decent performance. Agree that he had a couple of careless moments late in the first half but otherwise fine. He looks good enough to start plenty of games for us.

302~~~
Is he ready to start Saturday people reckon?

303~~~
Before we come to that point do we have anyone else to play there?

304~~~
I reckon it would be no bother to him anyway.

305~~~
This guy has really impressed me over preseason. Hope he gets some time or a good loan

306~~~
Best way to measure his true ability is to play him in competitive games.

307~~~
I think so yes. Made very few mistakes today. Keane looked very poor when he came on though. Nobody seemed to mention it, but today showed me for certain that Keane's not ready. James did well, but he wasn't prepared to cross the ball and passed back too much. Caught out in defence a couple times. Not sure he's ready honestly. But Blackett, definitely.

308~~~
Very impressed with his ability on the ball. Defensively mostly good but few shaky moments.

309~~~
Another cool performance.

He came from nowhere and delivers some good football and hope for the future.

310~~~
He's class. Play him in the PL.

311~~~
I think given how well he's done on the ball this pre-season with his distribution and now running with the ball he could be a good backup option for leftback

312~~~
Another good outing for him, if we buy Rojo then Blackett should give him strong competition for the LCB spot.

313~~~
Very annoying. But with that said, play the kid against Swansea!

314~~~
Just got back from the game. It's the first time I've watched him for a full ninety minutes and I was very impressed with him. I like him a lot and I really hope he get his chance in the first team this season. He's ready to make that step. Still so young but I saw tonight that he looks sharp, his awareness is good, and he's eager to get forward when he can too. Man of the match for me, not Phil Jones.

315~~~
Yes! He's a fecking star <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

316~~~
First choice for me. Really superb pre season.

317~~~
Eh?

318~~~
MOTM against Valencia and best young player on the tour.

319~~~
He's really composed in possession and good at bringing the ball out. Probably more so than any of our other centrebacks.

That's quite important with the system and style Van Gaal seems to want to play so I'd expect to see him in the team a bit. Less sure about his defending though, but that will improve with time.

I know it worries people a bit but I really think people underestimate just how god awful Rio and Vidic were last season. Not only were they inexcusably shite at defending, but their distribution was a noticably bigger problem to our midfield than our lack of having a midfield was.

Reece James I'm more confused about. I know it's a bit mean but surely we have someone better to fill in as a wing back?

320~~~
He's impressed me tbh hopefully his progression continues.

321~~~
On the left hand side I assume Shaw is going to be first choice, and he'll rote with Young.

322~~~
And the season before that. Sure we've lost a lot experience in defense, but not in terms of actual defenders.

323~~~
Seeing Blackett live for the first time in the flesh was great. He was really composed on the ball and assured with his defending. I would keep him around. Past loans have been terrible for him, so keep him with the squad and give him games here and there. Like Wilson he will learn more being here with our coaches than elsewhere.

324~~~
Not sure playing both Shaw and Blackett on our left side is the best idea at this stage. Too little experience. I can see why we might be after Rojo.

325~~~
Another solid performance last night. Kept it calm and simple.

326~~~
Rio was excellent in our title winning season.

327~~~
Yes many people like to gloss over this fact. He was overplayed last season which caused issues.

328~~~
Yeah Rio was brilliant in 12/13, it was 13/14 where he was really poor. 

Thought Blackett was excellent last night and I'd like to see him start on Saturday, don't know whether he's realistic. I watched the game with some non-Utd supporting friend who thought he was excellent and were surprised he was only 20.

We were however all underwhelmed by James, very disappointing performance by him I thought.

329~~~
He isn't on the fantasy team selection yet unfortunately <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I'd most definitely sign him up right now.

330~~~
It's incredible how comfortable he's looked at this level given that he seemed to be nothing special in the championship. He really suits the back three.

331~~~
This guy oozes confidence. It's like his body language is telling everyone "chill out, I've got this". He looks very good on the left.

332~~~
Probably because he wasn't actually that great. Few centre halfs stood out that season and both Rio and Evans had a poor first half of the season; their inability jump and win headers was a huge problem in the goals conceded column. Our defence only began to improve when Vidic returned at the New Year.

333~~~
No Rafael or Shaw Saturday, this may be his chance.

334~~~
He looks an impressive young player. Maybe we should forget about the militant Rojo and put our faith in this guy.

335~~~
We can do both. We'll need the numbers.

336~~~
What a daft idea. There is room for both at the club at this present time due to the lack of options we have.

337~~~
Both talented players but Rojo has experience. Just played at the world cup for Argentina which is quite impressive to be fair.

338~~~
Surely he's nailed-on to start Saturday now?

339~~~
As impressive as he has looked pre season he has no record or experience of consistently doing well at any level really over a decent period let alone at senior football.

And consistency is way more important for a defender as well. Would be a ridiculous risk to gamble on him that much right now. He can start as a backup probably if not go on loan for atleast a few months spell.

340~~~
With both Evans and Shaw hurt, I will guarantee 100% that he will start on Saturday.

341~~~
Yeh it's a no brainer that he'll be given the nod. Deserves it too after the strong pre-season he's had.

342~~~
I don't trust his awareness of attackers runs at all, but the rest is there. Perfect candidate for a loan if we weren't so short at the back.

343~~~
Why would we loan Blackett ? Who would want him ? What would we learn from him playing in the Championship ? What would he learn ? He looks well suited to playing as part of a 3 man defence which very few teams use, while his loan spells last season suggest that he may not be ready/possess the skill-set, for leftback or as one of two central defenders, even at Championship level.

I'm not even convinced of the wisdom of loaning out Michael Keane and the chances of him getting a PL loan are much higher than Blackett's chances given Keane's relatively successful Championship loans. PL loans are a good testing ground for our younger players, playing in the championship is really just a stepping stone towards a PL loan.

344~~~
Here is Blacketts big chance. 

He has looked very comfortable all pre-season, but now he needs to step it up when it matters.

If he plays like he has been though, he will definitely be making himself a regular name in the first team.

345~~~
Yep.

If he plays well then he can be a first team regular in this team. Exciting times.

346~~~
Evans and Shaw being injured could be his way of sneaking into the 1st team, and with us having an easy start to the season we could see him performing well, would like to see that we've got an extra man in defense (which we badly need) and that he's come from our own youth.

347~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if Blackett worms his way in Louis's plans on a regular basis as the season progresses.  He's confident, has very good awareness and is athletically suited to this level.  All he needs is experience and he's good to go.

348~~~
I'm not worried at all..he's like Van Gaal...not nervous at all

349~~~
He wouldn't be getting a game if we did our job properly in the transfer market.

350~~~
This pre season has been good for testing the water aswell. It's not like every team has been meaningless. Liverpool, Madrid, Valencia, Inter, Roma; they will all be teams we need to challenge in the future and he didn't look the newbie he should be.

351~~~
Great chance for him! If he continues playing as in pre-season, it could be his jump into the first team

352~~~
I would rather play him than Smalling or Evans at the moment

353~~~
Difference of opinions.

354~~~
Bit bizarre. Smalling has looked our best CB for me.

355~~~
Smalling will play in CFB or RFB. Blackett is in the LFB position.

356~~~
I think the Rojo deal will go through and Blackett will end up as his understudy as the left centre-back.

357~~~
Don't worry you will when the season is going on and the transfermarket is closed. We'll be fine until November when we get City, Chelsea and Arsenal on our plate.

358~~~
And yet with all the time until then, he might get all the experience he needs and might be a titan come November.

It´s all speculation, from you and me.

359~~~
I don't like this kind of attitude

360~~~
Just the way I feel. I am in no doubt Tyler could become a very useful player but I also believe if we'd have made 1/2 signings in this department I doubt whether Tyler would even be getting a mention.

361~~~
It will be:

        --De Gea--
Jones--Smalling--Blackett

362~~~
So what? He played on CB like an old guard doesn't mean it isnt a bit risky but still our best option right now. Not afraid about him being selected when Smalling can cover for him or Phil "last gasp tackle" Jones. The good draw will help him to settle in on a premier league basis and gain even more confidence. I am as nervous as LVG about it.

363~~~
So what? The fact we are adopting a 3 at the back policy with only 3 recognized center halves in the squad is nothing short of bizarre. Add to the fact all 3 of them are seemingly made of glass and we are already having to throw a youngster who yes looked okay during pre-season friendlies it makes the fact we haven't brought in anyone in this position quite simply beyond disbelieve.

364~~~
That´s how I see it too.

365~~~
Swansea ain´t Real or Liverpool so it´s not much of a big issue unless one of them get hurt.

366~~~
He's ready.

367~~~
It doesn't matter who we are playing. Tomorrow is a competitive game, points are at stake. We have 3 center halves, one of whom are already injured. Who is backup to Blackett? Michael Keane? We haven't got no where near enough depth in this area.

368~~~
Fletcher can play there as well as Carrick, extremely well ball playing defenders, so we are well covered. Who would have thought that ashley Young could play as left back for van Gaal.. I believe that he is a very good manager in terms of communication and giving intructions to players, if he thinks that lingar can play right wingback than why not. We have still good numbers and some player could adapt to some roles they never played and I belive its possible. Maybe the reason why we didn't buy anyone is that we seek some certain player who is not availible. It is very likely that we will add more quality as the time goes and 4-3-3 is the long term IMO so why to add basically 6th centre back into squad (not counting Fletcher and Carrick) when we can turn into 4-3-3 after january additions and more clearouts.. I assume we will be soon for a world class winger and a centre midfielder in january just to have an option to play that 4-3-3 which we are heading to long-term.

Just give them a chance. I hate these negative comments right before the season. There is always someone who will moan about something. So far things went well and there is no reason to think otherwise..

369~~~
Sorry but I stopped reading after you suggested taking both Fletch and Carrick away from what is already a weak midfield (another area we've neglected to address) to cover in defense.

370~~~
I trust Blackett. Reckon he won't look out of place tomorrow. 

I rated him highly while I was in the newbies/early days of the mains. Always been a fan.

371~~~
Starting tomorrow I believe. Not the biggest surprise given injuries etc.

372~~~
It was assumed a month ago that Keane would probably the one to be given opportunities in the first team if there was an injury or something. Blackett looked unconvincing/awkward to me in the match against LA Galaxy but since then he has bedded in fantastically looking extremely composed and deceptively quick for someone of his stature. Right now out of Reece James/Michael Keane/Lingard he looks like the one who has the highest chance of a breakthrough season. Btw, any news on Tom Lawrence? He looked like a livewire on his début last season but given our abundance of attacking options, would be understandable if he went on loan again.

373~~~
chill out bro, louis got this

374~~~
Oh I'am not talking about anyone player in particular, I'am just talking about the state of the squad in general.

375~~~
Well there´s still some time to go and I think Louis can do some magic during the time. We might not win all the games but I hope we can win one or two against the current top 4. If so come January we should strengthen and then we might have a chance. Thing is not to lose against the bottom half teams and I think Louis will take those games seriously enough that we win them.

376~~~
It was obvious after our pre season tour that Tyler Blackett was more or less ready to step up. He took his chance and made it almost impossible for the manager and us supporters to dismiss his contribution. I'm delighted that LvG is ready to put faith in him and I wouldn't be surprised if he continue to make serious questions about who's going to start or not.

Tyler has something rare and that is calmness and fighting sprit all together in one piece. When necessary he can be aggressive and push hard but the good thing is that he doesn't lose his calmness when he's fired up. I saw a couple of situations when he was challenged but instead of going to the ground or take a 50/50 he stayed on his feets and waited until the danger was neutralized. One of those times was against CR07. 

I like him a lot and following a young talented man to greatness is one of the best parts in being a life long supporter.

377~~~
I really can't wait to see him playing against Swansea. Judging him in pre season always give me a doubt.

378~~~
Lets hope he can "Hackett" in the prem...

<span style="color: #ffffff">Ill take my coat</span>

379~~~
Has been playing with the reserves. Scored today in the league opener against Norwich. I'd say he'll likely go on loan again.

380~~~
I've even thought that, when Evans is back, maybe worth a try of Blackett as DM. Other than good skill and pace, his awareness when passing the ball is pretty good.

381~~~
Your coat wasnt waiting around for you after that one... it left a while ago <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

382~~~
Still in awe of his rapid ascent TBF. Always thought Keane looked the more gifted of the two but fast forward one month and Tyler is closer to being a first team regular. There's just an X-factor about him that I can't put a finger on. Maybe it's the unreal confidence and maturity level he exhibits for someone so young, looks completely unfazed. Guess some are just meant to play in the spotlight and make the most of the opportunities while others wilt under pressure. Good luck to him. Must be an incredible feeling making his competitive debut at Old Trafford.

383~~~
I have no worries about Blackett at LCB tomorrow, he'll do well.

384~~~
You mean vs Swansea yeah?

I think full XI will be:

----------------------De Gea-------------------------

------------Smalling----Jones----Blackett-------------

Young------------------------------------------James

--------------Fletcher--------Herrera-----------------

-----------------------Mata--------------------------

-------Hernandez------------------Rooney------------

He's ready for this game.

385~~~
Need him to step up tomorrow.

386~~~
van Gaal really likes this lad doesn't he? I just hope he repays the faith shown.

387~~~
I'd be lying if i said i wasn't bit worried about him starting tbh.

388~~~
I thought he did reasonably well, with the caveat that I'm not quite sure who was at fault for the goals we conceded. Other than that he looked comfortable at this level. Some of his cross-field passes were superb. Thought he was very unlucky to get booked.

389~~~
The kid done well.

390~~~
I thought he was fantastic considering this was his PL debut and the pressure involved with that. Should keep his place for the next game, imo.

391~~~
He gave the ball up to quickly, which helped Swansea score the second goal. That shows his lack of experience. Other than that he was not that bad and I would not mind him continuing being in our first team.

392~~~
Rooney had a massive go at him after the second goal, so at least he thought he was at fault.

393~~~
Good on the ball and composure wise, but not sure he was great defensively tbh.

Still mighty good considering it was his PL debut in a team lacking confidence in a game which ended up being tough.

That giving the ball back too soon for their 2nd goal showed inexperience.

394~~~
Thought he was good, bit naive to give straight back to Bony for the free kick in the build-up for the 2nd goal.

395~~~
I thought he could have done more on the first goal.

He just got dragged along instead of putting a challenge in. He failed to push the player wide or prevent the pass.

He definitely has some gifts for his age, but Jonny Evans would of made a huge difference.

I also think that Young was played on the left to counter balance his inexperience. That meant our right side lacked defensive cover which might of played a part in both goals.

396~~~
I could see we were in trouble even before the cross came in as both Jones and Smalling were out of the game the moment the cross went past them. After that Young perhaps might have done better but not his natural position so understandable. Then Blackett may not have been stood in the correct position when they scored. Perhaps the blame should be shared equally between Jones asleep when they took the freekick, Smalling poorly positioned if the cross beats Jones, Young and finally Blackett.

397~~~
Did really well, our 2nd most solid CB after Smalling for the 2nd time. Jones had some good moments, but also poor ones particularly in the first half. Blackett was more convincing.

He does need to keep practcing his longballs though, too many wayward ones between each accurate one

398~~~
His passing is pretty immense for a CB. Sublime balls being played to the right side of the field by him and actually made some good runs forward again. Keep up the good work Blackwell.

399~~~
Giving the ball back within about a second allowed for the quick free kick to take advantage of our disorganised defence and score. It was a really naive but honest mistake from an inexperienced young player. He must also take some blame for the first as him getting caught in no man's land caused Smalling and Jones to shift over, leaving space on the other side for the shot. Other than those two moments however I thought he was quite impressive, composed beyond his years and comfortable with the ball.

400~~~
You can pick out a few moments where he could have done better or made a different decision but overall it was quite a good performance from him. Really has come on leaps and bounds this season and I'm really happy for him and it is a big boost for the squad to have him performing like this. Get the Rojo deal done and he'll do fine sharing the role with him.

401~~~
I thought he was at fault for both goals. In 20/20 hindsight, if I'd been planning to switch to 4 at the back, I would have shoved Blackett out wide and kept Jones and Smalling in the middle. Certainly you wouldn't have seen Fergie playing Blackett as one of the 2 CBs in this game (then again Fergie would never have given him the chance to shine most probably and I'm not sad to see him play for us!)

402~~~
He likes his long balls doesn't he? If they were better it'd be good - and it's certainly better than all the pointless passing we did around the back 3 and midfield, which then came to nothing.

403~~~

404~~~
Didn't look to out of place, but far from a flawless performance. Can't remember who was at fault for the first, but he showed inexperience to all the quick freekick that lead to the second. Though I doubt he will do something like that again.

405~~~
Young and our CM were more to blame for the second.

I like the look of him very much.

406~~~
The first Fletcher didn't track back and Jones was held off by the power of Bony. Couldnt get his sliding block around him. Resulted in Ki having nobody around him and enough space to pass the ball into the net. Absolutely nothing to do with Blackett

407~~~
Very nice way of putting 'blocked off'.

408~~~
Best player on the pitch for us for me today. I hope LVG gives him more chances because I think he could really turn into a great player given the chance.

409~~~
It definitely was. Blackett wandered and got caught out in no-mans land which meant Smalling and Jones had to shuffle over, which then left space over the the other side for the shot (with some help from a Bony obstruction as Jones tried to scramble back). Watch it again on the highlights tonight. At the end of the day though it wasn't really a huge error, I still liked what I saw from him today overall.

410~~~
the new defence lineup will improve as the players get more games together

411~~~
This lad can pass the ball. Some brilliant passes from the back. Also he didn't look out of place at all today. He is definitely going to grow this season. Hopefully he doesn't get injured.

412~~~
I think he was impressive enough in the game, he's vocal play in particular impressed me during the first half

413~~~
I think it was his fault for passing them the ball and letting them take the free kick so quickly. 

He still had a decent game though.

414~~~
2nd goal was his fault, right? Passed the ball back to Bony right away, who took the free kick quickly and they scored from it. 

Kind of error you expect from a very inexperienced youngster, though, and very correctable. Unless I got it wrong and it wasn't him. Still, that's basic stuff you learn as a kid.

415~~~
The only annoying thing was when he gave bony the ball back straight away, that let them take the quick free kick!. Please next time let them get the ball and get yourself set.

Apart from that though a solid debut, he has shown he can make it at this level, he has the potential.

416~~~
Blackett was at fault for the first goal, but I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion he was at fault for the second. Young was clearly the main one at fault. I'd argue Blackett was the only defender that didn't mess up on the 2nd. Nothing wrong with his positioning and couldn't do anything to stop the goal.

EDIT: Fair enough on the quick pass back to Bony for the free kick. From a defensive perspective, he didn't make any mistake there though.

417~~~
The team made about 3 mistakes after Blackett gave the ball to Bony for the freekick. Easy target.

It certainly didnt help and was a young player mistake that you expect from someone making their premier league debut. The vice captain not doing his main job? Ashley Young getting sucked into the middle and letting the ball go over his head? Yeah I dont think you can blame premier league inexperience.

418~~~
No one seems to have mentioned it here and i also didn't earlier, but he was definitely too passive in his defending at times.

As in the game passes him by a bit when you want him to sense danger and burst a gut to deal with it off the ball.

Still as i said before decent to good for a debut performance in a struggling team but some of the praise is bit over the top as well.

419~~~
He went AWOL after he got booked. It's going to be very hard for him to fill that Vidic-shaped hole in the defence. Be interesting to see if he gets a start against the inbreds.

420~~~
yeah no doubt, he's no Rio or Vidic, but he impressed non the less imo

421~~~
He looked like what he is...a talented kid that is nowhere near ready for this level

422~~~
And it would be absolutely ridiculous to expect him to. We are meant to be close to signing Rojo and he'll be perfect as his back-up.

423~~~
He looks really good this season just needs some experience around him IMO. I like him a lot though because he actually shows some balls unlike some. His passing was excellent.

424~~~
It's kinda like that Chelsea equalizer that Fergie slated Nani for, yes he allowed Swansea to take the early freekick but that doesn't account for Young drifting too central hence losing the header or Fletcher/Fellaini not tracking the runner . Those are two PL veterans who I'm sure were counted o to guide Blackett on his debut.

425~~~
Best pass completion in the game and one of the highest overall in all of today's games. The kid is ready.

426~~~
I wouldn't use that to rate him today. He looked fairly comfortable regardless of pass completion, however the 3 starting cb's saw more of the ball than anyone and that in itself outlines the team problem rather than displaying a measure of their individual performances

427~~~
He had some cracking long passes. Defensively...he was OK. One thing that annoyed me was that he was always turning away, showing his back to the shot taker. Man up, lad!

428~~~
They were brilliant! On what we've seen this summer, Blackett's an amazing passer of a football. Anyone who's not been impressed by him is

429~~~
Passing was very good, some of his long passes were brilliant, better than anything the likes of Cleverley and fellaini could ever produce. Not sure if he is good enough defensively, need to see more of him but he stood off too much for me and too passive at times, needs to add more aggression.

430~~~
His passes today were wayward. He's absolutely brilliant on the ball, but he could definitely work on his lofted long passes.

431~~~
He was lofting balls more than half the length of the pitch and landing them on Fellaini's head. What was wayward about that? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Whether we should have been playing like that is another matter.

432~~~
I thought Tyler was excellent and one of our best players. Some good long passes and he is really composed on the ball. I didn't rate him too highly on loan so I'm really happy that he's showing so much promise and that LvG has given him a chance. Hope he keeps his place.

433~~~
Sure. He's a really good prospect all right but we really need someone of the stature of Vidic to come into the team. Dunno about the Rojo deal. It all sounds a bit dodgy to me.

434~~~
They were often too short or too long, and he often did them at the wrong times. It's a lot easier to do that once you stick Fellaini up top too.

435~~~
You surely can't complain about his long range passing today? That was the brilliant part of his performance!

The not so brilliant part was when required to do actual defending. Like when he rushed out to Routledge on the first goal, dragging Smalling and Jones out of position to allow Swansea to outplay us.

Or like when he played a glorious quick return pass for Bony to set in motion the counter attack for number two.

436~~~
Poor on the first goal but Smalling should have covered for him. At least he looked like he could handle a football unlike Smalling.

437~~~
His distribution was very good today.

438~~~
I thought Blackett was at fault for the first, but then again, there were a catalogue of individual errors and the player was only looking to atone for Young's poor positional play. Still, I think he got too tight and vacated too much space on the inside. Obviously at fault for the second also. 

His distribution and composure on the ball is excellent though and probably only second to Evans out of our centre backs and that's mainly because of how two-footed the latter is.

However, this kind of performance is what van Gaal eluded to when he suggested Blackett might not be capable of the step-up consistently on a week-to-week basis. It's great for him to make his competitive debut for us, but also a bit unfair, because our defence can only be rectified in the form of signings. He can get enough games this season, but he should only be in a position to start cup games, otherwise it's a matter of dislodging Evans, Smalling or Jones. Good player though and I'm excited by how he develops.

439~~~
Well I couldn't tell properly from behind the goal seats but they weren't the best, not like Ferdinand. He's brilliant with the ball, like bringing it forward from the back and playing a nice forward pass. I just thought his long balls today weren't the best option at times.

And yeah but defending is something that a young person like him can work on with the experience and guidance of Van Gaal. It'd have been great if Rio/Vida were still here to help even more but hopefully we'll bring in an experienced centre back who can help too.

440~~~
Sorry I don't want to be rude but surely there are many other senior players to blamed today other than this kid?Only should be starting in cup games?You should tell that to Smalling instead.

441~~~
I like his passing and his pace. He's quick enough to not be outpaced over a distance by a player like Dyer, who's very quick, and his passing is really top notch. I'm not convinced by his positioning yet, and I'm unsure about his aerial abilities. All things considered though, he's certainly looking to be one for the future.

442~~~
You're a blind man. A blind man I tell you.

443~~~
It really is a surprise how much he's come on, I just think the main problem is he's still very young (baring in mind he played a lot of football at left back as well). It's a shame we've lost all our experienced defenders at once, I'm more than happy to be backup if we sign anyone.

444~~~
In amongst all my Woodward bashing I thought I'd drop in and post something positive. 

Blackett was a real surprise yesterday. You expect the odd mistake but on the whole I thought he done fantastically well.

445~~~
After seeing how composed he was against top class opposition during preseason, yesterday wasn't a surprise at all in my opinion. He is really taking his chance well.

446~~~
Pre season and your debut at OT are 2 different things. I watched him in every ore season game and fully expected he would make mistakes yesterday. Fact he didn't bodes well. 

Fletcher perfectly illustrated difference between pre season and PL - great in pre season, terrible yesterday.

447~~~
I think he'll play a lot of games this season tbh.The new CB signing will likely to compete with Smalling/Jones/Keane for the other two CB spots with Evans/Blackett for the LCB.With the possibility of switching to 4-3-3 it sounds just about right both in terms of quality and depth.

448~~~
I get that but nothing phases him, some players can just deal with certain situations and you could see this over the years, he has always been a very calm player. Sure, the occasion could have got to him but I wasn't surprised at all.

449~~~
Did you watch him in his loan spells? Very poor. Yesterday was a surprise in terms of him stepping up in a competitive game at OT. 

Very pleased.

450~~~
Saw him play left wing lol, I don't think he is as comfortable there as he is a CB and that could impact on a players confidence.

451~~~
His lack of defensive awareness played a part in both goals yesterday. At this stage I wouldn't be comfortable going to a tough away ground with him in the back 5. Still, he's shown enough so far this (pre-)season to make me think - and hope - I might have been wrong about him. On the ball he's pretty damn sensational. When you just casually decide to pull a whole new range of passing out of your hat during the biggest game of your life to date, there's something about you.

452~~~
It's bizarre how far he's come in a year despite looking average in the championship. Suppose it goes to show that loans don't suit everyone.

453~~~
His worst offence yesterday was passing the ball to Bony after we conceded the free-kick, which allowed him to take a quick one whilst we were out of position.

But that's just down to inexperience really - other than that he did as well as you could expect a youth product making his first-team debut

454~~~
Is it me or does he really really look like a bit of a lanky Evra? (Style wise not ability) I didn't realize he was a lefty either. I thought he should have moved to left back when we did the switch up in the second half.

455~~~
Does he already have a song for him based on Devo's Whip It? If not, I lay claim to the idea.

Unfortunately...

When a problem comes along
Tyler Blackett
When the ball comes in the box
Tyler Blackett
When something's goin' wrong
Tyler Blackett

...might be a bit premature after yesterday.

456~~~
Okay maybe it was just the view! Some passes were brilliant like the one out to Januzaj where he then won a corner which led to the goal. Some were just banged up field, and at the wrong times.
No doubt he will be a brilliant passing defender in the very near future.

457~~~
Not strictly his mistake, but I thought at that moment he shouldn't have kicked the ball straight to the opponent when the free kick was given against us. The one leading to the 2nd goal. That allowed the quick free kick which caught us a bit by surprise. Bit naive there.

458~~~
That's just inexperience, and he won't do it again. The fact that he was ball watching and made the wrong decision both in the build up to the first goal (he shouldn't have tried to get close to Dyer, leaving Sigurdsson open behind him) and the second goal (he was on Sigurdsson, but lost him) were much bigger worries. He wasn't solely responsible for any of the two goals, and others probably had worse involvements in both situations, but he could have done better on both occasions.

Still, I thought his composure on the ball and passing ability and range were very, very impressive. On a better day with his team mates performing to a higher standard, it would have been labeled an excellent debut.

459~~~
I genuinely hope he becomes a good defender, considering our squad's massive deficiencies in all areas of the pitch.

460~~~
Why are people here blaming Blackett for the first goal?  Go watch the replay.  The wing back was beaten so he went out to apply pressure.  He is suppose to get out there and do that esp with a back 3.  Granted he didn't channel the guy wide so he did not do his job perfectly, however the real problem is that none of our CM are tracking back in the middle.  There are three white shirts and two red shirts when that first Swansea goal goes in and while Blackett did not contain the ball out wide he should have gone to help and it is the CMs who are responsible for that first goal imho.

The second goal is mostly down to Smalling and Young not getting to where they should be.  The quick kick totally caught Smalling out of position and created the opportunity.  Young playing in an unfamiliar position, allowing the ball to carry over his head to the back post which leads to all types of problems and obviously a goal.  Again why is Blackett being slated when two others make horrible messes on this goal?

Overall I thought he played very well.  Yes a few too many long balls, and yes he was not perfect, but when I consider his composure and overall excellent play *esp* at his young age, it is confusing to my why anyone would go after him when other players clearly did more wrong and more to contribute to Swansea's goals than him... <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>.

461~~~
People want to convince themselves that Blackett was nothing more than a young player to play in cup games at this stage so that they can urge the club to throw money on whatever big name signings they want without feeling guilty.

462~~~
As do I. Nothing better than a player from our own academy making the grade!

If you're referring to my almost directly above yours, I think you must have misread it or deliberately overlooked some parts, as I quite clearly pointed out that others had to shoulder more of the blame than Blackett. I simply pointed out that he could have done better in both situations, and I'll happily stand by that.

463~~~
This boy is going to be an absolute to class defender when he matures. Very very impressed with him this far.

464~~~
Didn't refer to any post in particular mate which is why i did not quote anyone in particular.  I simply posted a comment based upon what I felt was a general theme here.   

And certainly he could have done better, I mean Swansea scored.  But if you fail to note many other players who did far more wrong in both goals then we can just leave it there <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>.

465~~~
I didn't fail to note that either. I wrote: "<i>He wasn't solely responsible for any of the two goals, and others probably had worse involvements in both situations</i>"

I'm not trying to pick a fight with you. It just seems that everything is very polemic here, to borrow a phrase from an old hero of mine. Anything stated is always interpreted in one or the other extreme direction, and then those with another opinion will start crying out and complaining about it. There seems to be no room for nuance in your opinions, it so often gets ignored and overlooked in favor of a more dramatic interpretation.

This being an example. Very few are singling out Blackett for performing particularly badly, some are just saying that he could have done better on the two occasions when we conceded.

466~~~
Stick the lad alongside an experienced defender who can direct him & he could well establish himself in the team. Just a shame we've no real leader at the back currently, oh Rio & Vida where are you now...

467~~~
Definitely. He should be a reason for optimism. Looked class in every game he's played so far and I didn't rate him too highly before so I'm pleasantly surprised and glad LvG has seen his promise.

468~~~
It was naive of him to do that, but if you look at the goal again all our defenders were back in position by the time Southampton got to the danger area.

469~~~
People seem to prefer Michael Keane as a defender. I remember seeing Blackett for the first time in preseason 2012 against Ajax Capetown in South Africa. He looked impressive at LB but the general consensus was that he was going nowhere fast. He was impeccable against Real and Liverpool in preseason and against Swansea too, save for the ball to Bony for the freekick (even though the goal itself wasn't a direct result of that, not one of our defenders was caught out on the backfoot as they were all back in position by the time Swansea got their cross in that led to the goal). This kid has a very bright future.

470~~~
On his Premier League debut for <a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/topic/manchester-united-fc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Red Devils</a>, <a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/topic/tyler-blackett/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tyler Blackett</a> made a positive impression. The 20-year-old recorded 97 touches of the ball, while completing 84 of his 90 attempted passes (93%). He showed his ability to read the game as he made two interceptions and three clearances. He also proved a dominant force in the air, winning all three of his contested aerial duels

<a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/08/17/cl-top-five-stats-from-man-uniteds-opening-day-defeat-to-swansea/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014...om-man-uniteds-opening-day-defeat-to-swansea/</a>

471~~~
His positioning for both the goals was somewhat poor tbh. He was the extra man in both situations and not sharp enough or doing enough.

Yeah, Young made a error getting caught out under the ball but Really he should have marked Sigurdsson for the 2nd goal or atleast been charging him to close down like crazy being the extra man in the box instead of dropping deep with no one else around for Swansea except Sigurdsson who was free and also should have covered wide properly in the first goal or stayed and held his position instead of being caught out in no man's land when the move began.

He was just too passive in both regards and game passed him by while he almost just watched. I guess neither are obvious errors that people notice immediately in this system but it's his weakness basically. He needs to be more aware and marking and tracking people off the ball is as important at this level as one on one defending. His composure on the ball has been standout and his 1 on 1 stuff good but he needs to defend better when he is the extra man especially instead of being so passive and stay aware and aggressive constantly.


He was as to be be blamed for anyone for the 2nd goal especially.

When Sigurdsson is the only man free in the box for swansea what is the logic of letting him stay free in front of you and dropping deep to cover the line and not even in a position to block his shot properly ? That's actually a pretty bad error. Almost as bad as Young getting caught under the cross.

And not too forget the whole defense got caught out in the first place including Smalling and Jones because he returned the ball quickly to Swansea to take the quick free kick. Dunno, how you can blame Smalling in that instance much at all as you did above. He was tracking his man Bony and fouled him and then had to drop deep but freekick  was taken quick thanks to Blackett returning the ball almost at once.

However i think Jones could have been better positioned as well but Blackett and Young were the main problems for that goal.

For the first one he got caught out in no man's land but that you could say was more down to others.
.

472~~~
I'd like to see him continue to play because he's good on the ball, but I can see hi making more mistakes. He got got dragged out of place for the 1st goal, and showed naively in giving the ball straight to Swansea to counter us to score the second. It's hard to expect him to be rock solid and that's what we need right now.

473~~~
There was a bit of a football IQ problem on the first goal but he was stuck out on the wing with Young trying to defend a 2 on 1. Not ideal, but I agree he looks a very mature young lad and defender.

474~~~
Seems good on the ball but his inexperience was a big factor in both goals conceeded IMO.

475~~~
Having re-watched the goals you have to say he made errors in the lead up to both goals. On the first he should have stayed with Gylfi, sure Dyer was behind Young but the way the ball was looped up Young was able to recover by the time Dyer would be able to control it. He was ball watching and pushed out when he needed to stick to his man. For the second he gives the ball back quick which is just youth naivety and then again he ball watches the cross, as it comes over his head he is just bouncing around watching the ball and lets Gylfi drop off him. In a situation like that he should be skin tight to Gylfi and just making sure his man ain't get a touch on that ball. It may sound harsh but he made the wrong choice in both scenarios. However I still want to see him playing more, he's got a lot to learn from van Gaal and if we get Rojo in Tyler will be great cover for him. Been thoroughly impressed with him so far.

476~~~
Not just you, I thought Evra was back several times when he had his runs with the ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> only to realize that he was bigger and taller

477~~~
His range of passing looked really good. Not necessarily what we need but he hit some really raking balls out wide. Look strong and quick.

The issue with young players and in his case defenders is they will make mistakes. Can we afford that this season? Probably not. Yet I think he has all the potential to develop into a excellent CB.

478~~~
His range of passing was second to none when he threw the ball straight to Swansea for the second goal!  Joking aside I think he will be a top player for the club.  Whilst I want the club to buy a big name defender I also would like to see him get game time (which he no doubt will when Smalling Jones and Evans all get injuries throughout the season)

479~~~
You have to say the 2nd goal was his fault. He gave them the ball back instantly when the referee gave the free kick which led them to hitting us on the counter. Stupidity at its best.

480~~~
Would rather see Blackett get games as a backup for Evans than for us to buy Rojo for that role.

481~~~
I thought Fletcher was part to blame too. 1), he should have stayed with the fouled guy Bony but didn't and 2) he wasn't aware of the game around him so when Bony did the quick take, Fletcher was unaware and didn't track back sufficiently to assist.

He should have done something similar to what the Swansea player did at the beginning of the 80th minute. Commit foul, stay at the spot and make sure a quick freekick can't happen.

3) Fletcher ran back but then left Routledge alone even though Routledge was alone in front of him and Fletcher was just looking at him.

Blackett was excellent for a first time first team player. His passing was really good and there was a stat I saw that said he had the most passes and highest accurate percentage. And most of these were forward and not side to side.

482~~~
I didn't think Blackett did a lot wrong, until preseason I didn't really appreciate his full passing ability, his long range passing is fantastic and he displayed that again aginast Swansea.

I'm not too down after that game to be honest, there's going to be blips and better to get them out of the way. Blackett was a big positive Saturday and I genuinely think he would force himself into a regular starter in the next few seasons.

483~~~
I agree with everyone lauding Blackett. For a debut he did really well. His long range passing in particular was superb. Defo one for the future.

484~~~
Tyler could be a future United captain. He's so calm with it...puts more experienced players like Evans and Smalling to shame with his composure. Big hopes for him. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSLWk9MSCrg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

485~~~
One question-is he left footed?

486~~~
Of course he is.

487~~~
The injuries of Shaw and Evans means that there is room for both him and Rojo. I'm really keen to see more of Blackett. I follow the youth teams a fair bit and I've been pleasantly surprised by his first team performances so far.

488~~~
I think that his inexperience kept Reece James out of the side.

It would have been better defensively to have had James on the left and Young on the right, but that would have meant the combined inexperience of Blackett and of James on the left side of defence.

Now Rojo can cover at LWB and Young can play on the right. When Shaw or Valencia return then Rojo can take Blackett's place at LCB

489~~~
I think Rojo takes Blackett's place as LCB if he is fit to start that is. I doubt he will play as a LWB in a 5, though not sure.

Rafael is back fully by next game so he goes straight into RWB. And probably James or Young at LWB.

490~~~
I hope this signing does not mean that Tyler's development will be retarded. It will not be a goos example to the other young players. I hope Tyler gets regular games

491~~~
if rafael is back and rojo is ready to play I wouldnt be shocked to see a back 4 (we looked better when we switched to it against swansea)

Rafael----Jones-----Smalling-----Rojo

492~~~
More about having another option at LCB with Evans switch to central CB (otherwise we have to play Smalling and Jones almost every game they weren't deserved it so far)
Jones/Keane Evans/Smalling Rojo/Blackett that's how I look at it.

493~~~
I agree, I just hope that Tyler gets games regularly

494~~~
We didn't play the whole pre-season 3-5-2 just for fun.. we have no defensive minded player who could cover for our two centrebacks who are not consistent enough.

495~~~
I disagree. He has a lot of promise, but he is not ready to be a starter. For me he should get games only in the cups and coming of the bench when we have full control and of course if we have an injury crisis. I'm convinced that we wouldn't have lost the game against Swansea if it wasn't for his mistakes. Which is a pity, because overall he had a very good game, but his two mistakes cost us both goals - a sign of a talented player who is not ready. Yes, others made mistakes too, but for both goals he was the one who started the avalanche of errors.

496~~~
That's incorrect. He did not start the avalanche of errors for the first goal. Go back and watch the move develop. There were two crucial errors well before Blackett moved across. Firstly Mata had been tracking Ki during the early stages of the move, he continued to track Ki back into our half, then bizarrely decided to wander over towards the action where Herrera, Fletcher and Young were involved, thus leaving the eventual goal scorer completely free to move unmarked towards our goal. Had Mata done his job, the chances of Ki scoring were minimal. Young, perhaps not surprisingly, got caught out by their wide player's run off the ball, requiring Blackett to move across. Those are the two key errors in the first goal and both happened well before Blackett was involved. Mata's mistake was a disgrace.

On the 2nd goal I think you can make a reasonable case that Blackett made two key errors, firstly enabling them to take a quick free kick then losing his man/failing to get out quickly to block, when the goal was scored. Personally I think Ashley Young's lack of experience defending crosses turned a situation that would normally be cleared, to some degree, by the full back, into a chaotic situation in which Blackett made a poor call.

497~~~
I still think Blackett was the main culprit for the first goal as well. Young was pretty close to their wide player and he would've run into blind alley had Blackett stayed with his man. The fact that Blackett left his man is what created the opportunity. Even if Mata had stayed with Ki the opportunity would've still be there, just Sigurdson would've shot or cut in instead of passing to Ki. In both cases Sigurdson would've been just as likely to score, because he had all the space in the world after Blackett left him.

498~~~
To be honest, I still believe Fletcher made far more erros than Blackett did. Watch the game again, Smalling made the tackle then runs back to get into the defence but Fletcher was on the the closest to the spot and even watches when Bony takes the ball and starts the quick freekick. Fletcher I feel should have been on the spot preventing the quick pass. Then Fletcher runs back but for some reason stops when he enters the box and doesn't even go to cover Sigurdsson who is in front of him with no one covering.

I felt Blackett's only mistake was passing the ball back to Bony. The rest was squarely Fletcher's fault.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/DemandingAnotherIndianabat.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/DemandingAnotherIndianabat.gif"/>

499~~~
Everyone makes mistakes especially at his age and experience. If you read my post properly, you will see that I was not asking for him to be first choice. All I was expressing was the hope that he would get games regularly and not be left out to rot. He will only eliminate those mistakes on the field, not on the bench or in the reserves. Also i disagrre that he was blatanltly at fault with both goals

500~~~
I agree he wasn't blatantly at fault for both goals - it's not like he miskicked the ball and someone went on to score after, but for me it started with him. As I said it's a pity, because he is showing a lot of promise, but he is not ready yet to be a starter. He should be a backup to Rojo. If he gets a few games in the cups, plus coming off the bench in a few games and I'm sure he will be required to cover for an injury a few times - overall he could get 15-20 games this season. This is plenty for someone his age. This could be much more beneficial for him, than getting thrown in the deep end from the start - if we keep loosing games the atmosphere in the club will deteriorate like last season and he might get blamed more and more for his mistakes. This could be very hard to take mentally and do much more damage than good.

501~~~
Glad Blackett should be getting another chance to play this weekend with Rojo out due to work permit issues.

Also found that Van Gaal likes him, which I am glad about. Hope the youngester gets to play many games this season.

502~~~
Aye, I liked that as well, it says to any young player that if you make your first mistake, it won't be your last and that they are a nessecary part of the learning process.

503~~~
Like him a lot. Needs a more experienced CB around him to bring him on. Where's Rio or Vidic when you need them...

504~~~
Another good performance and even didn't give an inch when Altidore tried to throw his weight around. Also did our best cross of the match. Whipped in a great ball from the left.

505~~~
One of the few who can hold his head high after today's travesty. Hasn't been mentally scarred by last season like so many others.

506~~~
Encouraging, in a game short of encouragement. One of the very few positives.

507~~~
His best performance for me so far.

508~~~
His passing was off today, but he showed good strength and balance.

He needs to cut out the aimless longballs. 2 out of 8 found the target today and that sums up how economical he currently is with them.

509~~~
Played well defensively but way too many long balls for my liking.

510~~~
Played well. Looks composed and can feel good about himself after today. Can't say the same for a lot of other players today.

511~~~
I love the lad. Composed on the ball, good positionally and quite a unit.

512~~~
I think those longballs are down to the shit midfield we had.

513~~~
With Cole retired and Shaw injured, could he be in the England squad?

514~~~
Stick a midfield infront of him and he'll have someone to pass to rather than bypass.

515~~~
I love that he will bawl at DDG and everyone else. Looks very confident. I like M Keane, but he looks terrified by comparison.

516~~~
Very composed again.

517~~~
He was the best player today. Again. I would say it is like a new signing.

518~~~
Today perhaps, but he also did it in the first game when Ander was an option

And I dont even mind if he goes for a long pass if he actually has decent success with it. But he doesn't. The vast majority dont give his teammate a chance to recover it.

519~~~
It's funny the contrast between him and jones in terms of composure, it's one extreme to the other but he does look good. I see him more as a left back then centre half.

520~~~
I think first game he was the hoofer to Fellaini. But yeah agree that he should be more selective. He has made some diagonals in pre season but cannot do it every time.

521~~~
For a guy who has played 14 professional games in his career, he's performing better than I expected. He's not a sudden world class option, but you really can't criticise him at all. 

Can't blame him for the long balls and it's good to see him very vocal in the back line.

522~~~
Long way to improve. But being one of our better players today goes to show the state of our squad.

523~~~
He was doing it before Fellaini came on though. He had a couple of successful ones after Fellaini did come on thats true.

We've definitely seen him manage a few nice long balls, its not that he's incapable its that he seems to need about 5 poor ones for each good one.

524~~~
really the last guy we should be knocking right now

525~~~
He was good. If we had a midfield that showed for the ball, he wouldn't be knocking up long balls.

526~~~
Very impressive today. Didn't put a foot wrong in defence, although his passing wasn't as good as normal.

527~~~
Not perfect but looks reasonably comfortable at this level. Don't like long balls without a purpose but the midfield weren't exactly offering much in terms of passing options.

528~~~
Our best player on the pitch. Only one who didn't look a nervous wreck. He has more leadership qualities in his pinky finger than Rooney has.

529~~~
Nicest surprise in this current state of absolute chaos. Van Gaal loves intelligent players with solid control who can provide team with organization on the field.

If the player will work hard and listen then we may have magnificent defender for ten years straight from Old Trafford.

530~~~
Did very well today. Too much hoofing though, really needs to calm that.

531~~~
Would a Rojo - Blacket CB pairing work in a 433? It would be a shame if he ended up getting less appearances once we utilise the 433 since he's been very good so far.

532~~~
I am quite comfortable with him starting games for us now. Taken the chance given with aplomb.

533~~~
Really taken his chance well. I feel far more comfortable with him playing than I do with Jones or Keane.

534~~~
Really like the cut of this fella's jib.

535~~~
Apart from a few hurried clearances he isn't any worse than what we have.

536~~~
Until Welbeck came on. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

537~~~
Welbeck injected more pace and energy. I can't believe we're trying to get rid of him.

538~~~
Can hold his head up high.

Not a complete embarrassment to his profession as others in our side are.

539~~~
His passing of all ranges was a bit off today but all in all he did well. Once again. Promising. Love how he mindfcuked the lino into changing that corner decision.

540~~~
His jib has a good cut.

541~~~
One of our better players today. It's a shame our results haven't been better because he'd be getting more recognition despite the fact that our bigger issues are in the attacking third as opposed to the defensive third.

542~~~
He showed more maturity in these two games than Jones did since he came here. Good with the ball, very good physically, pretty much everything you see in modern CB. Of course his positioning can be better, but I can definitely see him playing decent role for us.

543~~~
He is raw no doubt but he has a lot of potential. Positioning and passing a bit off but nothing he can't rectify.

van Gaal is the right coach to mould him into a good CB.

544~~~
Give this man a payrise, not Tom Cleverley. A contract termination would naturally be preferred for Cleverley.

545~~~
He's been the bright spot of the 2 games so far for me. He shouldn't immediately be sent to the U21s because of Rojo's purchase. He should be a constant part of our squad now.

546~~~
This year's Januzaj for me so far. Every game I've watched that he's played in, he's looked pretty damn solid.

Keane and Smalling need replacing in my view.

547~~~
He's an absolute unit isn't he? Good game from him, looks like we will see a lot of him this season knowing our CBs injury records.

548~~~
Our best field player today and that says everything

549~~~
Looks our best defender at the present time

550~~~
Pleased for him to see him have another solid display.

551~~~
Shows the state of our defence when someone who's played 2 first team games for us, is showing the rest how to defend!

552~~~
I'm still amazed he's a passable cb after being terrible there for the reserves and on loan.

553~~~
Maybe the rest of our team makes him look good.

554~~~
Should I mention this should all be in the non-existent "Tyler Blackett - 2014/15 performances" thread?

555~~~
He's been better than the rest

556~~~
Solid performance.  But need to be more adventurous carrying the ball forward.  He hesitated a few times but what am i to complain, still one of the better performers yesterday

557~~~
If Smalling is ruled out, I can see him playing next week again with Rojo playing CB in Smalling 's place. 

Great game from him, really solid defensively.

558~~~
Makes little mistakes here and there but can't really blame him because he's not experienced at this level. Still arguably the best defender we had the past two games.

559~~~
Another decent performance from him. I like how he is confident enough to carry the ball forward when given the chance. Still has a bit to do before I'd be convinced to trust him there long terms

560~~~
This kid is already showing he can match our other older and more experienced CBs punch for punch. If he was a Southampton player they'd be rating him at 20M plus

561~~~
I'm impressed by his confidence, already yelling at players who he believes are out of position or make mistakes, will be a future leader

562~~~
He looks a natural born leader. Whether he makes it at United or not I see him being a captain of a club in the future

563~~~
I won't be as bothered if this season is another failure. Seeing players like Blackett and Januzaj develop is a joy and pride you can enjoy from a season. He seems to have it all really. Very composed, athletic, determined, assertive and most importantly, loud as feck on the pitch. The one thing Smalling, Evans and Jones don't seem too bothered with, yet was the foundation that Vida, Rio, Evra, Neville and VDS were built on. I also love the way his burst and power just shrugs players off when he carries the ball out of defence. I'm not too bothered about his passing though, as Gary said, hes a kid that seems very determined to learn and improve, so he will watch the videos of himself and have his passing sorted by the end of the season.

564~~~
The only one who had any sort of balls to do that. Sad state of affairs if we're looking at this kid for leadership.

565~~~
Blackett has done really well in both games. But I don't get the Jones bashing here, they are different type of centre halves. IMO Jones was our top performer in both games.

566~~~
He's acquitted himself well in both games, certainly one of the few pluses so far.

567~~~
He has looked good. The only criticism I can think of is his tendency to try long balls to our forwards with very very little accuracy. Maybe its the lack of movement from his teammates that forces him to go for the long ball.

568~~~
Like on DDG right ? He played well, showed character, willingness to carry the ball and create from the back.

569~~~
Agree with most of the sentiments in this forum regarding Tyler.

I hope that when Rojo and Shaw become available, that Tyler is still making some contribution to the fist team, I do not want to see his development curtailed otherwise.

570~~~
Still very young, Shaw and Rojo will play more often than him this season but if he continues to impress like this, I'm sure he will rack up over 20 games and that will only place him in a strong position when the futures of Jones, Evans and Smalling come up for van Gaal.

571~~~
I'd sell Smalling if it meant Blackett getting game time to develop. I think the ship has sailed for Chris Smalling.

572~~~
if we continue to use 3 5 2, we need both of them.

573~~~
Shall we start with the racial comparisons now? 

"This guys going to be the next Sol Campbell"

In all seriousness, he looks pretty decent. Still pretty raw but there's a definite talent there.

574~~~
can he play at LWB? he seems to be goood on the ball and has a good left-foot. Benn very impressed with him so far.

575~~~
What are you talking about Smalling?

576~~~
As I said in the Match day thread, I think LvG will turn this boy into a superstar. He's just the sort of player LvG likes to pluck from the reserves.

577~~~
He looks decent, but very very raw. He looks as good as Smalling though, so far.

578~~~
It's good to see what is clearly a decent young player being given his chance at the back.

People going on about us buying an experienced CB, I think LVG is going to do what we should of always been doing and that is bring players up through the ranks and give them a fair crack of the whip.

Blackett has probably been one of the better players out there for these two games, had Fergie been in charge he would of been still playing reserve football while fletcher or Carrick played at the back, while Moyes probably wouldn't of known who he was.

579~~~
I think he looks better on the ball though. He gives it away now and them but Smalling looks edgy when he's coming out. I really hope LVG works on some lads technique.

580~~~
He's very good on the ball, he's big and looks a leader, I like him....and did anyone not notice how Michael Keane slot into the defence line yesterday and was superb? We looked better defesively immediately Smalling went off.

581~~~
I'm just saying, comparing their ages, and the fact that Blackett looks more comfortable on the ball than Smalling, maybe it's time we let Smalling go so as to allow Blackett to develop.

582~~~
Smalling is way better and it would be insanse to get rid of our best defender, especially noadays where we dont have much experience in our back 4

583~~~
Calm down. A bit too soon to say this. Blackett is better on the ball but he isn't a better defender, not at the moment anyway. Let's give Blackett a bit more time to see what he does over the season.

584~~~
Looks a good prospect. Def the best footballing defender at mo and looks comfortable with the ball at his feet. Big future ahead for this lad. It's interesting cause I've not read anywhere that this lad was high on people's list to be in the first team. LVG certainly has an eye for a young player.

585~~~
Sorry but that's kneejerk nonsense...

Smalling is an exceptional case due to his lack of football at a young age. He still has much to learn but look at the stats, Jones has played more first team football and is 2 years younger. He didn't have a youth career like nearly all top players have due to his own personal circumstances. I do think we would have benefitted greatly by sending Smalling out on loan to another premiership team.

To hail Blackett as a better prospect after a few games is a bit silly imo

586~~~
He's a lot more confident than Smalling, that's for sure. Smalling looks like he is going to panic any time he has possession of the ball. Blackett looks better but he has a habit of playing long diagonal balls which he is not really capable of playing, yet. He has only played a small number of games though and should hopefully improve immensely under LvG.

587~~~
I must say in the last few years when SAF was still in charge, he wasn't as keen to give youth a chance. It seems Van Gaal has not stepped away from his philosophy however, and is more than willing to give a chance to a few youngsters, which is brilliant to see. Now Wilson next!

588~~~
havent seen him on loan thought he played there but didnt impressed anyone there. I saw him when he was with us playing leftback or from time to time left wing for reserves.. he was very quick that days. He doesnt look pacey at all comparing him now to the 2year younger blackett. It must have something to do with the fact that he bulked up and he may had some injuries but I am not sure of that.. anyway centreback is not the position where you need too much speed. The leftback is not his position, I wouldnt play him there. His dribbling and speed for centreback is good but not for a leftback and never for leftwingback. I think Rojo will play a lot of matches on the left hand side instead of Shaw. He had solid wolrd cup as LB so they could all rotate SHAW LB, Rojo - LB, LCB, Blacket LCB, CB, Evans, any of centrebacks... smalling as CB and RCB the same with jones but he could be used as RB as well.... they all will have time in 3-5-2, the worst case for them is 4-4-2 but I have no doubt some of them will sadly be injured...

589~~~
Smalling, Jones and Evans all seem a level below what we need to straighten out the back four. Having a shit midfield who can't shield them doesn't help either.

590~~~
This guy has been a positive in an otherwise pile of shit excuse of a defense.

591~~~
I liked how Jones seemed to marshall the defense much better when he played in the center. You need that sort of leadership from the one in the center and Smalling just doesn't have it.

592~~~
Has the physique to develop into a fine defender and seems composed already - he needs to work on his passing and should he bulk up he could dominate our box more 

One real error in each game doesn't mask what has been a great start and I expect him to develop under LVG 

Rojo is left sided so he might be first choice but I expect Blackett to get opportunities

593~~~
Yes. Its good to know LVG is not for playing players out of position unless he's trying to make them versatile or completely convert them position wise. No more Jones and Smalling at RB or in midfield.

594~~~
Lingard, Young, Januzaj and Nani would like a word

595~~~
Could do with Jones in midfield at this moment tbh. He played Januzaj there yesterday.

596~~~
Well with the wingback system players like Young and Valencia are going to have to adjust if they are to get any playing time. 
Jones' midfield days are over. Januzaj was played there because we're bare in midfield. Once the team is more balanced with our new signings (and a clean bill of health all round) we probably won't see that sort of thing much.

597~~~
I know Moyes is like the anti-christ here but feck me you don't have to talk complete arse to randomly throw a slag at him. Moyes was regularly spotted in attendance at the U21 matches, he obviously knew who he was.

598~~~
I obviously don't care, so why waste your time typing that out?

599~~~
I remember reading some thing about people inside the club started to really worry about Moyes when he wanted to change to the youth set up to be more focused on power and athleticism rather than ball work.

600~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-moyes-tried-change-manchester-7025321" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...s/david-moyes-tried-change-manchester-7025321</a>

Guy was a fecking idiot.

601~~~
If you obviously don't care why did you type that out?

602~~~
So you wouldn't waste your time.
Which, seems to of been in vain.

603~~~
I obviously don't care.

604~~~
Thanks that it. Kinda scary what could of happened if he stayed longer,what was Fergie thinking.

Anyway doesn't matter now he's gone now.

605~~~
Mr. Mujac has posted on this several times and has said he didn't want to reduce the ball work but wanted to add more fitness/physical training to make it a better balance.

Here is one of his posts from recently, look through his posts to find others if you want.

606~~~
Ok fair enough.

607~~~
It's not a knee jerk reaction. I've always been uncomfortable at Smalling's discomfort on the ball.

I know Smalling is highly rated by the Caf. I think he is a good defender myself. But his clear discomfort at having the ball at his feet annoys me. He's also suffered from not having a sustained run in the side as a centre back for various reasons like injury and us having better options in Rio and Vidic and this has made him regressed somewhat.

We all rated Rio and Vidic when they were here, which was partly the reason why Jones and Smalling didn't get their chances to really develop as players. So I'd rather we not see the past repeat itself with Blackett, who's looked almost as promising as Jones did turning out for Blackburn. He also, more importantly looks comfortable on the ball. I can't emphasize enough how sick I am of us having players who are not comfortable on the ball. This bit is more obvious when we come up against teams who will press us or in the latter stages of the Champions League. 

Blackett needs games, and we're in the process of a rebuild ourselves so rather than loan him out, we could give him a run in the team.

Besides, I'm tired of us being loyal to players who have clearly let themselves down for too long. I'm not putting Smalling in that category, more about Young, Cleverley, Valencia, Nani etc, but I think it's high time we started showing players we won't stand for mediocrity anymore.

608~~~
Yeah, I'm delighted he's doing well and long may it continue, but the reactions towards him are becoming increasingly hyperbolic and it does him no favors. I guess it's part and parcel of being Caf flavor of the month but you just know his most overenthusiastic champions are the first ones who'll turn on him when he inevitably shows the instability which comes with youth and lack of experience.

609~~~
Called it, bitches:

610~~~
Very surprised with how well he's taken to first team football.

What's encouraging is that he's already got the ball skills and the physicality. What he's lacking in are things like positioning, concentration and reading the game, which can all be taught and learned by experience.

611~~~
His passing needs working on but he's very composed when he has the ball. Never seems to be in a rush

612~~~
I'm assuming he's under instructions to play it long given the number of times he's done it. Bit annoying.

613~~~
Di Maria wants it short, so he smashes it long..

614~~~
His distribution needs some work. Probably been asked to go long to avoid losing possession in an unrecoverable position.

615~~~
Out of his depth

616~~~
Is anyone genuinely impressed by his defending? Doesn't seem to do a whole lot of it anyway. Looks classy on the ball with a good touch/control, but poor decision making with his passing.

617~~~
What a load of guff.

618~~~
Watched Rio of old too much.

619~~~
Rioesque in hoofing the ball.

620~~~
Still looks a little shaky, as to be expected. I still think hes impressive though, given his lack of experience. This is a tough game, Burnley are down the throats of our back 3 whenever we have the ball. He's brought the ball out well a few times despite the pressure. The movement of our midfield gives him zero options for the pass though.

621~~~
Tyler "Long Ball" Blackett.

622~~~
He has been playing Those long balls in all his games. He is obviously being told to do so

Defensively he has done ok again

623~~~
He plays it to Young and he gets it straight back. Burnley crowd out Fletcher and Di Maria so his only option is to pass it to either Jones or De Gea or play it long.

624~~~
He doesn't look anything worse defensively than our "senior" defenders, so I wouldn't blame him too much, but his hoofing is bit annoying(altough that probably isn't his fault too).

625~~~
I don't want a player like him close to our starting XI. He has done better than I expected, but he should not be close to our first team.

626~~~
Poor first half from Blackett, hope he can improve his performance in the 2nd half. Some of his passing has been careless and his marking wasn't good when they got a header in.

627~~~
Not a good first half there from him. Started off with a terrible first pass, Arfield made bits of him at the corner flag at around the half hour mark and shortly after that took ages while trying to decide what to do with the ball and nearly lost it. He's not at the races at all so far today and could do with waking up a bit.

628~~~
He's taking over Rio Ferdinands 'make fifty long passes to nobody' mantle.

629~~~
Wrong thread.This is not Evan's thread <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

630~~~
He looks more composed that Jones and Evans put together. His passing needs work though

631~~~
Not upto scratch for me.

His passing is sloppy which doesn't suit our system.

632~~~
Decent defending, terrible distribution. Thats a few games in a row now that his passing has dropped quite a few levels from pre-season and the first game of the season

633~~~
He is getting worse with every game. Properly isn't helped with the fact we have no real leader at the back but today he looked edgy today, passing was diabolic as well. As soon as Rojo is cleared to play he won't be near the first team.

634~~~
Think people are being a little harsh. Got booked for a great tackle too.

635~~~
His defending is ok but he doesn't win many headers. Really let's himself down with his distribution.

If he plays it short then it is slow and deliberate and easily intercepted. When he plays it long it's aimless and wayward.

636~~~
Hoooooooooooof .....fecking idiot.

637~~~
Yeah, as everybody else had said, poor passing. But he'll get better.  
Although with so many leftie defenders coming he won't start so much.

638~~~
Perceptive.

639~~~
Fantastic come back. Award yourself a medal for that.

640~~~
Maybe you should get back to kneejerking

641~~~
He's alright defensively and probably been our best defender this season. Needs to stop hoofing the ball or if it's an instruction from the manager, it needs to stop.

642~~~
No problem with him!

643~~~
It has got to be an instruction otherwise why would LVG just allow something that's not working to just keep on going ?? I hope it's an instruction otherwise wtf !!

644~~~
Very unusual to let such an young defender keep hoofing (sorry, passing) the ball up the pitch.

645~~~
He's good, and LVG will make him better. I hope he promotes more of the youth.

646~~~
Instruction or not, it is so fecking annoying. No build up play.

647~~~
Very raw and today it showed more than the other games I've seen this season.

648~~~
I didn't mind the hoofing as any time we try to arse around with it at the back we inevitably end up giving it away and almost conceding. I thought he was quite strong in defence today.

649~~~
He's been better than I expected tbh and I've watched quite a bit of him. His hoofing is terribly annoying though and he tends to slow play down a bit too much for me as it seems he doesn't ever decide what he's going to do with the ball until after he receives it. He's a youngster though and you can't expect too much to soon. I'm sure he will improve on these two things.

650~~~
He really isn't that great.

651~~~
I think he's been consistantly good so far, if we had a link between our defence and attack maybe he wouldn't have to hoof it so much.

652~~~
He has been ok, nothing great so far. People are blaming him for the hoof ball, but a lot of the time I don't think he really has to much of a choice. Our midfield isn't exactly giving him options a lot of the time, and if he does pass it to them, it just gets knocked straight back to him anyway.

653~~~
Exactly. Hopefully Herrera and Blind will help in this regard by at least showing for it and then looking forward for the next pass.

654~~~
Think he's doing just fine especially with the dross alongside him.  Hopefully when everyone is fit he'll get a few chances to continue his progress.

655~~~
Maybe you should feck off.

656~~~
Calm down lads <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

657~~~
I thought Tyler was poor today, too many sloppy short passes, his defending was careless too, beaten in the air too often, asleep when one cross came in. The long balls were largely understandable given the lack of short passing options. I like him a lot but not a good performance.

658~~~
Cannot pass to a team mate. I'd love to see his completion stats for today.

659~~~
To be fair to the lad he looks fairly comfortable with the ball, and he's actually been our best defender in that respect. He's also been fairly good positionally. However as others have said, he had a number of opportunities this game and last game to play the ball to a midfielder in space along the ground easily, especially Di Maria, but he chose the long ball or cross field pass. Once he eradicates that element of his game, he actually could be a very good player for us.

660~~~
His short passing isn't bad. Problem today was he didn't make any. He played the long ball every time. That element needs fixing. As for defending, I think he's very much like Ferdinand - he needs a stopper next to him to get the best out of his ability to read the game.

Edit: obviously talking about style. He's nowhere near ferdinand a level.

661~~~
Four four two list Blackett's pass completion stats as 58/79

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755324/player-stats/112133/1_PASS_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...er-stats/112133/1_PASS_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

Evans 73/91

Jones 51/54

662~~~
73%, same as Di Maria. Very low. 2 Tackles and 6 interceptions is really great on the other hand, just a tackle below Jones who also had great stats in that regard.

663~~~
Thanks guys.

Still, when a centre half and creative midfielder have the same completion stats you know something is wrong.

664~~~
Terrible on the ball. Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof. That's pretty much all he did and lost it most of the time. Will need to improve that if he's to ever make it.

665~~~
He needs to stop hoofing the ball forward when under no pressure whatsoever.

666~~~
Has anybody said about him hoofing the ball yet?
Less nerve-wracking than Evans with the ball. Hardly had an inside pass on, and Young kept running towards him, bringing a Burnley player with him, so he could pass it back to him(under pressure) <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

667~~~
This. Comfortable on it,but hopeless when asked to do something with it.

668~~~
Looks solid enough defensively. Not afraid to be closed down, confident enough in his own ability and strength.

669~~~
Keeps the ball a bit too long for my liking, less hoofing under no pressure too.

670~~~
Don't think he was all that today, either defensively or on the ball.

671~~~
Crazy the reactions of some people on here.

Here is a kid who has only had a handful of senior appearances, he has come into the Manchester United defensive line that is under an enormous amount of scrutiny and probably been the best performer. He doesn't have his greatest game (if he doesn't have an option in front him, going long is his only option) and people are making u-turns on their judgments about his future.

I thought he did well and is well deserving of his spot. It's great to see in my opinion.

672~~~
I like him. Talented and deserves to get some appearances here and there when we can afford it.

673~~~
Loves a long ball, doesn't he? That said, I can't say I blame him. Some of the movement off the ball was dreadful, at times. Our build up play still needs a lot more work.

674~~~
Much better than Michael Keane

675~~~
Tbh I think if we play Keane next to Jones he will look better than Evans yesterday.Evans need to find back his form or else he will be dropped when Smalling and Rojo back in the fold.

676~~~
I don't know if Evans will ever stay consistent. If its not injury he can't maintain good form, or avoid the occasional blunder.

677~~~
That's why going out of the league Cup (or whatever silly name it's called now) at the first hurdle was so disappointing. It would have been the ideal opportunity for players such as Blackett.

678~~~
He's doing OK, just needs to learn to stop the long balls forward as much.

679~~~
I suspect that we will revert to 4 3 3 when everyone is fit. I see 
DDG
Rafael Jones Rojo Shaw
Herrera Blind Di Maria
? RVP/Rooney Januzaj
Either Rooney plays wide right or we need a new winger as neither Young or Valencia are good enough or Welbeck plays wide right
Or we go 4 4 2
DDG
Rafael Jones Rojo Shaw
Herrera Blind Di Maria Januzaj
    RVP Rooney 

Carrick when fit will be back up to Blind and Herrera Altghough i hope the Pearson and Perreira will be given chances
Mata will be back up to di Maria although I would prefer Kagawa to stay. I think with Blind and Herrera behind him he will show his true attacking qualities.
Wilson and Welbeck ( if he stays) will back up Rooney and RvP

Well I'm not making any judgement on him at all, I'm just taking it by a match by match basis and yesterday I thought he was very poor especially in the first half when Burnley were playing a more attacking game.

Right from get go he put us under pressure by playing a really poor or weak pass up the line which led to Burnley landing a high ball into the six yard box and Evans making a good clearance. Burnleys Afrield got the better of him a few times but he ran rings around him altogether down at the corner flag at around the half hour mark, nothing wrong with that these things can happen but what annoying was Blacketts attempt to get the ball back or at least put Arfield under pressure because to me he had the time to. Instead he more or less gave up and let Arfield tear into the box with the ball. Shortly after that he had the ball up around the half way mark and he just stood up for what looked like an age trying to figure out what to do with it and needlessly nearly lost possession. Then there was all the hoofing up top of the ball every time he got it.

Talented or not talented, young or experienced it wasn't a good performance at all and that's the long and short of it.

681~~~
Depends on what's your expectation on him.Many of us understand that he will make some mistakes considering his age,experience (first season in a PL with a new formation and all that) and the fact that the more "senior" players around him are by no mean reliable.Throw a 20-year-old Ferdinand on the same occasion and he'll hardly set the world alight IMO.

The rest, like you, seem judging youth players like him in the same wave as the seniors, or even harsher.Luckily the coaching staffs won't do the same thing otherwise we might better shut down the academy for good sake.I'm not talking about you but some others seem to find young players "easy targets" to blame whenever we have a bad match due to their obvious inexperience.

682~~~
Neither are good enough.

683~~~
He will look far better when we have a midfield to pass to.

684~~~
To be fair, Di Maria is making passes in the final third of the pitch which in theory is far more difficult than passing out of defence. Cannot compare the two.

685~~~
Blackett has a future here. Keane not so much, his brother too.

686~~~
So, the only Manc left in the first team.

687~~~
I don't think he has personally. Agree on the other two unfortunately.

If we revert to a 433 I don't see him getting any more chances in the first team.

688~~~
I thought he's done pretty well considering he has just been thrown into it, would be happy for him to be a backup and continue to develop.

As for the hoofing the ball, can't really blame him, it was quite disgraceful against Burnley how none of our midfielders wanted to take responsibility and get the ball off the backline and create. Even in the final third in the last minutes Evans was looking around with no one offering to take the ball.

689~~~
He won't get many chances indeed, but he'll be around as a backup. Jones and Smalling are injuries waiting to happen and you know it. With time, Blackett is going to prove himself equal to or better than those two, and if he has better luck with fitness he'll even be more dependable. He's clearly more comfortable on the ball than all our present defenders bar Rojo who we haven't seen it.

690~~~
Very very unlikely. I dont see it personally. Hes benefited greatly due to circumstances as opposed to ability. I still think Thorpe is the better player. Also Evans is far better in possession than him.

691~~~
You're being a bit harsh on the lad there. I haven't seen anything to convince me he won't be able to develop into a very good defender given the right coaching and time. He's only 20. He's already very good on the ball, big and strong and he's only going to get better. And LvG seems to like him a lot.

692~~~
If Thorpe was better he would've been on the plane to preseason, or got his chance ahead of Blackett. According to people here, both Thorpe and Keane are much better than Blackett, but its Blackett who's taken his chances well every time he's played in the first team. Who cares about the circumstances he's benefited from? He's still outperformed all our CBs perhaps save for Phil Jones since he's been in the first team. Evans has been a disaster in possession, just look at the pressure he often heaps on De Gea with his annoying brain fart passes, its already cost us a goal this season against MK Dons. Its happened a lot between those two. When Blackett replaced Evans in preseason against Liverpool, he brought calm to the back, the 20 year old actually settled us back there and his distribution and composure was much better than the more experienced players. Like it or not, Blackett is here to stay and he'll get way more chances this season than Keane and Thorpe in the first team.

693~~~
This. I think Blackett has been the most consistent out of the back three especially when you take into consideration his age and experience. He plays on the side where he has to do a lot of the cleaning up from Ashley Young's non defensive nature and only hoofs the ball up when there are no shorter passes on. If we do go to four at the back then I can see him getting less game time but I think he has done enough to stay in the managers mind when it comes to selection.

694~~~
I think all 3 have a chance to different degrees of making it atleast in a squad role but won't be surprised if none of them did. All have some areas of their games to improve on and it's tough to tell with young defenders anyway unless they are prodigies. 

Being left footed and this system has suited Blackett and why he got chances and tbf he has taken them. Will be interesting if he can continue and improve on this form and how he does when we go back to back 4 because in that previously he wasn't fitting at LB or CB.

695~~~
What? He has been the best out of all the center backs in possession both in pre season and during the league, whilst Evans has been a walking disaster in possession.

696~~~
Isn't he playing for the England U-21s this week or something? He's looked really good whenever he played, sometimes showing more composure than senior players in that defense.

697~~~
Exactly. I don't see why people feel to need to put him down when  he's hardly put a foot wrong so far.

698~~~
In a few games, yeah. Whereas Evans has looked composed on the ball for years, and Blackett wasn't known for his ability on the ball in the youth teams.

699~~~
He never received his performance thread.

Love how vocal he is back there.

700~~~
Speed to 15 seconds to see how much better Evans is in possession. What a joke. I actually thought he stumped this kind of shit out of his game but no. His mistakes almost cost us goals against Burnley as well where he had a mare. Far better in possession indeed!

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsIFGejLMWg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

701~~~
Tell us how many costly errors Evans has made over the years from mishit passes to own goals? Commentators usually say Evans has a mistake in him waiting to happen

702~~~
That's your argument... really?

Blackett may have adapted to the system quicker than Evans, but Evans has always been known to be good on the ball, a few games in an unfamiliar system don't change that.

703~~~
He's good on the ball, im not denying that, he's also always been prone to high profile errors throughout his entire first team career (even in a 'familiar' system), you know this.

704~~~
Except you are:

I admit he makes the occasional error (though not always in possession), but you seem to be basing his whole distribution game on the basis of a few games, whereas I'm saying that Blackett wasn't known for his distribution before the change in system. When we had Rio and Vida, Evans was seen as the centre back most trustworthy in possession. Also, he's been moved between the centre back and the RCB spot, whereas Blackett has stayed as a LCB.

705~~~
Im not really arguing with you, the poster I responded to said Evans was <i>much better in possession</i> than Blackett. I then reminded him of the errors Evans has made in possession. I don't know what you mean by 'most trustworthy in possession' though. That doesn't even make any sense because Ferdinand was superior to Evans as a ball playing CB.  Evans was switched between those slots  because he's comfortable with both feet.

706~~~
The future rock at the back

707~~~
Have you hit your head recently? Maybe forgotten about the previous 3/4 seasons.

You seem to be basing your "argument" on 3 matches. Bit short-sighted really.

Have you watched him much in the youth teams over the years? Did you see him whilst at Birmingham?

708~~~
I first saw Blackett in preseason in South Africa against Ajax Capetown in 2012. I haven't seen him much in reserves, only saw clips of his time at Rovers, but it hardly matters does it? He's playing well in the first team right now, surprising those who didn't see this coming and currently putting Evans to shame because (Evans) has been shocking since the Liverpool game in preseason. All im saying is 'much better in possession' is harsh considering how well Blackett is stepping up in the first team.

709~~~
Quite frankly his performances at CB for us are an absolute miracle considering his previous career.

He had two games at CB last year, in one he was yanked at half time with his team conceding 4, the other was 5 conceded in 90 minutes I believe.

In the previous season, with the reserves, he had the highest 'goals against average' of anyone played at CB, with 5 going in from 3 starts in the middle (we were a very strong defensive unit that season), including Veseli the full back.

I don't even think Blackett's mom expected this.

He was mostly a full back and I recall him being very weak in the air, lost us a game late on once, and was yanked, after letting his man score twice on long crosses to the far post in the span of 5 minutes and got nowhere near.

He fell out of favor around that time, and I expected to hear we'd sold him after his loan spell didn't yield many starts. 

Glad to be wrong, looks made for a back 3.

710~~~
NOt seen too much of either until this season to be honest....but it seemed to me 6 months or so ago people were saying the opposite. From what I have seen though I have to say Keane looks a million miles from a premiership defender let alone a Utd one.
I dont see much in Blackett either though he hasnt been woeful. But for people sayin ghe is good on the ball.....why is it everytime I end upo screaming at the tv set then as everytime he gets the ball on the left he just plays a long hopeful ball? One of the worst things about our defence so far has been its obvious we dont have a centre back that can actually pass the ball from the back with any confidence at all, hopefully if Rojo or even Blind are playing there this situation improves as any opposition side plutting pressure on high up the pitch will get success against us how we have performed so far

711~~~
I think Keane is Jonny Evans type of player he plays quite similar as well. He needs to get games and make mistakes and learn from that because he is quite error-prone but at times looks really great prospect. Wonder if hes got future here, I would rate him above Blackett before season started but Blackett surprised everyone. I considered him done after his recent loan spells. If we change to back 4 Keane has no chance IMO, Blackett is great in back 3 but in back 4 who knows he can become inferior Rio Ferdinand in the end. We may buy another Center back next year as well - the world class quality we always had in that position. I wouldn't say this hadn't we splashed cash for diMaría and mainly Falcao..

712~~~
Wasnt Evans a really hyped player, much more so than Keane coming through the ranks? Personally I have never seen Evans as anything more than a 4th choice centre back. I really dont get how people have rated him so highly and how people say he is our best centre back. He does a lot of things decently no more but has so many weaknesses in his game for me and he is hardly young now. I certainly dont see Keane forging a career here at all and from what I have seen of Blackett I think he has been overly placed being a young youth player and as you say beign a surprise, hasnt done badly but I dont think he has done well either. The last two decent defenders we bought through are now both at Sunderland. I remembe rbeing very very imrpessed with both in there devut seasons, O'Shea was superb at left back and Wes Brown really looked like a star, still wonder if it wasnt for his early injuries and apparent lack of confidence after a couple of big mistakes when he came back what might have been with him and for me no tone centre back we have that has come through the ranks since is comparable to the "pretty good" defender he ended up becoming. Mu only major worry about the first eleven now is our defence as forgetting Rojo who hasnt played yet, none of them seem to be intelligent defenders or have the ability to play the ball from the back which I think you need with 3 at the back...Jones is the only one who Im confident about this season

713~~~
I'd be surprised if he was still a United player this time next year.

714~~~
Blackett has shown very good passing ability. Its a shame that people only notice the negative things but passing has been one of Blackett's strengths since preseason. His long passing has been more impressive than not, except for the second league game against Sunderland. LVG is probably asking him to do it because he's shown that he's the only CB besides Evans who can find a player at distance.

715~~~
I don't really agree that Evans and Blackett are the best at finding players at a distance. Their success rate at it is far worse than Jones for example who usually hits 4/4 or 4/6 attempts in comparison to Blackett/Evans who more often has 30% accuracy but 15-20 attempts.

So while it is true that Evans and Blackett are the best at <i><b>attempting</b></i> a long ball it doesn't mean that they are the best overall at it. Being the best player in the world at attempting shots means jack shit really.

716~~~
Why is that?

717~~~
Not good enough imho

718~~~
He's doing better than Smalling and Evans at the moment. He was commanding in preseason against Real Madrid and Liverpool when he replaced a disastrous Evans at halftime, even barking orders at his teamates. Very good signs for someone who's only 20, not even the finished article. He has a future here.

719~~~
You've said yourself you've not really seen him in reserves or on loan at Blackpool or Birmingham, so how can you say he has a future? Comparing him to other players on the basis of a few games in a completely new system? He's doing better at the moment, and might suit a 3 at the back system more, but Van Gaal has said he wants a 4-3-3 if possible, and once we go back to 4 at the back I don't think he has the ability to make it here.

720~~~
You're going to say he's not been good enough in the three games you've seen him in? Smalling has made more mistakes. Evans has made more mistakes. Jones maybe less.

721~~~
Saw him in at least 4 occasions for Birmingham last season and was amazed he didn't leave this summer to be honest.  Hope he proves me wrong but I'd be amazed if he's a long time future at Manchester United from what I've seen. For what it's worth I thought he looked out of his depth against burnley.

722~~~
Those who hadn't seen him before and followed his career so far rate him higher than those that did.

I thought he had no chance frankly before this summer and that was the general consensus as well but now i am split on this tbh. Need to see him over more games and in a back 4 especially. He's taken to this new system better than most of our other defenders.

723~~~
I haven't seen him much in reserves, but like I said, those performances don't matter now. What matters is the last and the next game, playing in the first team. Keane might be your choice between the two for example, but if he doesn't show what he's made of in an actual first team game then his excellent reserve performances don't count for much. Blackett is remaining in the team and not going out on loan because LVG clearly has a place for him. He's currently more important to the first team than all other youth defenders. i.e Keane, Thorpe, James

724~~~
Yep I think once we go back to a back four he'll be out the door soon after. As a Manc who has been here since a young'un I hope I'm wrong but I don't see it. Keane will have a better career imo. As for now Tyler is doing good and I'll be right behind him to keep it up.

725~~~
He'll go to the bench along with James once Rojo, Evans and other defenders are back. 

Him being a left footer has worked pretty well for him and no disputing he has taken his chance in this new system mostly but defenders are judged especially over a longer period of time against varied opponents and in varied systems. So his previous performances do indeed matter. Even Titus Bramble has looked great for a period of games.

He's shown enough to not be dismissed outright though. So has Keane through last 2 years. Thorpe has been best of the bunch for the reserves and all underage groups basically and did well in his short injury curtailed loan too but has to show more yet in professional football at some level. It's kind of odd he hasn't gotten chances yet here. Needs a loan.

726~~~
Are you serious? Against Burnley he gave the ball away virtually everytime he recieved it hoofing it up long not sure what to do with it, if he has very good passing ability I must be Mr Maggoo

727~~~
You're obviously only paying attention to the missplaced crosses. Are you telling me you didn't see him execute several good long balls in preseason? It was a feeature of his game against Inter, Liverpool and Valencia. It was his ball that led to Fellaini's winner late against Valencia. People will only see what they want though, and if its all negative you see then im not surprised that you've missed the good things.

728~~~
Oh so you basing this all on pre-season. Lots of players can look fantastic in pre-season, Cleverly has in the past for example. Im basing it on competitive premiership games in which he has recieved the ball and hoofed it forwards in hope giving away possession. And I read people saying he has made less mistakes than Evans for example so far. I refer to my last statement, so would Mr Magoo have made less mistakes than Evans has so far. I hope you are wrong and Blackett proves a success but I dont see it. I often read people saying we under rate our youth and write them off to young when they are young and can make mistakes....I hold the opposite view. Everybody would love to see our own young players come through and be sucessful, but I think many look at them with rose tinted glasses, so many examples of this the last few years. I would lvoe to see a youth player come through with ral genuine quality, I think Welbeck had some admirable qualities but he was severely lackign in quality in some important aspects for me. Here is hoping Wilson can make an impact over the next 2-3 years

729~~~
I don't particularly remember Cleverley looking impressive in preseason save for one impressive half volley goal he scored in the states some years back. What impresses me about Blackett is how he didn't seem overawed by the occassion. He replaced Evans and brought stability to our panicking backline against Liverpool, played well against Inter, Roma and Valencia. Granted, our performances in the league have paled in comparison to the confident team that played well in preseason. The signs with Blackett are good so far with me, and it says something that he's part of the 25 man squad when most people thought he'd be shipped out and others like Keane would make the team this season. We'll just wait and see how Blackett and company (the youth) do when they get their chances this season.

730~~~
I don't think that reaching EVANS level is tha bad. He was the best center back in premiership 2 years ago and the year before he had very strong as well. I agree with you that he is not absolutely top notch but perfectly playable at our level, he was starter ahead of vidic and ferdinand even at the end of their careers/after injuries... I don't think Sheasy was much better talent than Keane, but he was given chance and took it he was also one of fergies favourite players to bring through. Brown was great talent but as you said he struggled with injuries. That is not true that our centrebacks cant play ball. Smalling is not the best even he is quite underrated in it and got better over summer. Evans is the best ball playing centreback in premiership still, no matter two stupid mistakes early in the campaign. I 'm quite worried for him he did well to overcome his lapses of concentration and hopefully he will get his confidence back. He is still our best centreback but he is constantly injured which is his major problem and may end his career here. Blackett show how composed is on the ball he can bring it forward as play some great passes. The reason why he was hoofing the ball forward was simply because the midfield was absolutely dreadfull and noone wanted to take the ball, and I think its got something to do with tactics, when youve got two strikers in a good run up front you can quicken your play sometimes and create chances the other way than passing around and looking for the penetration pass which seems to be pointless at times and we only make stupid mistakes. Keane went on loan, and Rojo is good on the ball as well, apart smalling all our centrebacks seem to have this skill unlike you IMO wrongly stated.. I understand we are all worried about our defense but it is just the defensive play of all our team which struggles, we need legs in midfield good dynamic midfield which cover the spaces and show themselves availible for the pass from the defense. I am absolutely sure that "assist" doesn't mean much at all to van Gaal, he may be disappointed a little because it just did a senior player but it is his tactics and he may be pleased in some way. Once we have our midfield back. Herrera-Blind-Dimaria we will start to have clean sheets trust me, also would like to see shaw and rafael on the sides we will be defensively solid. On tour we were quite fantastic conceded one goal from open paly but the men on the pitch were quite different, the key players. And we need to get confidence back and play as a team once more when we can do it we won't struggle in defense neither in attack which was probably our much bigger problem, creating one goal chance in two matches is just as bad as concede 5 in match IMO.

731~~~
If you think at any point in his career Evans was either the best ball playing centre back or centre back in the premiership then Im sorry you are utterly deluded, this is exactly what I mean about rose tinted glasses regarding our home grown players.

732~~~
I totally agree with you here that he has impressed in not looking overawed playing in the first team all be it pre-season or in the premiership, he has looked calm, very valid points..... but he certainly has been hoofing the ball long far too much when he gets it. Whether that is down to him or the lack of movement and support from the midfielders or simply that teams are pressuring high up the pitch as a tactic feeling our defenders cant pass the ball is another debate all together of course.

733~~~
He was very good at best that season we won the league in 2012/13. He was never anywhere near the discussion of league's best CB, never ever ever.

734~~~
It's a definite exaggeration, but Evans has had some brilliant spells for us, and at 26 is yet to reach his peak. Our best centre half for me, and obviously the most experienced.

We keep talking of our failure to recruit a top class centre half but they're few and far between nowadays. The likes of Kompany, Chiellini, Ramos, Hummels, Boateng, Godin were clearly unattainable so there was only really one that could fall under that bracket - Benatia. Once Bayern came calling we didn't have a chance in our current state. Instead the focus had to be about signing someone a decent age with promise and I think we did that.

Evans, Jones, Rojo, Smalling is a decent set of defenders and Blackett, though very raw, looks to have potential.

735~~~
Yes I can go along with that. While it would have been good to bring in an established top class defender, the opportunity does not seem to be there. We already have young defenders of high promise in Smalling and Jones and have added another in Rojo.

Very unusual for a club like United not to have a defender over 26 and only one over 24, but if they grasp the opportunity and we have the patience it should stand us in good stead. Jones has actually made an encouraging start this season I would say.

Rio is such a great guy, I really can't understand how some United fans don't like him.

738~~~
<a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> 

Promising stuff. Impressed with Rio, class from him.

739~~~
I love Rio, and I really hope Blackett makes it. He looks a rare athlete at center back.

740~~~
That is amazing from Rio and I didn't know he was like that.

741~~~
Blackett > Evans

742~~~
I have to admit, I have never seen a United fan who doesn't like Rio.

743~~~
What do people really think of this guy so far? (Blackett)

744~~~
I think he's done very well considering his age and inexperience and the fact that our whole defence is learning a new system. If he continues to develop, there's no reason why he won't be a first team defender for us for many years to come. Another good one from the academy, and he's in good hands with LVG.

Great to hear Rio keeping in touch as well, United will be crazy not to get him back as a club ambassador once he retires.

745~~~
I think you could have made an absolute killing at the bookies if you'd bet, at the beginning of summer, that Blackett would make the team and Michael Keane wouldn't.

746~~~
Sounds like Blackett has a good head on his shoulders to go with that great athletic ability.

747~~~
Seriously? There are dozens of people here who think he is a cnut.

748~~~
But even still, they still rated him highly as a player.

749~~~
So at this moment who do you rate higher? Who do you honestly think will have a longer career at OT?

750~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2746252/Tyler-Blackett-rising-star-Man-United-defender-perform-initiation-song-tannoy-airplane-38-000-feet.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...tiation-song-tannoy-airplane-38-000-feet.html</a>

Imagine, for a moment, the pressure Tyler Blackett found himself under. To one side, his new manager Louis van Gaal was watching intently. Around him, meanwhile, were seasoned trophy-winning professionals headed by Wayne Rooney, who wondered if he would deliver.

This, for the 20-year-old, was a completely new situation. But it was not on the pitch in front of 75,000 expectant fans at Old Trafford, Blackett’s first big Manchester United examination came 38,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean.

More in article

751~~~
My point was that people don't like him as a person.

752~~~
So that's where all this hoofing comes from, he learned from the best.

753~~~
I guess a little but I think most of that probably just comes from all the 5 stuff. He always comes across as a really good bloke though when you see him on TV.

Been lucky enough to meet him a few times and he always seems very genuine.

754~~~
I echo this sentiment.
Or perhaps that's where his calmness and composure on the ball comes from...

755~~~
I've never rated Keane that highly, I've never thought he'd make it here, though he's a quality player and deserved to get a chance and a summer tour.

I don't really know what to make of Blackett at this point, he only played 5 games at CB in the previous two seasons. This is his first run in a back 3, he's only had 3 games.

His physical development is crucial in all this, his height and physique give him a big advantage to other prospects.

Can he play as well in a back 4? If Keane was left footed would he be preferred?

Blackett used to struggle in the air as a LB, how will he do against a big bully getting fed headers all day?

I'm eager to see more, but I don't feel like we can really know that much yet about his quality. I'm extremely pleasantly surprised so far, I love how vocal he is.

756~~~
Has every right to fight for his place. I do think he is capable of playing at least 10 games this season. 15...well its something that we can discuss. Got his head screwed on and knows the score that he is an understudy.

757~~~
Already made 3 appearances. 15 seems quite probable if we stick to 3 at the back.

758~~~
Great to see he is down to earth and wants to improve. Has looked good for us and the more experience he gains the better. Rojo will be the main left footed CB but can see Blackett getting 10-15 games if he keeps on improving.

759~~~
Actually really impressed with this lad, alot of promise and at a very good age. Hope to see alot more of him.

760~~~
Don't rate him at all as a left back, which is probably why he was such a welcoming surprise when he's played centre back, really impressed with him, quick, can defend and has excellent distribution. As long as we stick with 3 at the back he will get plenty of games.

761~~~
One of him and Rojo is the logical cover for Shaw at left back, wouldn't you say ? I also think that the mental aspect is a major component towards the performances of players and he would have taken a huge lift in confidence after his break so imo the Blackett we saw struggling in the reserves is different from the first team player he now is, don't be shocked if he plays as well or better at left back next time he is fielded there. The things he would have learnt in the last three months and that confidence will have led to him adding new aspects to his game, at least I hope so.

762~~~
Good luck to him today. Yet another start. Talk about losing our identity.

763~~~
Will be a big test for him if we're playing 4 at the back.

764~~~
So glad he got a chance again today. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

765~~~
same here

766~~~
He's been our best CB so far this season. Like him a lot.

767~~~
Granted he hasn't had much to deal with today but I think he has been really good. Great on the ball, and seems this week he's cut out the big diagonals. If his defending continues to develop he could really be our future ball playing defender.

768~~~
Uh oh, jinxed him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Thought he was solid today, one faux pas when he let the ball run across him that time but apart from that he was good, who says we don't give youth a chance!?

770~~~
Looked far happier with 4 at the back

Impressive

771~~~
Impressed with Young Blackett. He played very well with Rojo

772~~~
It helps that he had a mobile midfield in front of him wanting to collect the ball.

He didn't have much to do, so not the best game to judge him, but he did make a mistake that could easily have cost us the clean sheet. But he's young and mistakes like that are going to happen. Overall, I'm very excited by him. Hope it's Evans and not Blackett that loses out when Smalling is back.

773~~~
I like that he isn't afraid to bring the ball out of the defence when he can't see the quick pass. The more experience he gets with every game, the more solid looking he gets. Did look better in a back four compared to a back 3.

774~~~
Kept his passing very safe today. One mistake from RoJo's short pass. Another moment when he perhaps could have done better stopping a cross, otherwise not much to judge him on. Anyway, he looked miles better than Evans.

775~~~
Wasn't tested defensively today. LVG probably favours him because he is so good at bringing the ball out of the defence. Had a bit of a brainfart towards the end when he turned without knowing where the attacker was a got his pocket picked.

776~~~
Hard to judge too much on such a game. But he's looked very confident and strong, mistake aside.

I'm still amazed at his transformation, and it will give hope to all our youth players as he was not highly touted among our reserves.

777~~~
Impressed by him. He's showing a lot of maturity at his age and deserves the games he's played so far. Just a few moments where he needs to concentrate better but i'm getting high hopes for him. There's no reason why he can't be here for a long time. He hasn't looked out of place alongside the seniors.

778~~~
I thought he played really well today, by far our best CB so far this season, who would have thought? Yes he wasn't tested much but you can only play what's in front of you, so kudos to him.

779~~~
Well Evans also had a bad pass which cost RVP his yellow as he had to cover.

Admins should merge the other Blackett thread with this one.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett.393909/page-19#post-16425560">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett.393909/page-19</a>

780~~~
Good performance today by the lad. Had one mistake but at least it wasn't a goal.

Can the admins maybe merge the two threads?

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett-2014-15-performances.396104/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett-2014-15-performances.396104/</a>

781~~~
I don't think that mistake was just on him, since he was obviously showing Rojo to pass it back to de Gea instead of him, and when Rojo passed it to him he probably thought there is nobody there. I am guessing if Rojo was talking English that mistake wouldn't have happened.

782~~~
Couple of sketchy moments but he looks very good. Wry assured and it's nice to see how much confidence they have in him with the ball at his feet. They really trust his distribution.

783~~~
Still young, few hasty moments but actually not hard to be impressed with this kid.

784~~~
I know Evans fluffed up a couple of times, as did De Gea, but that's irrelevant to this thread. We should be judging Blackett based on his own performances, not excusing mistakes just because other players also made mistakes. And I'm not even criticising him that much - I'm genuinely excited by Blackett and hope he really kicks on this year and I think he played well apart from the mistake. That said, he wasn't tested that much, so it's not the best game to pass judgement.

785~~~
Very good today. He is improved today. Better than any other games he played.

786~~~
Yeah he was very good today and if he keeps it up I think by the end of the season he will be a legitimate first team contender. So much for us losing our identity....

787~~~
I'd still bring back Smalling and Jones over him but he's certainly not looking out of place

788~~~
Lets be honest, if Smalling and Jones were fit, he wouldn't be anywhere near the squad. Nevertheless, I felt he had a pretty decent game today. Wasn't troubled defensively enough, although he had a bit of a hairy moment in the second half, but his distribution on the ball was very good, in my opinion.

789~~~
So impressed with this lad looks like he could be a young Ledley King!

790~~~
He's a brilliant passer. Probably our best CB at it.

791~~~
So far, so good.  He looks as nonchalant as Larry White.

792~~~
With all the talk about Welbeck leaving and United losing it's way, I don't like how the media completely ignore this lad. Completed 90 minutes in every PL game so far this season.

793~~~
Looks to handle pressure better than Evans lol.

794~~~
That's certainly true but the reality of Jones and Smalling is that their fitness records holds them back and a manager like LVG who is detached from our past won't afford them too much leeway. If they miss large chunks of this season I won't be surprised if LVG signs another defender, sell of one of them and promote Blackett.

795~~~
I have been really impressed with him through pre-season and in the 4 league games, his distribution is the best of any of our CB's and he's a good athlete that reads the game pretty well. I just wish we had a top experienced CB to play alongside him and help him as a leader.

796~~~
Of course everyone would.  And they should both get straight back in the squad ahead of Blackett as soon as they are fit.   But Blackett has done is taken his opportunity, impressed hius ne manager and fans and not let anybody down.

In doing so, he has secured his future at the club and can now buckle down and work hard to develop and improve himself, safe in the knowledge that many more opportunities will come this season.

Blackett was the only highlight worth remembering from our pre transfer window period.  So at least those 3 games of rubbish were not a complete waste and we launched a new career.

797~~~
Not sure about that. Rojo looks a very good passer.

I like Blackett. Seems to have great raw tools for a very  good ball playing centre back.

798~~~
As I've said before: The encouraging bit is he's got the physical and technical tools to become top notch.

He'll need work on the tactical stuff, but who better to learn from than Van Gaal?

799~~~
Given the change to a back four i wouldn't  have been surprised by him being benched. Van Gal clearly has faith, which is good.

800~~~
Tbf there was no other option was there ?


Thought he was Okay today. Made one big feck up to let Vargas through and was bit passive and positionally missing on few occasions but defender 1 on 1s generally well and good on the ball.

801~~~
Rojo

802~~~
Was needed at LB as Shaw wasn't ready and James was injured.

803~~~
LvG said shaw was fit enough to get some minutes, but not the full 90 didn't he?

804~~~
Yep. Hence, him not starting, i imagine.

805~~~
Impressed. Was our best defender in pre season was just a bit worried of him lacking the experience of the PL but he has settled in nicely, his composure and confidence on the ball for such a young lad is amazing and while he was a LB in his youth days he is better as the left footed defender and one positive thing about Jones/Smalling injuries is he keeps his place and when they come back they are not guaranteed

Also Him Januzaj and Pereira in the squad and Wilson will get a few games this season but we have lost our soul and don't produce young players anymore <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

806~~~
Great to see another good display. He has really taken his chance and making it hard for van Gaal.

807~~~
Having Rojo as the left back really helped him today. An easy outlet and someone providing cover in the air. Considering the 3-5-2 was more of a 5-3-2 with Young rarely making an impact in the wingback role, he looked a lot more comfortable and more assured in his passing.

Generally speaking he's been a bright spark for us this season. Was a bit too eager to play the long ball vs Burnley but played some well thought and incisive passes from the back today. The most impressive thing I find is he's got the balls to shout and yell orders rather than pull faces and make hand gestures. 

We don't produce players though. The Manchester United way was ripped out by Aloysius.

808~~~
Good match, though he had little to do. As others have said, I like his confidence.

809~~~
As great as everything is at the moment with Di Maria, Falcao etc Blackett is what puts the biggest smile on my face. It's a real middle finger to the media and just really pleasing to see. He is going to have tough stages this season, no doubting that but he has paced himself in a great position and has worked his way into van Gaal's plans which will be great for his development.

810~~~
I like him already, he's shown so much willingness to carry the ball out from defence when necessary and not afraid to get stuck in.

811~~~
I would be shocked if he isn't in the starting XI against Leicester

He plays well......he reminds me of Ledley King

812~~~
Although I was half asleep when watching the game therefore probably missing some things but I didn't notice him pumping constant long balls from the back which is encouraging.

813~~~
There was far more space for him to pass through midfield with Blind, Herrera and Di Maria all creating easy angles for the back four.

814~~~
Had a good game overall but he made a few mistakes that could lead to goal, mainly because he didn't communicate well with his teammates but it'll improve over time. He's role model for other youngster; take your chance and don't feck it up, you're playing for Manchester United, boys.

815~~~
'Where's the ball ?!' moment was scary as hell indeed but then in the end he got his game under control.

The kid is a promise and a riddle because you clearly see pace and ambition. He just needs to bulk up to Rojo's level and he'll be flying in Van Gaal's football diary in every future game.

816~~~
Clearly LvG thinks he's our most juiciest juice. He just keeps trusting him to play well and he keeps delivering!

817~~~
Agree 100%.

818~~~
Rated him a few preseasons ago, and glad to see him in the first team at the moment and getting games. Im not sure he'll last there all season, but its good for him. He's done well too. Few mistakes but thats the issue with young players they will makes them. In the bigger games these could be costly so he needs to cut them out or get protected in games which are influential and tight. But he'll be learning massively, hope he takes his chance.

819~~~
His best game for us yesterday. He has the tools to become very good, and any half-decent footballer never had his prospects harmed by being left-footed either I suppose.

820~~~
He's not top class but he's okay in the sense that he doesn't put many a foot wrong (bar that minor feck up towards the end) and any defender that can go a game without being mentioned is probably doing his job correctly. I'm hoping Rojo will be brought into centre back and Shaw given a chance on the left as Shaw is a much more exciting prospect than Blackett. He could genuinely become workd class.

821~~~
Our defence remains our weakest point... a real test with come with the big guns...

822~~~
Blackett is only 20 years old, and he is new at this position ( i think), he could be a very good player if he continues to improve.

823~~~
I don't even know if that was a mistake, it seemed like a little miscommunication with Rojo. It appears that Blackett was pointing towards De Gea and Rojo's pass caught him wrong footed. Anyway, I liked what I saw between those two save for that one moment

824~~~
He looked comfortable in the side thus far, wonder will van Gaal keep him in the side for sterner tests?

825~~~
Imagine being him now.

Local lad playing with some of the best players in the world. 

Living the dream.

826~~~
He's done enough to convince me to get his name on my next kit. He's going to be a future star

827~~~
To be honest, I hadn't seen it as my stream was having an epileptic seizure. Just read about it and thought some might jump on the mistake to say he played bad.

828~~~
Look at the 1st page of this thread which was only back in July will show you how much he has growing as he seems to get better every match. The main thing that impresses me is if he can't see a pass he will come out of defense with the ball which shows great composure and confidence for such a young age. 

The reason he hasn't got much attention before this season is he was a LB when it is obvious he is much better suited for CB. When Smalling comes back and Shaw is in the team it will be interesting to see if he can keep his place. So far this season he has impressed me more than Evans and Smalling. Jones has been our best defender this season but can't stay fit. would like to see him alongside Rojo at CB with Shaw and Rafa LB/RB.

Also funny to listen to the media saying we don't produce players and we lost our soul when he started, Fletch, Januzaj and Pereira was on the bench and Wilson will get a few sub apps.

829~~~
LVG has suggested that he'll be dropped when the injured defenders recover. I think its more of a 'don't you dare think you've made it yet' to keep him grounded. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/louis-van-gaal-hints-tyler-blackett-will-be-dropped-when-defensive-injury-concerns-ease-1465539" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/louis-van-...d-when-defensive-injury-concerns-ease-1465539</a>

830~~~
Yeah, I'd expect as much. He's still extremely young for a centre-back, promising start to the season though.

831~~~
Indeed. He's been our best CB so far this season for me, especially if you also factor in preseason.

832~~~
Blackett is fine for what he is, a young squad player.  Couple nervy moments yesterday where things could have gone to shit.  Doubt we'll be seeing much of him once Smalling, Jones, and Shaw are fit.

833~~~
I think it's been Jones by an absolute mile.

834~~~
Deserves to keep his place.

835~~~
Personally, I feel most secure with Smalling.  Poor on the ball, but less error prone than Evans, Jones, and Blackett.  Hopefully, Rojo can stake his claim to one of the spots.

836~~~
In that case Blackett can relax as I refuse to believe we'll have Jones, Evans and Smalling all fit at the same time for more than 3 games this season!

837~~~
There's Rojo to take into consideration too.

838~~~
Yeah, but seriously I don't want to predict how often even if they are not injured from the beginning we'll see them limping and leaving the field after 30 minutes. I am just glad we do have enough CBs now because they will all be needed!

839~~~
Rojo will play at LB as Shaw will probably be injured too.

840~~~
You're right. The unholy trinity of unreliability. Blackett will be a key player here.

841~~~
Nope that's Jones.

842~~~
Arguable. I think Blackett has been very consistent.

843~~~
Reminds me of Silvestre. solid, quick, gd distributor with his left foot, strong in the tackle, but a little prone to concentration errors every match that can be costly. Still great to see a youth product coming through!

844~~~
Doesn't have to worry even if he gets dropped. He's taken his opportunities well, and I think he's left a very strong impression. Smalling is going to have to play well to get his spot back in the team.

845~~~
True.

No matter what happens, Blackett will give LVG selection headaches when the back four are all fit. He's been better than all of them perhaps save for Jones (who gets injured a lot because of his over aggression, a contrast to Blackett who is very composed for his age)

846~~~
As others have said, definitely our most consistent and reliable looking centre back thus far. Looked good in pre-season too, despite that apparently now being a worthless exercise.

Probably will be dropped when others come back but he's done nothing wrong, aside from be part of a shaky defence (caused by other players.)

One of the positives from this early part of the season, along with Van Gaal's trust in the other young players.

847~~~
I doubt we'll be seeing much of Blackett in the next matches unless either Rojo or Shaw get injured.

848~~~
Yea, once Shaw is back, Blackett will probably go to the bench, at least until someone else is injured (which might not take long).  Unfortunate, since getting more playing time can only help him.

849~~~
Can't wait to see Big Tyler Blackett dominate our defence for years to come <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Genuinely, that's how high I rate him and his potential

850~~~
How can you rate him that highly already? I mean, we've seen so little, and almost all his playing experience in the reserves and on loan was at LB.

He looks a very intriguing player now, but he's barely been tested.

851~~~
I see his signed a deal with Nike - gotta love the profile gained from being at United.

852~~~
How can I?

Simple, because I'm .Rossi dammit!! 

But in all seriousness, he impresses me everytime he's played and, what's more, he keeps improving game by game

853~~~
I wouldn't get carried away.

He has still made a mistake in every single game this season. Lucky not to get punished for it vs QPR.

854~~~
don't get me wrong as an ardent follower of the reserves I'm absolutely blown away by the improvement in Blackett.

the fact I've been keeping tabs on him is probably the reason I'm hesitant to pass judgment yet. I honestly expected to hear we'd sold him and I would have guaranteed we'd sell Blackett before Lawrence at the beginning of the summer, for example.

he had two games at center back last year on his two loans. in the first one they conceded four goals by halftime and he was pulled a the half. I think the other game they conceded 5 and he played 90 minutes.

2 years ago in the reserves of all the players that got time at centre-back he had the worst goals against average. on an excellent defensive team we conceded five goals in his three games at center back that season. we averaged something between point 5 and point 7 goals conceded pet game that season.

so really this is all like a fairytale completely out of the blue.

855~~~
I rate him very highly too. Even if he does not become the CB first choice beast we're hoping him to be, I'm very confident that we'll have a very good squad player.

856~~~
Impressive even more so now...

What makes him stand out for me is his eagerness to study himself and improve his game. He works extremely hard behind the scenes so I've read

857~~~
Did he grow a lot in that time?  Sometimes you'll get kids like that who basically 'still think they're small' and have a bit of trouble adapting to use of their physicality.  Just throwing it out there.

858~~~
He's certainly filled out physically in the last year, he must have been projected to be tall which would explain some of the faith in him, you can't teach size.

He definitely seems more composed, more comfortable which may be because he's stopped growing finally. 

I wondered if the back three didn't suit him best, playing a role on the left somewhere between a true CB and LB. Hard to judge him in a back two based on that QPR game. 

He's only had that one game now in a back two and was barely called into service, aside from his excellent passing ability, which is much improved.

But then he's not made half a dozen bizarre errors like Evans, if he had he may have been benched. He deserves credit, undoubtedly.

859~~~
Just simply from what I've seen of him so far, I haven't really noticed him put a foot wrong. I'm no defensive mastermind though.

I like him and hope he carries on his good form.

860~~~
Nah, he'll get his minutes.  No way Smalling/Jones/Evans will stay fit for more than three games.

861~~~
Hope he doesn't get dropped for Sunday, it should be Evans that gets benched. Blackett has earned his place so far.

862~~~
Doubt you're alone there.  I remember watching him once last year at LB and thinking he looked like a CB pushed out there by virtue(?) of footedness.  Granted it was maybe just me thinking that.  But it's still one person vs. zero.

863~~~
I found it suprising that LVG played Rojo as LB against QPR, especially when Shaw has been declared fit. Rojo and Di Maria linked up very well down the left. Perhaps LVG wants to see more of that, which would mean Shaw is in for a fight.

He has made less costly mistakes than Evans who looks like a calamity waiting to happen.

864~~~
LVG said that Shaw was only fit to play some minutes pre game presser so that's why he probably didn't risk his hamstring.

I think he comes back next game when fit and should add a different dimension to the team too.

Smalling will be back too so will be interesting what we see in the middle and also do we stick with a 4 or 3 even.

865~~~
One of the most important parts of a successful defensive unit, is consistency. You saw it when we had Rio and Vida at the back, week in, week out. It's that level of understanding the back line need, that make them unlike any other area on the field. I know Van Gaal doesn't care much for reputations but I can't imagine he is going to not play Shaw once he's completely fit. He also, quite obviously, is a massive fan of Rojo. Apparently he was "enchanted" by him when studying DVD's of argentina. We also saw how quickly Rafael was restored to the starting line up once recovered, so far to say he sees him as first choice right back. With all that said, I'd say Rafael, Rojo and Shaw will make up 3 out of any back 4. The question is, who will be the partner. Right now I'd put my money on Jones. Rafael, Jones, Rojo, Shaw has absolutely bags of talent and potential in it. The two biggest worries are injuries (Rafael and Jones), and the lack of an experienced leader. I think Jones is a natural leader and will come into that role in time, and Rojo has played in a world cup final. But here are two center backs who are 21 and 25 respectively. It's very young.

Could see a signing coming here next summer. And if that happens, one of Smalling or Evans is moving on I'd wager.

Hard to see where Blackett fits in yet. He's looked really assured and composed so far but it's so early. Expect him to go through a difficult stage and make some mistakes. That will be the true test.

866~~~
Funny how everyone is pointing out the mistakes made by Tyler considering he is made the least out of all our centre backs..
He is showing a lot of progression and can only get better.. Seems to me a few people are bitter coz they expected the other young CBs to show more.. Get over it, he won't be the last player to be awful at youth level and flourish in the first team.. The fact that LvG likes his defenders to be involved build up play might be the reason he is getting to impress and the other aspects will develop with experience..
Everyone seems to be making reference to his spells out on loan but does any of the managers he is played under set their defenders like Van Gaal..or this, how many Liberos are there in the championship.

867~~~
It's an interesting predicament van Gaal has with Blackett. He's probably been our best defender this season, yet Shaw and Rojo have yet to receive their chance really.

868~~~
Indeed, I never watched him prior to the preseason tour but I heard his last two loan moves were a disaster to say the least.

869~~~
I agree with you there, amazing how no one mentions that he has made by far the least mistakes among our defenders. And given his age, how people even get to focus on those mistakes is beyond me. We should give the kid a chance to grow, he has shown enough positives for us to focus on for days.

870~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOBDvnnTVHg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

871~~~
He has adapted well to the first team and one thing that pleases me immensely is the fact that he is now considered a genuine first team player and is one we can count on as an option in a very injury prone group. There will be bumpy periods for him along the way and he has not 'made it' yet but it's been a promising start and it, LVG coming in and handing him and others their competitive debuts will motivate other young players and before we know it we could be having three or four from the current U21 crop in contention for starts. For now Blackett joins an impressive list of kids handed their debuts by Van Gaal, Xavi, Seedorf, Muller, Blackett.....

872~~~
Regardless of how well he progresses for us, this lad has a very bright future as he has all the attributes needed for a top CB at a top club.

873~~~
Seems like he's got a very good attitude. Really hope he does well here and becomes a first team regular during the Van Gaal era.

874~~~
Good to hear another first team player with a Mancunian accent so soon after Welbeck's departure.

875~~~
I hadn't seen him at youth level so I can only go on the ten games I've seen of him  over pre-season and the start of this season. I really like his athletic ability, pace and the fact he is very comfortable bringing the ball out. I know he is left footed but could he play as the right CB?

876~~~
He could, right footed CB's play on the left side all the time but when a left footer plays on the right, it creates an issue. Obvously being a left footer, he would have played his career on the left side and would naturally feel more comfortable and I'm sure van Gaal would see it that way but if need be, he could play on the right side of the pair, it would be a last resort though.

877~~~
If Smalling is fit to start and if we continue to play the 4-4-2 diamond, I don't think Blackett will start. But with Smalling and Shaw pretty fit this week, we could go back to playing 3-5-2 since LVG said last week we only play the 4-4-2 diamond since we didn't have enough defenders.

878~~~
I didn't hear it, but someone else posted that what he actually said was that he couldn't have played 352 even if he had wanted to, because of a lack of defenders.

Not that he wanted to, necessarily.

879~~~
BlackenBauer

880~~~
That's racist.

881~~~
Block it

882~~~
Why not? If anyone should get dropped at the moment it should be Evans. Only person who should take Blackett's place is Rojo, so Shaw can get a game.

883~~~
I think after last week's success, LVG will not change things yet. the diamond worked really well for us, so I think giving it another go is the best option.

884~~~
Then he said this week that we have to look at the quality of the players we now have, meaning that he now feels we have a good enough squad to stand toe to toe with pretty much anyone. I don't see the merit of dropping an extra attacker for a defender, myself.

885~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2042328/not-the-usual-carrington-graduatetyler-blackett-relies-on-perseverance-for-his-place-in-the-manchester-united-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchest...e-for-his-place-in-the-manchester-united-team</a>

Good to hear he despises Liverpool also!

886~~~
Has he? How many/What mistakes have Smalling and Jones made?

887~~~
He will eventually be better than any of Evans, Smalling or Jones I'm increasingly confident of that. In his first team games to date he has proven at the very least to be their equal and yes he has made the odd mistake but he will do at his age. His composure on the ball is remarkable considering not only his inexperience but also the fact that the entire team is in transition and he's been playing alongside players who are hardly commanding presences themselves. I'd keep him in for now no matter who's fit but LVG did say that Tyler had been "lucky" to get so many games due to injuries so that suggests he'll bench him soon. If he does it won't be for long as it's just a matter of time before Jones and Smalling are injured again and Evans is brainfarting goals away.

888~~~
Gotcha, I was just wondering how comfortable he was on the right as it might be easier for him to get games once everyone is fit if he can play as either given it seems we will be going back to a back 4.

889~~~
Jones made a stupid challenge against Burnley which gifted them a free-kick near the edge of the box, from which they hit the bar. Jones and Smalling were both asleep in the early stages of Swansea's 2nd goal. That's off the top of my head. While Blackett has made errors which have been pointed out in this thread, on an (clear) errors per match basis, his figures aren't so different from the other defenders. Not sure I'd go so far as to say he's made fewer per 90 mins. Indeed I would rate him behind both Jones and Smalling so far.

890~~~
In 4 years you will repeat this post with the name Blackett in place of Evans and some youngster in place of Blackett.

891~~~
If you're trying to hynoptise me it won't work

892~~~
I dont get the hype hes hype hes getting so far this season. Im obviously all for giving the young players a chance but people saying hes been our best defender are going overboard. He's made at least one blatant error in every game which havent been punished and apart from actually getting on the ball and passing it he's looked to stay out of the game as much as possible and play as a spare man which doesnt really work when youre playing as a centre half. Im not saying he doesnt deserve to get more chances but I cant see him playing a huge amount with a 4 man defence if we can ever get our other centre halves fit although thats not particularly likely.

893~~~
Smalling's back from the injury but that doesn't necessary means Blackett shall be dropped.

He's actually slowly getting close to throwing Smalling out of LVG's equation.

894~~~
How I see it. 

Looks a prospect but nothing more, being ridiculously overhyped atm.

895~~~
He's been very composed and assured which for a 20 year-old with no previous first team experience, is impressive. No, he hasn't.

So, apart from looking to get on the ball and pass it assuringly he's looked to stay out of the game...great logic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you people!

He's played well and as long as he continues to do so he deserves to play.

Please tell me what's wrong with those stats...

896~~~
It's strange, but I didn't think that he looked that good in the youth teams and was almost sure that he would be sold/released.

First team football really has been the making of him though. 

Hopefully he can really push on and become a United regular for years to come.

897~~~
Me too, i always thought that he was to heavy for a left back, it took him to much time to turn himself and track back, i thought that he could be a CB but wasn't convinced by that prospect.

898~~~
Yes he actually has if you watched games from a defensive point of view he has been caught out of position or had a miscommunication with somebody in every game so far which as a centre half you cant afford to do. 
I said hes looked good on the ball but when the other team has the ball he has looked to stay out of the game and play as a spare man as much as possible hes not marking men tightly, looking to challenge for many headers or looking to make tackles or blocks. The logic is hardly that difficult to comprehend and as for your little "you people" comment I've probably seen considerably more of the lad playing than almost anyone on this forum and am a huge advocate of giving youth a chance so thats a bit of an unnecessary and pointless comment.
I never said there was anything wrong with the stats but they do illustrate the points I've made above considering hes played 4 games and has only had 1 more defensive involvement than Smalling who played a game and a half and has less than both Jones and Evans who have both played less games and his passing accuracy which has been his stand out attribute so far is actually worse than everyone apart from Evans who is having one of the worst spells of form of his career.

899~~~
Be harsh not to start him today after his impressive displays of late, but now that Shaw's back, I can see him going in at left back, with Rojo partnering Evans.

900~~~
Yeah, it would be really harsh on him. As much as I want to see Shaw play, I'd be a bit disappointed if it was instead of Blackett.

901~~~
There are going to be times when Blackett will be left out, that's normal for a young player. We can't expect him to start 30 games this season.

902~~~
He has done well for us but a tough away game might be better left to the more senior players. Evans rebounded pretty well against QPR. I think he will hold his place alongside Rojo.

903~~~
He has been decent but nothing more. But considering his age and experience playing with the big boys, that is quite impressive. Shaw started off by being "decent" at first and we all know how much he developed last year so Blackett certainly has good potential. He is good on the ball and looks very composed which are two great aspects to have at such an age.

904~~~
I think he is being a tad over rated in here.

For example, (maybe I'm just seeing things) I'm sure Evans was being criticised for his performance in the Burnley game whilst there wasn't much talk on Blackett. Fact is, Blackett made quite a few questionable decisions on the ball as well. Defensively Jones was the best, but Burnley hardly threatened anyway.

It's nice to see an academy player in the first team, I just think perhaps we are getting a bit carried away. Same thing happened with James after the Galaxy game and it was evident in the Valencia game he wasn't quite good enough going forwards and didn't really fit in.

905~~~
Huge difference between playing fairly well in a pre-season friendly, and playing every minute of the first for epl games of a season, and playing quite well in most of them.

906~~~
I know. I'm just saying people had James down as a back up wing back, and then the Valencia game came and it was clear he wasn't ready/good enough.

Not saying Blackett isn't good enough, just that we shouldn't get carried away, especially when he has made some bad decisions. He's young, I get it, it doesn't mean we should just forget about it though.

907~~~
I would encourage everyone to remember that even Vidic struggled in his first 6 months playing in the EPL. 

I definitely think Jones has been our best defender, and I expect Rojo to nail down the other place quick enough.

But it should be remembered that Blackett is extremely inexperienced at CB. And he's now had only 1 game with us in a back 4. 

Pre-season is completely meaningless, no need to think much about his time there, beside noting he didn't fall to pieces.

He's very, very raw. He played 5 official games in the previous two seasons at CB, on loan and for the reserves.

Hopefully he can be brought through in a few years with luck.

908~~~
I don't think anyone is to be honest.

The mistakes that he has made have come through naivety, it has been his only achilles heel, but its also the thing that is probably easiest to coach out of him.

909~~~
Starts again. Deserved IMO.

910~~~
I'm so glad that LVG put his faith on this guy again. Even though there is Shaw. Glad that we keep our tradition to have player from our academic graduates in our starting eleven. 

I know that Smalling won't start since he just came back from injury.

911~~~
I admire LVG's faith and trust but Blackett needs to take these chances to his heart. So far he deserve them.

912~~~
Fantastic stuff by Blackett, full credit to him.

913~~~
Seems like a good kid, glad he's keeping his place in the side.. should be left out once he has a genuinely bad game.

914~~~
Reminds me of a young Ledley king great prospect!

915~~~
Great shout. He really does seem like Ledley King. Composure, strength and maturity.

916~~~
Seems like a nice bloke and fairly grounded. But I'm not so sure about his actual ability. He looks ok so far but some on here are overrating him big time.

917~~~
Blackett can also score a cracker goal. Well in academy, he took long shot free kick. I don't know if he can still do it.

918~~~
How?

919~~~
Great to see him starting again , despite what some would have liked.

920~~~
He looks like him but that's about it I'm guessing.

921~~~
Glad to see he is starting again as he's done really well so far.

922~~~
He's impressed with his composure, touch and short passing. Not really been tested all that much defensively but made errors when he has been- as well as making some general rookie errors.

Still, he's a talented lad and will learn a lot from his time in the first 11. Hopefully he'll kick on defensively over the next year or so.

923~~~
Aye. I see absolutely no similarities myself.

924~~~
Just his build and style the way he reads the game his pace and obviously left sided too. I'm not saying he will be as good as but hopefully he will be.

925~~~
Very, very good so far. Looking like a leader.

926~~~
very impressive by him, looks the best defender at the club atm

927~~~
Good prospect but needs better quality next to him.....

928~~~
He's done well.

Having to cover for Rojo too much though and he himself goes passive at times too much.

929~~~
I'd see him and Jones as our best CB pairing now.

930~~~
The CB pair now would be my choice for the foreseeable future. He has been quality today bar some slight slips against Vardy, but he is a tricky player to mark.

931~~~
He's been outstanding imo. Fair play to the lad.

932~~~
Really impressed me again today. Reads the game very well and his pace is great as well as that tackle at the end of it. Had a couple of little errors but they will go with the more experience he gains.

933~~~
His most impressive defensive performance so far this season (including pre-season). He's been very good.

934~~~
All he has to do is stay fit. If he does that then Chris,Johnny,Phil and Marcos can scrap over the other CB spot.

935~~~
Has been caught out of position a few times, but his improvement over just a few games has been fantastic to see and very encouraging for the future.

936~~~
Hes done well with his pace and physicality but his positioning at times has been piss poor. That effects the defence as a whole

937~~~
At the minute this lad is ahead of Evans and Smalling in the pecking order for me. Been really impressed, especially considering his age and how good he could become.

938~~~
Looking our only solid centre back again today. Some great tackles.

939~~~
A disaster. We will do nothing this season with him anywhere near the side.

940~~~
Fantastic second half today...

941~~~
Yeah I don't rate him at all.

942~~~
He's tough but has terrible positioning

943~~~
Just like I said in the matchday thread, he is arguably the worst defender who has played for United.

944~~~
Thought the first half was his best performance for us at the back. But defending really isn't his thing.

945~~~
-3 on my FF, little bastard. Actually had a really decent first-half.

946~~~
shows his youth with that bad and reckless challenge

947~~~
I mean he's still young but I'm struggling to rate this guy. He looks decent, but that's not enough for this level.

948~~~
His positioning for their 4th was woeful... completely fecked up our end to the match. Was looking fantastic for most of the match, but those two incidents were shocking.

949~~~
getting called dogshit in the matchday thread by the usual morons. The hate they have is scary.

950~~~
watch out for some kneejerk posts in here

951~~~
Astonished. Watch him closely, he has no idea where his runners are and his positioning has been dreadful. 31st minute was a big worry. Ulloa was running off the back of him and he made no effort to look for him...

Right, I had the above penned in at half time but left it because I couldn't be arsed with the ratty alerts coming my way. Honestly, he is very poor positionally and very, very timid in the air. Not good enough.

952~~~
Getting bossed off Ritchie fecking De Laet. What a complete joke.

953~~~
In fairness to the lad, he's only playing because all of our other defenders are made of glass. He's nowhere near ready for the first team, and he wouldn't be playing in it if Evans, Jones and Smalling could actually play more than two games in a row without breaking down for six weeks.

954~~~
Tune really changed in here, didn't it?

955~~~
He is 20 years old playing in a defence that is changing from week to week. Naivety is to be expected.

956~~~
It doesn't help that he's playing in a pretty poor defence. Smalling has regressed something terrible.

957~~~
As poor as the other defenders. He's still very young and inexperienced, he's done well considering all things.

958~~~
You had that penned in the first half did you? Yeah right, Feck off you with your kneejerk bullshit. 

Kagawa's gone to Dortmund.

959~~~
Losing concentrate after the third goal. But that's ok. He will learn from that, his 1st half was great.

960~~~
I agree, and I think he has the physical talents and ability to do the job. Just lacking in experience, awareness, decision making, and support from teammates. Those things will all develop with time.

961~~~
Got to laugh at some peoples reaction, one minute he's a beast, next minutes he's a complete liability. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

962~~~
Needed to be taken out of the firing line, red card or no.

963~~~
It was saved in from half time. I have zero reason to tell lies on an internet forum.

What has Kagawa got to do with this? I've commented on that player about once since last season. Stop acting like a child.

Follow my posts in the match thread. I caned him at half time because he was a liability in a positional sense. Evidence is all there.

964~~~
He actually had a decent enough first half but collapsed in emphatic fashion in the second. Much like the whole team.

965~~~
Yeah, because a normal person saves up posts for later <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Kneejerk bullshit as predicted.

966~~~
There's always a few mistake of him on every other game. Just reminds me of our other CB.

967~~~
Made some rash decisions after the 3rd goal. Mainly because he was put into situations he shouldn't have been in.

968~~~
They save automatically you sad prick.

969~~~
Our best defender today but he definitely got tired as the match went on.

970~~~
He's by far the least experienced man in our defence. He was responsible for 2 of Leicester's goals but I feel that more blame should be attributed to his more experienced defensive partners who are absolutely shocking.

971~~~
Guys calm it, insults will get you nowhere.

972~~~
He's only in the team because Jones is injured, Smalling is awful on the ball and Rojo is still settling in. He's definitely not a long-term solution.

973~~~
Very very poor second half. Totally collapsed.

974~~~
I hope he doesn't let the red card affect him too much. Did well today, considering his lack of experience.

975~~~
Its just unbelievable that he plays at United, it isnt a hard task nowadays to sign at United huh? He is just average, good on the ball, extremely poor at defending.

976~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

I just hope people stop with that blind bias for "youth players". You don't say "he's done well" about anybody who is the single most important reason why we lost a game we were winning comfortably.

Also, we're not in the position to give exceptions "considering all things", we need a team ready to compete now. When one player (any player) is wasting the effort of the rest of the team then he shouldn't have a place in the team, <i>regardless </i>all things.

977~~~
Genuinely feel sorry for him, had to do all the work in the first half and he was doing playing very good untill that fecking idiotic sliding tackle when everybody lost their shit.

978~~~
He'd be helped if he didn't have to partner with two useless mongs in Evans and Smalling.

979~~~
Tough game for him, showed how inexperienced he is but wasn't helped by the absolute nightmare Rojo was having next to him on that left side.

980~~~
There is literally no point engaging <a class="username" data-user="20558, @charleysurf" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20558/">@charleysurf</a> in debate. His one purpose on this forum is to jump from thread to thread belligerently insulting people with patronising, vacuous one-liners, before moving on and doing it again.

981~~~
Had a pretty solid first half, but he lost the plot in the second.  Hopefully we will learn from this.  Lots of potential.

982~~~
To be fair De Shit was given licence to do anything he wanted by Clattenburg. I bet he wouldn't have given him red even if he turned out in the second half with a shot gun

983~~~
His tagline says it all.

984~~~
Did I mention he's extremely raw?

He'll be back, but tons for him to learn. Like never get out-shoved, he's too nice.

985~~~
He appears to be a sad creature alright.

986~~~
Pfft, if calling Blackett shit is a mainstream opinion on here then I'll happily play the black sheep. Saving up posts about how crap you think a player is until he screws up because you are scared to say it when he's doing well . fecking hell! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I am must chuckling at the mentality that would do that! 
Sums up several bandwagonesque posters on here.

987~~~
he was brilliant in the first half and until that penalty he wasn't that bad. He is 20 and will get better but we need to bring in quality centreback and possibly some capable defensive midfielder. Blind should shield the defense and was invisible all game, didn't help the defense a bit. He is experience player and should do better. Rojo was much worse than Blackett

988~~~
This. It's baffling that he didn't get sent off.

989~~~
Don't kill him - he's done alright so far, bound to happen this sort of game eventually. Hopefully he'll bounce back from this experience.

990~~~
Just that inexperience again and no disputing that pen. However, still put in a great performance.

991~~~
Can't believe how fickle some are. If you read this thread back from the start of a game it shows how some base their opinions on minute by minute action.

He was our best defender until he made that tackle. The whole team seemed to lose their head after Clattenburg fecked us over, so it's ridiculous to single out Blackett. 

Like Vidic never made a silly tackle that led to him getting sent off, even during his best form. It doesn't suddenly change how you view the player and his performances in general, and in general he did very well.

992~~~
He was never at any point today brilliant. take the blinkers off

993~~~
Probably out best defender in the first half. Shat his pants like everyone else in the second half. Feel sorry for him but at least his red means we will surely see Shaw now.

994~~~
One thing I'm consistent with is giving my opinions on anything irrespective of what people think. I critcised Blackett at half time in the match thread. But as it was half time I left the thread and thought I'd wait as there was another half to go.

As you type comments on here the draft saves often. You probably wouldn't know that because all of yours posts are smart arse one liners that usually have nothing to do with football. You offer the grand sum of feck all.

995~~~
As painful as watching that 5th goal was, today can be a lesson for him. He has great potential and has done well in this stint in the team. Time to get out of the spotlight for a bit, reflect on the good and the bad. Learn from it all and develop.

996~~~
Reasonably good first half. Nightmare 2nd half. 4th goal he made a rather bizarre choice; would have been better off staying with his original man and hoping Blind could get could back. 5th goal I thought he got pushed out of the way on the initial challenge then clearly an error to give away the penalty and get sent off. Hope he can learn from his mistakes.

997~~~
you already admitted you 'saved' your thoughts on Blacketts shitness because you were scared of the replies as he was playing well!  You were waiting until a screw up to get ranting.

998~~~
As I pointed out last night hes a centre half who only wants to be involved in the game when we have the ball. Refuses to mark men tightly and tries to tell others to mark the man instead of doing it himself, is timid in the air and gets caught out of position at least a couple of times a game. He wants to play as a spare man all the time which you can get away with to a degree in a 5 man defence but cant afford to do in a 4 man defence.

999~~~
I chose to leave it for the time being and was going to mention it after the match. The second half was about to start and I couldn't be arsed to sit on the Caf while the game was on. I don't think commenting in these threads while a game is on is all that productive either.

1000~~~
He's playing wonderful stuff but he will be targeted by bigger teams in bigger games and he just is not ready for this level yet. Smalling I don't think will ever be good enough.

1001~~~
Mistakes like that were always going to happen, and happens to defenders far more experienced than Blackett.

Second half saw the entire team drop in performance, unfair to single him out. Blackett had a great first half, including an enormous tackle (on Vardy?). As surprising as his emergence into the first team has been, he's been decent. Adapted well and provided cover while others have been out injured. Physically, the boy is a tank. Be patient because there will probably be more of this in the future. It's the price of trusting youngsters. Here's hoping he'll learn fast because I've really taken a liking to him

1002~~~
Would have been so much better off playing next to Vidic. Sadly, his debut season coincides with what is our worse defence in the history of the club. Obviously lots of injuries have derailed any semblance of continuity and chemistry, but this lot are just very young and very naïve.

1003~~~
I'm leaving this one, going nowhere . But you said you did not post your thoughts on how awful Blacket is because you didn't want to face the replies. You said that. 
If you had faith in your opinions about how bad a player is then you'd post them even when the player is doing well.

1004~~~
Smalling has had a lot of good matches (when he had a run on CB), but its his first match from injury, cant expect too much.

1005~~~
I didn't think the player was doing well, I said as much in the match day thread before the first half even finished. 

Look, just do one. The fact you mentioned Kagawa in your second comment, and feck knows why considering I discuss him no more than any other, shows you've got an axe to grind me with for whatever reason. So either put me on ignore or piss off and you'll be a lot happier.

1006~~~
Had a good game but is still inexperienced so will take him a season or 2 to get to his potential. I am more excited about how he turns out then any other youth player coming through including Januzaj...

1007~~~
He's had a tough lesson today. The pace and power of the Premier League has finally hit him. But we shouldn't forget how good he's been at the start of the season. He was deservedly in our team on merit and didn't look out of place. That naivety with some of his defending will be coached out of his game in time but unfortunately that red card means he's isn't likely to get back in the team for a while. Shaw being available means we must surely shuffle our pack again. He's got to be given the LB spot while Rojo goes inside. The lack of experience at the back is hurting us. We don't have a partnership like Rio-Vidic yet that you would build your defence from. Everyone we play there just seems to be filling in until they get injured and replaced.

Blackett has shown enough potential to make me think he'll stick around. For now he needs to get stronger and smarter with his positioning.

1008~~~
His positioning is quite poor, even in the first half he was getting pulled into areas he shouldn't of been meaning Blind was sometimes the last defender with Evans.
I cannot comprehend what he was doing for their 4th goal, it was schoolboy defending and the penalty as well showed his lack of experience.

Hopefully he can learn from this but I have my doubts of whether he will make it here and it's not just based on this game. If he improves and learn from his mistakes then he can become a good back-up player.

1009~~~
His positioning for the 4th goal was laughably bad.

1010~~~
Said it a week ago, but Blackett makes me nervous.  Then again, most of our center backs seem error-prone bar Smalling.  Blackett should be on the bench with Rojo sliding over to his best position.  How long will it take for Shaw to get fit??

1011~~~
His reading off the game and positioning isn't great.

That's been his problem when left exposed and still is.

1012~~~
This is spot on.

1013~~~
I didn't want to really judge him based on the first few games as we controlled those games and our defence wasn't put under much pressure. Today you can also say its harsh to judge him as we just collapsed collectively, but I'm not convinced by him. He's decent on the ball but defensively I'm not convinced he's any good actually or even ready for premier league football.

1014~~~
Aye, he can be as composed on the ball as he wants but as a CB that isn't going to get you that far. Off the ball he lacks the awareness to track runners, where to position himself and as you say shies away from marking a man. I've said before and I'll say again that I'd have Thorpe or Keane over him anyday and both will have better careers than Blackett.

Looking through the thread you can see that almost all of the praise he gets is for his composure on the ball but hardly anything for his actual defensive work which for a CB has to be the main part of the job.

1015~~~
He'll be out of the team due to suspension anyway, but if not I wouldn't have called for him to be dropped. He capitulated after the penalty, like the rest of the team did, but until then I thought he was doing a good job covering for Rojo's completely inexistent defending. When players were waltzing past the latter, Blackett read the play and cut out the danger quite a few times. Even the fourth and fifth goals, the decision making from Tyler was very bad but you can see he was completely abandoned by his full back.

1016~~~
Yeah he started well but he was always going to make some big errors as the game went on.

1017~~~
Yeah as someone who has played a lot at centre half myself and has done a lot of defensive coaching with teams I want My defenders to be defensively solid, aware and brave first and foremost and then things like composure on the ball are obviously plus points and things which can be improved upon but if a player doesn't have those natural defensive instincts and alertness to danger they are very difficult things to teach.

1018~~~
It's not saying a lot, but Tyler Blackett has probably been one of our better defenders this season. Still, credit where it's due, that still takes some doing for a youngster who has only just broken into the side.

Thought the red card today was harsh, a yellow would have sufficed in those circumstances but Clattenburg had lost the plot by that point. Shame Blackett will now miss a few games, as he really needs the experience. You can see his youth and inexperience working against him at times, his decision making needs work, but there are definitely positives here. Hope he grows into a big, strong centre back for us.

1019~~~
He is growing, but for a big lad he seems weak in the air. Seems very comfortable when the ball is on the ground, but seems to want to let the ball drop to often when it is in the air. He also doesn't win that many headers.

1020~~~
He looks a prospect, but he got caught under the ball too many times.  Looks fast and strong, and will learn by his mistakes.

1021~~~
Something that will come with time I feel. Still very inexperienced at senior football, let alone PL. He has the ability and talent to be very good and with our defenders and their injury troubles, he will get many more opportunities.

1022~~~
Yup, if he doesn't go slightly to the ball then he could track their forward and Blind could cover, no idea what he was doing for the fourth.

1023~~~
I feel sorry for him. He's a young lad, possibly even younger than his age in terms of his experience at a high level and, for all his promise, it's unfair to expect him to thrive in a poor defence thst changes every week. He'll come out the far side of this stronger but right now he's taking the brunt of a lot of shite being caused by more senior players.

1024~~~
Had a great first half, mainly covering for that pathetic excuse of a defender Evans. Then just collapsed in the second.

All in all, from what we've seen, I don't see anything that suggests he's anywhere near the level we need, or ever will be.

1025~~~
Doesn't look very good. Not that any of his defensive partners look better, mind.

1026~~~
How is Evans pathetic? The only pathetic part about him is his proneness to injuries. He had a great first half because he had feck all to do really. He was standard and had an ok game up to a point. He was at fault for two goals.

1027~~~
Evans was terrible today. At fault for the first goal, and constantly bailed out by Blackett.

1028~~~
Rafa has to take some responsibility for that goal. He should have gotten in a challenge there.

1029~~~
Absolutely, but the centre back should have taken charge of that situation. Not just stood there and watch the ball fly over his head, straight to the big lump of a striker that he is supposed to be marking.

1030~~~
Blackett has done better this season than glass Evans and Jones, and has been our only constant at the back. Yes he showed naivety and impetuousness in getting sent off but the same can also be said of Rafael and Rojo, who were also both rubbish.

It seems like if we'd signed Blackett from a European team, his performance would've been excused.

He'll learn from this and LVG obviously sees something in him to select him ahead of Evans, and playing him ahead of Rojo at CB.

1031~~~
No I think Evans is cleared of any responsibility in that situation. Rafa is tracking Ulloa so it is his man. Evans takes up his position and the ball was hit with such venom it would be hard for any man to make any ground to get his head on it.

1032~~~
It was poor positioning from Evans. He shouldnt leave their only striker on his own to be marked by our relatively small, and weak in the air, right back. It was a mismatch that was obviously going to cost us.

1033~~~
Rojo left all the defending to Blackett, and he coped for a long time. It all went to shit when the rest of the team did.

1034~~~
I'm going to watch the game now but I caught their 4th goal. His defending was amateurish, I couldn't believe he got attracted to the ball. I don't think you can even put that down to inexperience. If I was playing centre back and did that when I was playing Sunday league football the manager and all my players would have slaughtered me. If that was a defender for any other team, I'd be laughing.

1035~~~
So is he actually a centre back then? At no point watching him in pre-season or this season have I thought -

'This guy is potentially a class CB because he is/has...

a) great in the air
b) a great tackler
c) a great man marker
d) great defensive positioning
e) a great reader/organizer'

Apart from maybe the first 45 minutes today where he put in a few pretty good challenges.

It's more like, he's class because he's tall, fairly quick and doesn't shit himself when he gets the ball at his feet. A bit like a midfielder playing in defence.

1036~~~
He's supposed to be learning and being guided by the likes of Smalling/Evans/Jones, not having to literally lead the defence. How anyone can single him out for criticism is beyond me.

1037~~~
He is a bit overrated and it caught up today. He is a solid talent but lets see how far he will go

1038~~~
Blackett's over promoted - should be nowhere near the side, but it's a reflection of how poor our defensive options are. He's going to be another Welbeck- held up as better than he actually is, just because he's a local lad.

1039~~~
My thoughts exactly. The poor lad should be eased into the squad given the occasional game but not having to carry our central defense despite showing promise he isn't there yet. A young lad like him is always going to have some difficulties at the highest level every now and then that's part of the development process.

1040~~~
Um, look Inter, we know we technically sold Vidic to you but we'd really like to just borrow him back, just for a week, maybe two, tops.

1041~~~
Fecking Moyes.

1042~~~
I swear Blackett looked much more assured than any of our other defenders.

1043~~~
Just made a horrible mistake to gift Palermo a goal...

1044~~~
This guy has become quite over rated because he looks calm on the ball. Against actual runs and movement he is getting shown up.

1045~~~
Clearly playing shit to get away again

1046~~~
Welbeck was a fantastic talent and has developed into a very good player. Blackett is not a patch on him, based on what we've seen so far. I get the feeling that he's playing out of coincidence mostly.

1047~~~
Same as Evans, who is suddenly a top centre half just because he is comfortable on the ball. I much rather have Smalling (not good today), but normally very solid defensively.

1048~~~
Blackett is nowhere near Welbeck in terms of talent.

1049~~~
Today his inexperience was shown up. He will be a better player after this experience. Today our defensive shape as a team was crap.

1050~~~
I do not agree with that. Evans has actually defended well since the MK Dons game. If anything, his defensive game is being under rated because of his recent sloppy passing. What makes it even more strange is that Blackett was equally as bad as Evans with his distribution in the Burnley game. He doesn't get half the criticism it seems.

Him being 'calm' on the ball doesn't excuse some of his rubbish long balls and the fact that he is dragged around so easily. It's naive. Smalling, Jones and Evans are all better.

1051~~~
He shouldn't be playing for the first team. Thorpe is a better cb and even he should only get minutes here and there. It's understandable that Van Gaal has selected him though considering the injuries.

1052~~~
The criticism of Blackett in here is getting ludicrous. Did you truly expect a player with no senior level experiencdm to slot in like a 26 year old Rio Ferdinand or Vidic, with a changing defence shape, a revolving set of partners alongside him due to injuries and a still gelling midfield unit infront of him? Some folks in here need to get a grip on reality.

1053~~~
No, but we didnt expect him to be a complete moron with terrible positioning.

1054~~~
This was a game too far for him, away against a good pressing team. To be fair he kept it together until late in the game. Expect him to out of the team for more than one game unless we have another injury crisis.

1055~~~
Just seen the game again on MOTD, and my God, what was he doing for the last two goals? Absolute comical defending.

Someone said earlier that he's made mistakes every game and got away with it, well today he didn't.

1056~~~
Complete moron?
Wov. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
Some of you are taking it too far esp. since he's a young player. 

Today he showed his inexperience and had bad mistakes. But in the games he played he showed promise and was generally good. 

He wont start the next one and we'll see how much he'll play from now on.

1057~~~
Seriously just watch the defending for the Vardy goal, its absolutely terrible. It'd be hilarious to watch at lower league level.

1058~~~
Obviously over-hyped yesterday, obviously now this is the back lash.

As always with redcafe the truth is in the extremes.

1059~~~
If we are judging our CB's then we judge them the same. If we can point out the flaws in Evans, Jones and Smalling the we should do the same for Blackett. The other three misplace a pass and they get killed for it.

1060~~~
So about 5 less mistakes than Blackett?

1061~~~
Blackett shouldn't be in the team. Vidic wouldn't have helped either.

1062~~~
He shouldn't be in the team. Not ready yet and may never be. The fact he is is a damning indictment of our summer's transfer activity.

1063~~~
Surely, for this season at least, Vidic would be a better option. I'd guess we'd have held them to less than 5 with Vidic for Blackett.

1064~~~
Yeah, I guess you're right if you put it like that.

1065~~~
He shouldn't be playing in 2 at the back system. For some reason he adapted pretty well for 3 at the back fair play and overachieved.

Seriously up until the start of the season him starting at CB for the U21s or the U19s used to have me worried for precisely the reasons JB and LimerickCityKid outlined here -

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett.393909/page-24#post-16501598">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/tyler-blackett.393909/page-24#post-16501598</a>


Still tbf to him he was good first half. Went to shit when he was more exposed in the 2nd as his positional and player awareness is poor and he is too passive.

1066~~~
In all honestly, its a bit ridiculous that he's anywhere near a United first team. He's almost got there by default.

1067~~~
He did get there by default, with LVG insisting on a left footed CB for the back 3. He stayed there on merit/performances. But obviously he needs to keep them up and not dip like he is doing or he'll lose that place, then who knows what happens to him

1068~~~
His promotion to the first team is pretty similiar to Januzaj last season, 

We used Januzaj alot due to our team being so devoid of creativity and attacking impetuous we had to use an 18 year old for inspiration

This season the over reliance on Blackett is a mixture of other defenders not being much better along with injuries

1069~~~
What did you want him to do in that situation?

Rojo sold him out today for me.

1070~~~
This - who exactly was Jonny marking and why not Ulloa?

1071~~~
He had two options. Close down the player in possession as quickly as possible and try and somehow cut out the through ball (admittedly the chances of that working would have been slim) or drop off so that Vardy didn't have a free run in on goal.

Instead he did neither, and just sort of floated around in no mans land, making the pass over to Vardy as simple as you like.

1072~~~
Exactly.

Blackett had an awesome game up till their 3rd goal, but after that .... was all down hill.

1073~~~
He was never getting to the player in possession, so if he had gone to him the pass would have been on anyway. If He drops off and marks the space/Vardy and De Laet runs and picks another pass/scores. Again people would kill him for not doing anything to stop De Laet. 

It was just an awful situation to be in as a CB. Ideally, Smalling should have been there with him to cover the pass whilst he engages De Laet. Rojo had gone, Smalling was god knows where. There was way too much space.

1074~~~
He should be making these mistakes in the Championship/League one Football for Manchester United's B team instead of the pressure cooker of the EPL. The fa wonders why England don't product enough good young English players and yet are unable or unwilling to create the right conditions for youngsters such as Blackett to grow. In my opinion, unless you are a phenom such as Adnan most players struggle to take the leap from the reserves straight to the 1st team. Blackett would benefit greatly from a loan, however, due to the injury problems of Smalling, Jonees, and Evans unfortunately that is unlikely to happen.

1075~~~
I don't want to go back and find the posts, but from the few youth games I saw and from the pre-season, particularly that first half against Roma when Destro's movement completely flummoxed him, it was clear he was lacking in awareness or whatever you prefer to call it. 

Long term, it's tough to say, but there was really nothing to suggest he was going to magically perform consistently as a CB, unless the people who watch more youth football think differently.

If we don't have insane injuries at CB, it would be nice to see him go on loan in January and start 20 championship games, maybe impress a Prem team enough to take him on loan next year, and then he'll be 22 and have around 60-80 pro games under his belt and we can see where we're at.

1076~~~
Please no just no! This isnt a match day thread so such arse should never be posted. You think this is the worst defence ever, you have no idea.....

1077~~~
He looked like a player who hasn't come through a successful loan spell in a League 1/Championship side and who is still very new to his position.  If he wasn't left footed, he would be playing at that level and making these mistakes in an environment which suits his inexperience.  The glaring positional errors (esp. the 5th goal) would have been ironed out of his game with regular time in the lower leagues if he was good enough to make it at a higher level.  Hopefully, we can bring in a talented CB in January and let him go back to learning his trade at a lower level and hopefully realizing his potential in the long-term.

1078~~~
This is why people need to manage their expectation when it comes to youth player.Positioning (as well as concentration) has always been his weaknesses since his youth team day.If a youth player was promoted you have to be ready for him to have errors in his game which will either be ironed out eventually or never.Especially if you play in a defensive line and you don't have any reliable seniors beside then it will be even worse.Not really any rocket science here.

Treating youth players the same way as their seniors is just simple-minded and will always lead to the unnecessary negativity route.Suggesting he needs to go on loan after one poor match is nothing else but knee-jerking, and I'm sure I saw it happened for every bloody young defender.People just love to find scapegoats (Rooney is the best example).

1079~~~
Not sure why people are criticising him a lot for his game today. From what I've read, Rojo played poorly and this would have left Blackett in poor situations as LB should be the CB's last defence from the left, which sounds like it wasn't happening. 

Again, I haven't seen the game yet but sounds like Blackett had a good first half. Sad to see that he got a red. Anyone have a gif of the red card?

1080~~~
In hindsight, both of the options you mentioned, bring into play the possibility that Blind or Smalling might recover sufficiently to impact the play. Had he held a high-line then Vardy would have been forced to check his run and even if on-side when the pass came, Smalling might have got back in time. Similarly, if Blackett had simply covered Vardy, De Laet would be forced to act (shoot/cross) before Blind gets back. Either option would have reduced the chances of Leicester scoring, though still a great opportunity for them.

Worth noting that Blind and Smalling should have sensed the danger far earlier so we would have had protection despite Rojo and Mata getting us into trouble.

1081~~~
Sorry Douglas, you were wrong. 42 is not the answer.

1082~~~
He's been our best CB despite his inexperience and his young age. Shows how desperate we are at the back.

1083~~~
How the feck does Blackett have 3% of the CAF's Man of the Match vote putting him as the 3rd highest vote getter?  Gotta be opposition fans, no?  Thought he was quite poor and not sure how anyone but di Maria wins it tbh.

1084~~~
I thought first half he was our best defender, he was making loads of interceptions and tackles. Of course though when the team shape went and the tempo increased, he seemed to get nervous and suffered with the pace. 

It'll be a lesson for him that's for sure. Letting a player bump him with the ball mid-flight won't happen again hopefully. He need's to be tougher than that as a CB.

1085~~~
He was pretty good up untill that 4-3 goal, so probably untill 3-3 when everything went to shambles anyway.

Bar that hoofball naturally, I think that 'spending hours with Rio after training' didn't do him any good. Hope he's not as deluded.

1086~~~
He is quite prone to error to be honest. It seem he made some notable mistake everytime I watched him play, fortunately our opponents aren't that strong so most of the time it didn't look that bad.

1087~~~
I could be well off the mark. I know he is young. But he is not ready and would not make any other defence in the league right now. Championship at best. Will he be good enough? I am not sure. He is very strong but his reading of the game is poor, and gets caught out of position. In my opinion, he seems quite slow too. I think we need to shield him and give him more games in the reserves.

1088~~~
How was he at fault for our first goal and when was he bailed out by Blackett?

1089~~~
I agree with people here saying that if there are two defenders in the box - CB and a RB - and just one Leicester's striker, he should've been Evans' man, not Rafaels, given the height, physicality and fact that Evans would've been doing feck all anyway.

1090~~~
Yep, I’m not saying Evans is completely blame free however he clearly isn’t solely responsible for the goal, in fact, he was hardly to blame at all yet many are pointing the blame straight at him.
I’ve no idea what Rojo was doing, Blackett followed the ball instead of getting into a stronger position and Rafael let his man go wherever he wanted, the only thing you can blame Evans for is his positional awareness and even that can be questioned.

I’m getting sick of defending Evans on here, I don’t believe he is going to be the solution to our defence, not because he isn’t good enough but because of his injuries. We looked a lot stronger at the back yesterday when he was on the pitch, but God forbid that might be because of Evans.

1091~~~
How come Ulloa is pronounced Uzhoa? It's just weird.

Bit of a clanger from Tyler in that game - hardly unexpected for a young defender though.

1092~~~
Completely different. Januzaj may have been used a lot due to crap players, but his play was at a much higher level than Blackett's. He was also promoted for being outstanding for the u21s, while Blackett wasn't close to that at youth level.

1093~~~
Yeah Januzaj was played because his talent made it hard not to pick him. Blackett is playing because we have failed to recruit better defenders and because LVG has developed a soft spot for him, which I predict will evaporate, like the player's confidence, as it emerges that he is not really ready yet.

1094~~~
He's clearly not ready and is only playing due to injuries, he might make the bench if we ever have a fully fit defence <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> but he most certainley wont make the starting 11, not yet anyway.

1095~~~
I suspect this horror show might have done a thing or two to his confidence levels, yeah.

1096~~~
Thorpe is more ready. Keane was more ready. Playing Blackett is actually pretty odd.

1097~~~
Thorpe is nowhere near ready. Keane made far more mistakes that Blackett has (and yet people are ready to get rid of Blackett).
He suits 3 CBs which we can't play now, because our other defenders are made of glass. What is odd is you thinking it is odd.
Who plays there with Smalling is not fit, and Jones and even Carrick are injured?
He is a LB just starting in the Prem at CB. Cut him some slack.
Rojo was far worse, and Blind provided no protection at all.

1098~~~
It's not a question of me cutting him slack. It's just a strange selection. He looked a bit out of his depth for Birmingham (contrast with Michael Keane who has mostly impressed on loan) and although decent on the deck, has not shown either for the reserves or for anyone else that he is strong enough at the major stuff a CB has to do. 

You can debate the case with Thorpe, but certainly he has looked more impressive in the reserves. And Keane may have taken a step back recently but has quite a few good games under his belt and is clearly stronger.

1099~~~
I don't get the "strange selection" bit.
If you know an alternative then please share it.
If you mean who he kept out of Tyler or Keane, Keane was very poor for LVG, and that is why he made that choice.
Thorpe looking decent for the reserves is a whole different ball game to first team football (as Tyler is showing, after excelling against better opposition on tour.)
I personally think Tyler has a lot to learn (maybe too much) to play in a CB pair ( Left in a 3 suits him better, as it ask him almost to be FB, which is his position. Not that I think he is great at FB)
The defence is on the bones of its arse at the moment, otherwise, I'm sure LVG would love to take him out of the cauldron we are in, with an under-performing team of new faces.
Ideally, you blood youngsters in a settled side, when the result either doesn't matter, or the game is safe. We don't have that luxury.

1100~~~
You can only beat what is in front of you.Blackett has impressed on tour but Thorpe wasn't even given a chance to go.

Don't think we're in the position to judge between Blackett and Thorpe without watching them in training with the seniors but if you ever watched Thorpe in the U21s you just can't help but feel he should be given a chance.Writing off his excellence and attributes he shown there are just pure ignorance.Vermijl starting in front of him vs. MK Dons is a shocking decision.

1101~~~
Writing him off??
Are you fecking simple? (How's that for ignorance?)

1102~~~
According to all brum supporters I talked to Thorpe was also very impressive from them despite his short time there due to the injury while Blackett was one of the worst players they'd ever seen. Obviously you can't always go off that as Leicester fans called Lingard shite but it does show that Thorpe has impressed in first team football while at the same club as Blackett who didn't.

1103~~~
Let's be honest, it took many by surprise when he was picked. Although he's done ok, it's clear he has a lot to learn and is far from being 1st choice.

1104~~~
Its not that strange, until this summer it never looked like Blackett would ever even make his debut here at United, the expectations some had of him, turned into reality (not having the right level (yet))

1105~~~
True but then you have to question LVG's choice to play Blackett at CB and Rojo at LB.

1106~~~
If a central defender can't play in a 2, then he's not a central defender.

We could have that luxury if we had recruited in the positions we really needed to.

1107~~~
Agreed, though I suspect he sees the same as me, in that Blackett doesn't cover enough ground for a FB.
In hindsight, I wish he had done that, as then we would have nailed Rojo to his defensive duties, and Blackett would have been less likely than Rojo to be in the Leicester half all the time.

1108~~~
Agreed.
What do you want me to do about it?

1109~~~
He's nowhere near ready to start for us. He has been excellent but will cost us goals. Shaw should be playing as he has tons of PL experience

1110~~~
Forgive me for only just remembering, but Blind is a LB.
LVG could've put him in there and brought Fletcher on. 
Maybe that is what he'll do vs West Ham, and put Rojo at CB with Smalling.

Defenders are very thin on the ground.

1111~~~
For the Leicester attack when he got nudged in the back and then proceeded to give away a penalty, what should he have done in that situation? Was it a foul, because Vardy wasn't getting the ball without knocking him out the way, or was it Blackett's fault for not positioning himself/ his weight correctly. If he has one foot forward and the other back, positioning his weight slightly on his back foot, Vardy won't knock him forwards, surely and he would have just headed it away?

I'm not a defender and haven't really thought about it before, but I'd have thought this would prevent the situation from occurring, correct me if I'm wrong! If so, then it's just a learning step I think.

1112~~~
He did well until the game changed. Atmosphere and the rush of panic that swept the team cost him. Needed a calm head to keep his confidence up and to calm him down aswell as Rafa and Rojo but Rooney decided to pump them up/panic them. Great leadership!

1113~~~
Think he was our best defender yesterday. Think once the game changed he was still unlucky and made one rash decision that ended in the sending off. Rooney bollocking him for his own mistake didn't help but hopefully he can reclaim a place in the side after his suspension.

1114~~~
Rafael Smalling Rojo Shaw - Will be the back 4 versus West Ham baring any injury midweek.

1115~~~
Probably. If not, questions will be asked about Shaw's role at the club. I was guessing he wasn't deemed fit enough on Sunday.

1116~~~
Van Gaal certainly seemed to inply that after the game on Sunday.

1117~~~
Saw that red card tackle coming a mile off.  But, he really didnt deserve to be in that situation, I thought he was the best defender for us (which aint saying much).  

He's got promise.  But we should not be depending on him like we are.

1118~~~
I am sure LvG would sit him down by now and told him what he needs to do in the same situation the next time.  I see something special in this boy that can make him one hell of a defender in years to come.

1119~~~
Funny how one terrible game changes people's opinion. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://38.media.tumblr.com/6c62329dc29be781c6ff8777b68c6e6b/tumblr_nc99bgBhxl1qaorn7o1_400.gif" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/6c62329dc29be781c6ff8777b68c6e6b/tumblr_nc99bgBhxl1qaorn7o1_400.gif"/>  how is this his fault?

1120~~~
Seeing that gif make his fault even obvious, for let go a player he marked on the center, to chase an opponent miles away from goal.

1121~~~
The GIF is a terrible angle to judge it. <a class="externalLink" href="http://mediacrush.net/-jjGUUCZtgQo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here's a better version</a>. It seems like Smalling is pushed to far forward but Blackett makes a complete mess of defending the 1vs2 or even 2vs2 with Blind closeby.

This
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/34KE6Ys.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/34KE6Ys.png"/>

turns into the following as Blackett moves towards the ball
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/sPyr5ZI.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/sPyr5ZI.png"/>

1122~~~
Show lack of experience and not intelligent enough to make a quick judgement.
He ran towards de Laet and I'm sure he knew there is a man (Vardy) behind him. I think he expected Smalling or Rooney to drop back quickly to cover him to stop Vardy. But that is a wrong judgement because Smalling and Rooney are way too far. What he should do is stick with Vardy and wait until Smalling and Rooney got closer, once they closed enough, make a sign or told them to mark him then he can run towards de Laet if he hasn't launch the ball.

It is understandable for inexperience defender. And the blame is obviously on Rojo and Mata. Blackett isn't the main culprit for that goal.

I think the reason why Smalling went pushed forward because we were trying to score goal but in my opinion he shouldn't since the score was still 3-3. Again this is show bad communication between our paired centre backs. I wonder why the manager or coaches didn't warn him not to push forward too far.

1123~~~
When you have no  top level experience, are put under that much pressure due to their entire team losing its defensive shape and positional discipline and like every other United player on the pitch, you have lost your head and are no longer playing with your brains: That is what happens! Anyone who thinks otherwise has never played football in their lives.

1124~~~
Two wrongs don't make a right.

1125~~~
Just re-watched the first half and his subsequent performance in the second half looks even worse. Very big disparity between his performances in either half and he was actually one of our best players in the first, especially as he was constantly covering for Rojo and atoning for his errors.

1126~~~
He was very good until the team panicked at 3-3. At that point onwards he was the worst for a 15 min stretch along with Rojo (who was regularly to high). The indecision he showed for the goal when Mata lost the ball shouldn't happen even at U21 level.

1127~~~
Indeed. That was a terrible error, but I suppose judgement and concentration errors are the main weaknesses Blackett has to eradicate from his game, so hopefully he is capable of learning from that mistake. However, his second half performance reflects unfairly on how he's performed in our defence over the course of the season, especially at a time when the whole defence has capitulated and he is having to assume more authority and responsibility at just 20 years old.

I'm undecided whether he can have a future here as of yet, but providing he performs well in training and to the level van Gaal requires, he should definitely still remain around the matchday squad and possibly even first team in spite of our returning defenders.

1128~~~
I do think he might have a future as a squad player at minimum. He had the physique for it at least! The next year will show if he has the ability.

1129~~~
I blamed the entire outfield 10 for those 3 goals. We lost both our shape and our positional discipline without the ball.

1130~~~
He just doesn't have the experience, he has no CB habits. Two years of playing CB on loan and he might be ready, imo.

1131~~~
Thing with Blackett is that his lack of awareness and positional intelligence has been apparent from his youth days and worrying aspect when he played for the U21s so it's nothing new that he makes wrong decisions when left exposed in a back 4 even more in a stretched game.

He always wants to be the spare man too much too instead of the guy making the interception/tackle or marking his man tightly and commanding his area. Was the case in the first game when he lost Sigurdsson for both goals in different phases of the Swansea game as well. Th

He has a chance if he sorts this out and becomes more aware and aggressive in quick transitions and even aerially, otherwise won't be surprised if he's loaned mid seas and we don't see him play for United again.

1132~~~
He has all the qualities to become an accomplished centreback, He's strong, quick and mobile. The thing is he is still only a boy learning his trade. He has done reasonably well over the start of the season for a player that nobody would have picked to be near the first team at the end of last season.

Yeah he has made the odd mistake over the first five games in the league but he's shown plenty of promise. I just hope he is given another chance in the coming months to prove his worth.

1133~~~
I agree with all of that, well said.

1134~~~
I can see what you mean.....perhaps this kind of weakness was the catalyst for the 3-5-2 at the start of the season?

maybe we will see it again.

1135~~~
He's made some big errors but overall he's impressed me, he has stood up to the challenge when others may have shrunk away.
Still won't get a start when all our defenders are fit though.

1136~~~
Sorry but this is a very, very stupid post.

1137~~~
Was it as stupid as Blackett? If not, it was worth it.

1138~~~
What the actual feck is up with people saying they re-watch our games just to see how an individual player played? Too much time on hands?

1139~~~
Blackett is the future.

1140~~~
Pointing out big positional errors in a CB is different to pointing out that they misplaced a pass though.

1141~~~
Not his fault entirely but he is definitely responsible for charging out wide as a centerback.  He was placed in an incredibly difficult situation and unfortunately made the wrong judgment.  The real question is whether he knew Vardy was behind him?  If yes, he definitely should have stuck with him instead of expecting Smalling to make it back.  Its still his fault for not seeing Smalling's position (lack of awareness).

With that said, he is still a youngster with no PL experience so it's not fair to crucify him for making mistakes.  That stupid pass pissed me off more than anything when I watched the game.

1142~~~
Agreed.

1143~~~
Fletcher should not be anywhere near the first team.

1144~~~
Vidic in his prime could not have handled that any better than Blackett did.  Bottom line is that he was put into an impossible situation on a counterattack.

1145~~~
Impossible situation? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Come on. I was screaming (not literally) at the tv when I saw him charging out towards to De Laet with Vardy in the middle. He made it as easy as possible for them to get a clear chance on goal. It was a woeful piece of defending.

1146~~~
When needs must. 
Of course we never had any injured defenders...

1147~~~
It was poor, but he definitely has been put into a difficult situation there and he's made a split second choice that was the wrong one. Hardly surprising given his inexperience. A good defender could have snuffed out the danger, but there are other players who are just as much at fault as he is for that goal. Even if he does the right thing and tracks the runner, he's leaving the man out wide with bags of space to run into and we're still in a poor position to stop the goal

1148~~~
Look at the first still and see Smalling's postion in relation to Rooney. Then watch the gif.
Either Smalling didn't bust a gut, or Rooney is faster than people on here reckon.

1149~~~
It wasn't impossible..he just didn't have the experience (or common sense depending on how harsh you judge it) to deal with it. Stck with the man closest to goal - simple as that. Stick with him until you get help but don't leave him and get caught in no man's land... this is something he should know from U18 level.

Stay with Vardy and give others time to reach the winger..even if they don't there is less space for Vardy to receive any passes if he stays close to cut the angle from the wing... force the winger to shoot from a bad angle if anything, but don't give vardy a 1-on-1 with the keeper with acres to run into. If he stays it's 2 on 2 at the worst.. or someone reaches back to take on the winger.

Anyway he hopefully has learned from it.

1150~~~
Yep. The position he took up in the middle of nowhere was even worse than if he committed to de Laet. Obviously, dropping off and tracking the runner was the correct thing to do, but it's the indecision from Blackett that is the main issue.

1151~~~
Couldn't handle it better than Blackett did? You couldn't handle it any worse than Blackett did. He effectively did absolutely nothing other than keep Vardy onside. It is common sense to stick the man in the middle or if you are going to go for the man with the ball out wide at least go for him and not just drift slightly to the side and do nothing. The ball was even loose at the start and if committed himself he likely could have slid in and got a block.

1152~~~
Which one are you talking about?

1153~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2769068/How-training-days-turned-Tyler-Blackett-great-hope-Manchester-United.html?ito=social-facebook" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...pe-Manchester-United.html?ito=social-facebook</a>

1154~~~
Very good to read indeed.

1155~~~
There was speculation about him being part of the England squad. Literally the last thing he needs at present.

1156~~~
The 4th goal with the gifs and video of posted on the page before. Is that not the one everyone is talking about?

1157~~~
For that one, I think Vardy was on his own half of the pitch before Rojo mistake so the onside thing won't matter. 

After the error from Mata and Rojo and when de Laet got the ball, Vardy watched his run to make sure he stayed onside.

1158~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/FemaleFrayedDarklingbeetle.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/FemaleFrayedDarklingbeetle.gif"/> 

I'm still undecided on Blackett, but you really have to admire this block which hasn't been talked about much. (Brilliant from De Gea, of course.)

1159~~~
Yes. A super block. To date his actual defensive play has been relatively weak for a United player but he was fast to react in that situation. Still needs to do a lot of work on some of the defensive basics like winning headers and positioning. Interesting that LVG did a direct swap for Shaw rather than shift Rojo across; personally I thought that was wise in the circumstances.

I like Blackett but he is incredibly raw. Given LVG appears to want to play one right-footed central defender and one left-footer, you'd imagine Blackett will get more starts at some stage of the season, unless Evans is considered both right and left footed.

1160~~~
Top block.

1161~~~
at the end of the action his end are in the air like -what a shame it didn't end up in the back of the net". Great block and some nice tidy and composed paly as LB. Looked unfazed as always

1162~~~
There are few defenders with a bigger potential than Blackett - and so far he has managed to (almost) eradicate his one major flaw - his concentration. I will be the first to admit that I could pull my hair out when I was watching Blackett in the reserves and the academy because of his one major lapse in concentration each game. Some games he could let a high ball simply go past him and totally miss that there was a striker through on goal etc....

But he deserves credit for what he has done so far - and that block today was important

1163~~~
Impressed with his short cameo today. Believe he can fill in the LB position anytime he is asked to. Good on the ball and decent composure overall, this lad.

1164~~~
Happier with him at left full, thought some of his decision making at cb was poor, have to say I was impressed with him when he came on, not defensively, his distribution was excellent, composed and confident at a time when the team were a bit on edge, fair play to him especially after the red incident that might have knocked his confidence, speaks a lot about his character.

1165~~~
Did an important job when he came on.

1166~~~
What a block...

1167~~~
Didn't even see the block until the replay, was brilliant! My Liverpool fan mate, reckons he's been our worst defender (evans though...). I dunno what planet he lives on, he said De Gea's saves against madrid were routine...maybe for a world class goalkeeper. Then again he had Reina week in week out at the time.

1168~~~
That block was brilliant but he went asleep for the Osman chance before somewhat which De Gea saved.

1169~~~
At the time I thought he was probably at fault for the Osman chance but watching it in slow motion just now, it is clearly Rojo who is at fault and Blackett does a decent job of closing the space; might have been different had he not had a wide player to mark.

1170~~~
Has a big change to make our squad for the future well done lad.

1171~~~
Do not trust him at CB. Hopefully Rojo stays fit and we only have to use Blackett as LB cover.

1172~~~
That block was Vidic-esque <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1173~~~
Not really, Vidic the lunatic would have thrown his head towards the ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1174~~~
In all the brilliance in the last few minuted by Dave, Blacketts block got kind of loss. Was brilliant by Tyler and so important.

1175~~~
The block was absolutely top drawer but him looking unfazed doesn't mean he played well otherwise. He always looks that way.

He made a couple of errors that could have cost us dearly. One of which, a misplaced pass to no one was inexcusable at the time. I don't mean to be harsh but we shouldn't ignore the obvious flaws in his game either.

1176~~~
Fellani's ball watching is amazing

1177~~~
Big future for Blackett at United. The future CB pairing could be him and McNair

1178~~~
I thought he was awful at LB. Martinez noticed it and directed his subs to target Blackett.

Much better at LCB in my opinion

1179~~~
I'm sorry to say, but I don't believe he has what it takes to be a regular at United. His strengths seems to be his passing which is alright and he does seem quick and athletic, but the actual defending part of his job description has consistently looked suspect in my opinion. Hope I'm wrong though.

1180~~~
And McNair?

1181~~~
Looks better in the two games I've seen him play. I've been very impressed with how composed he has looked. Still early days though.

1182~~~
I don't understand that to be honest. Blackett has done well too. He wasn't criticised when we kept two clean sheets with him playing , then Leicester happens and he's not a United defender all of a sudden. McNair has done well, just as well as Blackett has this season especially under the circumstances.

1183~~~
Sure, McNair has had less time to show his faults and Blackett got a pretty rough ride in the Leicester game, when he got thrown into the deep end. But I've felt since the US tour in the summer that Blackett showed weakness when it comes to spatial awareness and marking ability. 
He's a talented football player no doubt, but to make it at United even at an O'Shea/Phil Neville level you've got to be an extraordinary talent and I'm not sure he's got that to be honest. That goes for McNair as well obviously, but I've been more impressed with his performances so far, even if I am sceptical of his ability to nail down a spot here as well. Seen too many hopefuls fail during the last 20 years. 

Obviously I want both of them to make it though, so I hope I am wrong.

1184~~~
Blackett has looked very good defensively but subject to errors of judgment.

1185~~~
I think the same.

His sudden jump into the first team squad had more to do with the fact he was left footed and we were playing in a 3 back formation.

1186~~~
I thought this thread had been bumped with news of an injury <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1187~~~
You mean, he has exactly that what Badstuber had when van Gaal promoted him... <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1188~~~
Blackett has had mistakes in him since pre season. He had mistakes in him for the youth teams. McNair has been more solid at both levels.

1189~~~
Ive seen this from a lot of posters, can't seem to get over the 'shock' that Blackett has made the first team when it looked unlikely.  In the meantime, McNair has done well in two games and is rightfully getting praise, I just wonder how quick he'll be harshly criticized when he has a bad game.

1190~~~
Blackett has played a lot more than McNair for the first team so of course he would make more mistakes.Give the lad time.

1191~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Fanzone/News-And-Blogs/2014/Oct/Tyler-Blackett-living-his-dream-at-United.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/Fanzone/Ne...yler-Blackett-living-his-dream-at-United.aspx</a>

<b>Tyler Blackett's living the dream</b>

<i>ManUtd.com's Mark Froggatt recently met Tyler Blackett to discuss childhood ambitions, back-up plans and the road to first-team stardom... </i>

<b>Raised in the shadow of Old Trafford, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Tyler-Blackett.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tyler Blackett</a> has always dreamed of playing for Manchester United and continuing the club’s proud history of producing home-grown talent.</b>

The hulking 20-year-old lives in Hulme, which is just a short walk away from the Theatre of Dreams and a five-minute drive from the city centre. It is also where his Reds-supporting family brought up a boy whose only ambition was to play professional football for the club he first joined at the age of eight.

Despite pursuing an education at St Anthony’s School in Urmston before graduating from Ashton Sixth Form College, all while ascending the many ranks of United’s own Academy, Blackett was impressively single-minded when confronted by the careers officer in his teenage years.

“My whole childhood revolved around the game and I always wanted to play professionally,” he explained during an interview for Sunday’s edition of <b><i>United Review</i></b>, the club’s official matchday programme. “I never had a back-up plan for what I might do if things didn’t work out at United. It was always about playing football for me and I was determined to make it happen. It was basically football or nothing, which might have been risky but that was how I saw it. Thankfully, it seems to be working out for me.”

With six first-team appearances now under his belt – five from the start, one as a sub against Everton - it does appear to be “working out” for the physically impressive Mancunian, who is clearly flourishing under the tutelage of famed trustee of youth Louis van Gaal. But what makes Blackett’s rise even more remarkable is its correlation with a summer of change that brought in six expensive new signings to join the Dutchman’s Reds revolution.

When I pointed this out, Tyler revealed a mind-set that has fueled his rise through the ranks. “It makes me feel proud. When you see the club spending money in the transfer window, some players might look at that and think they won’t get their chance to impress but I’ve never felt like that. This club always give young players a chance and I’m hoping to take advantage of that.”

The only blot on Blackett’s fledgling career is the red card that followed his admittedly ill-judged sliding challenge on Jamie Vardy during last month’s 5-3 defeat to Leicester. Although the experience could have shattered his confidence, he simply described it as “heightening” and vowed not to choose the same option following a reaffirming chat with van Gaal. “He just explained there were other options I could have chosen, rather than bringing the player down. It is definitely something I have learned from and will remember.”

Tyler's suspension allowed fellow centre-backs Marcos Rojo and Paddy McNair to shine in his absence, providing plenty of competition for places ahead of United's next match against West Brom. Until then, the muscular Mancunian will take stock at the Aon Training Complex as his team-mates fly around the world on international duty. The domestic pause will also provide time to reset the season aims that were set in July, which included “breaking into the first-team squad” and “letting everyone know that I can play”. Three months later and it is safe to say he has already achieved both.

As Blackett is all too aware, the next stage in his development requires him to cement a place in the manager's plans for the future. While the task at hand is not easy, the single-minded boy from Hulme is determined to meet the challenge head-on. After all, he has a lifelong dream to fulfill. 

“My family have always been really supportive of me and my friends have also been delighted to see me play for the first team," he said. "They just want me to keep doing well for myself, which is what I am trying to do. Hopefully, I can make everyone proud.”

1192~~~
Sounds like a good kid with a good head.  Certainly has what it takes to be a top defender.

1193~~~

1194~~~
I've seen this as well. It's almost like they don't want Blackett to do well just so they could be proven right about him.

He did very well until the Leicester game and unlike McNair had to deal with the unfamiliar 3-5-2.

1195~~~
I'm not just comparing their first team appearances. You as well as most people who watch the youth teams know Blackett has mistakes in him.

No I really don't care about being proven right. He just fills me with less confidence than other youth players.

1196~~~
Awwww

1197~~~
The position will be his if he just stays fit.

1198~~~
People saying things like he's good defensively but just prone to errors of judgement is just as bad. Neither make any sense.

Equally I feel people are guilty of wanting him to do well as he's a local lad etc. which is fine but at the same time plainly ignoring the errors. I read people here saying he was great when he came on at the weekend. His block was fantastic but He made two error's that could have been fatal. One was yet again not tracking a runner. The second was his almost trademark chipped sand wedge of a pass straight to a West Ham player. We were under extreme pressure at that stage and He had other options at the time.

McNair imo already looks a more natural defender with better instincts (which is ironic given where he started his career)

1199~~~
I know but I don't want what he has done in the past to affect my judgement on him.Players do improve with the right coaching/environment and we've seen a lot of positive things from Blackett compared to himself just one year ago.

1200~~~
You can say the same about Michael Keane when it comes to mistakes, but many thought he'd make the jump to the first team ahead of the other youth players, with Thorpe right behind.

1201~~~
Did he not get called up to one of the youth England sides?

1202~~~
He was called up to the U-21 in August

1203~~~

1204~~~
Didn't see him taking many free kicks since moving up to the U21s, but he has one hell of a free kick in his locker.

1205~~~
I hope they aren't all to the ilk of the one in the article because it wasn't that impressive.

1206~~~
I've always rated Thorpe ahead of Keane.

1207~~~
Im impressed with his interview.  He doesn't seem in awe of his situation of playing, he has high drive and ambition.  It's been great to see him and McNair be given this opportunity.  If Blackett can stay injury free he will get plenty of game-time over the injury prone trio of Evans, Smalling and Jones.

1208~~~

1209~~~
Crazy.

1210~~~
50k. That journo is having a laugh. If he gets a new contract there is no way we would pay him that amount. Just a lazy journo using our name to create a bit of a stir.

1211~~~
50k? No chance that he'll be on that. He deserves a bumper deal since he's obviously been promoted to the first team now, but he won't be making anywhere near that.

1212~~~
I think Jones/Smalling/Evans are either on or a little bit more than that. There's no way we'd bump Blackett up like that. Nothing article, I'd imagine.

1213~~~
Half of that sounds about right 25k would be around the right number.

1214~~~
It does seem like a lot. 50k is the new 30k these days though, inflation! If its true I can only congratulate the young man!

1215~~~
Quite the dribbler
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/37qnHWDNbnM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1216~~~
He has fantastic composure and technique on the ball. WOuld love to see him rewarded with a new deal but as said above, I don't think we have to worry about 50k a week.

1217~~~
Ah, I think he'll be bumped up to like 10k at most. If he's on 2 now, then there's no way he's getting a particularly large increase for a hand full of okay appearances, one of which he was sent off in. Factor in that he's home grown and he'll obviously be getting paid less anyway. Not to mention, 10K would be a five fold increase in his current alleged salary.

1218~~~
50k/w is madness for a young lad with 6 1st-team matches...I don't care how good he's or he would become, it's like the Club is sending the wrong message for youngsters "Well done, kid. You've made it".

1219~~~
See no reason why would we put him on 50k tbh.

He might get a new contract but will be very surprised if it is anything near 50k.

1220~~~
Oh, so we believe the article?

1221~~~
If that is true, then we are a bit crazy. Most likely, isn't true though.

1222~~~
It's Ian Ladyman. Not saying he's the best out there but he's generally reliable, been writing a bit of anti United stuff lately though.

1223~~~
It will be around 15 to 20 k per week and he would be stupid not to take it.

1224~~~
Is Adnan Januzaj even bringing in £50k p/w? Seems like a major rise considering he's only got half a dozen first team performances, and has looked decent at best. Sounds like nonsense.

1225~~~
Just for comparison, Liverpool spent £17m on Jordan Henderson who was 21, had 70 prem appearances and was an England international, he's still on the £40,000 a week deal they gave him.

The wages we're throwing around do seem to be getting out of hand, just because we can afford to doesn't mean we should.

1226~~~
Januzaj is on 60k

1227~~~
From the reading of that article, the £50k figure seems to be more a plucked figure rather than him being informed. Ducker says he's getting a new contract too, I don't think any of them know what he'll be getting without speculating.

1228~~~
I like Blackett but all he should be getting ATM is a pat on the back, if you know what I mean.

1229~~~
Very excessive wage if true. Why not a lower wage but with clauses to earn more based on progression. At least offers more incentives rather than telling him he's made it.

1230~~~
I mean, surely this 50k story is just absolute drivel.

1231~~~
I like how everyone believes a story if it has a negative spin about it, but then calls it rubbish if it's something a bit positive. It's daily mail for God's sake. He won't be getting anywhere near 50k as our previous dealings have shown. Now everyone relax.

1232~~~
Do we have for any player some reliable salary number?

1233~~~
The sad part about a story like this is that it will stick and for all future references Blackett will be a 50k player just like how Luke Shaw has become a 160k a week player because of one rubbish story

1234~~~
I find that article hard to believe.

1235~~~
I posted about this yesterday if you want to check my post history, I believe the figure is £120,000 which is still too much imo.

Let's not forget Fergie ran Giggs out of his office for asking for a company car when he was still a teenager. It's a different time now but we shouldn't forget the lessons he thought us.

1236~~~
congrads to blackett.  anytime i'm pleased to see player like blackett to be paid well than those fan boy's darling.  certainly paying a static playing shaw for 100k+ is so valuable and paying a versatile blackett 50k is fecking expensive and crazy

1237~~~
yep

1238~~~
How do people even believe this shit?
I mean I can understand people like <a class="username" data-user="83615, @Manucho the boss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83615/">@Manucho the boss</a> believing it, but there's no chance in hell of this being true. Januzaj was given this sort of amount after he looked like our best attacking midfielder in the last season. Blackett won't be paid 50k in his first contract. People should get a grip.

1239~~~
We had to pay up to keep Adnan as PSG were all over him.

I'm not sure why you have an @ before my name, this isn't twitter.

1240~~~
Really hope he comes in for Rojo. Deserves another chance and I think against Palace, he should do another good job.

Seeing him and McNair start would be a great middle finger to those saying we have lost our soul.

1241~~~
I agree. I have enough of letting the likes of Jones, Smalling and Evans come in without the feeling that international competition can come as serious from the youngsters.

1242~~~
Apparently be was quite poor in the Reserve match today, hard to see him starting off that performance.

1243~~~
Please tell me you're joking <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1244~~~
I watched the game against Leicester. He had a decent game but we lost to a late goal. Blackett got yellowed in the second half for a sharp challenge (won the ball but took the player too). If you didn't actually watch the game you can's say stuff like 'hard to see him starting off that performance'. This is why people believe anything these days smh. Even if he had a bad game in a bloody U-21 game, he'd start Saturday if LVG saw fit.

1245~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1246~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1247~~~
Quite hilarious that the only fit and avaialble CB's for next week are Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett.

1248~~~
I watched the game too. He was crap. Of course a crap performance for the U-21s is relevant when it comes to LvG picking his next first XI team.

1249~~~
Tom Thorpe as well.

1250~~~
Ross Barkley was plenty shite for Everton U-21's in a few games and he got moved up, same with Pogba for a big portion of his last season with us.

Some players just need the step up in the calibre of their opponent, to realise their potential, I understand that is a hard position to justify as conventional wisdom says one must prove themselves at a lower level first.

1251~~~
Yeah, that's fair enough. Just disagreeing with the sentiment that playing badly in an U-21s game mid-week won't factor in picking a team at the weekend. Youngsters can be picked based on how they do in training as well as what they do in competitive games but Blackett did himself no favours with his performance against Leicester.

1252~~~
Agree but we have no idea how LVG factors in those things on his decision making.So far all of these players he has promoted only Wilson,James and by some extent Lingard were among the best performers in the U21s last season.2 key players for the U21s last season Pearson and Rothwell are no where to be seen.

1253~~~
I think that's mainly down to where we're weakest in the first team squad. He's being forced to fast-track defenders but has a lot more options in midfield. 

The one curious omission is Thorpe. I'm not sure what he's got to do to get a game.

1254~~~
I would imagine currently in LVG's pecking order he's behind the 3 senior CBs plus McNair for the RCB spot, maybe even behind Vermijl for the LCB spot and perhaps 4th choice in the holding midfielder role after Blind,Carrick and Fletcher (maybe even Jones if we're not short of CBs).

1255~~~
Yes, yes I can.

You're a feisty one, I remember you! Normally everyone just blends together, your anger stands out.

"I heard player A had a terrible game."
"Well, he probably won't start the next one then."

See, it's simple!

1256~~~
He was the same in their last game as well. Made one rather stupid mistake....Im not sure what Thorpe has to do at this stage to get ahead of him....

Well thats good enough. Thank you sir. Phil Jones girl looks exotic

Luke Shaw an honourary Spanish amigo

1267~~~
No wonder he's had such a bright start to the season.

1268~~~
I thought he did well at the start of the yr. Be interesting to see him and Mcnair....but I think fans would feel safer for some reason with Carrick and I think having Blackett would give Palace more confidence which is stupid really. But for both these reasons I wonder if LVG will go with Carrick. Understandable and potentially the right call if so. 

LVG does have the guts to do it though. Even Fergie opted to play Carrick and Fletcher at CB's and more proven players in other positions over youth players (ask Pogba) ...but LVG is dutch and they do have a different mentality, average age of Ajax team for example.

1269~~~
He's gone back to struggling for the U21s last 2 games he's played there.

1270~~~
The evolution of man.

1271~~~
He also looks like he is ready to twat anyone at any given moment.

1272~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1273~~~
Adnan's missus is clearly a lezzer.

1274~~~

1275~~~
Smalling's missus is <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Which is all the more impressive considering he looks like Phil Lynott after an unfortunate lawn mower accident.

1276~~~
He's always underwhelmed at that level.

1277~~~
I can see Lingard is clearly a boob guy. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1278~~~
He also seems to be off the crutches.

1279~~~
Looks like he's not as fancied now as he was, for Blind to be ahead of him at CB.

1280~~~
Another head scratching decision.

1281~~~
Or is it Carrick at CB? I'm at a. seminar, cant watch the game.

For me, Blackett is 2-3 years away from being ready.

1282~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/wayne-coleen-rooney-among-united-8075912" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/wayne-coleen-rooney-among-united-8075912</a>

1283~~~
I think the boss likely didn't want to play 2 inexperienced players together. Blind although isn't a CB is a very experienced player compared to those 2.

1284~~~
I'm very curious to see how Blackett would do with McNair but I don't see that happening if LVG has the manpower to play someone else.

1285~~~
Could very well come in for this match. I would like to see him back in there, he has been very good this season when he has played, yes he made mistakes but what player doesn't, especially young players.

1286~~~
Would be a huge gamble. We need at least one with a bit more experience.

1287~~~
If Smalling is fit does LVG start Mcnair or Blackett ?

Mcnair deserves it for me and is better too and who i would certainly go for but how rigid is LVG to his right foot left foot thing ?

1288~~~
I should think all 3 will start unless one of Jones/Evans is fit. Smalling and McNair at CB and Blackett at LB.

1289~~~
Yeah, I'm expecting him to start at LB in place of Shaw.

1290~~~
Looks well out of his depth here.

1291~~~
Just as I expected, he is just terrible and has no awareness, not good enough.

1292~~~
Looking very overawed. He's lucky his pass across goal hit Smalling. What is he doing with his backpasses? All of them are putting De Gea under pressure. McNair is looking far more capable.

1293~~~
What a careless performance so far, his left foot is keeping him around the squad IMO.

1294~~~
A youth player who has through no fault of his own been prematurely promoted.

1295~~~
He isn't ready for a game like this. Can't handle being pressed and his distribution gets us into trouble.

1296~~~
Probably popped a Vicodin before the game. He is 5 secs late on everything.

1297~~~
Tyler Blackout

1298~~~
We survived this game with him in the team, hope this was the last until he learn to defend better.

1299~~~
Struggles to deal with any long ball.

1300~~~
He improved a lot in the second half, together with the rest of the defense (and the team actually). I'm still not comfortable when the ball is in his zone though.

1301~~~
As I said before, Birmingham last year was his level.

1302~~~
I thought he defended quite well actually. Looked out of his depth with the ball though.

1303~~~
He's only in the side because he's left footed and Van Gaal has an OCD for players playing on the side of their preferred foot.

1304~~~
Thought he was absolutely appalling in the early stages of the game and seemed incapable of passing the football without nearly giving it to the opposition, however he gradually settled in and was fairly decent in the second half. He shows signs of having some ability, but a lack of experience is clearly a major problem for him right now.

1305~~~
He has always been late in reading the game and gets bullied at times physically.

1306~~~
He's a bit....rubbish, aint he?

Its hard not to like him though.

1307~~~
Always late, slow and casual with the ball. I don't think he's good enough for United.

1308~~~
Started the game very weakly and Arsenal were pouncing on a clear vulnerable area of our side. He finally grew into the game in the 2nd half and had a few good defensive contributions. I do think he's taking a few too many liberties on the ball

1309~~~
He did OK considering it was Arsenal away and they had far more possession. But my god his long passes were awful.

1310~~~
Worst defensive performance of a United player since Wootton against Chelsea a couple of years ago. And during these 2 years we have had some really bad performances there.

1311~~~
He has never been good enough and this match proves it. You can't excuse him since this isn't his first time. We were quite lucky at the beginning of the season which our fixtures where he made ton of mistakes, but the weaker teams couldn't capitalize.

Same with Rojo although we can give Rojo the benefit of the doubt since he is new to the team.

1312~~~
Stupidly casual on the ball. In pre season people thought it was composure, I think he's just an idiot.

1313~~~
Really lackadaisical and times with the ball. Not sure he will have much of a future here.

1314~~~
Evans vs MK Dons

1315~~~
Yeah because Blackett was a bloody veteran centre back for us last season...

1316~~~
Probably. Though to his defense he had just returned from an injury that kept him off the pitch for half a century or so.

Anyway, Blackett has been really awful on the last couple of performances. The worst part is when he takes the ball under no pressure, closes his eyes, waits until some opposite player makes pressure and then hoofs it either out of game (best case) or in some risky position. Madness!

1317~~~
Did his job so fair play to him.

1318~~~
Was a long way from good enough for United today.

1319~~~
He got better, but man he was all over the shop in the first half

He has had better games for utd earlier in the season. But McNair certainly is the better of the two

1320~~~
He was terrible today but no.

1321~~~
He just waits too long to make a decission. He really needs to be quicker because once he's made a decission, he's already closed down and the option he chose is already gone. Other teams will notice this. Whenever he plays, teams will choose to leave him on the ball and then close him down quickly to disposess him. The pace of Premier League is fast and he needs to adapt to that quickly if he wants to make it.

1322~~~
Seemed to have lost some of his rhythm from earlier in the season. Was a little to lethargic on the ball, but I still think he's a good back up option. Has a lot to learn. He seems to be a player that thrives in a team with proper organization. We didn't have that today so he suffered. But also remember that he had Welbeck, Sanchez and Oxlade-Chamberlain closing him down at every instance. Those are some pacy players and can be in your face in a flash.

1323~~~
He had a good preseason in the US, but his composure hasn't really carried over during regular league games. Whereas McNair definitely has it despite not getting the preseason.

1324~~~
He's not premier league standard. Liability every time he got the ball or the ball went close. Just seems a bit clueless. Might make it at championship level but I wouldn't expect to see him making appearances for us once we get defenders back from injury.

1325~~~
I'd like to preface saying I am a big fan of home grown talent, and McNair and Tom Thorpe too. But the elephant in the room is that Blackett can't tackle. He isn't aggressive enough 4/5 times and ox danced around him so many times. He is good on the ball and therefore suitable for games where we have tons of the ball and the passing lanes to CM are uncongested, but I think we saw today that he isn't even good enough on the ball when under pressure. Maybe that will improve over time, but his lack of defending talent won't IMO. We've given him a good numbers of games and chances now and I think we can draw some conclusions, as sad as it is to say

1326~~~
Very nervous on the ball and hardly makes the right decisions. I had hope for him but there was always this feeling that I'd never be comfortable with him in defence.

Oxlaide and Chambers were destroying him all game.

1327~~~
Like every outfielder in the first 20, terrible.

6-7/10 thereafter.

It was Arsenal, a lot of their players are a nightmare for defenders.

1328~~~
Brummie fans would disagree, they thought he was awful and the worst player to pull on their shirt last season.

Was getting absolutely rinsed by Ox and then Carrick tried to go over and help and he got done too. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Just isn't very good and was really lucky not to get caught on the ball more as he took his sweet ass time and would escape at the last second.

1329~~~
He's still a kid with a lot of development ahead of him.  I'm simply delighted he is getting games as it will be massive inputs into his fulfilling his huge potential.  

We should go easy on criticism on players like him and McNair.  Simply put, they should not be playing at this level yet.

1330~~~
Errrr ... Rojo is not only older and played in a world cup final .... It's his first year in pro football and he still has less than 10 appearances!

1331~~~
Agree.He was no doubt dreadful today but people are really gone over the top on this thread.

1332~~~
Look, I'm not basing this only on this match and his matches in the first team, I'm basing this also on his youth matches where he never, ever proved that he is good enough. The only reason he gets picked is because of our injuries and because he is left footed.

1333~~~
That's true I remember reading their forum and they hated him! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1334~~~
Still can't see him making it here. He's just not that good...

1335~~~
So many people forget he is a young defender, hasn't been playing and has had to come up against a very good attacking force like Arsenal. He didn't have the game of his life but he did well. We can't have young players putting in world class displays at the drop of a hat.

1336~~~
We won today despite him. His distribution is terrible. He just hoofs the ball. No composure at all. Some of his balls to DDG were awful. He's young sure, but i've seen little to convince me of any real potential...

1337~~~
I'm basing my opinion on his performances before tonight, including for Birmingham last year. Will never be a premiership centre half imo.

1338~~~
Well good for you but based on today, he did his job over the 90 minutes and contributed to the 3 points. It's up to van Gaal and Woodward to find the solution for 5 years down the line, not Blackett's.

1339~~~
Mixed bag from him today, he made a couple of decent blocks and used his athletic ability well at times, but his positioning and the ease with which he's out-muscled for a big lad is disappointing.

1340~~~
He wasn't great on the ball which is actually his strength but he made a heck of a lot of important defensive clearances in the 2nd half and considering he hasn't played for an age I think the criticism here is a bit over the top.

1341~~~
Poorly. And that's all people here are saying. Is not good enough.

1342~~~
Surprised Blackett is getting so much abuse when McNair was much worse. Started poorly but did reasonably well as the match progressed. None of the players seem to understand the system we were supposed to be playing. I counted 7 good pieces of play from Blackett, while McNair had just one. Both made lots of errors; McNair far more than Blackett.

Blackett is very raw and clearly has major weaknesses at this point in time. In the medium to longer term he will have to improve his defensive play if he is to stay at United.

1343~~~
It's redcafe.You need a Baresi-like performance when you're 20 years old being thrown in to play against Arsenal to not being abused.Who care about how many good pieces of play he had?

1344~~~
And then the praise in the McNair in the other thread.

What is funnier is that Blackett is getting done for "dawdling" on the ball, it was McNair who put us in the most danger doing just that.

1345~~~
Needs to be more composed on the ball, defensively he has the power and strength. Was good in the end.

1346~~~
Aye couple big clearances towards the end of the game.

1347~~~
The initial 20-25 minutes masked the good bit for most, which is unfair. Glad we won, otherwise this thread would be unbearable.

1348~~~
Invites pressure from the opposition when taking too long on the ball and then compounds it by putting De Gea under pressure with slow backpasses. His technique on the ball seems fine it just seems to be a decision making problem.

Kept going and did well towards the end with some clearances.

1349~~~
If Blackett can improve his concentration and awareness of runners then it looks like he'll get a chance. He needs to be more physical, but he's been far more impressive then I ever would have expected from his reserves/youth team appearances.

1350~~~
Some harsh criticism in here considering it was his first 90 minutes for the first team in a long while. If he had an experienced defender like Vidic next to him, I think he'd be a lot more composed. We seriously lack a leader at the back who'll calm the young players down whilst in possession.

1351~~~
Had a good game considering his lack of experience in this type of game. Wish he wouldn't keep hoofing the ball forward to no one. It just invites more pressure on to us.

1352~~~
Thought he was very poor all game and some point at latter part of the game person watching the game with me asked, has he done one good thing all game and couldn't think of anything. He did a few minutes have a couple good plays defending. He really worried me though, he didn't seem to know where he needed to be.

1353~~~
Some of the criticism is way OTT for such a young lad with no prior experience, the confidence he will gain for playing in such a big game with a far more composed second half showing, will put him in good sted moving forward.

1354~~~
He doesn't really know how to position himself and that's been evident since youth level, to be honest. A spade's a spade; he just isn't very good. I think he'll go on to have a very solid Championship career in time.

1355~~~
Agreed, it's crazy how some people are analysing him and McNair.

Have to start expecting strong, solid performances in these types of games in a few seasons, not now.

I think he has been doing very well and did fine today.

1356~~~
Like a poster mentioned before, most people expect a Baresi / Maldini esque performance from the lad. 

I think he may come good even quicker than a few seasons, it would be even better if we could at least get a consistent partner in say smalling where they could have a run of games together.

1357~~~
They're really not. The criticisms levelled at Blackett are exactly the same ones that have been levelled at him throughout his time in the U21s, at Birmingham, and now in our first team. You either 'get' defending or you don't, and he doesn't.

Nobody has major problems with McNair because he actually demonstrates the ability to position himself properly. Nobody is expecting anything Baresi-like from him either, simply the basics.

1358~~~
I did not think Blackett was horrible.   There were moment he and Paddy made errors mostly due to inexperience, but they made some nice plays also.

1359~~~
He isn't good enough.

1360~~~
Let's just wait a little bit longer before we give him that 50k/week contract... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1361~~~
Seems to me that some of the contributors who didn't rate Blackett in the U21s, rush to post criticism of every error he makes in the 1st team while forgiving McNair for making the exact same mistakes. Caught out by ball over the top - happened to both several times this season. Failed to keep close enough to player they were marking who scores - Blackett guilty, McNair too (City). Against Arsenal Blackett gave the ball away 11 times. McNair 10. Presents big chance to opposition through mix up with defensive partner - Blackett/Rojo (QPR), McNair/Blind (Palace). McNair's marking of Welbeck was poor throughout. Carrick and McNair were asleep for Giroud's goal.

I have no idea whether Blackett or McNair will make say 100 appearances for United. I would imagine both will need to improve a lot to have any chance in the medium to longer term. But right now, they are doing amazingly well, unless of course you judge them against Rio and Vidic at their peak.

1362~~~
He was just as good/bad as McNair. Both made a few errors but Blackett actually made more vital clearances late in the second half. McNair's challenge on Wilshere could've earned him a red on another day to be perfectly honest, and some of his errors invited pressure. Wilshere's one on one came from a McNair error

1363~~~
Some very poor decision making today which put DDG under pressure at times. I'd rather Smalling-McNair in a back 4 in the next game.

1364~~~
Thats laughable. If he goes anywhere else it'll be in the PL

1365~~~
Me too but LvG's obsession over one left footer and one right footer in defense means we'll likely be playing the 3-5-2 system until Rojo and Shaw are both fit.

1366~~~
At home against Hull though, I think he will probably go to a back four and make do with Blackett at LB.

1367~~~
That would mean playing at right footer at LCB, I hope you're right but given LvG's choices so far I don't see it happening.

1368~~~
Really? Bad kick from DDG what was I saw.

1369~~~
Yeh but that's what I'm thinking, Hull at home, surely he can do away with that idea. There would have to come a time where he would have to otherwise he would be moving Di Maria, Mata or RVP to the backline.

1370~~~
People just can't give it a rest.You guys are not the only one who watched him in the U21s but you need to remember about the freaking circumstance that he has been thrown in (big game away, the whole team was woeful in the first 25 min not only him, our midfield can't control the game so he has to hoof it in some occasions although he should have done better) and he actually wasn't that bad under that circumstance.Typical redcafe when you hate a player, you abuse them to death.

He might not make it but luckily you are not the one who decide it otherwise he would have been thrown straightly to League Two.This is only his 6-7th appearances in the PL and he has been good in more than half of them.Yet people forgive their lovechild Mata when he has been poor in most of them.

1371~~~
I don't think he's a premier league top 10 defender. Basically he isn't all that good at defending.

1372~~~
A lot of the doubt can be tied back to the red card at Leicester. He became the public face of a nightmare collapse.

For me he looked shaky first 20 minutes against Arsenal but grew into the game and was in general fine, made some good interventions and clearances.

It's far too early to judge him.

1373~~~
I've seen faults in all of his matches when it comes to defending, even his distribution aside from the first match. I agree with JB. His positioning is poor, and he's indecisive during confrontations. I could understand being optimistic of his chances here if he had done well for the youth teams, but that isn't the case. If Wilson or Januzaj struggle, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because they have shown great talent at all levels. Just because he's young doesn't mean you can't say anything negative about him, just as long as it's not personal or treating him like Nani/Fellaini.

1374~~~
McNair and Blackett don't have the obvious talent and potential that Shaw has in bucket loads, but they can still be molded into top, top defenders. We should be proud of our academy once again.

1375~~~
His weaknesses are as clear as day but I disagree that he can't improve on that.If you read other comments some even compared his performance with Wootton's performance against Chelsea few years ago which is just ridiculous.If we keep carry on judging players based on their youth teams performance then Eikrem or Petrucci should be in the first team.It's good to know how they did in their youth career but players do improve or stagnant and even by a huge margin.For me Blackett has improved a lot this season and patience is still needed for him before us redcafe experts decided whether he's a Championship player or not.

1376~~~
Both McNair and Blackett are expected to make errors, but Blackett consistently had no fecking clue what to do or where to be and kept shitting himself on the ball and hoofing it or dallying. McNair has more composure and tactical awareness despite not actually being a CB. It's no coincidence we got ravaged down our left hand side today and also 4 of the goals came from the same side against Leicester.

1377~~~
A lot of clearances, he is good with the head, but from time to time he looks a bit slow on the ball. Maybe this dullness is more a question of slow decision-making than a lack of technical skills, however, you could see in the match against Arsenal that this slowness invites the opponent players: They liked to put pressure on him.

But it was only his sixth game in the premier league, right? Independently from the question what he showed during his youth career, it’s pretty impossible to judge a young player after a handful matches. <b>More important</b>, I am just happy that we have him. We are in a bizarre situation considering our injuries and he is doing his bit to help the team to get through this phase in the season.

1378~~~
Looked nervous. Poor distribution and very languid in his play.

1379~~~
I think he's doing his best with all things considered. However he does look nervous on the ball, lingers with his passes and get's caught out a fair few times. McNair looks like a rock in comparison.

His marking and tackling is usually good enough though. Not bad for a young lad anyway.

1380~~~
He clearly wasn't ready for an away game against Arsenal. Poor first half, but improved later on. Might be because of the formation change in the 2nd half.

I think he'll be a decent squad player once he's fully developed.

1381~~~
Some of his decisions made my head spin (including the ball he played across goal with Arsenal players stalking) but most of this was in a 3-man backline (including two players from Youth Academy) with no midfield support from Blind and very little from Carrick.  So all things considered, he handled things pretty well and got better in the later parts of the game.

1382~~~
From what I saw McNair struggled with the pace of the Arsenal players. I remember one instance where Welbeck went past him down the left way too easily. He could've forced him outside.

1383~~~
The reason our  defence is loooking bad is because we are unable to move the ball  out of the back.. we either tend to hoof it away.. or make the simple pass bad.. thus causing more chaos on the backline.. Blind was seriously missed yesterday.. all the simple things he does.. of receiving the ball from the defence and moving it out..

1384~~~
Not really. Well see, but I think I'll be right in the end. He isn't very good at defending and certainly doesn't appear as good as a solid lower Premier League-placed defender like Shawcross.

1385~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/smallingw5z8e.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/smallingw5z8e.gif"/>


Excellent defending by Smalling here ofcourse.

But re Blackett i think this GIF shows one example of his biggest problem for me. First his positioning is odd and then he doesn't seem to have awareness of Welbeck besides him and is late at reacting runners of a straight ball. He should be blocking the lines when pushing up or tracking the runner besides him.

If it happens once or on odd occasions it's fine but it happens too often to him. He always seems fraction late to react and that makes a big difference.

1386~~~
In Garth Crooks team of the week, despite being comfortably the worst of our three CBs out there.

1387~~~
His selected teams have always been laughable, it's like he just picks 9 star players of some teams irrespective of their last performance, and then to mix it up a bit picks a couple of random players for absolutely no reason.

1388~~~
There are not too many better CBs in the league than Shawcross so that comparison is a bit funny.

1389~~~
Wouldn't mind Shawcross back at all. His injury record is fantastic. But I guess the hipsters will never accept a Stoke player.

1390~~~
He's been at Stoke for years now, a perennial lower league side. The comparison makes sense because Shawcross was convincingly better at defending than Blackett at the same age. The very fact you consider him one of the best about, I do disagree for what it's worth, backs up my initial point. There is no guarantee that Blackett will play Premier League football, and the suggestion he'll go on to play Championship football shouldn't really be seen as a massive insult. It's tough maintaining a place in a Premier League back four. Shawcross has managed that to his credit. I don't think Blackett will.

1391~~~
Keane is better and he can't get into the Burnley side.

1392~~~
I have no issue with that. Blackett was trying to hold Welbeck to a high line. Smalling wasn't covering anyone and so he was just slightly further back so when Welbeck made his run, intelligent little run I must say as he dug himself into Blackett's back then ran, Smalling had him covered.

1393~~~
We'll take care of that.

1394~~~
2013-2014 - 9th
2012-2013 - 13th
2011-12 - 14th
2010-11 - 13th
2009-10 - 11th
2008-09 - 12th

Average position 12th... so that would be a perennial midtable side (unless you treat the league as two seperate halves, which would be a bit odd)

I'm feeling pedantic.

1395~~~
I have absolutely no idea what he was trying to do at the end. Passed the ball, went down, realized the guy who he had passed to had nowhere to go, so got up again to receive the ball. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1396~~~
Geez, can a 20 year old who hasn't even played 10 competitive games yet get a little breathing space?

Shawcross is good but he only made 2 apps for the senior team in the league cup and he was loaned out to Royal Antwerp at Blacketts age never to return. Did you think he'd turn out to be a solid lower premier league placed player?


He's not, and maybe Burnley's current starting pair have good chemistry and the manager doesn't need to break them up. I guess Blackett is only in the United team because he's left footed right? Keane is older and on loan, Thorpe is older and nowhere near the first team. Keane had his chance to impress LVG in preseason and he simply didn't. Blackett on the other hand rose to the occasion. If he wasn't good enough he wouldn't have started 5 of our first PL games, no matter how bad our injury crisis is/was.

1397~~~
Blackett gets games because he is left footed. Even Vermijl got a game at RCB because he's right footed. There's a reason why we went with a 3 back. Blacket isn't good enough to play a two centre back system. We had no other left footers so we changed the system instead.

1398~~~
Haha. I knew you'd say that. Oh well

1399~~~
Well it's true. That's why he got called up for pre season despite being a LB.

1400~~~
Didn't Vermijl play LCB? Keane RCB and Evans CB? Vermijl is comfortable on his left and has experience playing LCB and LB for the reserves though so that is why he'd play there despite being right footed. 

I agree on Blackett getting played because he is left footed.

1401~~~
Obviously in a fully available squad, Blackett and McNair wouldn't get anywhere near the lineup this season.

But it's a hell of an experience for them. A proper chance to look at whether they'll have the potential to improve and one day be proper regulars, or whether they'll still be jury out types like the rest of them years on.

1402~~~
For me it's quite simple really.

I trust McNair to do a solid job - with Blackett I almost get a heart-attack every time he gets the ball. It might not be fair based on what he has done in the first-team, but I have seen him enough times in the Academy and reserves to know that it is likely to happen once in a while. But I will be the first to admit that Blackett has a potential few others can match.....if he can avoid making those errors.

1403~~~
Michael Keane is considerably better than Blackett at defending. There's so much evidence to suggest that too, most notably his outstanding season at Leicester, a progression we readily messed up by dicking him around in the reserves again last season.

Keane was 19 and part of the best defence in the Championship. That's as impressive as Evans at a similar age.

Blackett moved ahead of him in the summer due to circumstance as opposed to defensive ability. Lack of left footed defenders being the main reason why.

1404~~~
Who cares that he's left footed? In addition to that he has ability and you're downplaying it. He's ahead of Keane and Thorpe who are both older than he is. Whatever circumstances you may come up with, it remains a fact that LVG clearly sees something in him that he didn't see in Keane.

1405~~~
You do have a fair point that Blackett must have done something to get himself into the first team, but also keep in mind who Blackett has to compete with for his spot.

Blackett's only competition for the roles he can play are Shaw, Rojo, and Blind (LB and LCB).

Keane, Thorpe, and McNair have Smalling, Jones, and Evans to compete against (RCB).

We have 6 RCB's who can possibly play for the first team at RCB. That results in lots of competition for Keane, Thorpe, and McNair. On the other hand, we have 2 players who can possibly play for the first team at LCB. Thus, Blackett has fewer obstacles to overcome than Keane, Thorpe, and McNair.

Also, it says quite a lot that van Gaal would play Blind at LCB against Crystal Palace than play Blackett there. It's apparent that van Gaal doesn't see much promise in Blackett as a central defender in a 2-man-defence formation. I would even say that he doesn't see much in the 3-man-defence formation as I'm sure that, if Rojo and Blind were available, he'd play one of those two ahead of Blackett.

Regardless of how Blackett's getting his first-team appearances, it's a great chance for Blackett to assert himself into the first team and prove van Gaal that he's a worthy first-team player. However, for me, he looks out of sorts as a central defender and is still much better off as a full back, which I see as his natural role.

1406~~~
Shaw, Rojo and Blind (coincidentally all injured at the moment) are not as injury prone as the other three and will start most games. I can just as easily say that LVG doesn't see much in Thorpe and Keane because he allowed Keane leave on loan and he hasn't played Thorpe at all despite the three players they are back ups to being so in and out with injuries. LVG rates Blackett and McNair over Keane and Thorpe

1407~~~
I thought Evans was at LCB? I remember him making a shoddy pass out there almost leading to a goal. Might have got it mixed up.

1408~~~
Just looked at the highlights and it is Keane right, Evans centre, and Vermijl left. Evans is out the left and gives the ball away for the first goal but Vermijl is even further out the left on the touchline. You probably just don't want to remember that night and I can't blame you.

1409~~~
A left foot.

1410~~~
So be it then. He'll get more games here than the likes of Keane and Thorpe.

1411~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah, that night was horrid.

1412~~~
I've removed it from my memory. I actually can't remember much from the game, if anything.

1413~~~
I know I'll probably come off as tactically naive, but I'm sick of all this left-footed/right-footed stuff regarding our CBs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't both Rio and Vidic right-footed? There is no pairing that I would take over that one (when both were in their prime of course,) so all this left foot/right foot stuff being the prime determiner in who plays or gets signed is a bit tiresome.

1414~~~
After the game I felt that he was pretty poor and made a lot of mistakes but having seen it again I realised that he did very well in the second half. Just like the Everton game where he made a crazy block at the end, he was in the right positions in the box a lot of times on Saturday.

1415~~~
They were, yes. I agree with you, there is a benefit to having a left/right foot combination but I don't think it makes that much of a difference. The thing is though that van Gaal is a bit of a weird guy and it seems to be quite important to him, personally I hope he ditches it and just plays the best pairing whether one is left footed or not.

1416~~~
Agreed (and just to be clear, my little 'rant' was at LVG's policy, not at your comment.)

1417~~~
Agreed. Its bullshit

1418~~~
Agreed. Yet for some reason some will only look at the mistakes he made. McNair made a few mistakes of his own as well. They both still had very good moments in the second half

1419~~~
Agree.He might or might not make it at United that's the story for the future but what I disappoint about is a lot of posters here ignore his massive defensive contribution in the match especially the second half.He did play a role in our win but at the end was abused like he scored a hat trick own goal or something.

1420~~~
Yea its crazy.

1421~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thefa.com/news/england/under-21/2014/dec/poty-tyler-blackett-071214" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thefa.com/news/england/under-21/2014/dec/poty-tyler-blackett-071214</a>

He has played 9 minutes for the U21's and is a contender for "Player of the Year" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1422~~~
I think it's just everyone who played is a contender.

1423~~~
So its fair to shoot rounds of criticism to Blackett because he won't make it here anyway, but McNair can get away with a diabolical performance because you see more potential in him? Did you see Blackett in preseason? He showed a lot of potential and LVG was impressed. I don't even care that it was preseason, he played very well against some good teams. He's also played well in the PL, making some vital blocks and clearances and I remember one acrobatic one against Everton (right before De Geas crazy save at the end) and against Arsenal. The Everton one was certainly going in but his save didn't get anywhere near the attention McNair's equally good heading save got against West Ham. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSLWk9MSCrg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1424~~~
Still a massive fan of Blackett and think he has performed very well for us. Can't say if he will have a future here or not with the money we can spend but I think he will earn a place in van Gaal's plans.

1425~~~
Fully agree.

1426~~~
Did well in the second half, I am sure a stat fiend will prove me wrong but he seemed to pass the ball well and looked composed.

1427~~~
I thought he played well, with the exception of his poor control that led to being booked for a foul. Seemed weird that Blackett had no problem feeding the ball into our forwards, when the defence had appeared incapable of doing so in the first half.

1428~~~
He's not good enough and he's there because we have an injury crisis.

1429~~~
you have absolutely nothing positive to say, anywhere.

1430~~~
No I don't. The only positives are jammy results. Today we didn't get one.

1431~~~
Every thread I've looked at you've just lambasted players or the performance.

1432~~~
Young got praise today and so did Carrick from me. I praised Falcao for getting a goal. That's enough because they turned up.

1433~~~
He looked today. He'll look bad another day, growing pains.

1434~~~
Yup they should be happy, they got your praise. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1435~~~
Better than Evans

1436~~~
Thought he was decent when he came on. Will be inconsistent because of his age but he did better than Evans.

1437~~~
I'd stick him in ahead of Evans.

1438~~~
This. I didn't notice him too much defensively, but he was very willing to play the ball forwards, usually picking out his man. I still have faith in him

1439~~~
Could easily have been sent off for the studs up challenge...

1440~~~
Nah would have been VERY harsh tbh

1441~~~
I'd definitely play him ahead of Evans in this system, but that is probably more to do with how lowly I rate Evans, along with being less suitable for a back three IMO.

1442~~~
I liked his passing.

1443~~~
Didnt see the most of the 2nd half. Did we switch to 4-4-2 when then and what position did Blaykett play when he came on?

1444~~~
No, stayed with 3 at the back as far as I remember.

I thought he did well. The one time Benteke tried to bully him and Blackett resisted, I enjoyed that.

1445~~~
Totally agree.  Evans to me offers nothing at this stage and I would much rather give game time to a young player with potential and live with his mistakes.  Blackett is pretty good on the ball and has done well in challenging attackers so there is plenty of upside.

1446~~~
Precisely. At this stage, I actually see Evans as expendable in spite of our injury crisis, which might seem crazy to some, but I would honestly select McNair and Blackett over him, whether it's in the first team or Blackett. I would say out of all of our current defenders, Evans is in the most perilous position, because of his injury record and with Blackett and McNair at least having scope for improvement. You would think at Evans' age, he would have matured and cut out the schoolboy errors that have always been present in his game, but he remains weak and fragile and still is prone to stupid moments.

On the subject of Blackett, I'm not a big fan and I remain skeptical of whether he can have a future here and even if he can develop well into a position. Perhaps it goes to show that he isn't up to the level required at United, but he doesn't seem to have a 'specialist' position and the most suitable one currently is as a left-sided centre back in a back three, but will we continue with this formation in the long-term? It's good that he has a bit of versatility, but will he have development problems like you could attest to Smalling and Jones having.

His passing range and accuracy can be pin-point and accurate and he's a decent athlete, but he is still very susceptible in a back three due to his often poor concentration and positional play and he always seems prone to getting caught out from runners from deep. There were even a few instances in the Villa match. If we do play a back three against Newcastle (though we shouldn't), then I hope he starts instead of Evans if Rojo is still unavailable.

1447~~~
Did ok but like McNair he looked more comfortable when moved to fullback.

1448~~~
Reasonably good performance both as a left-sided central defender and as left-back. I like the weight on his passes; quite a contrast to some of the others. Nice pass that would have reached Falcao had he not been pulled back, which the ref somehow missed.

1449~~~
He actually is an interesting option to have on the left side of the defence.I would have him ahead of Rojo there.

1450~~~
No where near good enough for us. Christ we have enough money to aim for Europe.

1451~~~
Did well today and has raw potential but he is too defensively suspect to play regularly, gets far too easily at times, needs a good loan spell somewhere.

1452~~~
Agree with this, but I'll add that his range of passing is really impressive for a young defender.

1453~~~
I would argue that every of our young defenders have a good range of passing in their locker (I have seen Thorpe,M.Keane and McNair knocked those hollywood passes for fun).The only difference is the composure to really do it in tough circumstances.

1454~~~
Didn't see the game but pleased to hear he got a run and did a good job.

1455~~~
He was not our worst player yesterday and it's also interesting to see that he tries again and again the long ball to the forwards - actually he is quiet good in it and I am very sure that Van Gaal gave him the order to do so. (I remember Van Gaal at Bayern: One or two defenders had his explicit permission to play the long passes... others didn't.)

However and more general it's depressing to see the technical skills of Blackett. If you compare our young defenders with the defenders of Bayern, for example... there is a huge gap. 

Take Bernat (born 1993) and Blackett (born 1994): The first one is able to stop the ball under pressure and to give a solid pass to the player next to him, even when the opponent is attacking him. Blackett is not able to do that. Not at all.

I locate massive deficits in our youth training. The defenders we develop play like british defenders did in the 80ies. While the german and spainish defenders could be our playmaker with their technical skills.

1456~~~
You can thank Meulensteen for that.

1457~~~
But he's the best Coach in the World ever according to himself.

1458~~~
I wish. 

Seems like we've gone in completely the opposite direction with defenders coming through our youth system being comfortable on the ball yet lacking any sort of passion/affinity for defending. Comparing his ability to Bernat who is quite obviously a pretty special/unique talent is a bit unfair no? It's not as if those teams are churning out 2-3 Bernats every year?

1459~~~
Valencia are producing a new Spanish leftback each time they need one... Alba sold, Bernat in. Bernat sold, Gaya in

1460~~~
Bernat has played over 90 senior games. Blackett has played just over 20.

1461~~~
Blackett will be a better and more expierenced defender with 90 matches played, but his technical skills won't be much better. The basis for your technique is built in the youth, coaches are telling us, right?

Of course Bernat is a very good defender and it is maybe unfair to compare Blackett with him. However I just wanted to illustrate that our defenders look pretty weak when it comes to ball control, playmaking and technique. (At the same time, Bernat is very good, but he is no wonderkid like Alaba was. That's why I thought a comparison would be allowed.)

1462~~~
I guess where we differ is that I don't see much wrong with Blackett or McNair from a purely technical stand point, most of their problems and mistakes can be rectified through experience, especially knowing what to do when put under pressure. They are also both still in a position to improve the technical sides of their game.

The problem, as ever, is trying to judge too quickly.

1463~~~
It's so frustrating on here at times, half our squad have been written off as not good enough this season. Are players no longer  allowed time to develop, go through bad patches, or make a mistake anymore FFS. Blackett has made 9 appearances and kept 6 clean sheets, McNair has never been on the losing side, sack the cnuts.

1464~~~
When was the last time there's a player coming up from the rank that hasn't been written off in their first season?I thought Januzaj was going to avoid this but there's plenty of criticism on him as well in his second half of Moyes's era.Pogba didn't really set the world alight in his appearances did he?And that's when we still have SAF.

Of course players aren't allowed to make a mistake anymore.We can always go out there and buy those Hummels don't you remember?

1465~~~
He played well yesterday, not sure why he's being criticized.

I don't think there's much wrong with him him technically either. His problems tend to be taking to much time on the ball, prone to hoof balling and concentration issues.

1466~~~
Bernat was bought by Bayern, no?

I agree with your point in general though, but there really aren't many top clubs who produce many of their own defenders. Bayern have done well recently, but like most big clubs, they also snap up most of the talented youngsters.

But technically, yeah, I'd have expected better or more technically able defenders coming through our academy - especially since we seem to be producing the right kind of technical midfielders - Pereira, Pearson, Januzaj, Rothwell etc all seem technically sound. (Though well see how they handle the step up, aside from Adnan).

1467~~~
It's a strange one though. He's so languid and "calm" on the ball, my mate already thinks he's got the wrong (Berbatov'esque) attitude to make it here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

He did well yesterday but he's a difficult one to call. Doesn't seem quite fast or skillful enough to be a regular fullback, and he doesn't seem positionally strong enough to be a CB. He's still young and learning though, so hopefully he kicks on.

1468~~~
Ah yes, I forgot how easy it was, but what happens when he makes a mistake<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1469~~~
I like him. Physically imposing, pacy, good passing, composed and a decent defender. Just needs to improve himself positionally but that will come with age.

1470~~~
He becomes a new Rojo.

1471~~~
Indeed, then the new flavour of the month comes along and we start again.

1472~~~
I'd like to see Blackett used as a left back in a back 4 formation.  Something seems off with Shaw physically and he may need a long rest to get over whatever is niggling at him (ankle? groin?),  but between Blackett and Blind we'd be well covered at left back.

Derailing the thread for a moment, we need to take the right back situation more seriously.  Rafael was unlucky to suffer a facial fracture but no one can deny that he's way too prone to injury.  I would not at all be uncomfortable with a solid buy at right back and keeping Rafael on for cover.

1473~~~
Blackett has shown how comfortable he is in possession. I think that playing as a left back for much of his youth has really helped him at that. It's also helped his distribution as well, and I think he can be decent in a back 3 particularly in helping us dominate possession. He's also decent at stepping forward with the ball and carrying it up the pitch; the one thing he can improve in terms of that is the speed at which he plays. He plays the ball at quite a slow pace and takes quite a bit of time before releasing the ball. By that time, the opposition's already organised; however, I'm sure van Gaal will improve this aspect of his game.

Defensively, I still don't really see it in him. He relies way too much on his physical qualities in his defending. Even in defending 1-on-1's, he seems sluggish and prone to being beaten by somewhat quick players. I hope he improves in this, but I just don't see that innate defensive ability in him.

1474~~~
I make it 3 clean sheets. He didn't play against Palace, Hull, Liverpool or Tottenham.

1475~~~
No idea, didnt look into it to much, just going by his profile on his page.

1476~~~
Its a bit pointless comparing the style or technique of a Spanish international who has been converted from a winger and is exceptional for his age with that of someone who has played as a centre half most of his life. Have you actually watched much of our youth teams in order to come up with your assessment that we have massive deficits in our training because our current under 18s contain some very technically good defenders and in the younger age groups we have had some of the best technical players and players of the tournament in tournaments containing all of the best youth teams in Europe and have played the likes of Ajax and Barcelona off the pitch in certain matches.

1477~~~
1. I doubt we are going to offer Blackett 20k a week tbh.
2. You say he's a good forward passer, however there's been countless times where he just hoofs it. The Burnley game was horrific from him in that aspect.
3. Strong, quick, athletic, fair enough. That doesn't make a good footballer though, but we'll look past that for now.
4. You say he has good anticipation, but when it comes to forwards making runs he doesn't seem to anticipate movement. That was evident against Destro in pre season. And carried on into this season.
5. Don't really care for passing stats like that for CB's because it lacks context.
6. Van Gaal probably asked the coaching staff who the left footed defenders were. Blackett was the only one so he went on tour. If Blackett was right footed, he'd be out on loan in the championship or playing U21 football. That is based solely off his actual ability. You denying this is delusion. Imo, he's a left back.

1478~~~
1. Why not? Its been reported in different media outlets, same with Paddy McNair. You don't think LVG rates him? He's going to be offered a contract soon. His current one is up in summer. Want to take a friendly bet on it?
2. He doesn't just hoof it, he usually plays measured long balls and he's usually good at them. LVG likes us to pass out of the back, so its obvious Blackett is being instructed or encouraged to play it long  because he's good at it. It seems you choose to only think of the instances where he missed his target and proceed to deem him a 'hoof the ball up' player. Have you taken notice of the many times when he found his man? People had no problems with his long balls when they were consistently finding their targets in pre-season and in games leading up to Burnley. After Burnley now he's a hoof the ball up player all of a sudden, its not true.
3. Yes, strong, quick and athletic,  physical attributes that help defenders do their job more effectively. If Evans was more quick and strong on the ball he wouldn't struggle so much against pacy and physical strikers.
4. Yes, overall he has good anticipation. If you want to go back to preseason, he was one of our best players. Also, since you're okay with using examples from Preseason, look at the Real Madrid game, he kept Ronaldo in his pocket and matched him for pace. There was one instance when Ronaldo tried several dribbles and stepovers against Blackett and he failed to get past him. I guess you'll say Ronaldo wasn't match fit, but neither was anyone else really in pre-season.

Look at this video, 20 seconds in you'll see Blackett's excellent anticipation and positional awareness against best player in the world Ronaldo. The video is full of other instances where Blackett used his speed, skill and anticipation well against speedy players. Puts Evans to shame. After the 1 minute mark you see five instances where Blackett plays well measured long balls that find their target, hence why I say LVG probably gives him license to do so. He even made our defense look calm when he replaced Evans in the final game against Liverpool in Miami. Look at the entire video and you'll see why LVG made him a full member of the squad.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSLWk9MSCrg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

5. Why don't you care for passing stats? What context would suit you better? Forward passes? Pass completion? You may not care for passing but I'll tell who cares about it, LVG. LVG wants ball playing CBs and Blackett fits his philosophy. FYI Blackett has played and completed more forward passes than McNair this season, just as an example.

6. This is a moot point. Who bloody cares that he only got his chance  because he's left footed? He took his chance well and the reality is that he's being rewarded with games. Yes, LVG took him because he's left footed, but he impressed him without a doubt. Keane obviously didn't impress him, Thorpe obviously hasn't impressed him. The theme here is LVG will only play you if he thinks you're good enough. IMO you're deluded in thinking Blackett isn't in this team on merit, and you're wasting your time thinking in alternative outcomes. Blackett is not on loan in the championship, he's a fully fledged member of Manchester United's first team and you can't take it, IMO.

1479~~~
I always wonder what would be said of players like Gary and Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes in their formative years if the caf were around then.

Let the lad at least try and grow into a member of the first team squad. Ffs.

1480~~~
Let me tell you.

Gary and Phil - average hardworking players,will go down to be decent Championship players,or perhaps League One.
Butt - new Cattlemole,Tunnicliffe,etc
Scholes - too small and can't tackle to save his life.Should have played in Spain or Germany.

1481~~~
1. No thanks mate.
2. He looks calm on the ball. I wouldn't say he is a good passer.
3. I don't doubt that it helps defenders. Just that I'd rather they were intelligent with their game. Carrick looks a better CB than Blackett.
4. People don't make comps of players being shit. And pre season is a different story, we were beating Roma and Real and yet couldnt beat Burnley and Sunderland at the start of the season. An in season Ronaldo would take the piss out of Blackett.
5. I meant I don't care much for passing stats for defenders. They can pass it to their CB partner 100 times and it will look like they are a passing master on the stats.
6. If he was right footed he wouldn't get a sniff. I am comparing him to our other CB's. He'd be behind McNair.

Don't really want to carry on this Blackett debate. I just don't think he has it in him to be a good CB. Certainly never in a back four. I'd have Carrick and McNair in there before him.

But hey, I don't think Lingard will make it here either, so maybe I'm just being harsh. What I have seen of Blackett though just reeks of incompetence in terms of reading runs from opposition forwards. You can be as big and strong as you like, that doesn't beat anticipation and reading runs and movement. It just doesn't seem natural to him, at all.

1482~~~
I actually like him a lot. I think he is the better talent of him and McNair and I hope he stays in the first team for some time. I'd much prefer he get game time over Evans, for example. He had a little period where he was a bit shit this season but I think all the tools are there for him to be a good player for us.

1483~~~
He shits all over Evans, and so does McNair. I look forward to seeing him at OT for a long time

1484~~~
Consistently has no idea where to position himself.

1485~~~
Played everyone onside in the build up to their goal. I cant understand why McNair isnt ahead of him in the pecking order.

1486~~~
Neither Blackett nor McNair are United quality.

1487~~~
He did similar for Leicester. Doesn't know whether to tackle or stand off.

1488~~~
McNair looks a damn sight better than Blackett.

1489~~~
Why did he come on? We had two better centre halves on the bench.

1490~~~
They're still very young, though. Granted, Blackett's positioning at the goal today was poor and he's often not been convincing, but I think it's kind of harsh to completely write off two youth prospects at a young age.

1491~~~
Too early to write off his United career, but today I blame him for the goal. Every replay just highlights what a pathetic attempt to clear the ball it was. It seemed like he might have already been picturing his heroic goal line clearance and lost focus.

1492~~~
I think if Blackett wasn't left footed he'd be nowhere near the team. McNair is short on confidence, but have seen far better reading and anticipation of the game from him. Blackett had no idea what to be doing at all points during the build up to their goal. Not to mention 4 of the goals vs Leicester coming down his side.

1493~~~
He's left footed you know. It's all a part of the philosophy.

1494~~~
Evans has played on the left side for the past month.

1495~~~
Screw that, why did LvG think we needed to even bring him on when we already had 2 CB to mark one of their forwards?!

1496~~~
Not a good match from him today. You can't keep making these crucial mistakes.

1497~~~
Is it just me or it is Carrick who was on fault of that goal?Blackett had to move inside to thwart that Southampton attacker who was supposed to be marked by Carrick which left their player on Blackett's left nobody to mark.

1498~~~
At fault for the goal. No idea why he came on.

1499~~~
He's crap. Seriously.

1500~~~
I don't think Blackett (or McNair) will make it here to be honest.

1501~~~
Very poor play for their goal, no positional awareness but it's not his fault we lost, LVG should take the blame today.

1502~~~
Bad permance from Tyler. He's not United quality and should move. Hopefully Rojo will be back soon so we won't have to see him in the team again (not that this 3 CB bs should continue.)

1503~~~
He isn't even League 1 quality sorry to say. Absolutely awful player

1504~~~
Can't blame him. He's a youngster without any substantial experience.

It's shocking that we are still forced to play that type of players. Just shocking...

1505~~~
How and why he was on the bench in the first place ahead of Falcao and Januzaj I'll never understand.

1506~~~
We not.

We had Evans on the bench, who has played on the left side of defence for the past month.

1507~~~
Wtf was he even doing for their goal ?  

He doesn't have much positional awareness or aerial prowess when challenged off long balls.

1508~~~
Fecking clueless player.

1509~~~
Or we could have just switched to a back 4 simply.

1510~~~
This poor bugger was massively out of his depth today. Manc or not, he's not good enough.

1511~~~
I think it showed what Southampton thought of him as they moved Pelle slightly right to expose Blackett's frailties.

1512~~~
His introduction created uncertainly in our defence and Southampton took advantage

Not good enough for United

1513~~~
He is positionally uncertain and always sees himself as the one who has to make the long passes, which always end up with the other team. He just isn't good enough, that's quite obvious.

1514~~~
Having watched it numerous times. I don't think Blackett made a serious error. He could have tried to play off-side but that's not the percentage play in that type of situation. Carrick's positioning for the initial kick up the field from the keeper basically ignored the threat from the free man. We seemed to be fine until Smalling chose to put pressure on the player with the ball, who already had Blackett between him and the goal. Had Smalling instead tracked Pelle, who was free once he got up off the floor, which is what you'd expect him to do, it would have reduced the threat.

1515~~~
Said it before and I'll say it again, he doesn't understand how to position himself on a football field. He didn't for the youth team, he didn't for Birmingham and he doesn't for the first team. In his defence, he was thrown on by Van Gaal rather needlessly. He's out of his depth and it isn't really his fault.

1516~~~
How some think this guy is anywhere near good enough is baffling, not better than any random defender in the Championship, not the first time that he's looked clueless. Is big, strong, tall, and knows how to hoof it, no more can be said. Ship him off before he costs us more.

1517~~~
I don't even think that either of them are Premier League level long term. We really need to be in a position not to use these players.

1518~~~
Don't know why people think he's better than McNair.

1519~~~
Harsh on him, he wasn't good but wow some are going in hard on a young player thrown into a game where we looked poor to begin with.

1520~~~
Agree.I don't think he has a long term future with us but some of the criticisms here...Those hoofs were clearly instructed by LVG as well as we were running out of time.

1521~~~
We looked controlled in defence until he came on. Then panic ensured and doesn't help he hoofs every ball.

1522~~~
Neither of them are good enough. The point was made about how both were behind Keane in the academy picture. Keane is a proper defender first and foremost, what he lacks in pace and ball possession he makes up for being robust. McNair and Blackett are doing their best, and have done well comparatively at times, but you see when they have to use their judgement to defend they look so out of their depth.

1523~~~
I didnt think we poor defensively tbf. Other areas were a lot worse today.

1524~~~
Was hated by fans at Birmingham last year which says it all really.

1525~~~
I just think we looked flat in general and he wasn't the only defender that was poor on their goal. I'm not even saying the lad has a real future at United, but he seems to get a worse thrashing post-match than almost anyone despite barely being in double figures when it comes to senior appearances.

1526~~~
I think it's very harsh he was rated as our worst performer today. He wasn't as bad as RVP, Di Maria or Smalling.

1527~~~
Well I for one thought Smalling was decent today.  I'm not gonna say Blackett was our worst performer but I think it's pretty evident he's not ready for that level of football.

1528~~~
Agreed.  He needs to be out on loan learning how to be a defender.

1529~~~
10 appearances, 6 clean sheets. He's looking like our best defender. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1530~~~
Eh? Smalling was mopping up everything, winning everything against that big bastard Pelle. Once Blackett came on, well, it went to shit.

1531~~~
Too casual in his approach sometimes. He looks like someone who needs a second or two to think of what to do before playing the ball.
But i just hope he kept on working hard to improve his flaws rather than think that he has made it.

1532~~~
I actually thought in real time that he would easily clear the shot that went in. I wonder if his reaction times are a little slow.

1533~~~
Is he nowhere ready to be a part of the first team. Looks clueless in defense.

1534~~~
Most people rate McNair over Blackett. I don't think either one of them will see much time on the bench after we sign a CB or two. Its funny how people's views change after games though. Blackett might play against QPR, give a 7-8/10 performance and the posts here will dramatically change to choruses of praise

1535~~~
Blackett is some athlete, i think he has a chance.

But he's raw, raw like a vampire's steak. He needs a successful League 1 loan because he's probably not really ready for the Championship, as far as his technical ability. 

I don't want to see him get by on physicality and never acquire top level technique, like Mika Richards.

1536~~~
Blackett made 3 mistakes for the goal! Why LVG didn't bring Evans on is beyond me! Sometimes it feels likes LVG tries to be to clever instead of doing the obvious!

1537~~~
so we came from - who is this guy/how the hell this guy could make the summer tour squad after such terrible loan spells TO this guy surprised me a lot, what a man that van Gaal he must have seen some potential and it's paying of I think he has got top player in him AND FINALLY TO he is crap can't play even in league or ligue un? 

ffs some consistency in opinions although I admit it was very easy to get carried away after his performances from summer tour and the same was with fletcher...

Blackett is a great athlete and strong man but looks clumsy and error prone, can't really defend so I am not sure at what position he could make it at us. I guess non? He is good with the ball but not good enough to play any other position. I think he will end up in Championship but wouldn't write him off yet, I would like to see him on loan somewhere where he plays every game so he can start to learn how to defend. Any lower table championship team who could actually play him unlike Birmingham or Blackpool? Well are there any worse?

1538~~~
What panic? Southampton never really threatened us. Blackett doesn't just hoof up the ball either, he plays measured long balls and two of them found their target. Its clear that LVG instructs him to do this because he thinks he's good enough to do it.  This 'hoof the ball up' thing is overstated.

1539~~~
The same Evans who has given away a goalscoring chance to the opposition in almost every game he's played this season?

1540~~~
Smalling was one of our better players out there, IMO.

1541~~~
Bringing him on cost us the game. He is very shaky. He looks about 2 years away from being ready to make cameo appearances for us

1542~~~
He made a mistake for the goal for sure, but the whole back line was at fault for the goal. He did not cost us the game any more than Mata's 3 misses did, or our bad passing in the attacking third, or the formation. Saying that, I did find it odd that he didn't keep Blind as left-sided center back and use Blackett as a wing back, purely for the pace.

1543~~~
Blind was LWB for his crossing and it nearly worked

1544~~~
True, but he's super slow so in a defensive sense, he's a risk against pacey wingers which Southampton do have + overlapping full backs. My point was mainly though that it's extremely harsh to put the blame of not getting a point at home to Southampton on Blackett's shoulders.

1545~~~
I agree. The culture of scapegoating in English football continues

1546~~~
I keep hearing how he's slow all the time but I have yet to somehow see that effect him or let him down in a match performance. He's so good to mask that deficiency if he indeed does have it.

1547~~~
Blind?

It's very noticeable, he's obviously intelligent enough to position himself well to mask it but when he's forced into making recovery runs due to others errors he looks like he's running through treacle.

1548~~~
That's the thing, his lack of speed rarely lets him down. Shaw with all his physical attributes could not create separation to send in a single cross all game long. Blind moved to left back and generated 3 crosses in about 20 or so minutes, one of which should have been a sure goal had Mata connected properly. I don't think that's something we need to worry about with him.

1549~~~
Absolutely shocking on the ball at the moment. Gifted Liverpool about 3 chances last night with Jonny Evans moments, and was just hoofing long balls out of play all evening.

1550~~~
That pass to set up their Spanish forward was just unbelievably stupid. I respect playing the ball out of defense, but that should have cost us a goal. He really needs to learn when to play and when to get the ball up the pitch better.

1551~~~
Not saying it wasn't a horrible error but it's amazing how people forget that he is 20 years old. He will have a career in the game, the next couple of seasons will determine if it will be at United, not the next pass.

1552~~~
He'll go on a free and we will get compensation.

1553~~~
True. Problem is, the cerebral cheese cutting is as prominent now as it was 2 or 3 years ago, which seems to indicate it's a pretty deep-rooted issue.

1554~~~
I agree. What people initially saw as calmness and comfort on the ball in pre season can very quickly start to look overly relaxed or lackadaisical once the players playing against you are actually fit and sharp enough to close down. He always has a mistake in him and doesnt seem to be eradicating these mistakes at all and has looked worse for the under 21's this season than he has for the first team because he hasnt had players of the same quality around him to cover his mistakes.

1555~~~
He did it more than once last night too.

1556~~~
I don't believe for one second that he's remotely good enough for us. Wasn't Fryers more highly rated and look how it's turned out for him. I honestly don't rate Blackett at all.

1557~~~
No.

But your right he isn't ever going to be good enough. He'll not get anywhere near Jones/Smalling standard and I don't even think they're good enough. Good championship career beckons for him imo.

1558~~~
Can't help worrying that Van Gaal's insistence on left vs right footed balance has promoted Blackett way above his abilities at the expense of more promising young defenders who don't happen to prefer kicking the ball with their left foot. Which wouldn't reflect well at all on his reputation for bringing kids through, despite all the stats about us playing so many youth players this season.

1559~~~
I know you have to whisper is around here, but he's just not very good. Infact, he's really rather rubbish.

1560~~~
Whisper it? 9 out of the 10 posts in this thread today have said more or less the same thing.

1561~~~
Blackett was a somewhat unknown commodity until this season. A quick look back at the Fryers threads on here would tell you he was highly rated by some and Spurs went to a-fair bit if bother to sign him. Seems Fryers was definitely more highly rated than Blackett.

1562~~~
I question if he is even good enough for the Championship. Thorpe is by far the better player.

1563~~~
Fryers is older than Blackett.

Fryers was highly rated in the U18s but so was Blackett.Saying him a somewhat unknown commodity is a bit strange.He did go to the pre-season under Fergie.

1564~~~
thought he did look okay for a young player thrown into a PL game, for the first few appearances of course.

lately he is getting even worse, and those hoofing are just so awful to watch. guess he is just getting his chance because he is left footed.

1565~~~
I remember when Fryers was leaving the threads all said it was no major loss as Blackett was the bigger prospect.

1566~~~
There is something really wrong with him recently.Even by his usual standard that was just awful.

1567~~~
I just can't understand how anyone can see him making it at United.

1568~~~
Remember when he was pretty decent in pre season and even going into the season a few games. He's 20 and he's having shite form. Shocker, that. Its not quite time to write him off.

1569~~~
He's having shocking form following on from not being a standout for the reserves. He's also playing for a new contract as his runs out at the end of the season and he had 3 very talented youngsters on his tail who will all be 18 next season and IMO should be at about his level by then with 3 years on him.

1570~~~
If your speaking of any of the u18 crop, none will be ready for the first team next season really. My point wasn't that Blackett should be in the team, but its too early to condemn him and tear his contract up.

1571~~~
I just don't see who it benefits. He's not a United player, he won't make it here and of that I'm certain and our defence will be strengthen significantly in the summer and it's unlikely the 4 or 5 first choice centrebacks will all be out injured again. By signing another contract all he is doing is delaying the inevitable and stalling his progress. There's no point in him being in the U21s when those three will be making that step up next season and if he's going to go on loan he might as well sign professional terms with another club and start his career as a first team footballer. At least that way he will get a first team wage at a mid table or below club and we will get compensation for him. Makes sense for all parties and the same goes for McNair. .

1572~~~
It's all due to LVG to decide if he will have a future with us (at least "short-term" future).If he said no then there's no way Blackett contract will be extended.Simple really.McNair will extend his contract for sure plus he's younger than Blackett.Don't think the number of CBs in first team squad next season will increase anyway since number isn't the problem.If there're one or two new signings one or two of the current seniors will leave.

1573~~~
I don't think McNair is "for sure" at all. He's in exactly the same boat. The truth is that neither has shown anything like the promise of previous academy players like O'Shea, Brown, Evans or even Shawcross. Phil Jones was a country mile ahead of them both when he started for us at their age. Its all well and good saying "they are young give them a chance" but I'm not judging them against experienced first teamers, I'm judging them against academy players of old who were much, much better than they are now. They are getting the games they are because of a ridiculous situation, not because we see potential in them.

1574~~~
Phil Jones was one of the best young defenders in the world when we sign him and he already played first team football for Blackburn before that.McNair has shown enough in the U21s as well as his first team appearances for us to keep him at least for next season.Don't forget he's still learning his trade as a CB and that might not be his final position.Impressed me vs Liverpool U21s on Monday when he played RB in the first half and holding midfielder in the second half.When Evans was on the same age as him he's still playing on loan in the Championship.

1575~~~
I was impressed with McNair on Monday as well. I have not been too hot on him generally but I thought that he played with the kind of authority that you would expect from someone who has made the step up to first team level. I thought that he was definitely one of the best players out there. Blackett, on the other hand, was very poor.

1576~~~
I can see what you're saying but you're missing the fact that the development of a young player isn't a fixed science. Players develop at different rates. Because Blackett is worse than Jones when comparing them both at the age of 18 does not categorically mean he will be worse at the age of, say, 27. Likely? Sure. The probability is that he will be worse. But nothing is categorical. It's a subtle difference but important. I've seen plenty of talented youngsters who looked certain world beaters to become crap and players who looked nothing more than average go on to become brilliant footballers. 

Having said that doesn't mean you hold some fictitious hope that every young player may one day become good. You have to assess on what you see in training, matches, amongst many other things. 

I tend to agree though that after I was initially impressed with Blackett, he's really regressed IMO. However it's been just over half a season, it's too early to condemn him to the dustbin just yet - it might be bad form. 

However only one man is in a real position to make that call and it's LVG. Guess we will see if he gets a new deal but i tend to agree that it appears unlikely at this rate.

1577~~~
I'm aware he's older? I was making comparisons with Fryers when he was here at the same age. I always felt Fryers was highly rated by 'some' on here and if you look back through the old threads, you will see he was. My point stil stands: I don't see Blackett making it here, not one bit. 

Not strange to say he's a 'somewhat' unknown commodity? He clearly is. I don't watch U21 games but people on here that do, seemed to rate a-few higher than they rated Blackett. I had heard of him and knew his position, but I can't claim I knew more than that. Blackett has clearly been fast tracked this season due to several different circumstances.

1578~~~
Since we lost Vidic and Ferdinand it’s clearly the panic at United and we’re only focused on our defenders, and not our defense, rather than the real deal since 2 years, our attacking display.

How a player like Blackett can develop when at 19 there are so many critics against him. He has still not the level, but so did Rio or Vida at this age. I think that he will be loaned next year, hopefully in PL, and we we’ll see then

1579~~~
Have people already given up on Tyler? because i think at 20 he can still go on to be a really good defender, rookie mistakes are understandable when you are a rookie.

1580~~~
I don't think he'll get a game again this season unless injuries strike again or we move to back 3.

1581~~~
I trust him to be in the lineup more than I'd trust Evans.

1582~~~
This

1583~~~
I haven't given up

1584~~~
I never really thought highly of him so it's not like he has suddenly changed my mind.

1585~~~

1586~~~
Can't really argue with that, although it's no barometer at all.

1587~~~
Hopefully get him a good loan next season.

1588~~~
This is the caf (2015 edition).

Where apparently, if you're 20, and you're not already Messi/Ronaldo level, a regular first team player, save damsels in distress, leap tall buildings in a single bound etc. you must be absolutely shite at football and life, and hence not wanted at our club.

1589~~~
We will probably sell McNair and Blackett this summer for £5m combined. They have been put in shop window this season and these short contracts ensure that we get a fee.

1590~~~
I doubt that very much. Even if we buy a CB or two its good to have players like this we can fall back on. Next season will see us playing more games if we get into the CL. We'll need these legs.

1591~~~
Are you sure that you're talking about Manchester United - the club that sold Darren fecking Gibson for 1 bloody million?

1592~~~
All the bits referring to footballing ability etc. are absolute nonsense. The reason that people might have "given up" on Blackett is the fact that at youth team level he never showed any real ability to be a first team regular at a club like United. I understand some players are late bloomers, but to play a lot of U21 games and never really show the ability to make the step up means that people are entitled to feel that he won't make it. I think he'll be a rotation player for the next one or two years, and after that we'll either sell or choose not to extend his contract. There are far more talented defenders in our youth ranks at the moment that I expect to take his squad rotation role sooner rather than later.

1593~~~
Blackett maybe. Selling McNair would be stupid and illogical.

1594~~~
New deal confirmed. Change in thread title?

1595~~~

1596~~~
Well I was completely wrong about both (he and McNair) leaving in the summer. 

I just don't see where their future lies with us though, we're surely going to strengthen to a point that neither is going to get much game time so what plans do we have for them? Loan moves to EPL clubs? Protecting our interests in a way we are envious of other clubs doing?

1597~~~
Congratulations to Blackett. Im sure his entourage is more sensible than Periera's

1598~~~
Gets sent off for reserves. Rewarded with contract extension. Hopefully we can get a couple of mill for him in the summer if he's not in our plans.

1599~~~
Perhaps LVG actually believes they have the potential to be first choice one day?

1600~~~
What if the "strengthen" means we'll let some of the senior defenders go as well?If the number doesn't increase they will still get the same chance or even more with their versatilities.

1601~~~
Good for him on the contract, great athlete and comfortable on the ball but a long, long way to go to be a starting CB at United.

1602~~~
good decision! Next step on loan in the Prem please.

1603~~~
He'll be a regular in our defense in the future. LVG can obviously spot a talent and he likes both Blackett and McNair.

1604~~~
Omg does LVG even watch the players, we'll probably end up signing Falcao as well. Blackett is very poor, he's just big, fast, strong and that's it with him, I see no potential in him. He cant even impose himself in the u21 and has been defensively suspect in almost every game this season. I think Thorpe and McNair are far better options.

I read something about him being earning over 20000 a week, is that true? That would be very strange, meaning that he gets paid more than any Ajax player while showing absolutelu nothing.

1605~~~
It would be silly to let him go for free. He will probably go on loan next season. Then United can decide if they want to keep him or sell him. I still think he has a chance of making it here.

1606~~~
Good to get him nailed down. Worth keeping with us to see how he develops, has had a better season that he could have hoped for im sure

1607~~~
I think that's unfair really. Up until the Leicester game he was showing good form and was defending well, there was a reason he kept being played. Since then though his form has definitely dipped, but I believe he will be back again. He is definitely not useless though.

1608~~~
What would be the most we could get out of him, there's no PL club who would buy him as a starting CB, we wouldnt make much on him, especially with Woodward and our general selling record.

1609~~~
We played vs the very bottom half, how much did he have to do? And even then he looked shaky many at times, just not good enough. The standard has really dropped at this club if performances like that and in the u21 are rewarded with new contracts. I'm dead serious if I say he wouldnt look out of place in the Championship.

1610~~~
So, because our selling record is shit, we shouldn't offer Blackett a new contract so it becomes even shittier. Makes sense.

1611~~~
Identity lost etc etc

1612~~~
Certainly needs to improve a lot but I'm willing to be patient for the next couple of years. Just to put Blackett's performances in context, Luke Shaw has made lots of errors, so too Smalling, Evans, Jones, Rojo and McNair. Only defender I can think of who hasn't been guilty of tons of stupid errors this season is Valencia and even he has made a few, such as failing to mark Sunderland's goal scorer at the corner and giving away possession in dangerous areas.

1613~~~
usually academy players start on a high and then struggle for while. It's the same with Januzaj and McNair. It's about developing and coming back stronger. Too early to say he can't make it here.

1614~~~
We will easily get the cost of his wages plus the chance to see how he does on loan.

1615~~~
He just screams Ezekiel Fryers to me. He played under difficult circumstances, but he was really poor

1616~~~
I think he is quick, strong and can pass well, but he needs to stop dawdling around and play at a quicker tempo. He's obviously been watching Evans as he waits on the ball so long that the strikers close him down and he ends up having to kick it away, usually to 1 of the opposition. If he played at a quicker tempo he should clear some of those errors.

1617~~~
I don't think any Premier League team would take him on loan. Bottom half teams need solid defenders as they have to do a lot of defending, and defending is easily the weakest part of his game.

1618~~~
And we were keen for him to sign a new contract. Shows there is a profit in keeping some Youth prospect even if they have little chance of making it here(Not saying that for Blackett but clearly it was the case for Fryers).

1619~~~
You see no potential in him? 
Obviously LVG does see sthing in him cause otherwise he wouldnt sign a new contract. 

What do we have to loose, he'll probably go out on loan and we'll see if he'll come out good. 


United dont give a chance to youth, people cry, United signs a youth player, people cry again.

1620~~~
Is this anywhere near enough to play for United, he's supposed to be good on the ball but he also hoofs it very very often, vs clubs like yeovil ffs.

1621~~~
Obviously not recently which is why he is nowhere near the first team at present. But he will clear that up, he is only very young and still inexperienced.

1622~~~
You make it look very simple, but the difference in class/potential in Pereira/Blackett for example is very significant.

I am just a fan and not saying tbat I have better eye for talent than LVG etc, but he's proved this season that his decision making is quite shambles. 

We'll see how he develops, but I'll be surprised if he's in the PL in 5 years time, he has shown absolutely nothing this season and even before other than his physical attributes. But I guess it's the standard here now, just imagine Blackett at Barca, would be laughable.

1623~~~
Yeah. I'll be surprised if he gets a Premier league loan <i>and </i>manages to play regularly next season. Maybe that's not the plan though.
Either way, I'll be stunned if he's at United or even starting for a Premier League team in three or four years time.

Maybe starting for a newly promoted side, at a push.

1624~~~
You cant just assume that he will, young lads neeed to show progress, that their learning and developping. Or else you might as well give every single youth player a chance hoping that they will clear out their flaws. Maybe I'm just harsh, but I think it's painful to see which level now is enough to play for this club. Just imagine Blackett at Barca or Bayern, a giant/athletic defender with sporadic decent ball skills.

1625~~~
Yeah every decision club makes is low standard these days... 

Not every youth product barca signed has become a great player or stayed there.

People seem to unerestimate the club whatever the decision is made. Maybe he ll be good maybe not no reason for panicking

1626~~~
Do i need to remind you where and what Smalling, your love by the look of things, was doing when he was 20?

1627~~~
Luke Shaw's back up for the next couple of years IMO. I don't think he'll end up a starting line up player, but will probably do a job as a squad player while he develops.

1628~~~
You won't see me saying bad things about academy products but I agree with <a class="username" data-user="79807, @Sammyjunn" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79807/">@Sammyjunn</a> that unless he makes some rapid progress I don't see a long-term future of him at United.We have better talents down the rank particularly.

1629~~~
Not trying to say that, but if players like Blackett are qualified as good enoug, I'm worrying about the standard we have nowadays.

Not really talking about producing players, but what to do with players who just arent good enough. We've done that in the past too, let them go to different clubs, that's why we have one of the most players in the top european clubs. (In terms of youth products)

1630~~~
Point out what relevance it has in this discussion. To hope that a player will make such a progress like he had, is equal to hoping that Welbeck suddenly does become Henry's level.

1631~~~
We offer one a contract and he rejects it (Periera)...and its Uniteds fault too

1632~~~
Good for the boy. He extends his contract for us. LVG likes him a lot. I think that he has a chance because he’s left footer, and in these terms, he has “only” Rojo and Evans in front of him, so that’s maybe why we keep him at the club.

I’m always happy to see a young player coming from the Academy having a contract with us. The fact that he’s a pure Manc can add this to the image of the club… Hope that he develops well in the future.

1633~~~
The relevance to the discussion is that fact that that defenders develop late. Blackett may or may not develop that well, but this contract is a no-lose situation for United, so I don't know why you're whining about it.

1634~~~
We are not going to make much money from him, close to none imo. He isnt some highly rated youngster, if he's really getting those wages, we could even make a loss on him.

1635~~~
Oke then, lets sign tons of young defenders and hope they'll eventually turn out well. Seems like a solid policy to me, even if they havent shown much signs of potential.

1636~~~
Good for him in signing a new contract. Worst case means we can sell him for a bit of money, best case he becomes a good squad option/starter for us in the future.

1637~~~
Tend to think if McNair was that highly rated then he would have been tied down to a five year contact. By the end of the season both will be into the last two years of their contract. Hardly a ringing endorsement.

1638~~~
He played a very good game against Real Madrid in preseason...even kept Ronaldo in his pocket <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. I don't care for the 'it was only preason' comments. He actually made it hard for Ronaldo in front of 100,000 fans.

1639~~~
A big meh on this one for me. You just know we'll let Thorpe leave for about 20p in summer as well.

Probably says more about the number of left sided defenders at the club more than anything else.

1640~~~
Agreed on all 3 points.

1641~~~
Should sell him on soon while other clubs might think he is actually good. Loaning him out will probably just show he isn't very good.

1642~~~
Pleased for the lad. It's a good contract that he has signed and he must be thrilled. There is a lot of hard work in the future for him if he is to get back in the team. Physically I have no issues as he has the power to be very imposing but I still am unsure if he has the intelligence and concentration to play at this level. We will see how he develops.

1643~~~
I really really don't rate him. I'm not even sure he would be a regular for a top four Championship club, let alone us. I hope he proves me very wrong but I just can't see it.

1644~~~
Personally, I think he's pretty shite. I hope we don't see him in the first team again anytime soon.

1645~~~
New contract? Jaysus.

1646~~~
No harm in giving him a contract, but I'm not so sure on him. However, I appreciate that no two players develop at the same rate.

1647~~~
I don't rate him, but atleast there's no harm keeping him around the squad and hopefully getting decent money for him.

1648~~~
I don't particularly rate the guy. He looked alright at the start of the season but that's all it was. He's a crap left back and not much better in the centre too. The only reason why he's still here is because of our shortage at the back. He's nearly 21 now so he's not exactly a kid.

1649~~~
Good on him. I was criticized for wanting him to go on tour in pre-season and have been one of his few backers this season. I really think he has the attributes and hopefully he can continue to develop over the next couple of years.

1650~~~
10 appearances, 6 clean sheets. But he's total, utter shite obviously. Muppets.

1651~~~
Yeah results are down to one player. He played with 3 cb's at the back. And with another CVM in front of them. 5 goals vs Leicester so he is shit, just stupid reasoning.  We alsoplayed vs the weaker teames in the league.

1652~~~
he's better than given credit for here

1653~~~
It's fair if you think that, but that was a really stupid argument. 

What potential have you seen in him? I just saw a big defender with speed who cleared every ball that came near him, no reading of the game, composure and positional awareness. He hasnt looked good in u21 and certainly hasnt looked like being too good for that level.

1654~~~
He has speed, size, and technical ability. Tactical ability can be taught and consistency and calmness come with age. I prefer to look at his positives than his negatives. Obviously he has problem areas but there is a lot of room to grow for him. For a 20 year old defender with little experience he did well in the majority of his appearances.

1655~~~
He's not very good. Most who watched him come up through the academy and reserves were well aware of this. Doesn't stop the usual delusional types insisting he's actually good just because a new manager chanced him in a couple of games.

1656~~~
Fair enough, but do you think that's enough to remain at United? Arent their tons of players with those attributes?

1657~~~
That's my feelings too. When you see the 3 coming through now and how much more talent they have than he ever had it just seems strange to prolong the inevitable. Maybe he feels he can still get a great education with us and the club feel he can get us a proper transfer fee in a few years.

1658~~~
Hasn't he actually been struggling in the U21 games recently too? I can't see him having much of a career here.

1659~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1660~~~
I have mentioned in another thread that I had just watch Aymeric Laporte for Bilbao tonight, absolutely no comparison. Laporte is a million miles ahead of both McNair and Blackett.

1661~~~
Great news. Hope he gets a decent run in the first team next season.

1662~~~
McNair and Blackett have signed two and a half year deals. At the start of next season they will enter the last two years of their contracts. I wouldn't be surprised to see them both leave this summer.

1663~~~
I dont think theres even the slightest chance McNair will leave.

1664~~~
Championship player.

1665~~~
People here decide on a player too easily.You're either shit or you're not.To remain at United for 12-13 years Blackett clearly must have some good attributes.However the question is not that but will he become good enough for United?There're a lot of doubts that he ever will.

1666~~~
Why are some fans complaining? I thought we liked bringing youth through or is it the case we just want to dispose of the ones deemed of poorer quality. Come on, he's only 21 so why write him off? It is utterly short-sighted, unreasonable and frankly stupid to condemn him to mediocrity right now. Championship player? FFS.

By several accounts he's got a good attitude and is very willing to learn. He's held up reasonably well being thrown into the first team, but he's young so you'd expect inconsistency. I am not saying he'll definitely be world class but give the lad a chance and time.

1667~~~
Haters. A young player gets a contract and all I see is bitching about why he was offered one. Another player  called Periera rejects a contract and there's bitching about United not doing enough to keep him. This thread has turned into a hate thread. Keep it up fellas

1668~~~
I don't hate Blackett, I just think he's useless.

1669~~~
You are being extremely generous. He looked at sea on loan in the Championship last season. 

I would be surprised if starts regularly for a league one team forget Manchester United. No defending nous whatsoever. I am shocked by this contract extension.

1670~~~
Aside from pre-season he hasn't impressed me much. Will give him a chance to improve of course, but don't have high hopes.

1671~~~
Also doesn't stop people like you who only want to look at fvcking negatives and nothing else

1672~~~
I really don't understand the negative feel around Blackett. He is what we want to see from United, okay he hasn't led us like Vidic, how dare he? But he has done well, forget what we want long term, we should appreciate an academy player coming through and contributing this season.

1673~~~
A loan move next season??

If Rojo can't play in any matches til the end of the season then i would 100% rather see him than Evans

1674~~~
Glad he signed a new contract, let's see if he can kick on and be a Man Utd defender. Besides that, it is always nice when we are looking out for our youth players.

1675~~~
Mate. I'm not being positive or negative. I'm just being honest in my assessment. He isn't a United standard player. If he was a good player I'd call him one

1676~~~
It's fine having an opinion and from the outlook, you would look to be close to right but I'm sick of people predicting a young players future career. Who knows how a player is going to develop.

There are players going around now who look average who could be worth 50m in 3 years time. And there will be 50m rated players who won't be able to buy a goal etc.

1677~~~
Good on the kid for getting himself a new contract, though I'm still doubtful that he has a long term future here. Though hopefully he proves me wrong and he develops into a great CB

1678~~~
Forget what Van Gaal said in his press conference. What does a two and a half year contract actually say? To me, it says that he has a maximum of 16 months to prove himself and will be sold sooner should the right offer arrive.

1679~~~
Pleased for the lad he appears to have a good attitude which is all too rare in young players these days.

1680~~~
I agree but this isn't really that helpful when making decisions regarding young players. We can't assume that every player who's not very good at 21 just needs more time. Most players at least show potential. I would argue that those with a good eye for talent are proven correct in their assessments a lot more often than not.

1681~~~
When you say no defending nouse whatsoever what is it that he does wrong exactly?

1682~~~
Given how few players from our youth teams actually graduate to become 1st team regulars its a very easy and lazy thing for people to just say a player wont make it and be right. We see so many posters making statements such as "shite player or nothing player" without actually expanding on what is wrong with a player.

1683~~~
Blackett showed a lot of potential in preseason. He was one of our best players in the states and put a veteran like Evans to shame.

1684~~~
Yet youre doing the exact same thing in the Jones thread who is only 2 years older but has shown infinitely more in terms of both ability and potential than Blackett ever has.

1685~~~
When you've followed the academy/reserves for over 10 years and seen how few players have actually made the grade at OT you begin to understand how big the step up actually is. Hundreds of average enough young players have been hyped up on forums/message boards etc as future 1st team players. Only the very special have tended to actually be good enough. If a player looks poor at academy level, reserves level, championship level why would we assume he's good enough for Manchester United. It's not laziness, it's a realistic assessment based on what we have seen.

1686~~~
The only player im truly sick of is Evans. Im also ready to let Rafael go

1687~~~
You may have followed the academy/reserves for ten years etc etc but when you just say "He isnt very good" tells us absolutely nothing about why he isnt very good. "he isnt very good " isnt a very clear assessment its simply an opinion. What about a player "isnt very good"?. That might be more interesting, valuable and insightful.

1688~~~
What exactly about him makes him not good enough even as a back up? He's only looked really poor against Leicester and only when the entire team collapsed after they equalized.

1689~~~
The question should be what has he done right?
<ul>
<li>He has no positional sense.</li>
<li>Loses concentration mid game.</li>
<li>Is slow to react to situations. Lackadasical at the best of times. </li>
<li>Not a great header of the ball. </li>
<li>Poor at reading dangerous situations.</li>
<li>Ordinary with the ball at his feet under pressure. Constantly reverts to hoofing.
</li>
<li>Ordinary pace and crossing ability to ever become a full time LB at United. </li>
</ul>The only thing going for him that he is a physical specimen for his age. 

I don't have time now to follow the youth as I used to, but I still do whenever I can. I also saw him couple of times on loan in the Championship last year. The kid doesn't shout a good defender to me. I do not see any standout attributes so far that will change my mind. 

People say," oh he is young" but players hardly ever go through magical transformations. It's always a gradual process, the talent is always there, and it gets honed under right management and their own hardwork. I don't see it with Blackett.

1690~~~
Well if you saw him on loan a bit you would know he played at left mid half the time, so don't form an opinion on his defending from that.

Anyway, While we could sit here and pinpoint specific moments in games where your bullet points are proven correct, I think it's harsh to judge him overall in that way. I feel he is quite good with the ball at his feet and is comfortable, yes he can play himself into trouble but what player wasn't with that 3 at the back. You are right about it being a gradual process but then say you don't see it, well let the gradual process take place and lets see in a year or two if he has featured enough in the first team to stay on.

1691~~~
He started in defense in the couple of games that I watched; I think I am entitiled to hold my opinion. 

Eric, defending, especially at a club like United is about specific moments in the game. We are not a club that will be under the cosh for majority of the game in most games. A defender will be judged on those crucial moments. And Blackett has looked ordinary in more than those specific instances. 

Not my decision to make whether he stays for a year or two, or not. As of now, I don't think I am incorrect in my assesment of him as a future United defender.

1692~~~
Entitled to your opinion, no doubt but his loan spell was not a great indication, I mean how many games did he play during both spells? Maybe 15? A chunk of those at left wing. Hardly enough to judge him.

I understand that moments count, especially at that end of the pitch at a club like United. I just find it so harsh on him, he is so young and we should be looking at his contribution after 30-40 senior appearances, not after a handful in a turbulent time for the club and defence.

I understand forming an opinion on him based on what we have seen so far and that's fine but I think he has been good considering, he has performed and also stepped up in big moments at times.

1693~~~
A young player thrown into an unsettled defence, in an unfamiliar position with half a team of new players.
Seems like a reasonable excuse for the manager but not the player. He'll come good.
and if you think he is a unit now, if he follows the family genetics, he could end up with Chris Samba's build.

1694~~~
I am not exclusively judging him on the loan spell, instead giving it as an evidence as to why I think he is not good enough. Also, the question I would ask is, "<b>Why </b>did he not play during both those spells if he is such a great talent?"

You have your belief and I have my opinion. I guess time will tell who is right. 

By the way, I am rooting for you as there are not many things better than a home grown lad making it at United, especially one from Manchester.

1695~~~
Fair question but why couldn't Pogba get a run? Why can't Rafael, our only RB, get in a squad in desperate need of a RB? All questions with answers but at the end of the day, simply because that's life.

1696~~~
Instead of me slating him which I don't really want to do; why don't you tell me what has impressed you about him. What makes him a United player in your eyes?

1697~~~
His composure for his age, his speed, physique, ability in the air, his passing. People overlook this a lot. Look at these videos without a biased state of mind and please tell me he doesn't have potential

<b>After <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Feb/tyler-blackett-signs-new-contract-at-manchester-united.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">signing a new contract at Manchester United </a>on Thursday, Tyler Blackett revealed his hopes to establish himself further – at Old Trafford and on the international stage.</b>

Following a senior debut for the Reds on the opening day of the season, the Manchester-born centre-back has grasped the opportunity to make strides in Louis van Gaal’s squad with ten appearances in all competitions so far in 2014/15.

While Blackett is relishing working with the defenders in United’s first-team, the youngster has his sights firmly focused on forcing his way into the manager's starting line-ups in the future.

“It’s great because they’ve all been in my position before, so they’ve done it,” the 20-year-old told <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/MUTV-New.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a> </b>of his defensive colleagues. “I’m looking up to them but hopefully I’m here to challenge them as well.

“I want to kick on and to challenge the players in front of me and get a regular place in the first team. Hopefully I can get call-ups for England, push on and be more established in this great club.

“I know I’ve got everything [I need to] achieve here at the club. All the coaches are going to help me, so I’m just hoping to achieve great things here. I’ve got to keep on improving, concentrating and listening to the coaches and staff. I’ll take on board everything they say.”

The extension of Blackett’s contract to at least June 2017 – <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Feb/tyler-blackett-signs-new-contract-at-manchester-united.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">with the option of an additional year</a> – has delighted the Reds’ No.42, as he continues to fulfil boyhood aspirations.

“I’ve always been a United fan and this is the club I’ve grown up watching. I love going to United and seeing the games, so playing for United is just a dream come true. It’s what I’ve worked for my whole life. Being at United is everything I’ve always wanted, so I’m just happy to get the deal done now.”

Van Gaal was pleased to see Blackett agree fresh terms, saying: “It’s the strategy of the club. We want to educate players of our own youth academy in a cultural Manchester United. We want to keep them.”

1699~~~
Hate to be the cynic but we could have given him a contract to get some sort of resale value from him if not this year, then maybe the next.

Hope I'm wrong and he really comes on, but you would have thought we will sign 2 CB's this summer, so he is going to find it very tough to break in properly.

1700~~~
Hate to tell you but at the end of the day, it's what a contract is about these days.

1701~~~
He doesn't have potential. He's rubbish.

1702~~~
Sure thing. Keep hating him then. You must be pissed at this new contract <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1703~~~
Can't say I rate him much. His touch isn't good enough.

1704~~~
I don't hate him, I just think he's rubbish.

1705~~~

1706~~~
I will be in the minority but if it was a choice between McNair and Blackett, I would like to see Blackett given the nod. Not a slight on McNair but I really like Blackett, he did well at Arsenal and I think given the chance, he would perform well again.

1707~~~
Id be happy with either. I thought Blackett was abit unlucky to lose out to McNair towards the end of their playing time earlier in the season. Blackett looks like he would be up for the physical battle more then McNair though, but i trust what ever LVG goes with.

1708~~~
Blackett's been garbage in every U-21 game I've watched this season. McNair, on the other hand, has been quality.

1709~~~
Agreed.

1710~~~
He can be too casual at times but I think he has it in him to be a very good defender. Has the basics covered IMO, just need to fine-tune them. Also the Van Gaal comments makes me wonder whether he is involved in the U-18 training sessions as well...anyone care to clarify that? If he is, that's very exciting.

1711~~~
U-18s?

1712~~~
Err, the youth team training sessions.

1713~~~
Not from what I know.

1714~~~
MCNair is a bit more experienced but he will be bullied by drogba.. Blackett on the other hand has the physical presence to keep up with him and he's left-footed..

1715~~~
Just like he was bullied by Lukaku?

1716~~~
He would be a concern against Chelsea's u21s. The idea of him playing against their first team at the Bridge is too much to even contemplate

1717~~~
Surely if van Gaal likes his left sided centre backs then he'll play. I do have more confidence in him than I do McNair, he appears to be a bit more level headed too.

1718~~~
He preferred Jones and Smalling when Rojo was fit so I think it only matters when we're playing 3 at the back.

1719~~~
I see your point, when SAF was manager we never had these type of conversations about left sided centre half's. Although I don't recall us ever playing three at the back under him.

1720~~~
Under SAF, I remember Vidic playing on the right with Evans and on the left with Ferdinand.

1721~~~
Vidic mostly played on the left with Ferdinand on the right, although there was one season where they swapped but it was only for a few matches then they changed back.

1722~~~
Care to elaborate? Blackett has some interesting qualities, levelheadedness isn't one of them. In fact, his lack thereof is why I doubt he'll make it at United, despite being physically and technically gifted. McNair isn't as athletic but his head is screwed on considerably straighter.

1723~~~
People acting like McNair is a win, he was far from convincing in back four on the ball, often thinking he's got plenty of time like he was with u21, while the game has been so much more faster and physical. I felt with every touch with him under pressure, closed down from strikers. Blackett looked the same though even I thought he looked quite more composed than McNair at times. Also wining in pace apart that physical thing. The big concern is his positioning but still I wouldn't care less if we played him. 

It's not like we are playing for the title anymore and not like we have a big choice with Paddy as the second option..
We should do our best to beat them but we are not under pressure at all I'd say.

1724~~~
LVG will decide to troll this whole debate by playing Tom Thorpe.

1725~~~
Neither of them is a great option, to be honest. LVG's left-footer thing has really hurt us. Without it, the two youngsters who'd have got their chance would have been Keane and Thorpe, both much more highly rated by those who watch the youth sides. It's all hypothetical, of course, but I can't help suspecting that either of those two would have ended up  being a much more positive back-up option.

1726~~~
Yeah, Rio was always on the right apart from those few matches.

1727~~~
Didn't I said that ?

1728~~~
I knew someone was going to question me on that. I've read a couple of interviews with van Gaal talking about Blackett and he's spoken very highly of him indeed.

McNair on the other hand, I recently read story in the paper about him and Pereira offering money to some girl to have sex with them.

1729~~~
Sort of but you made it sound like that it was a permanent thing.

1730~~~
Permanent ? Vidic side was dependent on who he was playing with. He was on the left almost all the time because he was with Ferdinand almost all the time.

1731~~~
Well to be fair, if you haven't watched the U21's like we have, and seen some terrible Blackett performances like we have, you'd probably think he was a very level-headed, calm player based off his time on the pre-season tour and in the first team. That's what I really don't get - aside from the Leicester game, I was impressed with Blackett's performances in the senior squad, but they were nothing like the sort that he put in regularly at lower levels. I've never really rated him, he has all the physical attributes and is good with the ball, but he's shown in the U21's that he's simply not good at defending.

I've not seen any U21 games this year mind, so maybe he's improved his game there, but in the last 3 seasons or so when I've watched the U21's he's never looked like a player who'll make it here. Especially when you consider our U18 prospects - Tuanzebe, Fosu-Mensah, CBJ and RoShaun Williams.

1732~~~
He hardly played many U21s games this season with the 3 matches ban after his red card.

1733~~~
I didn't know that a red card at senior level affected lower levels. And I thought 3 match bans were for red cards as a result of violent conduct, not for a professional foul?

1734~~~
I'm not questioning Blackett's professionalism - he's quite dedicated by all accounts - and if that's what you meant then I guess the word 'levelheaded' was confusing rather than wrong. And, while letting tabloid SEX SCANDALS influence your opinions is almost always a great idea, this particular SEX SCANDAL had nothing to do with McNair as he wasn't even aware of, let alone on-board with, Pereira's solicitation.

1735~~~
He's played 9 games for the u21's and been poor in most of them

1736~~~
He had another red card playing for the U21s.

1737~~~
A reflection of how badly he's been playing.

1738~~~
Fairly sure McNair is right-footed.

1739~~~
I think Van Gaal likes McNair because of his ability on the ball.. Some of his passing is excellent, i remember him playing a perfect through ball to set Rothwell 1v1 with the gk from our half in an U21's game recently.

Blackett dallies way too long on the ball to suit how we play now, and he serms to switch off a lot during matches and get caught out.

1740~~~
You'd be correct.

He's played right-back this season.

1741~~~
Im simply saying that McNair wasn't bullied by Lukaku, yet for some reason you think Drogba will bully him and not Blackett.

1742~~~
The truith is both him and McNair had some good and some abmyssal performances. The rest is personal preference.

Personally i never feel safe when Blackett is playing. Whenever i see him play I can't help but think that he is rather good when he does not have to defend...

Neither is an ideal choice but sometimes that is how a player shows his worth - being thrown into the deep.

1743~~~
Abysmal is pretty harsh, they were thrown into the deep end. They might not have put in a world class display but considering the circumstances they have both been very good. I know among a lot of fans, it's either 10/10 or a waste of space but overall both have been very good.

1744~~~
I don't remember much of the game tbh but hasn't Lukaku played out wide?

1745~~~
Sorry to say but he looks so out of his depth in the Premier League. Seems off the pace on the ball and off the ball.

1746~~~
Very very annoying performance and a pointless sub. Does he not know a full back is supposed overlap his winger? Stood there watching90% of the time.

1747~~~
Can't see him being good enough, deer in the headlights springs to mind. Loan next season for sure.

1748~~~
i havent seen anything from his first team appearances yet to say that hes ready for this level

1749~~~
The worse thing is he doesn't actually ever look out of place at the U21 level.

1750~~~
Hilarious he came on, as opposed to Rafael.

1751~~~
Like I said in the substitutions thread there is no chance Van Gaal would have brought on Blackett for "tactical" reasons. Blackett unfortunately isn't good enough

1752~~~
Worst cameo ever?

1753~~~
Poor lad. That was really shit.

1754~~~
He looked so promising at the start of the season.

1755~~~
Terrible. Gave Di Maria no help whatsoever.

1756~~~
Tbf Di Maria also gave him no help with that terrible back pass.

1757~~~
Only came on because LvG either felt Shaw was tiring or he'd decided beforehand that Shaw wouldn't play the 90.. Blackett looks out of his depth.

1758~~~
I feel like he plays with one eye open and the other asleep

1759~~~
Looked like an awful defender to me. Decent on the ball though for a CB.

1760~~~
I just don't think he's a left back. Certainly not one to offer a forward threat when we're chasing a game. 

I'm reserving judgement on Tyler Blackett the centre back.

1761~~~
Stood like a lemon, when overlap was on staring at Di Maria bum. Rafael should have come on.

1762~~~
The more I watch him in the first team the more I wish our group of promising defenders in the U18s can grow up faster.

1763~~~
It was his first game for ages but he added nothing and it's no coincidence that Chelsea's attacks intensified down our left after Shaw went off.

1764~~~
I get what you're saying but i've always thought he is a very limited player. Granted hes young and learning i still expect more. Take McNair, hes not the finished article but i can definitely see promise there. Blackett not so much

1765~~~
I don't think he's good enough to make it in the Premier League, let alone Manchester United. He's a terrible left back and only looked half decent the few times he's played at centre back. If he can improve there, then maybe he'd be an option for one of the smaller teams in the Premier League, but I really don't see him improving that much. Surprised he was given a new contract when he's nothing special, nothing special at all.

1766~~~
So he is, my bad. Guess I just disagree with Van Gaal about McNair's merits vs Keane's or Thorpe's. Fair play to the lad though, he was decent today.

1767~~~
McNair's miles ahead of him..

1768~~~
He put in one very good cross, but otherwise had a bit of a shocker when he came on unfortunately.

1769~~~
Why was he not overlapping? Terrible from him. We should have brought on Rafael.

1770~~~
Why was he brought in ? Weird decision by LVG chasing a game.

It was like he was still half asleep.

1771~~~
Shaw was slightly injured and he's the only left back on the bench.

1772~~~
Could have just put a more attacking makeshift one at LB (Even Di Maria) or just put on Rafael even.

We were chasing the game and they were pretty much bunkering.

1773~~~
I was thinking the same thing. Also, I didn't mind us playing an emergency 3-5-2 in order to grab that goal.

Back on Blackett... the more it goes, it's clearer he's Championship material. No disrespect, but I can't see him make in in the Premier League either.

1774~~~
He's hopeless.

1775~~~
Looks to me like he could do with a full season on loan in the Championship playing 40 odd games at centre half for his development and to toughen him up. That league is pretty relentless.

Then review it in summer 2016. Would agree that he's not ready for us yet.

1776~~~
Agree with that sentiment. McNair was great today, as was Shaw.

1777~~~
Not his fault. 

To be expecting him to play like a LB was never going to happen. I honestly think we shouldnt have brought him on at all and brought on either Rafael or RVP and just changed shape. Instead he looked like a CB playing at LB.

1778~~~
Puzzling from LVG. As others have said, even if Shaw needed to come off, I would rather have seen ADM, Rafael or even Januzaj at LB. Its not like there was actually going to be much defending to do from that point in the game.

1779~~~
Very poor again. Brainless tbh, don't think he will make a PL defender let alone a United one.

1780~~~
Exactly; the gap between the two of them was so blatant. McNair was easily one of our best performers today.

1781~~~
Yeah, wouldn't be too sad if he left in the summer.

1782~~~
Absolutely shit. Probably the worst sub appearance this season.

1783~~~
Did he sign a new contract?

1784~~~
Yeah he did didn't he. Maybe he can get a loan deal somewhere. Either way not too fussed about him at the moment tbh

1785~~~
you can't judge him after this cameo, hasn't played LB for some time and with poor diMaria infront of him it's always going to be tough. Maybe you can't judge him after this season either, you would have to think Januzaj is shit too then.

Anyway he's defender who can't defend and I don!t see him being potentialy good at any other than LCB positions but we won't play with 3 at the back anymore.. I guess we should loan him and either he has a wonderful season to restart it here or we will sell him for some little money. McNair, Tuanzebe, Fosu-Mensah, Williams are better prospects I believe.

1786~~~
Hope he never plays for the first team again. I've always said he's too clumsy.

1787~~~
Put in a very good cross but otherwise anonymous. Not sure where the negativity is coming from, hardly had enough time to make an impression one way or another.

1788~~~
While it did look like he should have overlaped, Di Maria never uses that option so he would have only being closing Di Maria's space. You could see that he wanted to but it would have been a clear instruction not to limit Di Maria's space. Especially considering there is a 90% chance Di Maria will lose the ball.

So while frustrating, it was probably the right thing to do by Blackett.

1789~~~
Well Di Maria waved at him once to push forward, so I doubt it was a instruction to be honest. I just don't think he's a very good fullback.

1790~~~
Di Maria probably is under instruction not to give it to the blue team but that doesn't stop him. He is a very instinctive player and so is the game, so no doubt that some scenarios call for a player to make their own mind up on the spot but in this case, I fully understood Blackett not going, even though I would have liked to have seen him go.

1791~~~
He wouldn't have limited Di Maria's space, would have rather pulled a defender with him to cover his run and give Di maria more space.. Plus it was so obvious that Di Maria was waiting for that overlapping run

1792~~~
Player out of his depth in the championship last year out of his depth at Stamford Bridge shocker.

1793~~~
Why would expecting someone who has played most of their life at LB to play like a LB never happen?

1794~~~
Don't think he is going to be good enough for us even in 2 or 3 years time.

Mcnair on the other hand was superb and has been much better than blackett.

1795~~~
I think people are too harsh to him.....he isn't a good left-back option if we must attack for the last minutes and he hasn't played in a football match in the last weeks.

1796~~~
I just don't rate him whatsoever.

1797~~~
correct.

He has confidence...and a pretty good CB.

1798~~~
He's just not a very good footballer in all honesty. To be brutal, I'd say he's a championship level player.

1799~~~
But he's a LB?

1800~~~
I worded it wrong. 

I meant hes been playing CB for in the first team with the players around him. I honestly do think its difficult changing positions like that especially if youve been training for a while for a specific position. I wouldnt be surprised if Blackett has had all his training for CB (whether in a three at the back or not). 

Kinda like how Jones went from CB, to RB to DM to CB. Although he was CB at Blackburn (and most of his career) changing these positions will not be good for his development and then to see him play his usual position will be a bit alien to him.

1801~~~
This is it. I don't have anything against the lad and he does have a good amount of composure about him, but he's just not good enough at this level. We have better defensive prospects coming up as well.

1802~~~
Played well against Leicester for the U-21s. Held Evans hand (Evans was shit) and played a few very good through balls, one of which led to our equalizing goal

1803~~~
I kow it's a game of opinions and people see things differently but I always see him at being very god with the ball at his feet. Decision making can make that look different at times but in regards to actual ability with the ball, I think he looks quite natural. It's just a different style which people aren't used to and therefore they think he isn't good.

It's like the old saying, he has a good touch for a big guy. No, he has the same touch as everyone else, it just looks different.

1804~~~
Shouldn't be a part of the first team squad next season. Sell or loan him. Not good enough yet, don't think he'll ever be.

1805~~~
I mean we can all slate him but the fact is that he's not good enough for us.

1806~~~
Wasn't really his fault for the goal

1807~~~
Has no business playing in the Premier League at this point. Especially not against one of the best attacking sides in the league.

Might do a job for a Championship side on loan next season, but it's hard to see him become a regular feature in our defence at this rate.

1808~~~
McNair is a converted midfielder and can still defend better than him. Young is a winger and is better at LB than him.

1809~~~
I'll bet anyone a grand he'll be at Sunderland or one of those teams in a couple of seasons. 

No where near good enough for us and I don't think he ever will be

1810~~~
Criticism in the match thread is way OTT

1811~~~
Two words. Can't defend, Martin.

1812~~~
I have no idea what he's doing at this level.

1813~~~
It wasn't his fault for the goal.

But he isn't good enough positionally nor is he good enough on the ball in tight spaces.

1814~~~
Poor substitution. Unfortunate goal.

1815~~~
I thought he had potential in pre season.

1816~~~
Useless player.

1817~~~
I'd rather have had an injured Rojo stay on than Blackett get subbed on

1818~~~
Hasnt put a foot right this season, but wasnt really his fault, just inlucky.

1819~~~
He's been helped by the number of injuries we've had this season and outside a few ok performances at the start of the season he's been pretty pathetic. 

Amazing what lvg sees in him (outside being left footed!)

1820~~~
On the contrary it was completely his fault. He was playing two Arsenal players onside which directly led to the goal.

1821~~~
should not be playing at this level

1822~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Great reply.

1823~~~
Dog shit

1824~~~
Hopefully last time we see him. Belongs in the championship.

1825~~~
Interesting decision by LVG to play him

1826~~~
No idea why Van Gaal bothers bringing him on.

Young would be a better option at left back.

1827~~~
Harsh.

1828~~~
Indeed. Utterly predictable though. You could see a lot of people already made up their mind that he'd be at fault for a goal, so of course they'd jump on anything.

In general, it's quite fun to see the reactions to deflections. If it's a liked player he's been unlucky, but if it's a player that's not liked it was 100% his fault.

1829~~~
Why was he subbed on?

1830~~~
He did okay. There was a reason he came on, Rojo was having problems and Blackett had less of them against the ultra pacy Walcott

It was a goalkeeping error

1831~~~
No idea why LvG insists with subbing him on

1832~~~
Oh this fecking place sometimes.

1833~~~
He's a fourth choice, under 21 left back with little-to-no experience.  Any other season and he would have never played.

1834~~~
Goal wasn't his fault. People need to calm down. Was good for him to get some game time.

1835~~~
That's where the fingers should be pointed. Blackett's not good enough, so why's he brought on (a second after Walcott) when there were other options?
You don't grill Blackett for having the audacity to not be good enough. Unfortunately block any way.

1836~~~
How did he ever managed to get an extension is beyond joke.

He has no brains and no business being a prem player.

1837~~~
Just saw the deflection and he's not at fault at all.

1838~~~
When are we going to learn ? these academy players dont deserve these minutes they're getting.

1839~~~
This lad went to Birmingham on loan and their fans couldn't wait to see the back of him. It's not rocket science.

1840~~~
My guess is because he insists on balance within the team. Blackett is left footed so he gets in ahead of McNair (who i believe is right footed)

1841~~~
Awareness of what's going on around him and his positioning still seems to be an issue for him.

1842~~~
It's a sad state of affairs when fans of United, who have such a rich history of bringing through young players, are so quick to lay into a young player when he makes a mistake. And if he Blackett did make a mistake today, it wasn't the goal. He was unlucky for that.

But I see promise in Blackett and I hope LvG continues to show patience with him.

1843~~~
There's a couple of us that watched the youth teams and told you despite him playing alright to start, he's not good enough. There are others that watch the youth team and are too lenient. It has always been obvious that he's not good enough to play first team football.

1844~~~
Weak link when he came on. Should have just put Young there and play Di Maria

1845~~~
Really unlucky but I think he was definitely the weak link when he came on. Probably the wrong situation to blood a youngster.

Im guessing Rojo couldn't continue, planned for 70 minutes or made too many mistakes.

1846~~~
Can only assume Rojo was injured. I guess the other option would have been to put Young at LB and bring on Di Maria/Januzaj, but everyone would have jumped on that as well since Young was our best player going forward. It's just terrible luck we seem to be getting decimated with injuries at LB.

1847~~~
I can't believe he's getting the blame for that. He was up against Walcott, in the penalty area. Another day, and that defection would've only led to a corner and some applause from the crowd.

1848~~~
Got a bit unlucky with the goal, but was generally doing good things at left back. Rojo was fading, so needed replacing.

1849~~~
The ball travelled across the pitch, and when it landed with Walcott, Blackett was far too far away from him... it was piss poor. Gave him all the time and space in the world.

1850~~~
to be fair the og itself was a bit unlucky.

but right now I don't seen anything in this player that would suggest he'd be an asset for us in the future. best off moving to a lower level club.

1851~~~
Tell me about it, its fecking disgusting the treatment some of our young british players get.

1852~~~
It wasn't, but he was woefully out of position for Walcott to receive the pass in the first place.

1853~~~
He should be winning that ball in the air before it even gets to Walcott, but he was miles away.

1854~~~
It's not just today. People knew he would cause a goal today the minute he stepped on the pitch because of his performances up until now. He came on against Chelsea and just looked completely out of his depth and his last appearance before that was against Southampton when we again lost, conceding just 5 minutes after he came on. The only thing he's ever shown is good composure on the ball. His reading of the game has always been terrible and his tackling, aerial strength and marking are all well below par at this level. We should've put Young at left back because Blackett is barely good enough for the championship at this stage.

1855~~~
Everything he touches turns into shit.

1856~~~
He played him onside and then didn't get tight enough until it was too late. However he was cold and it's why you don't change the back 4 unless you absolutely have to during a match.

1857~~~
Oh yeah I'm saying he was great(He wasn't)but I only caught the Arsenal goal on here and some of the comments seemed to suggest it was something other than bad luck.

1858~~~
He played him onside and then didn't get tight enough until it was too late. However he was cold and it's why you don't change the back 4 unless you absolutely have to during a match.

1859~~~
The error was where he plays him onside. But he's barely a Premier League level player, let alone at a top four club.

1860~~~
He's a liability. He wasn't actually that bad today but he's managed to score an own goal. Just his luck but he's just woefully inept. His level is about the Championship.

1861~~~
Championship level player at best. Bringing him on is like throwing the game.

1862~~~
It's not like he shines at youth levels.

1863~~~
Why take off Rojo?

1864~~~
This would if been the logical choice, but we know LVG's subs are never that.

1865~~~
Hes coming back from injury no? LvG probably thought he was tiring

1866~~~
He isn't ready yet for this level, and i don't expect him to feature at all next season. A loan would do him a world of good.

1867~~~
12 appearances in his debut season
He was, he looked a yard slower all day.

1868~~~
He's not good enough and won't make it at United. 

Should move to a Championship club.

1869~~~
You expect too much from LVG

1870~~~
I don't rate him either, and never understood why he got the chance ahead someone like Thorpe in the first place, but we aren't really helping him by throwing him out of the position in big matches all of a sudden. Young was definitely better option for LB today.

1871~~~
Some one tell how this utter pub player who looks like he's won a competition to play for United, keeps on getting games? Especially games this big?

I swear I've never ever seen him have even a half decent game, yet he keeps playing.

1872~~~
Looks extremely uncomfortable on the ball.

1873~~~
He was at a championship club last year and was torn to shreds.

1874~~~
Well, he doesn't pick himself.

1875~~~
I lost any faith in him after that Leicester game. Hes just shockingly out of his depths, say what you like about the likes of Fletcher, Brown or Oshea but they never looked this bad.

The only thing he has over other defenders is hes left footed so should be better playing as a LB... but he hardly does

1876~~~
I can't for the love of me understand what LVG sees in him, ridiculous. The goal was not really his fault per say, but he could have done better, I felt we'd concede once he came on.

1877~~~
He shared in the responsibility for the goal but let's review the options LVG had:

- Bring in McNair and play Jones at LB
- Drop Young to LB
- Play 352 with Smalling, Jones, and Valencia

and his choice is to put Blackett on.  Completely asinine decision.

1878~~~
Err, drop Young to left back and bring Di Maria on? We would have least had a chance of taking advantage of all that space Arsenal were leaving with him on the pitch.

1879~~~
He's not good enough for the PL let alone us. He hasn't got a scooby about positioning himself. He looks bang average at youth level. 

LvG subs have been frankly crap.

1880~~~
I don't know why LvG didn't just bring Di Maria on and move Young to LB or even bring McNair on and move Jones across, Blackett just looks out of his depth at the moment.

1881~~~
We won't see him much next season. Too many transfer plans in that formation even with theoretical chances of his improvement.

1882~~~
He's young, but he's not emitting United quality. Loan or sold this Summer.

1883~~~
Yeah, exactly that.

1884~~~
The only other team in PL where I can see him getting some game time is QPR, and maybe Aston Villa. It's amazing that he manages to get some game time here in United.

1885~~~
He's a reserve player playing for the first team, and today came up against an England international. It was a mismatch the moment he came on, really.

1886~~~
How random

Why not Burnley?

1887~~~
Not good enough.

1888~~~
Bit harsh some of the criticism, he probably should've done better to close Walcott down yes for sure but he is young and still learning the game.

1889~~~
To be fair to him, I can't be that easy to just slot back in for a few minutes every month or so.

Needs a loan spell to the Championship and a club where he'll play every week to toughen him up. Then reassess him next summer.

1890~~~
And that is not an understatement.

There is something intellectual quotient (or IQ for dummies) and it's supposed to exist in humans. This guy has fecking none! What the hell are we doing with such player when we have a whole U21 squad out there with players better than him? To use words from one of my favorite authors and should I stand in front of Blackett, my message would be simple: "Throw yourself in (down to the bottom of a well) next time, and rid us of your stupidity."

1891~~~
ok m8

1892~~~
So erudite and wise!

1893~~~
Except he hasn't done well for the u21s either. If it was Pearson, Wilson, Januzaj, or Pereira, this excuse would be more appropriate.

lol

Although I don't think Blackett is good enough for the first team, I don't think it's right to say anything like that.

1894~~~
I may be completely off base here, but I'm beginning to suspect you're not a very nice person. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1895~~~
Championship player and its been clear for a long time.

1896~~~
I may have not used the best quote to say how I feel about him. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that players who severely lack intelligence like him should just burn their dreams of playing for a big club, and then go off somewhere else for everyone's sanity.

Like someone else wrote, he's not even among the best U21s out there. So the question begs as to why he is an option on a bench and in a match against Arsenal.

1897~~~
I guess I'm the only one who sees a future for him here. He is big, strong, fast, has a good first touch, and can pick out a pass. I think he has the potential to be a real stud in the center defense.

1898~~~
Its always amusing to see people making comments about a persons intelligence based on their observations of that person in a football game, not really the most intelligent way to judge intelligence. Oh the irony.

1899~~~
Fvck off with all the harsh criticism. The goal was unlucky. Walcott went for a goddamn cross and it was deflected. You can't blame Blackett or Valdes

1900~~~
You're not the only one.

1901~~~
He didn't put  foot wrong, the deflection was unlucky. I've seen worse from Hummels this season for Dortmund.

1902~~~
Stupid thread bumped by idiots after an unlucky deflection.

1903~~~
OK then.

At the end of the day he is our 4th or 5th choice left back, he is hardly going to be a great player. It was Van Gaal's fault for me. Terrible substitution. Our two most dangerous counter attacking players stayed on the bench whilst he brought on one of the slowest players in the squad instead. Bizarre.

1904~~~
LvG has a long history of giving youngsters a chance, people say drop Young back and bring on Di Maria but it goes against the confidence LvG is trying to instill in young Blackett, and arguably the rest of the academy.

1905~~~
Indeed. I don't think he's really to blame for the goal (albeit it's fair to say he could have done better) but Blackett has been defensively frail at both junior and senior level. He needs a good loan to the Championship next season to toughen up.

1906~~~
Don't agree. The game was crying out for the pace of Wilson or Di Maria. If he was so bothered about the academy then he would have brought Wilson on instead of Van Persie.

1907~~~
I fecking gree. Its a disgrace

1908~~~
I'm not sure the rest of the youth setup would have understood a thing when they see Blackett playing against Arsenal while all insiders and outsiders know there are better youth players ahead of him. If bringing in a player from the youth system was in the books, then Wilson was the easy candidate.

1909~~~
Blackett is one of our fastest players though

1910~~~
Even if it isn't his fault, I still think he isn't good enough. I'm all for giving young players a chance, but even players like Keane and McNair have more to them. Said the same for Wootton when he was here. 

Blackett only got a chance because he is left footed.

1911~~~
Burnley's left back had some good crosses on MOTD today. His name is Ben Mee, like a pirate or something. 

How about Hull? They played McShane at LCB in a 5 man defense this weekend. McShane!

1912~~~
In a parallel world, yes.

1913~~~
I meant Van Persie. Blackett was at fault for me though. He was stood right next to his centre backs but behind the line. He left Walcott onside and in space. I don't want to be too harsh on him but I don't think he has a long term future here.

<a class="username" data-user="84160, @NoPace" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84160/">@NoPace</a> 

Mee is a City academy graduate.

1914~~~
What about the fact he can't read the game, poor at marking and slow in the tackle?

1915~~~
He really isn't.

1916~~~
I don't care why he got his chance, he got it and the others (Wootton and Keane) didn't. Rojo was only signed because he's left footed too, 100%

1917~~~
You just dont know

1918~~~
If you can pick out a pass you can read the game and you can intercept passes like he does quite often. He made a couple of good tackles and nothing slow about them. He is very athletic and it would be stupid to give up on him now.

1919~~~
Yep, I just haven't realized he is Usain Bolt in disguise. Actually he does a good imitation of Bolt with his footballing ability. 

Wouldn't expect anything but praise from you mind so I won't even bother.

1920~~~
NO. I guess you didn't see how he matched Jordon Ibe of Liverpool for pace in preseason. You don't watch dude closely. He has a similar laid back style to Rio who had pace for days in his prime

1921~~~
Why the hell is that?

1922~~~
If he was right footed no one would even speak of him.

1923~~~
Who gives a damn though? He's been given his chance and thats all that matters. You're not given a chance at United if you're completely shit. Why wasn't Reece James given first dibs?

1924~~~
Reece James was loaned out to a league 1 side right? He isn't good enough either. Had Blackett been right footed he wouldn't have even got a sniff and probably would be at a championship team right now. That's his level. That's why it matters.

EDIT - Wootton played against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He wasn't good enough either and is at Leeds now where he belongs.

1925~~~
Surprised that none of the younger defenders coming through our academy have much pace. The drop off in pace from Smalling/Rojo/Jones to Blackett/McNair or Keane until he left is really noticeable.

1926~~~
Tuanzebe, Fosu Mensah, Williams are on their way !

1927~~~
The deflection was unlucky, really unlucky. However, playing Walcott onside wasnt unlucky, it was just bad defending in the first place. I think Rojo did this earlier in the game, the only difference is Rojo played on Ramsey and then carried on and cleared. Rojo played on Walcott and it lead to a goal through a deflection (OG tbh).

Im not going to rate him on this game. I say it again, its not his fault. How many games has he played for us as LB? Not youth, I mean first team? Since the Leicester game, it seems he always has a mistake in him. That Leicester game where he got sent off was the worst thing that could have happened to him.

I do think he needs a loan spell away from the club next season and to be playing every game (and in one position).

1928~~~
I said this about Blackett about a month ago in the McNair thread
"The problem is he's a defender who's pretty poor at actually defending. Rio had occasional lapses in concentration but Blackett regularly makes the wrong decisions, gets over powered by smaller opponents, gets beaten in the air by smaller opponents, pushes up when he should drop back, doesn't track runners well and gives the ball away in dangerous areas. Its no coincidence that he looked good in pre season because opponents were lacking fitness and sharpness as he is good on the ball when he's not pressured but he's looked poor since then. He's a cb who only looks comfortable playing on the left side of a 3 at the back as he gets a lot of cover from the other cb's and from the wing back."
Since then he has made at least 1 big error and given away chances in every under 21 game either by playing a stupid pass in a dangerous area or by allowing the ball to beat him without noticing there is an opposition player behind him. Im all for allowing young players time to develop if they are showing signs of development or improvement but he keeps making the same mistakes over and over again. People can say he wasnt to blame for the goal today and perhaps it is slightly harsh to blame him but he played Walcott onside, then was slow to react to the situation sauntering back when he should have been sprinting to get back to Walcott and then hanging out a leg rather than actually committing and making sure he blocked the cross. Everything he does just seems very half hearted as if he doesnt want to over commit to a decision but then he ends up getting caught in two minds and ends up doing nothing.

1929~~~
He should be absolutely nowhere near a Manchester United squad.

I'm sorry, but he's a Championship level player right now.

1930~~~
I want to come in here and back him uo and add a little perspective but it's just not going to go down well.

I'll wait unitil Juan's blog so everyone has cheered up a little.

1931~~~
The thing I find funny is the people defending him. Not one of them would put money on him staying at United.

Hell I'd say putting money on him staying in the Premier League is a risky bet.

He's quite simply not good enough. People given Evans so much shit on this forum, but at least he's a Premier League quality defender.

1932~~~
I would go even further than that: he's Football League Two caliber at the moment.

1933~~~
unlucky with that deflection but agreed, he is not good enough.

van gaal was planning to sub rojo no matter what, should have been blind to LB and bring on a midfielder.

1934~~~
We would sell him in the summer.

1935~~~
No Championship.

I don't think Blackett is anywhere near good enough but people need to stop repeating the same stuffs every time he made an appearance.Especially when the deflected goal isn't really his fault.

Well that's simple not true.The likes of McCullough who was released by us at 18-19 are currently League One regulars.

1936~~~

Unacceptable at this level.

1937~~~
Nice to see a local lad in the first team, but he's horribly mediocre.

1938~~~
I mean that pretty basic stuff. If you're up against Walcott you should at least be switched on.

1939~~~
I don't think Blackett is good enough for us but ppl are going after him because his mistake (from which he recovered really well actually)  led to a goal even though in the same game defenders who we have bought for 15-20 million made multiple errors

1940~~~
He's done everything wrong there. Shocking stuff. People were harping on about Ramsey's pass, but Blackett made it easy for him to pick out Walcott there. You'd get less space in the Sahara desert.

1941~~~
I was just about to ask why on earth Blackett was in the middle of the pitch there.

He's never shown he has even average concentration or an average football brain, here or in the Reserves.

I've never seen anything about him that says Manchester United first team, besides his athleticism.

1942~~~

the new Mickey Silvestre

1944~~~
He is aware of walcotts pace and was caught out minutes before but walcott was offside. you say unacceptable but he isnt the first to do it and wont be the last. He is playing vs players with quality and pace that he hasnt faced before. A massive exaggeration to say unacceptable. He is young and learning

1945~~~
This!

1946~~~
Perhaps he already calculated the one step in the front and he will be offside ?

1947~~~
A still frame of Rojo playing Ramsey onside when he ended up clearing the ball off the line would look just as "unacceptable".

1948~~~
We can keep saying this but the fact is he isn't even as good as Keane and McNair. Technique is poor. Poor positioning. Wasn't stand out in the reserve team. Would not be anywhere near the team if he was right footed. Looks shit at both CB and LB. 

He isn't good enough. He isn't even good enough for any other PL side let alone Manchester United.

1949~~~
Im not one for writing people off. I believe he will have to make massive improvments to have a role here. But he has been given a chance by someone who knows a bit about young players. He is athletic, good on the ball, can play 2 positions, if he can improve to the level we need he will be very handy.

1950~~~
Tbh, what I think happened was that he asked the coaches who were already here from the U21 team who the left footed defenders were. James and Blackett went on tour as a result. Blackett started the season poorly with his performances at Swansea, Burnley and Leicester. He was specifically bad in the latter two.

1951~~~
I really dont see what LvG sees in Blackett - can it really just be because he is left footed?
As I honestly cant see any other reason why he keeps getting games - his positional sense is horrific, has been at fault for several goals this season.

I know he is still young but even McNair is lightyears ahead of him.

1952~~~
Think Hull is very likely to be his last game here. Its just a case of whether we loan him before selling, which I think will be the case. Promising sign that LvG gave him a chance - unfortunately he's not very good. I don't follow the U21s nearly as closely as some here do, but I think I'm correct in saying he never even stood out at youth level, so there's no reason to assume he's suddenly gonna turn into a good player just because he's 21.

1953~~~
Linked up well with Periera  in the second half against Club America. They had a few sexy exchanges down that left channel, Schweinstieger too.

1954~~~
he did well. I liked when he knew he could not just get the ball and take it, he hit it against the attacker's feet to get a goal kick.

He will improve and will be a useful squad player to have.

1955~~~
I agree

1956~~~
He and Evans were good on the left last night.  I think there is a good footballer in him somewhere, we just need to play him in the right spots and stop throwing him in against Chelsea and Arsenal in the closing minutes.

1957~~~

According to Luke Shaw, Blackett is the player who is in the gym the most, morning and afternoon.
