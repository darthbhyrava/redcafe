Welcome to Manchester United

2~~~
Best looking player at the club.

3~~~
Is it up on the clubs website yet?

I think he will be a fantastic signing for us.

4~~~
He's going to be a massive crowd favourite

5~~~
Welcome to Manchester United Daley Blind! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6~~~
More importantly, welcome Mrs Blind <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7~~~
Welcome to United. I hope he can surprise me and become more than a utility player.

8~~~
Welcome Daley.

9~~~
Blind and Angel, the Sun headline writers are gonna have a field day this season.

10~~~
Welcome Daley, we really needed a player like him. Really cheap too, considering how versatile he is, and him being the player of the year in Netherlands.

11~~~
Why haven't <i>United</i> confirmed this?

12~~~
Welcome Blind. A very satisfactory summer, I doubt we can achieve these kind of heights in the future. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

13~~~
DevilsQueen is delighted.

14~~~
United haven't confirmed it yet as per usual.

15~~~
Good signing for a very good price. Well done Ed.

16~~~
Welcome to Vanchester <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

17~~~
Daley Blind you're the love of my life
Oh Daley Blind would you let me shag your wife
Ooooh Daaaaaaaley
I want that curly hair too

18~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyOUjz_kpn8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He can tackle!

19~~~
Welcome!

Probably one big announcement with the other signings.

20~~~
Really good signing at a great price. I see him being a bigger success here than some of our other additions.

21~~~
Good signing, happy with this.

22~~~
Why is he so cute bros?

23~~~
I think he ll be great for us. With our present midfield should walk into the team straightaway.

24~~~
Yeah but has he really though? Or is it like the Bundesliga player of the year award that Kagawa allegedly won?

25~~~
Finally a compilation with great music...  <span style="color: #ffffff">this is the white bit</span>

26~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

27~~~
Kagawa won foreign player of the year if I`m not mistaken ?

28~~~
He's probably the best left-footed centre-midfield player who can also play both centre-back and left-back in the world.

29~~~
Very excited about this<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> He culd be an important part in our future (hopefully successfull) team.

30~~~
Welcome to United. A major upgrade from Cleverley.

31~~~
a great signing...... You know for sure that an Ajax produce, can always pass & play well!

32~~~
He sounds like some kind of braille newspaper.

33~~~
I don't even know if that's an award? As far as I know Kagawa won the 'player of the year' vote on some German website so we all decided to strip Marco Reus of the official Bundesliga player of the year award and unofficially gave it to Kagawa after he signed for us.

34~~~
Yesssss <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

35~~~
Cos the press officer is lazy and is going to announce a load of signings and exits in one statement.

36~~~
Great signing. Said it before, if he turns out to be half as good as his dad was, United have got a great deal. Don't forget he provided the ball for RvP's diving header wonder goal in the World Cup.

37~~~
Welcome Daley Blind. So happy with the signing. Hopefully he's not turning into Kleberson (look good in World Cup but in the end was shit).

38~~~
By the way how to spell his name. Blind (with how we spell e) or Blind (the meaning of can't see)

39~~~
I'm more excited about this deal than the Falcao one.

40~~~
You spell it the same way you just did. Twice.

41~~~
Brilliant news! Probably been asked before, but what was his main position in Ajax this year when he won player of the season? CM or LB?

42~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

43~~~
MUTV interview at 8.30

44~~~
Nah seriously you know what I'm trying to ask here. I'm having trouble to spell his name. I actually having trouble to spell De Gea as well. British, American, Aussie and Spanish seems have different way to say his name.

45~~~
That reaction<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

46~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

47~~~
Oh you mean pronounce. Sorry, didn't realise you weren't English. I think you say it like - Bl-in-d.

48~~~
LOL
At least you are helping. I appreciate it thanks.

49~~~

50~~~

GET IN!

51~~~
It rhymes with wind, if that helps. I mean, wind as in air, rather than wind as in wind up merchant. I now realise English must be hard to learn.

52~~~
He's dreamy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

53~~~
Interview on MUTV

54~~~
He sure is happy.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

55~~~
Not on the feed they are broadcasting in Norway <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

56~~~
I'd bum him tbh

57~~~
Sky reporting the club view him as a defensive midfielder.

58~~~
He's a marketable face that's for sure.

59~~~
The seeds are being sown <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

60~~~
What shirt number will he be getting?

61~~~
yep just seen that good news

62~~~
I'm very happy that we got him. He can fill in at left back/wing back and be the perfect central midfielder to partner Herrera. He's very calm and assured in midfield. Defensively, he's solid and demonstrates great awareness. On the ball, he demonstrates good passing and technique. He's perfect for linking our defence and midfield and a great outlet for central defenders to look out for.

63~~~
A Dutch DM, fine by me. Welcome to the club, hopefully he will be brilliant

64~~~
I really believe he can prove to be an excellent supporting cast member to our superstars.

65~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

66~~~
I'd page <a class="username" data-user="23903, @Successful" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23903/">@Successful</a> to this thread, so he can decide.

67~~~
Welcome to United Daley, top quality signing

68~~~
American and British are probably the main reason why it is so hard. They seem having different things in spelling and pronouncing. The worst things are they changed some Spanish name like De Gea. I said De Hea because that's how Sky Sport and BT sport said it. LOL. But Spanish and American have different ideas.

69~~~
Hottaammn, he looks good!

70~~~
Welcome to Man Utd!

He's a versatile player of quality and he should do well here. Get him in that midfield immediately.

71~~~
Might not be the most glamorous name this summer but he fills several positions for us and should hopefully be a really useful player for us in the coming years.

72~~~
What squad number will he get? 17?

73~~~
I agree. But the English language has so many words that are exactly the same or pronounced the same so that makes it difficult. There, their, they're, kitchen sink, sink as in sinking etc. Must be very confusing. Apparently the Argentinians pronounce Rojo more like Rocko yet the Portuguese pronounce it Roho I think.

74~~~
I hope 15.

75~~~

Handsome bastard. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

77~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

78~~~
We've turned into a pretty handsome team recently.

79~~~
He does look good in a ManUtd shirt.  No homo.

80~~~
He's going to have to convince me he's the right man for the job, never been impressed with him.-

81~~~
He should be given a number in the 20 region, making a statement this is not a top notch signing. Let him have Cleverleys number.

82~~~
Di Maria and Rooney kinda lowers the average

83~~~
Welkom Daley, laat zien wat je waard bent!

84~~~
Awesome. An intelligent, composed, ball playing central midfielder.

85~~~
My god. He is a bit gorgeous.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

86~~~
Nevermind about that, he's gorgeous.

87~~~
Excellent, hopeully he will hit the ground running, as he is already accustomed to LVG's philosophy

88~~~
He's handsome little scamp. Really happy with this signing, think he'll do well for us. Versatile squad players, they can be a godsend at times.

89~~~
Blind is really good at reading the game, although not the most talented he uses his intelligence to make the most out of what he has. Very exciting deal, our first real midfielder with good defensive capabilities.

90~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/oT5Ater.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/oT5Ater.jpg"/> 

How tall is LvG?

91~~~

92~~~
6ft 4in I think. Dominant.

93~~~
It is all about the "philosophy" at Manchester United this season...

LVG thought he could teach the "philosophy" in 3 months, but after 2 weeks with Jones and Smalling that jumped to a full year...but i'm hoping Blind can be LVG's voice on the pitch and get that timeline back down to a couple of months and kick start the season.

94~~~

95~~~
He'll be a great signing.

Shame he's arriving the same day we're signing Falcao and selling our best academy player of the last few years to a direct rival.

96~~~
He's a Manchester United fan and it's a dream come true to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

97~~~
I think he's exactly the type of player we need so I'm very pleased with this signing. Blind and Herrera is a massive upgrade on what we've had for the last couple of years that's for sure.

98~~~
A defensive midfielder......an actual honest to god defensive midfielder..................YES YES YES YES YES!

99~~~
Merely a bonus.

100~~~
Blind is only 5 ft 11 in.

101~~~
I love players like Blind. I so hope he's a success here. He'll put himself about and improve our side.

102~~~

103~~~
Part of me wonders if he's been bought to play the central role in the three man defense, with his ability to step forward and play the ball.

104~~~
Just watched his interview, he's a fan of United, so is Rojo, Di Maria only want Manchester United if he was to leave Madrid and Falcao supposed to have turned down City and Pool.. These are the players we need, players who want to play for the club like De Gea and Rafael!

105~~~
You mean how you pronounce it? The 'i' is pronounced as you pronounce the 'i' in the word 'literally' or 'different'. So you don't pronounce it like you do when you mean 'can't see'. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Apparently he's been told that in the beginning he has to focus on the midfield positions. He should be a starter there at least for now. That's what his manager said on Dutch TV.

106~~~
Look at him... a winner

107~~~
Pleased with this signing; hopefully the talk of him excelling recently as a DM will translate into the Premier League for us.

108~~~
He's a midfielder. That's good enough for me.

109~~~
Poor Daley Blind. No one gives a shit now we've signed Falcao.

110~~~
And some people still think he won't be an upgrade over Fletcher and Cleverley.

Not to mention he won the above award, playing as a DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER. Caps for emphasis, given so many caftards seem to post that we haven't signed a defensive midfielder.

111~~~
Why did they use a comedy shirt for this?

Anderson could fit in that thing a few times over FFS.

112~~~
Welcome to United Daley.

113~~~
Daley Blind is very handsome, as is Mata !!

114~~~
Feet on the ground kinda guy, feel he's got a key role at the club off field as well as on.

115~~~
Hopefully he will be a very important signing for us. Many of the top clubs have a ball playing defensive midfielder who do wonderful jobs and usually fly under the radar, and from what I have seen of him he seems to fit the bill.

116~~~
Wow, we actually bought two central midfielders this window (maybe even 3 if you consider Di Maria to be used as one). Have we finally learned?

117~~~
What a handsome man <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Looking forward to seeing how he goes.

118~~~
Hope he can be the next Carrick for our team. Alonso for the anti-Carrick brigade.

119~~~
Actually I think that's the perfect way for him to arrive. The spotlight will be off him to an extent and he can just get on with helping us out in a crucial area.

120~~~
I have my reservations about him but I'm 100% on board with him proving me wrong, welcome to United Daley! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

121~~~
Will be an underrated, shrewd signing.  Not a big name but has an important role as a Def MF.

122~~~
Poor lad completely overshadowed by Falcao.

I really hope he does well. Boy, do we need a good midfielder.

123~~~
In terms of getting some balance back in the squad, I think Blind may be the key signing. With him, and hard runners like Di Maria and Herrera in midfield, hopefully the days of other teams waltzing through our midfield are over.

124~~~
Of all the summer signings, I want him to succeed the most, because, I feel like if he clicks, both our defensive and forward problems will be diminished.

He could be like the final piece of the puzzle, ala carrick in 2006. A shrewd signing.

125~~~
This is my thinking. Despite the big names we signed I think Blind <i>could</i> be the best signing.

126~~~
I always feel he was a backup option, that is why we went for him so late despite him being available all summer. I think we were trying to go for other players like Vidal and it didn't work out. That is why we turn to him. However, he is still an upgrade to what we have in our current squad so i think it is a important signing.

127~~~
Agree 100%. He will quite simply provide the spine and coherence while others still get to grips with the setup. 

-----Di Maria-------Herrera
---------------Blind

with Strootman likely on his way later... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

The forwards/wingbacks will sort themselves out, the quality is definitely there. Back three will take some time settling, maybe another singing later, but will be far better protected than they have been recently.

128~~~
Oh wow, he is gorgeous.

129~~~
Ye, agree with most of the posters on here. The least 'glamorous' signing of the Summer (apart from looks wise) could well be the most important signing of the summer. Hopefully our new unsung hero.

130~~~

131~~~
IT HAPPENED!!!!
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

132~~~
Only racked up 4 pages. Hopefully the start of a great time at United.

133~~~
Personally havent seen him too much, my Ajax supporting mate though, raves about him. Thinks he'll do really well here. Lets hope so!

134~~~
Pleased we got him in, think and hope he will become a vital piece of the squad.

135~~~
Could be the vital cog that finally makes this team tick pending the possible arrival of Strootman. 

Versatile as well so hopefully won't take long to establish himself.

136~~~
Has he worn the 17 before or something? I'm a little surprised United gave him that when 15 was properly available, but I guess nobody expects Nani to return, so it might not matter.

137~~~
17 was his number in Ajax

138~~~
I see, makes sense than - thanks <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

139~~~
Agreed. I think LVG figures at least he can provide cover at LCB, LB (we really have no backup for Shaw whether or not we're playing 3 or 4 at the back) and DM. 16 million isn't insane to pay for the first option as Shaw's backup and the backup DM to whoever we buy (Strootman) once Carrick (who is 33) moves on next summer or the year after.

A smarter, better passing O'Shea who is familiar with the formation Van Gaal is trying to implement (which I'm not really a fan of), has improved massively in recent years and is only 24.

The big question mark for me, having only seen him play 10-15 times, is if he has the athleticism for the Prem. He seems to have trouble with power and pace (like Evans). He got beaten for a goal last week in this way, and certain fast wingers might give him trouble when he's out left for us.

140~~~
2 birds with one stone; give Blinder his preferred number and make Nani feel there's no number for him if he comes back

141~~~
I'm loving these classy number reveals we are doing. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

142~~~
Blind and herrera are technical good options and good passers but both lack the physical presence we miss to stand up against the likes of Toure.

Still hope we sign Carvalho one day, he seems to be the next midfield powerhouse but for the Moment we have players good at interceptions by reading the game well in Carrick and Blind rather than tackler.

143~~~
They are rather beautiful <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

144~~~
Why did he play as a WB and not a DM for Holland during the summer?

145~~~
Same as Rojo's reason, his countries other(actual) wingback options were shite. When he didn't play, wasn't it Kyut at LWB?

146~~~
That might be just wondering you wouldn't play him as a DM if that's his best position. I've never seen him play in midfield so i'm eager to see

147~~~
I agree with quite a few posts on this thread in thinking that this could be the signing we need to work the most .

I would love us to play with a diamond in the middle with blind in front of the back 4 , rooney at the top and di Maria left and Herrera right . Shaw and rafa giving us the width on the flanks .

Impretty sure blind will play the holding role until ,in my opinion strootman comes in be it January or next summer or carrick can regain the form of 2/3 years ago when he returns to full fitness .

It looks like LVG will be sticking with this 3 5 2 so if thats the case then blind knows whats going to be asked of him so its better the devil you know in that position as hes played there before under LVG .
My guess is young will be flogged off in the summer and blind will then provide competition for shaw on the left hand side of defence unless he does enough to cement the holding midfield berth himself.

148~~~
Daley Blind is a useful versatile player but which is his natural position? DM? LB? CB? 

Plus can he become better or is he a temporary solution and will be on the bench as soon as LVG gets the players he needs?

149~~~
Blind played DM last season in Ajax, for which he was awarded player of the year in Holland. His agent said that Blind were told that he will play in tha position in United. He played LB the year before though, he has hardly played as CB I believe.

150~~~
OK, but I hardly believe he is the world class player LVG wanted to integrate in the squad.  More like a good sub.

151~~~
Because he's capable of being good in both positions and they had a good DM, better put Blind at LB and De Jong at DM than Blind at DM with De Jong on the bench and someone who doesn't have a clue at LB.

152~~~
He's stunning, him with Herrera and Mata in midfield would be drop dead gorgeous. Hopefully we won't stick Di Maria next to them. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

153~~~
Sexy XI:

-------------DDG---------------
-Rafael--Evans--Rojo----Shaw
-----------Blind------------------
-----Herrera---Pereira-------
-----------Mata---------------
-----RVP---------Falcao------

154~~~
Wow RvP and Falcao up front, that's just mental. I don't like the defence though.

155~~~
Wrote about him in the newbie section as I attended 10 live games last year so ill post here aswell.

A lot of people on here and rival fans will be surprised by this guy as he is the balance to our unbalanced team. He plays the Carrick role as it plays to his strengths. He is the builder of the team always looks for the ball off the Cb's and moves it on. His main asset is that he has great passer of the ball whether it is long or only 10 yards, he is no passenger always available and wanting the ball. He is underrated on here as the passes he did in the WC is what he can do as a CDM. 

IMO this guy is our most important signing he will give licence for Di Maria and Herrera to be a bit more advanced where they are more comfortable without being left wide open. His reading on the game is also top class. Not the best or the biggest signing but defiantly the most important. If you want to know how good he is he got POTY as a CDM which is extremely hard due to the position but everything Ajax did started with him and he was instrumental and is a good tackler will be loved here I just know it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

156~~~
LVG also had Nigel de Jong available for DM while there were no other quality left (wing) backs.

157~~~
Is he better than Carrick in that holding role? Last season's Carrick was a mess, tbf.

158~~~
Last season by far it was Blind stellar season and Carricks worst but 2 seasons ago when Carrick was one of our best players it be close. Blind has better passing overall much quicker and will always know he is playing as he is always stuck in and wants the ball. Carrick is probably better at reading the game but has 10 years more experience. Blind will turn out a better player IMO and come QPR a lot of people will get a shock at how good he is. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

159~~~
------------Lindergaard-------------
--Rafael---Evans---Shaw----James--
---------------Blind------------------
---Januzaj-----Herrera----Pereira-----
---------Mata---------------
--------------RVP---------

This needs to go to a poll.

160~~~
I'm really looking forward to see him in action. Versatile to play DM or Left Back or a Left CB, he adds a lot of critical value to the team. I think, with him and Rojo we will become a lot more solid at the back and that translates into stability all over the pitch!

161~~~
Yea agree. To begin with I wasn't sure about him but along with the other signings we have made he adds the defensive balance we will need and I can see him becoming a very valuable player for us. We bought him for a good price too. When there were quotes for over £20 million I thought it was a lot but we got him for a good price in today's market.

162~~~
for those of you mentioning that he won the player of the year in Netherlands. Kagawa won the player of the year in Bundesliga and failed to impress at old trafford. Even at his preffered role he didnt impress and say whatever you want. Premier League is just different level phisicaly. Also Ajax dominates the league. We will struggle to get to top four and will be robbed of points from the "weakest" of sides. The intensity of away matches is intense and a lot of oppositions tend to press us higher than ever even at Old Trafford because they know we will be struggling to keep possession. He looked like Cleverley in that role maybe better composed but I hardly seen of him more than this world cup and couple of u2be vids to be honest. He didnt impressed me at all and I dont think he is the player on the level who whould be broght in, if he was 20 Id say okay hes got time.. but yeah hes almost 25.. anyway I'll be surprised if he turns out to be better than squad player in the future but certainly his role this year is huge and he must perform and I wish him good luck to positively surprise me. If anything I dont want to see Fletcher starting for us for more than cameos so Im glad with this signing because we obviously cant bring everyone in one window..

163~~~
Looking forward to seeing him play, as he has been bought in for the position we have been crying out for someone to fill for quite some time. Lets hope he's the real deal and not just a squad player/ stop gap til Strootman comes

164~~~
I wish the media would stop calling him a fecking defender

165~~~
Lindegaard is far better looking than De Gea indeed.

166~~~
It irritates me far far more than it should

167~~~
I hope he doesn't realize how important he is going to be for us this season. If he kicks on nicely our chances of making the top four increase dramatically. To put it, well, dramatically - but I think it's true. The signing I'm looking most forward to seeing in action, bizarre as that may sound.

168~~~
On ESPN FC they were saying that United have signed three left backs: Shaw, Blind and Rojo.

169~~~
Lot of United fans complaining about how many LB's we've signed. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

170~~~
Let them carry on, it might bewilder our opponents when they see him playing further up the pitch.

171~~~
Ay, I've seen this kind of thing a few times now. It's just poor research.

172~~~
Somehow I am anticipating seeing him play for United more than Di Maria or Falcao, perhaps because I expect him to improve us A LOT compared to the dross we've had in midfield, Carrick aside, for ages.

173~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Am sure most of the clubs use SSN/Daily mail to scout the opposition.

174~~~
As i think someone else mentioned, yes, he was lwb for Netherlands because they needed a player there and had de jong as cdm.

But why did lvg then replace blind with bloody dirk kuyt? And when de jong was injured from memory blind didnt replace him...

176~~~
Smalling over Evans every day of the week. 
+ Falcao needs to be in there, what a man. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

177~~~
Even Sky was saying that shows how clueless the media really are. The only thing Shaw and Blind will be fighting for is who has the best looks <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Can cover at LB but obviously going to play CDM shows how much football the media watch as they seen him LB for Holland at the WC and think that's his position <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

178~~~
Even worse is when they start moaning about how badly we've bought because we're playing a left back in midfied

179~~~
Exactly. You think with them getting paid high amounts of money they would know a bit about players, fair enough if they never seen him play but going around calling him a LB when he won POTY in Holland as a CDM is just lazy.

180~~~
Blind strikes me as the unassuming hard working type that will become afan favourite very quickly. The fact his thread has 5 pages says it all really. He isn't a hollywood signing but he looks humble and proud from his interviews and I can't wait to see him in action.

181~~~
This is untrue.  When De Jong went off hurt against Mexico Blind was asked to move into his position with Martins Indi coming off the bench to replace Blind in the back 3.  Then Blind played at LWB against Costa Rica and Argentina.

182~~~
Take it back. Take it back!!

183~~~
But it's true!

184~~~
You havent got good memory then.

185~~~
Surely head and shoulders should ditch Joe hart and make falcao the face of there shampoo .
What a barnet !

186~~~
No place for Rojo? Handsome bastard that he is.

187~~~
Or Blind.

188~~~
You took the words out if my mouth, can see him becoming a united hero very fast. He just reminds my if Hargreaves before his injury, hard working, hard tackling. Hope he gets a run as DMF

189~~~
His signing was sandwiched between di Mari and Falcao, so not a huge surprise this thread didn't get much attention

But I think he is going to adapt right away

Are holland playing this week?

190~~~
Scholes started out at left back didn't he. Just saying.

191~~~
When is the Netherlands game and who are they playing against? Can't wait to see him in action,just finished watching Di Maria and rojo for Argentina.

192~~~
Nope. Scholes started as a striker

193~~~
Are you sure, when he was very very young I think he was used as a LB. Im talking under-13's. Pretty sure I read that somewhere.

194~~~
No. Played up front. Cleverley played full back for youth cup winning side.

195~~~
Nah, you're confusing Scholes with Tom Cleverley. Happens a lot mind you.

196~~~
Yea it pissed me off at how ignorant they're being. Basing their entire opinion on the the WC. Idiots.

197~~~
These so call pundits are going to be so confused when they see Rojo at centre back, Shaw left back, and Blind in midfield <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

198~~~
So can anyone who watched him for Ajax give a quick summary of what kind of DM we're getting?

199~~~
Italy away tomorrow at 19:45.

200~~~
And the unfortunate thing is there is a strong possibility we will see Ashley Young at left wing back.

201~~~
No he wasn't. For the season you're referring to - Marco Reus was the Bundesliga player of the year.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=1838840.html" target="_blank">http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=1838840.html</a> for 2011/ 2012.

Kagawa was only a fictional Bundesliga player of the year for shite websites including the ever reliable daily mail :

Not one time but twice. Good job Daily Mail. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2508260/Shinji-Kagawa-joined-Real-Madrid--reveals-Jose-Mourinho.html#ixzz3CI7RST8m" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...rid--reveals-Jose-Mourinho.html#ixzz3CI7RST8m</a>

As for the rest of the post :

1. Yes he did. His role under De Boer was as a #6 and Blind was excellent. Nothing flashy but the most effective #6s aren't supposed to be flashy. Just look at the best CDM of his generation - Sergio Busquets.

2. Patty Evra is 5'7" and was torn to shreds in his debut appearance. De Gea was a stickinsect when he first arrived at United. But both of them went on to have great careers. I don't think the physicality part will make much of a difference for an intelligent player like Daley when people like Mata or Silva can play at the highest level. And apart from a little lack of pace Blind isn't physically weak.

3. Can I borrow the crystal ball ? Pretty please ? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4. Blind has a great first touch, good awareness, tacticaly astute, technically proficient and has a good passing range bordering on very good at times. He played brilliantly when Ajax faced one of the best pressing teams in modern football Barcelona and beat them, also did really well vs another great hound press team in Dortmund. He'll do the same in the Premier League.

5. About the rest I wouldn't say much because admittedly you've only seen a few matches and youtube videos. It's not a good enough sample size. But even then Blind was one of the revelations of this World Cup - gave 3 assists and scored 1, playing in a mainly LWB and LCB position - not his first choice position anymore. I dunno the last time Cleverley did that TBH. Also his great technique and tactical knowledge was on display throughout the tournament.

Blind will be a good player for United. He may struggle a bit at first but like most intelligent players he'll adapt. If he wasn't then Van Gaal wouldn't have bought him.

202~~~
I've seen tons of that, I'm afraid.

204~~~
Noway!

205~~~
Think he'll slot into our midfield well. Will help allow Herrera and Di Maria to get into more advanced positions up field to help contribute offensively if we end up with those 3 in midfield (hopefully). 

People will moan that we should have gotten a Vidal-like player for us, but I believe Blind will end up being one of the strongest signings this summer.

206~~~
Actually it doesn't.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Yft5bt3SVZZVFjyRbbpUHWGsXVFrp7KDuvGbXhDLN4MEtCeaW-bxrupRFUNEUSu0ylyKIBcgGtJ9pZ0MvyQQ6iAZRgdehk3JfGv2eoOkL5hCEOKIbAzssEhY3Bg36dkPaA" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Yft5bt3SVZZVFjyRbbpUHWGsXVFrp7KDuvGbXhDLN4MEtCeaW-bxrupRFUNEUSu0ylyKIBcgGtJ9pZ0MvyQQ6iAZRgdehk3JfGv2eoOkL5hCEOKIbAzssEhY3Bg36dkPaA"/>

207~~~
Great post!

208~~~
Can't wait to see him and Herrera in midfield together! Be so nice to have dynamic midfielders again.

209~~~
Bloody Lawro was on Irish radio the other day saying we had signed him as competition for Shaw. I mean he was getting paid for uninformed guff.Too lazy and disinterested to do any research. Abysmal work.!

210~~~
Any of you remember how Blind Sr played on the 90s for Ajax? Lots of description of how Daley Blind played seems similar to how his father played. They played the same position too if I remember correctly.

211~~~
Not the same position. Blind would be more similar to Frank De Boer who was a LCB/LB with a great passing range.

212~~~
Probably watched a couple of World Cup games, saw him at left back and just assumed that's where he plays. The press have done the same with Rojo. It is really lazy, you would think that anyone who talks or writes about football professionally would at least take literally 2 minutes to look up the player and read a bit about them. Posters on messageboards put in 50 times more effort just to learn more about players because they're interested, it's embarrassing that people like Lawro don't bother

213~~~
I do think him and Herrera can form an excellent bond in the middle for us.

214~~~
Not sure about style of play but I was thinking that having a famous father might have something to do with him being a relatively late bloomer in midfield, he might have been shying away from comparisons by playing in a different position. Could be talking rubbish though as I don't know where he played for Ajax at under age level.

215~~~
We have needed a sound DM for some time. Daley could well do the business we need right there. Has the right attributes.

Also, a lady I know saw his pic and almost swooned. 'Wasted as a footballer' she reckoned.

216~~~
Woody will have his transfer fee made back in no time, using him for marketing. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

217~~~
Funnily Enough my missus saw a photo of all the signings on FaceArse and asked who's the one that should be a model. In my muppet haste I said oh that's Falcao " he looks like a coke dealer". She then pointed out our Daley dish!!!

218~~~
Does anyone else think danny blind looks like Jorah mormont from Game of thrones.??

219~~~
He's essentially a better looking version of Iniesta but with hair. And he's not half bad with a football either.

220~~~
OK, I dont expect much anyway, hopefully you are rights

Everything we hoped Cleverley could become. If he can do it at this level........ <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

223~~~
Watched this and I was dismayed. It's like no one did any research at all. Just showed up to the studio and straight on TV.

224~~~
Did the same on BT sport and sky. Really highlights just how professional the professional presenters are really doesn't it! He should be playing tonight shouldn't he?

225~~~
I loved his goal vs Brazil in the World cup.

We do have some great passers in the team now. Blind, Herrera and di Maria all seem to have that eye for a killer pass. I would expect them to be our midfield 3 as well.

226~~~
starts tonight as a LB against Italy. Would have liked to see him in midfield, but they play there with De Jong, Wijnaldum and Sneijder.

227~~~
Ya me too.. Wanted to see him midfield..

228~~~
Holland fans will be wanting LvG back. 2-0 down already.

229~~~
Happy that we didnt buy Indi, had a bad start

230~~~
Totally. I thought so too.

231~~~
I presume it was partley because he has played CM for the last 2-3 weeks and now he is playing LB.

232~~~
Better looking than Mata?

233~~~
Was he playing LB in a back four?

234~~~
Yeah. Netherlands have gone back to a 4-3-3.

235~~~
Can't have been an easy night with Bruno Martins Indi sent off after 9 minutes.

236~~~
Don't care if he's poor at LB. Won't play there for us much.

237~~~
Holland will go backwards without Van Gaal.

238~~~
Started on the left of a back 5. Finished as a DM. Wasn't terrible but wasn't very good either.

239~~~
yeah and people who rate Blind here were all about how useful he can come being <b>versatile</b> ... can play as LB, CDM/CM and CB. I don't personally care either whether he is shit at LB and CB, where he would be absolutely last option for us IMO, but hopefully he can play good as CDM which is what we need now until we buy another midfielder(S) possibly of higher quality. But now he's got incredible chance to impose himself in the team, hopefully he won't be as shy as Cleverley.

240~~~
He'll probably be a certain starter until Carrick returns so he has about two months to prove himself. If he's good then he'll probably stay in the first team with Carrick playing a bit part role in what could be his final season for United as he'll turn 34 next year.

241~~~
The most likely scenario, yes.

242~~~
Couldn't care less how he plays when he's not wearing a United strip. Not going to claim I know a lot about him though, and I'd be surprised and delighted if he's good enough to force Carrick out the side as most posters seem to suggest wil happen.

243~~~
Didn't watch but Seems he was poor playing LB but from reading comments about the game, seems almost all the dutch team barring De Jong and maybe Sneijder was poor.

Just going off stats it doesn't look too bad for him in terms of defensive contribution or passing and i saw in highlights had one good potential headed assist for RVP too which he missed.

244~~~
I don't think he played bad.

245~~~
The guy behind this account definitely puts things like that out for RT's. He knows a load of United fans will be all over a Tweet like that. Total exaggeration, even though he wasn't good I'm sure he's had worse games.

246~~~
He is a solid player, but his game has no particular creativity

247~~~
Wouldn't take anything out of the performance overnight as he'll be playing CM for us, like others have already said.

Looks like he's a genuine goal scoring threat as well, going by that Youtube vid. Looking forward to seeing him in our side! He's no Vidal or Schweinsteiger, but let's face it, Fletcher & Clev couldn't even beat relegation quality CM pairs...so he's going to be a huge upgrade on that at least

248~~~
Didn't watch the game, but from everything I heard from Ajax supporters, he was never that great at left back. Just average even for the Dutch league playing there, but was a completely different player when played in midfield, hence he won the footballer of the year.

249~~~
Everyone has looked shite playing for their country these days, unless you are Di Maria. So I wouldn't worry at all. I mean, look at Rooney for example

250~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYdoJex-qSk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

251~~~
Well he won't be playing left back .Had a poor game there last night.

252~~~
The ignorant media would have you believe otherwise.

253~~~
Unless shaw and rojo both are out at the same time(going to happen though knowing our luck), then blind will be playing in midfield for us.

254~~~
Rooney looks terrible playing for anyone to be honest.

255~~~
according to whoscored.com he has the 2nd best rating of all starters for Holland against Italy. 

Don't know how he defended but on the ball he looked better in midfield in that highlight video.

85% passing including 7/10 long balls being accurate. Total passes 78 (2nd highest of the team)

3 Interceptions, again 2nd best after de Jong with 4.

So, if this was his worst game for Holland then his worst game has been better than our average midfield performance last season.

256~~~
I was just glancing at the game. What I saw he was neat and tidy. I would have been more worried if we had signed Stefan de Vrij, I thought he looked dodgy.

257~~~
Well, at least we know he can pass backwards 10 yards...

258~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/MPUTBWBuwWv/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This seems to be trending on Twitter even though it's from a World Cup game!

259~~~
Even the great players miss place a pass.

260~~~
Don't look too much into a friendly game when he's playing at leftback ffs...

261~~~
Highlights are mostly of him playing left back. I don't think he's all that good at left back.
Watch a highlight video (I know, I know...) of him playing midfield for Ajax, and he looks a different player.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyOUjz_kpn8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Really quite excited to see him play there.

262~~~
"I'm a good kicker of the ball"

That's a good start. 

Blinding!

263~~~
I've not seen him play that much. Would we have picedk him if not for LvG?

Hope he comes good as I think he is the most critical of all purchases.

264~~~
As soon he came in defensive mid he played better. kept the ball moving, played as an anchor so he kept back in case a player has no options. He plays the simple game like carrick which united defiantly needs. When he is surrounded by the likes of Di Maria, Mata, Falcao, Rooney, Herrera, RVP and so on. He'll have them options to pull them killer passes which he does have in his locker and provide assistance to the newly back 3 or 4 line.

265~~~
He does and he doesn't. One of Carrick's greatest (and most un-appreciated) strengths is his ability to pass the ball forwards. Haven't watched much of Blind (and it was a poor game to judge him on) but he seems a <b>lot</b> more conservative with his choice of pass.

I do wonder what he brings to the team that Cleverley doesn't. The type of holding midfield performance Cleverley put in against Arsenal in London last year, for example. Is Blind quicker? Stronger in the tackle? What are his great strengths as a midfielder? Enlighten me, eridvisie-watching caftards.

266~~~
Blind is very intelligent and good tactically IMO, that's what sets him apart from Tom in the anchor position who seems lost at times. He may not be the fastest or most physical player on the pitch but because he can get into "heat spots", it become easier to diagnose opposition play as a defensive midfielder. He's been coached well by De Boer. Kind of a poor man's Busquets than a Carrick clone, good metronomic passing range but not very expansive. He can't dictate the tempo of games from a deeper position like Michael can. Very good in the tackle too but he's no Keane or Vieira. One thing I've noticed instead of clattering in, there's a sense of dispossessing the opponent rather than breaking up play much like Busquets. Which works out well because then you can immediately launch a counter or threaten the opposition backline instead of conceding free-kicks.

267~~~
Ok, thanks. Sort of Carrick without the penetrative passing, combined with Busquets without sumptuous skill. 

On that limited basis (and what I saw yesterday) I reckon he will divide fans massively but be a useful enough signing all the same. All the sideways/backwards passing will raise a few hackles, that's for sure.

268~~~
Yup pretty much. A lot of fans will unreasonably expect him to be the midfield messiah they crave but Blind is clearly not that guy and might never be that guy. What he is though is a consistently solid no-frills midfielder that can act as a placeholder until we get genuine quality in. Even as it stands he's probably our best midfielder bar Carrick (circa 2012/ 2013) and Herrera which just proves how desperate the situation really is. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

269~~~
WOW, Carrick is a penetrative passer now? The guy is a cautious pussy who mainly passes backwards and sideways and doesn't have the balls to go for 50-50 challenges. Hopefully, Blind will be a few steps up over Carrick.

270~~~
If he can be the 'mop' in the midfield, allowing the likes of Herrera and Di Maria, maybe Strootman after January, to be their expansive selves, then as far as I am concerned, he will have repaid his fee and then some.

In the big games also, I wouldn't be surprised to see him and Carrick as the double pivots either. Think there is some definite potential for that to occur, IMO.

271~~~
That's harsh. He was an extremely penetrative passer in his prime.

272~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Thought the same..

273~~~
Here we go again.

EDIT : BRB with proof to the contrary.

274~~~
He really wasn't, better distribution and vision, but never incisive forward through balls, that really wasn't his game.

275~~~
From April last year. Number of <b>forward</b> passes made over the 2012/13 season. More than any other footballer in the whole of Europe.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.kalooga.com/thumb?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FBIKTf2GCcAAMIGW.png&amp;md5val=e3fd2318b935c000a5e0f6339c457c5a&amp;key=0c47976a5f10265b1b740d2b8c6b5aed358c4826&amp;method=fit&amp;size=1920x1200" src="http://img.kalooga.com/thumb?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FBIKTf2GCcAAMIGW.png&amp;md5val=e3fd2318b935c000a5e0f6339c457c5a&amp;key=0c47976a5f10265b1b740d2b8c6b5aed358c4826&amp;method=fit&amp;size=1920x1200"/>


See what I mean, though?

With this kind of crap being spewed about Carrick, poor wee Daley is gonna have a hell of time winning fans round. I also think we'll badly miss that sort of progressive passing. It's why everything was so slooooow with Clev and Fletch in midfield. Hopefully this is where Hererra comes in.

276~~~
You can see what he's trying to do. Curl it with the outside of his foot to the full back (or CB it looks like?) opposite to him... but when he took that first touch, the ball continued to move towards him, causing 1 of the most epic mishits of all time <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

277~~~
Not through balls but forward passing really <i>was</i> his game. Few better at passing the ball from deep areas into the feet of the front four.

278~~~
I thought he was. When we were near the opposition box he played some excellent balls forward into the feet/in front of our players. Not saying it was the main point to his game but he wasn't a backward and sideways passed as the poster I quoted said.

279~~~
Carrick carried a hole midfield that season. He was very good that year we last won the title!

280~~~
He's much better as a holding midfielder.

281~~~
So absence <i>DOES </i>make the heart grow fonder! I can't wait till Carrick's back and we all start moaning about ineffectual he is as a centre-mid. Why do you guys think we're in this pickle in the first place? It's because isn't good enough. The look of fear is always etched on his face.

282~~~
Take this haters :

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s28.postimg.org/pf48hksml/Untitled.png" src="http://s28.postimg.org/pf48hksml/Untitled.png"/></a>


Last season despite being out of form, Carrick had 73.9 % forward passing rate per 90 mins.
Modric and Alonso who were among the "better" midfielder across Europe had 67.3 % and 69.9 % respectively.
Caf darling Kroos and someone branded the "best midfielder in the world" by some had a tremendous 64.9 %.
Gunodgan in 2012/ 2013 had 64.6 %.

He also had more key passes than Alonso and more than Gundogan from 2012/ 2013 and about the same pass length as the others.

In Fergie's last season, the forward passing percentage was over 75 % !! Sideways/ backward passer my ass.

283~~~
Who, Carrick? Is this a joke?

284~~~
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder. But what you posted before was shown to be bollox.

285~~~
As per my previous post, we'll miss those forward passes and I'm not sure who's going to provide them. Blind is definitely a lot more conservative in terms of his passing options.

Herrera is much more willing to take a risky pass but his pass completion % is quite poor for a CM.

In conclusion, central midfield remains a problem area.

286~~~
Um, Di Maria?

287~~~
I was kind of hoping he'd be further forwards. Don't really want him being the first CM to get the ball from our defenders. He's wasted that deep. Personally, I'd like to see him wide in a front three or out on the wing.

It's all to with this "transition" shit that Mourinho is obsessed with. As soon as the opposition attack breaks down you want to get the ball to the feet of your attacking players as quickly as possible. Di Maria hanging back is one option but I think we'd be better off if we had someone else to make that first pass that turns defence into attack.

288~~~
You've came to that conclusion even though one has yet to play a game for the club and the other two new recruits have yet to play more than 60 minutes? We need another midfielder, I'm sure of that, but whether or not our midfield is a problem area remains to be seen. Herrera and Di Maria provide boundless energy and flair and I'd take that above passing percentages any day.

289~~~
How is this a bad game?

290~~~
Hmm, true. Still, Herrera is every bit as capable as Carrick at doing that job though, obviously less proven in the PL but his stats (same format as above) were really impressive in La Liga last season as I recall. Hopefully he's back from injury shortly. 

Di Maria doesn't need to be too far forward, not to the extent Mata does anyway. He was practically a box to box midfielder for Real last season. His work rate and energy is ridiculous.

291~~~
I'm definitely jumping to conclusions.

Do you not think that <i>every</i> midfield benefits from someone really pulling the strings, though? A really precise and accurate passer who will consistently hit the target 9 times out of 10 but also has the range of passing to switch play really quickly, from defence to attack, or side to side.

Assuming you do think a good team needs someone like that in it, who fits the bill in our current squad?

EDIT; Probably Herrera, I assume. <i>Hopefully</i> Hererra.

292~~~
I wish people would stop using his time as CM at Real Madrid as a reason to use him as a CM here.. There's no Ronaldo/Bale on the wings here, he will be much, much less effective. Using one of the best attacking players in the world in a box to box CM roll is such a waste and I will be fuming if it happens.

293~~~
Yeah, this season would be far less problematic if we still had the Carrick of 12/13. What a beast.

294~~~
So where would you use him?

295~~~
Actually we do still have Michael Carrick, now you mention it! 

Obviously, he was gash last season but who wasn't? Against top opponents, him and Blind might be our best bet at the base of midfield.

296~~~
On either wing, preferably the right wing where he can tuck inside if needed or go wide when needed. Our team as a whole will be much better with players of his quality dragging defenders out of position and allowing more space in the middle. I've seen it in every PL game thus far, teams know our wings are probably in the bottom 5 of the league so it's easy to deal with us 1v1, whilst flooding the centre so our actual quality players have no room to play. I don't think Young/Valencia have beaten a man yet... It's obvious that last year our games where Januzaj was wide and playing well, the team played better, not just because of his individual ability, but because of the points I made above.. Players are scared of these type of attackers, so they lose shape etc etc.

297~~~
Generally, yes, I'm a big fan of that metronome kind of midfielder. With that said, I don't think it's completely necessary. The Dortmund side that did so well didn't have that kind of player. I wouldn't say Atletico had one last season either. I think energy and creativity in the middle of the park was more important and I think we're on our way to sorting that out.

I said in the Carrick thread yesterday that I think he'll still play a big role in our side on his return, mostly due to reasons you outline above. I haven't seen much of Blind at all, but as long as he has the balls to take the ball from the defenders on the turn then I'll be happy. It should be nice to have a different option in there at least.

298~~~
Carrick is hideously underrated here. He literally carried our midfield singlehandedly for much of the 2012/13 season until Scholes gave him a helping hand. A top, top midfielder.

299~~~
Right, but you realize he wasn't remotely as good a winger as he is a midfielder?
Hehe, I know we do, it's just difficult to imagine him hitting those heights again, especially with the injury.

300~~~
My problem with Carrick is that he's quite slow and he takes an absolute AGE to pass the ball sometimes. If we ever get to a fast passing system, Carrick will slow us down and stand out like a sore thumb.
He's also 33 so how long could he or even should he be playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world?.

301~~~
Not sure he's that sort of player (admittedly on very little evidence!). Seems like a very low risk footballer. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. 

Good points about Atletico and Dortmund.

302~~~
When you see what he can do on the wing like in the Germany game, don't you think it would be a bit of a waste of his talents having him in centre midfield?.

303~~~
What? No. He's a better midfielder than winger. It'd be the exact opposite.

304~~~
Yes he is. One good season as CM surrounded by the worlds best players in one of the most one sided leagues and you think he's a CM.. He's obviously a winger, just has insane vision and passing ability which makes people like you automatically assume he's a CM. He's not <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

305~~~
You're right, yes, what possible evidence could there be for me thinking he's a CM, it's not like he played there the entirety of last season in which he was one of the world's best players, or plays most of his matches for Argentina there, or looks like he's going to be used there for us. How silly of me.

306~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Okay, okay.. Why aren't you adressing the rest of my post about how he was surrounded by some of the worlds best players, and now he'll be playing with Young/Valencia on the wings. No matter how good you think he is as a CM, I will bet my god damn house on it he will be less than half as effective as a CM for us and you're welcome to screenshot this quote and bring it up in 8 months time <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

307~~~
You probably won't be here to do that.

We won't be using either of those players when we have a fit squad, btw.

308~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

309~~~
So what squad are you suggesting? A narrow 4-3-1-2 with Falcao - RvP partnering eachother <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ? Everytime I see someone suggest something like that it makes my arse laugh. And trust me, I'll be here.

310~~~
Shortening the odds.

311~~~
I think we should bet money on that. You in?

312~~~
It's true

313~~~
Erm, sure lol. What makes you think I'd leave?

314~~~
Haven't heard that one before... 

Why's that even funny anyway? A midfield diamond probably suits our squad more than any other formation.

315~~~
Because shoehorning our players to get them all to play is screwing up our balance.. It doesn't work with the 3-5-2 to get Rooney/Mata/RVP playing and I'm confident it won't work to get Falcao in there either. If we had an Aguero type striker then maybe so, but two up top isn't going to work with our current players, no matter how hard we try. 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 is the winning formula.

316~~~
Young definitely has.

317~~~
I'm guessing most are guessing what he'll be like at DCM?

318~~~
Carrick can play a great lopng ball and incisive pass, his problem for me always in an attacking sense particularly in big games was that he struggled a hell of a lot under pressure and he did/does often pass the ball backwards of sideways. I have never been a big fan of Carricks to be honest but an ability to play an incisive pass (with time on the ball) is certainly something he isnt lacking. Also positionally he is very good defensively, something I certainly hope Blind has an ability for

319~~~
It's also pretty unlikely given that our three highest earners are centre forwards. Rooney's best form has come as a second striker and he was pretty decent with RVP under Fergie so I'm sure we could find something that works. It's hard to judge their partnership under the shambles that was Moyes and our midfield last season.

The diamond suits our midfielders, a regular back four suits our defenders and the formation in General allows us to play 2 up top. Van Gaal is his own man but it seems he obvious choice with this squad. There would be much more shoehorning going on if we tried to force Rooney or RVP out wide in a 433 or Di Maria and Mata into a 352

320~~~
Which was his only consistantly good season for Madrid and do you realise he played in central midfield earlier in his career?

321~~~
That's why I'm saying we don't.. I also don't think LVG will play without wingers, and as he stated that Di Maria is like Robben, he will be a winger or a forward, not a midfielder. Also not using wide men is criminal with how good Falcao is in the air.

322~~~
Probably our biggest failing as a team this season, so I doubt he'd be the worst offender!

323~~~
Back to my first sentence then, do you think we'll drop two of our 3 highest earners, one of which is our captain?

324~~~
<a class="username" data-user="41579, @Vato" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41579/">@Vato</a> thinks that he was never inconsistent.

325~~~
It remains to be seen, but for the good of the squad I feel it needs to happen. Being our highest earners has nothing to do with starting or not anyway, not for me it doesn't, and I don't think it matters for LVG either.. I'm sure he'd drop Rvp/Rooney/Falcao at once if Wilson was performing better than them for example.

326~~~
How come people can't remember that Van Gaal said the only reason why we were playing 5-3-2 was because we don't have good enough players to play 4-3-3, Van Gaal also said the reason why we are not playing with wingers was because "we don't have good enough wingers like a DiMaria" that was when he mentioned DiMaria that got everyone speculating.
Van Gaal said that he wants to play 4-3-3 long term.

327~~~
This is going massively off topic but feck it did you know not watch la liga last season or even remotely hear about it. It's best league in the world at the moment in terms of players and  competitiveness To say that role Di Maria was doing was easy is nonsense. The role was so easy that he mange not to win the league.

328~~~
The Carrick abuse is hilarious. Our midfield has been poor for quite some time now but its because we didn't have enough quality to put alongside Carrick in a midfield two or three. Dunk reckons absence makes the hear grow fonder but in reality he just has a very short memory. Either that or he started watching United last year. 

Carrick isn't the answer anymore as he's 33. He can certainly play a big part this season but I hope Blind and Herrera step up now. But the division of opinion on Carrick is staggering. He's not Nani who's shown glimpses of brilliance amid torrents of shite. He's been a top class midfielder for the best part of a decade. He was out of form last year, there is no doubt about that but he wasn't helped by the fact that he was the only midfielder of any quality that we had.

329~~~
30 points from winning to 5th. 20 from 3rd to 4th. Hardly competetive. Whilst the PL had a 20 point gap from 1st to 7th. But yes, it is the best league in terms of players, I said that already..

330~~~
It's not the sideways/backwards passing that's done us in (although it hasn't helped) what's really fecked us over has been our CMs dwelling on the ball for ages before trying any kind of pass.

331~~~
Has he actually said that though? I've seen it said and I've also thought I've read it/heard it myself, but I'm not sure. If he has said that, why has he also implemented 3-5-2 in the youth teams? The first team players are irrelevant to them, surely they don't also lack the players for 4-3-3?

332~~~
He also pointed out that the 3-5-2 allowed him to play with two strikers. It wasn't <i>just</i> because of the players we didn't have, it was also about fitting our best current players into the team too.

If it was simply a case of signing a quality winger then we'd never have bothered trying to adapt to a 3-5-2 in the first place. Some sort of 4-3-3 might be the long term goal but 3-5-2 is the main plan for this season (I think) as it allows our top heavy squad to play with more central attacking players.

That's why the diamond would strike me as a possible alternative (if we're lucky). It essentially has all of the plus points of the 3-5-2 but with a more secure back line.

333~~~
Yep he did say all that, i can't remember which interviews he dais it but i'm sure they are in his interview thread.

334~~~
Who said anything about leaving?

335~~~
Oh i'm sure we will stick with 5-3-2 this season, maybe even parts of next season but he did say his wanted to play 4-3-3 long term and i'm sure after another 2 or 3 transfer windows have gone by and he has the players he wants, he will switch.

336~~~
Oh I get it, I disagree with you so I must be a cnut and I'll eventually be banned. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

337~~~
My opinion is best not taken as gospel though, to be completely honest. People like <a class="username" data-user="28916, @jojojo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28916/">@jojojo</a> or <a class="username" data-user="86804, @Raul Madrid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86804/">@Raul Madrid</a> are probably better suited to give a more correct analysis. More often than not I'm watching a game and don't even realise someone is playing shit until it's pointed out. That plus having horrendous memory isn't really helpful for giving a good summary about a player's season.

338~~~
There is no doubt he is a massively talented player, one o fthe best in the world, but never inconsistnt? He still has Nani like moments, and on the wing seemingly more so, remember him being linked with moves away as little as two years ago.
I do think as a central midfielder he needds the right players around him to truly flourish, which he had at Madrid. In a totally differnt way I think he may have that here, time will tell....but never inconsistant I would certainly not agree with.

339~~~
Bad Cina -  you bully <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

340~~~

341~~~
I wonder if Cruyff feels the same about the likes of Viktor Fischer, Nicolai Boilsen, Lucas Anderson or in the past the likes of Jan Vertonghen,Thomas Vermaleen, Christian Eriksen leaving their clubs at young ages to join Ajax?

342~~~
Starts left wingback tonight.

343~~~
Darnit - Holland need to find a good LWB and have Blind move to center. Anyway, hope he has a good game to build some confidence for Sunday.

344~~~
His long pass is just great, hope we will play him in midfield.

345~~~
Just got a good assist against Czech Republic.

346~~~
That's the plan, apparently.

347~~~
That left foot of his <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

348~~~
Any gifs of the goal?

349~~~
Better header than cross imo

350~~~

351~~~
Yeah, the cross is nothing special. The header makes the goal.
But an assist anyhow... And Falcao can header like that, so it's all good.

352~~~
It's a cross that found it's mark, which is something.

353~~~
He does have a good cross on him, seemed to put a few good ones in the first half too. Decent game all in all, his pace - or lack thereof - hasn't really been as bad as I've seen made out. His stamina levels seem strong and his long passing resembles Carrick of two seasons ago.

354~~~
So let me get this straight. He picked up the ball wide, got it out of his feet while looking up to see who was in the box. Then before the defence could get in his way he whipped a ball into a dangerous area and the attacker headed it in.

What a novel idea, why don't we do that?

355~~~
The cross wasn´t spectacular, the way he controlled the ball before and already had the pass he was going to give in his mind was good.

Had another nice low cross/pass in, in the first half iirc, was decent defensively, had an allright or good game.

356~~~
Good game from him, very solid defensively, some good passing and positioning in attack. You can see it's not a natural part of his game, but that's not why we bought him. 

He isn't fast by no means, but if he's played as DM in 3 man midfield I don't think this will be an issue. Decent mobility I guess.
I like his first touch, seems to be able to create space for himself easily.

357~~~
I'm excited to see him in midfield for us now. Tonight he started as left wingback then LB when they switched to 4-3-3.

358~~~
Made a post in the Euro thread but its more relevant to this one.

359~~~
Nice summary for people like me who didn't watch the game. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

360~~~
His distribution puts our defenders to shame bar Evans.

361~~~

362~~~
Was I the only one who nearly shit him self reading the manutd.com headline 'Dutch reds suffer injury-time woe'.. I thought Blind was injured for a split second <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

363~~~
There was a moment near the end where the Czech's broke, Martins Indi raced out to close the guy with the ball down and Blind tracked the central runner and cut off the passing avenue to him, simple stuff I know but it was good to see the awareness instead of getting drawn to the ball that was on his side of the field.

364~~~
Yep, I was impressed by that. He doesn't have the pace to recover ground like Jones would for instance, but he is positionally excellent and intelligence - as vague as that sounds - is his best asset.

On a side-note: did anyone notice how infield Blind was playing at times? His positioning there was quite prevalent and I don't know if it was under instruction or not, but it seemed a bit odd. A few times when the Czech's initiated a counter they exposed his flank and you would look back to see him centrally.

365~~~
From what I've seen of him he's a very intelligent player, a managers dream.

366~~~
Did he play as LB or CDM? How did he do?

367~~~
Article from ESPN talking about Frank de Boer on Blind's preferences:

368~~~
I think Blind will need some time to adopt - not only because of the league but also United playing different than Ajax under de Boer.
Hopefully we will give him a run as DM/CM and not make experiments.

369~~~
I suppose so - but I am sure there would be games where he subs Shaw/Rojo off and puts Blind in there. Thats the thing about this man- the flexibility will give us various tactical options during a game as well. There were Holland games where he played all 3 positions!

370~~~
me too. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> blind picture was under that headline.

371~~~
Blind 17 sounds like a Japanese / Chinese movie about a group of mystical assassins.

372~~~
He's apparently a CB according to that moron Robbie Savage, who I think only put him in there ahead of Evans in order to have a pop about having no youth products in the team.

373~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Exactly what I thought when I read that nonsense this morning. Agendas flying around everywhere from within the industry at the moment.

374~~~
What do you mean by "agendas flying around the industry at the moment"?

375~~~
Many current managers, ex-manager's, pro's and ex-pro's passing comment on all things United at the moment, most of which is unsubstantiated and sometimes total nonsense.

376~~~
I believe the lack of knowledge of these pundits about Daley Blind has been remarkable, so too the hoopla about Wellbeck leaving United to join Arsenal. It happened nearly two weeks ago, and the media still can't let it go it seems.

377~~~
Including our very own Paul Scholes

378~~~
So it looks like his debut will probably be at left wing back if Shaw, James, Smalling and Jones are out. Which is bound to confuse people.

379~~~

380~~~
For what it's worth the boss said he likes Blind as a defensive midfielder, would certainly support Sky's claims he has been brought in to play as such.

381~~~
I wish I had his hair. 

Also, excited to see what he can bring to the side as a DM.

382~~~
Definitely so even if that isnt the case tomorrow due to shaw not being fully fit.

383~~~

384~~~
Most of the media think Rojo and Blind are leftbacks. They're gonna be so confused to see them both in the team, with Shaw at left back <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

385~~~
Just his hair?

386~~~
I was thinking the same. 

Even Gary Neville was saying few weeks ago how we will strengthen in the LB department (Blind was not official ours) and Carragher was saying that we don't need 3 LB's. I was just WTF do you really can't just open the internet for a second and look where this players really play.

387~~~
It will be funny to see their reaction when the team is announced and their predictions and the way they change their tune at fulltime.

388~~~
Couple of games in van Gaal will be hailed as a wizard for turning these two left backs into a centre back and a midfielder! The current crop of commentators are really sub par!

389~~~
As I'm also an Ajax supporter, just when to their website and clicked on a video, watch this <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-TV/198127/Ajax-Heracles-Almelo-200.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-TV/198127/Ajax-Heracles-Almelo-200.htm</a> . 0:20, this is typical Blind stuff you can expect here at United. He is so tidy, smart, has great vision and his technique is very good, ofcourse this level is lower than in the PL, but when he adapts for us, he'll be great.

390~~~
He's going to be a big upgrade on Fletcher. Also hoping he's got Herrera and di Maria playing beside him.

391~~~
Craig Burley called him Danny Blind today on ESPN FC.  Danny's a bit old to be playing football.

392~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

393~~~
ESPN FC has shit pundits. Like each and everyone of them is a fecking useless piece of garbage.

394~~~
Great post.
I'd also add some points to the Bundesliga player of the year discussion because there seem to be some misunderstandings regarding that topic.

There are 2 awards in Germany.

One is the <b>VDV</b> (Vereinigung der Vertragsfußballspieler: the German equivalent to FIFPro) <b>Player of the Season Award</b>. This is the award which is commonly called <i>'Bundesliga Player of the year/season'</i>.
It's voted for by all professional players who are members of VDV and every proffesional who plays in the Bundesliga can receive it.
Taken into consideration are (or should be) performances in the national competitions only: Bundesliga and German FA Cup (DFB Pokal).
It's the less prestigious and newer of the two awards in Germany.

The more prestigious award is the <b>Player of the Year in Germany Award</b> (Fussballer des Jahres).
It's voted for by the VDS (Verband Deutscher Sportjournalisten / Association of German Sports Journalists).
Additionally to every Bundesliga player all German players abroad can receive this award (which hasn't happend since the end of the 90's and the decline of Serie A).
Taken into consideration are all club performances (league, national cups, EL, CL) and all performances for the player's country.

Kagawa has won neither and actually finished outside the top 3 in both awards.
In 2011/12 Reus won both those awards.
Bundesliag Player of the season 11/12:
1.Reus (30% of the votes) 2.Ribery (16%) 3.Huntelaar (13%)
Player of the Year in Germany:
1.Reus (26%) 2.Hummels (13%) 3.Lewandowski (11%) 4.Kagawa (8%)

Sometimes it happens though that different players receive the awards.
In 13/14 Reus won the 'Bundesliag Player of the Season' award while Neuer won the 'Player of the Year in Germany' award on the back of his WC performances.

395~~~
Brand new info. Nice ! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

396~~~
Kagawa won player of the year in some magazine vote I think. Certainly nothing official but he was voted the best player somewhere by some people

397~~~
Kagawa won "best player in the Bundesliga voted by Manchester United fans after he signed for United" award.

398~~~
His United debut, he'll polarise some United fans I feel. Maybe time to change the title to "Daley Blind 2014/15 Performances".

399~~~
looks like hes in the 5th season with us , composed , calm

400~~~
Impressed by Blind so far. Quick, one touch passing. The difference a competent midfield makes...

401~~~
Could do with a bit more strength in that holding mid position, but on the ball he's excellent.

402~~~
Perfect cover for di Maria and Herrera.

403~~~
Took the words out of my mouth.

404~~~
Playing great. Team is playing great, im jizzing

405~~~
Good debut so far. Keeping it simple in possession and not wandering out of his zone. 

QPR playing like shit, but still... very good debut.

406~~~
Love what I'm seeing so far. But he's got minimal work to do in fairness. His passing is great though.

407~~~
Early days, but he looks like he could be invaluable to us in the holding role in midfield, especially until we get a better option like Strootman (hopefully).

EDIT - Though we can't place too much emphasis on it. QPR have been the footballing equivalent of a corpse in the hands of a necrophiliac.

408~~~
Both him and Herrera must be annoying to play against. Always snapping at your heels.

409~~~
Noticed that. he fell down two-three times when trying to tackle.

410~~~
Wonderful half.

411~~~
His anticipation is excellent

412~~~
The Dutch Carrick

413~~~
We'll play them both with Herrara <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

414~~~
Quality.

415~~~
Needs to spend some time in the gym. Other than that he is brilliant

416~~~
Gonna be our most important player this year. We're keeping the ball so so much better. Might struggle under more pressure but with this diamond we can just rotate 90 degrees and have herrera at the base instead. It's been quite fluid. 

But yeah it's great to finally have a cm that seems to be able to come and get the ball off the defence and act with the ball really quickly

417~~~
He is just what we needed and now we can just watch and enjoy how he is dictating the game from the back.

418~~~
Really good on the ball he's barely made a bad pass, He's not going to bully a midfield with tackles and strength but I can see his defensive qualities, he seems to have great awareness.

fecking hell, we seem to finally have some real quality through the middle I can't believe it.

419~~~
Gets the job done with minimal fuss. I like it.

420~~~
Him and Herrera really show how terrible the Cleverley/Fletcher/Anderson crew have been.

421~~~
Apparently we signed three left backs this summer...

...I love how the media can be so ignorant. Would have killed them to look at the many tapes of Blind playing well as a holding midfielder, like he's doing now for us, last season for Ajax?

422~~~
Fast distribution and cover for Herrera while attacking. Check. Tactical awareness. Check.

Fully efficient for Van Gaal in the debut. Good price for a good Dutch player.

423~~~
Brilliant player, great debut so far.

424~~~
Said it before, reminds me of Hargreaves so much.

Exactly what we've been missing.

425~~~
Passes like a boss. Perfectly weighted and pin point accuracy.

426~~~
Not a fashionable buy by any means, but he's going to be one of our most important players this season.

427~~~
Very enthusiastic debut game from him. He's certainly keen to impress. I think he can become something of a crowd favourite here

428~~~
Solid and with more time under his belt will grow in confidence im sure. Love the fact that he looks like he can run all day and isn't afraid to put in a challenge. Exactly the type of "water carrier" we need for all that attacking talent upfront.

429~~~
He sort of plays like he doesn't know how slow he is, running around closing down like a nutter and that. Looking good so far.

430~~~
Like a mixture of Hargreaves and Carrick, very encouraging start.

431~~~
He might be more of a utility player after watching his first half performance. His energy and ability to cover gaps in the midfield reminds me if Fernandiho at City or Hagreaves in his prime. If he keeps this up, he will be an influential part of our midfield.

432~~~
Really impressive debut thus far.

433~~~
He's the player I've been most pleased with so far. You knew what you were getting with Di Maria but Blind is a bit more unknown. He'll have much tougher games but we need a player in that position that just moves the ball on quickly and effectively. He's done it very well. No more than one or two touches every time he got it.

434~~~
I love him. Not the type to light up the show, but a very important piece of the puzzle nonetheless.

435~~~
Give him a contract for life

436~~~
Fantastic debut. Didn't think he would cover that much of the pitch.

437~~~
Got outmuscled a couple of times but overall a very impressive first half from him.

438~~~
I like how that Herrera and Blind are always hassling midfielders.

439~~~
I think he'll be seen as an upgrade on Carrick. Still maybe not as good Carrick with his passing range, but he knows how to pick a quick pass and keep things moving. Doesn't take too much time on the ball and that's everything our midfield hasn't been for a while now.

440~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He'd be one of all-time DM greats, if he were.

441~~~
If he keeps this up I might admit I was wrong!

442~~~
He's having a blinder! <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>



Nobody's said that yet, right?

443~~~
But but but we don't need another left back ;-)

444~~~
Looks like the type of player that can galvanize a locker-room.

445~~~
Great debut.

446~~~
Masterclass. Beautiful bastard.

447~~~
He was really, really good today. Will be ignored by the papers because it's a distinctly unshowy role, but he was in the top 3 performers easily.

448~~~
Love this guy already.

449~~~
Carrick after featuring on an episode of 10 Years Younger.

450~~~
My man of the match today. I love him for the same reasons I love Carrick.

451~~~
Carrick'd it up a treat today (the good Carrick), let's just hope he's not a pussy.

452~~~
He runs a bit like Hargreaves.

453~~~
He shower everythig that we missed for such a long time at united.

Wonderful performance!

454~~~
Could be the most crucial signing. Outstanding performance as midfield anchor today.

455~~~
He was great, I was expecting a shaky performance but he did he job so well. Could see him pointing and instructing the other players too.

456~~~
What a brilliant debut.

457~~~
Jah! I liked the look of Rojo as well.

458~~~
Exactly what we needed. His awareness, given this was his debut, was beyond impressive.

459~~~
A Falcao goal and it would've been an almost faultless game from all our new signings.

460~~~
Quite often your defensive midfielders or defenders have their best games when you barely realise they're playing.

461~~~
Gonna be everything Owen Hargreaves was meant to be for us.

462~~~
Outstanding debut. Looks extremely comfortable on the ball and he reads the game very well. 

Great addition.

463~~~
112 passes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

464~~~
He might get some credit if only for the possibilities his name gives them for shit puns.

465~~~
He was very good, calm and composed. Need to see him against a team that will press more to form a better opinion but excellent debut.

466~~~
Promising debut. Hope he grows and makes it his spot.

467~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bxgick8IAAEZuwX.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bxgick8IAAEZuwX.jpg"/>

468~~~
107 out of 112.

1/8 of all United passes.

469~~~
What a beautiful anchor.

470~~~
So good! Look's very confident. Played so many passes without a first touch, even when it was awkward... great body movement and always knew what was around him.

106/111 passes.

471~~~
Exactly the type of player we needed to get the best out of Herrera and Di Maria, and it showed. 

He did brilliantly today.

472~~~
Got one more in the mean time! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

473~~~
Carricks replacement.

474~~~
He's really handsome.

475~~~
A midfielder who shows up for the ball and keeps it simple <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

476~~~
I really felt that when we signed him, he would become a stalwart of composer and sensibility in our team. Today for me proved that...

477~~~
He was superb.

478~~~
This guys going to be one of my favourites, control and leads the game with a lit of intelligence.

Finally sorted that midfield

479~~~
Does everyone still think hes a leftback?

480~~~
Excellent today, sterner tests ahead. It is away from home I hope he'll come into his own.

481~~~
What's he doing passing the ball forward? Doesn't he know that United midfielders don't do that. Not the United way <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

482~~~
Keeps thing simple and ticking

483~~~
Very tidy performance. Nothing flash, just does his job. Good start to his career.

484~~~
Very confident and composed debut. His use of the ball was very intelligent and his positioning was good as well. 

Needs to add a bit more aggression and physical presence into his game though. Failed to break their play a few times despite being at the right position. I'm sure it will get sorted out in time.

485~~~
No dilly-dallying on the ball; and kept it neat and tidy and brought others into play. Still, only his first game, and he wasn't pushed/pressed by QPR though. I'd really like to see what how it goes when we play a team that presses like crazy.

486~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> My bad.

487~~~
Really solid, but today was not the biggest test of course.

488~~~
Yeah he was brilliant.

Gives Herrera and Di Maria the license to go forward.

489~~~
Very impressed. Early days but if we see more of that then he'll be a very important player here.

490~~~
Hard not to love him. I can see him benching Carrick for the big games now if he keeps this up.

491~~~

492~~~
Great decisions, nearly score from quite a distance. Amsterdam football academy for the win.

493~~~
I was impressed. Seems to keep the ball moving whenever possible. The blend with Herrera and Di Maria looks very promising. Super shot towards the end. If he keeps that level up, Carrick and Fletcher won't feature too often.

494~~~
Exactly the type of player we needed. Someone to sit in midfield and pick off their passes, and pick the ball off defenders and pass it to the forward players. A proper Carrick replacement.

495~~~
After reading the caf experts reviews, I assumed he'd be slow & not physically up to a Premier League match. Odd how he seemed very much on the pace & physically able to cope with whoever he came up against!

1 game in looks like he's been playing here years & looks to be a very able Premier league player. Many more such performances to come <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

496~~~
He wasn't really on the ball for the 15 minutes before half time either, whereas before that he was constantly moving the ball about and dictating the tempo.

497~~~
Very very promising start. He's like an ungraded Carrick.

Slightly worried about his lack of physical presence mind, especially against the better teams. For people that have seen more of him, is that something he lacks in general?

498~~~
Such a composed and classy player. Like others have said, he's exactly what Hargreaves was intended to be for us. He's got a good range of passing and anticipates things so well. Our midfield just worked brilliantly today and he was a key part of that. Just needs to add a bit more strength and he'll anchor that midfield like a boss.

499~~~
Had a good game. I wasn't a real supporter of buying him but if he keeps this up i'll change my mind. He's not the fastest player in the world and he isn't that strong but he has a great footballing brain.

500~~~
Di Maria was obviously MOTM, but Blind was 2nd best for me.

501~~~
He's a water carrier, and I mean that in the best possible sense. Even though he got forward a couple of times and had a great shot, his main job is to screen the defence, break up the opposition play and play it simple, and he did it brilliantly. He looks like the perfect player for this team - someone who keeps it simple and gives our attacking players more licence to play. Him next to Herrera looks like it's going to be a massive upgrade.

502~~~
Did simple things very very well today.

Excellent buy for us.

503~~~
Lovely performance. We've needed a midfielder who does exactly what he did today for a long time. Kept the ball moving in the right directions and gave di Maria and Herrera freedom to hurt QPR.

It'll be interesting to see if he stays as cool against teams that are, you know... good.

504~~~
A great debut today. Put in a great shift, looked good on the ball, battled hard, won a number of headers and tackles and has a powerful shot on him.

505~~~
A very intelligent player, right place right time. Perfectly weighted passes, good movement off the ball and consistent throughout the entire game. Tougher games ahead of course but it does show what having a good central midfielder does for a side. Its almost criminal that it is an area we neglected for so long.

506~~~
Finally a decent player to sit in front of the back 4. Really good and simple passing as well.

507~~~
Very good debut. He isn't the quickest, but he moved the ball quickly, read the game well and was always moving, whichever team had the ball.

508~~~
The thing I liked the most about him, he knew where to be to keep the passing flowing. Compare it to Fletcher who hid most of the time. It makes a huge difference.

509~~~
Did what they all said he does. Brought calmness to the team.

510~~~
Bossed the middle today.....enjoyed watching his peformance....

511~~~
Looks like hes been with us for years. Not the most glamorous role, and he won't be the one who steals the headlines, but that was a superb performance.

What impressed me most, was his composure. He radiates calmness

512~~~
Very impressive.

513~~~
Not much doubt that he's our best option in the role he played today, great anticipation and passing. Physically though, I don't think he's quite got the tools to dominate from there; lost a few duels that could have cost us against better opposition. But as I say, much better than our other options there.

514~~~
His head was on a swivel the whole match. He looked like a veteran rather than a player on his debut.

515~~~
Absolute class. His calmness and composure took me by surprise. Looked instantly like the most experienced player on the pitch today. Finally we have some competition for Carrick.

516~~~
He just seems like a calm and intelligent player and is what we have been lacking, especially with Carrick being out.

517~~~
Brilliant performance in my opinion. Yes, the opposition wasn't really great, but Sunderland, Burnley, Swansea aren't top teams neither.

The most influential thing about him was that he always looked for a forward pass, or to the side, but more forward. Because of that, we brought the ball back to the opposition so they couldn't put any pressure on us, which wasn't the case in first three games (especially vs. Sunderland and Burnley) were the ball was to often brought back to our defenders and all that while the opposition players weren't really far away.

In worst case scenario he will be a very, very good back up player, but I hope more....

518~~~
Sums up the significant difference he made in the side today. Add to that his familiarity with our manager and his methods and he was the ideal drop-in upgrade.

519~~~
Big games both will probably be required and maybe a system change. Couldn't see us playing a diamond at cfc, city or LiverpoolLiverpool

520~~~
The only thing more impressive than Daley's performance today was Daley's hair.

521~~~
Brought balance to midfield and allowed the team to function properly. Sexy bastard.

522~~~
Early doors, but that psychological x-factor is what pushes a good-on-paper attack into elite status.  Long story short this type of player can single-handedly keep clashing egos in check.  Instead of '<i>That's the sixth time _____ didn't play me in</i>' you get '<i>Whatever, Blind'll get us another chance.</i>'  Subtle but huge difference.

523~~~
Was as good off the ball as he was on it. Worked well with herrera.  Intelligent player. Will need to build his physique a bit for the premier league.

524~~~
Should be nicknamed the fireman, always available and goes around putting out fires. And yes you're allowed to imagine him in the uniform, but no you're not allowed to say anything about his pole.

525~~~
MOTM for me. A metronome. A balancing weight to the whole team. 

Oh shit we've got a midfield.

526~~~
Liked what I saw but will wait until we meet a more testing team to make a more defined conclusion. He was calm and kept it simple but that's the magic of the role and he played it perfectly.

527~~~
Are you Jamie Redknapp? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

528~~~
Encouraging stuff from him today, definitely an upgrade from Fletcher and Cleverley. Even though he's just moved to a more competitive league and joined a massive club, he just got in there and it was business as usual. We need players with this mentality.

Performances like this one is what earned him the "player of the year" award in the Eredivisie. He links the defense with the midfield, controls the tempo through his passing and provides cover for the two box to box midfielders in front of him with his off the ball movement, a metronome in the middle of the pitch.

I really liked how alert he was when QPR tried to press and get back in the game early in the second half. He tried to get on the ball as many times as possible and helped us slow things down and kill the game off.

I really hope he becomes an integral part of LvG's team, it's a good feeling to know that there is someone able to do Carrick's work on the pitch when the latter isn't available.

529~~~
Hiss tackling, pressing, composure, saving dodgy situations for other players. 

A beautiful debut.

530~~~
Really liked what i saw from him today, didn't display the same level of passing as carrick, but got stuck in and spread the ball around calmly. Good debut.

531~~~
I'm literally not Jamie Redknapp, I promise.

532~~~
Very similar to Busquets. I love the way he brushes the ball, has a perfect weight to his passes.

533~~~
I was literally reading your post as Jamie said basically the same thing on SS.

534~~~
Beautiful man with wonderful hair. He is the perfect sitting player for herrera and Di Maria

535~~~
Did not put a foot wrong.

536~~~
Fluid performance, only 1 gripe was how he covered for other players. He was too close and therefore closing his options to cover other players. Kranjar's shot a good case in point.

537~~~
Played like he's been here for years! Absolute bargain signing

538~~~
Top class player. He looks so classy.

539~~~
Left footers look really elegant. He's no exception

540~~~
Haha, oh dear. I shall console myself in the knowledge that people don't say 'retarded minds think alike' so we must both be pretty great.

541~~~
Perfect game for his debut, an easy game for him. Even so I was impressed. His weight of pass and awareness around him both in terms of passing and positionally defensive wise looks excellent. I think a few days ago a Dutchman, may have been Kluivert saying he brings great balance to a side, and from his debut I can see signs of this being very true.
Although the performance was a vast improvement on our play of recent times, and the result excellent, I think there is far much more to come, and the midfield 3 of Blind, Herrera and DiMaria could be excellent

542~~~
I have no idea how will Fletcher get anywhere near the team with him being fit and when Carrick returns(I am guessing van Gaal will want to give him game time from time to time). Good debut, what I like about him is his obvious intelligence and quick passing, reminds me of young Carrick.

543~~~
Looked already comfortably at home in his first outing for us and might actually make it really hard for Carrick to get back into the team. Quality performance from him today.

544~~~
Unless he drops a major bollock, I don't see Carrick displacing him when he is fit.

545~~~
I thought he was excellent today.  Looks like exactly what our midfield has been missing over the past few seasons.  That said, it would be interesting to see how he does against a team that will press us higher up the pitch.  I don't expect him to have as much time on the ball as he did today.

546~~~
So impressed by Blind today, great performance in front of the defense. I hope he is kept there and perfects the position. I haven't felt as comfortable as I did today with a United defensive midfielder in years, especially when we get any kind of pressure.

547~~~
He showed exactly why I was adament that having bought Ander, we just needed someone responsible and not too fancy like Blind to come in and play the more defensive role and bring out the best in our new Spanish midfielder. It gives more balance than the likes of Vidal who wants to attack just as much if not more than Ander.

Granted I didnt mention signing Di Maria as well <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Thats working out a treat

548~~~
He actually gets my vote for MotM.. He kept the ball moving, and comtrolled the midfield. At the start of the 2nd half QPR were man marking him with attackers for a while and I noticed how sloppy we became in possession and kept getting caught out..

549~~~
Sums it up, which is exactly what you want from someone in that position. 

Tackled well, passed accurately and was disciplined positionally. That's what his role was and he played it pretty much perfectly - albeit sterner tests are to come.

550~~~
Thought he did very well. Blind and Herrera looked on the same wavelength already.

551~~~
Great performance.

You could tell that he underestimated the strength of some players - tackled a couple of players and bounced straight off them.

552~~~
Masterclass performance against admittedly inept opposition. Still, he's provided what van Gaal has eluded to in the past few weeks; an option in the build-up play and someone to quicken the tempo and offer a platform for di Maria, Herrera, etc to thrive. If I have one criticism of his performance, it is being out-muscled in 50/50's when he has been in good positions to win it, but he was the metronome in midfield and his awareness of players around him was exceptional considering he was playing with new teammates. 8/10.

553~~~
Excellent debut and looks a steal at 14m. Not surprising that someone schooled at Ajax is so comfortable in the opening phases of play working out of defence.

554~~~
He was very tidy today, but he has pretty much 0% pressure on him all game. They never tried to shut him down or mark him properly, so he could run the game as he pleased.

Overall though he did a good job.

555~~~
But that is the beauty... if he is better than Carrick great for United, and knowing Carrick is there finally gives us some depth.  I have no issue who LvG picks between these two, both are very smart efficient players.  Bliind has more mobility and I think Carrick has some exp and other strengths.  

Bring it on ... <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>!!

556~~~
He did very well and impressed me but we need to stay real, it was QPR sitting deep not pressing much away from home, one of the easiest games this season. Arry will always play like this I can see some other sides press us higher even Burnley did that.. so must wait but was promising and the formation was a good upgrade on 5-3-2 it was basically 4-1-3-2 the central CB was pushed higher up the pitch and this role looks to be his best..

557~~~
I remember kliuvert before the game started, he said blind is one of the most tactically intelligent players VG brought in, I do not ever once remember him giving the ball away.

558~~~
Any other game he'd of been my man of the match, his willingness to take the ball from his defenders and move it forward was brilliant. For me he was key in allowing Di Maria to just play his game, carrying on like this and he'll be the bargain of the season.

559~~~
Look what happens when we have an actual honest to god midfield! 
Caf>saf>moyes

560~~~
Quietely impressed with blinds compatability with Herrera, he has very good distribution and very tidy use of the ball, while I am clear in understanding this was only qpr, its not impossible to imagine these two forming a formidable MF 2. And his 25-30 yarder wernt too bad either <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

561~~~
Good debut. Kept it simple and let others shine.

562~~~
Who was the guy who kept saying he was 5th choice when we signed him? 

He's fecking first choice now!

563~~~
Same, thought he was fantastic today,unlucky not to score too.

564~~~
107/112 passes today. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

565~~~
Lovely stuff from him. Totally bossed that water carrier role but even then, you could see that he's technically proficient. Almost all his passes were one-touch.

Also loved the fact that he got a decent shot on target! Really nice to have midfielders shooting on target from distance.

566~~~
Looked miles better than i thought he would, it is only the beginning but along with Di Maria and Herrera they make a very exciting trio.

Well done Blind! Quality Debut


<i>4:0 victories make everyone happy, apart from those eager to moan about RVP</i>

567~~~
The movement he got on that shot was just... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

568~~~
96% pass completion. Hell yeah.

569~~~
I think he will be a star for us

570~~~
I think this lack of physical presence thing is being overstated.

571~~~
Looks ace the boy does.

572~~~
Best player on the pitch today. What a performance! I'm surprised with him. The way he stole the show. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

573~~~
Massive upgrade on Fletcher. He was very impressive today, and a big part of our dominance.

574~~~
It will be very hard for Carrick to establish himself again. He always needs a run of games to find form. He mightnt get the chance now.

575~~~
Very impressive. That was a cracking debut. Always available for a pass, passed the ball crisply and progressively, and covered defensively very well. When Di Maria ha his one small blip and lost the ball close to our own area Blind covered the run of their attacker perfectly to help snuff out the danger. Far stiffer tests to come, but such a promising start.

576~~~
Neat and tidy display from him today. Went largely unnoticed due to all our attacking play.

577~~~
So calm and composed on the ball with a touch of class. Hopefully even more to come as well, though he wasn't under any pressure at all on the ball today, so it will be interesting to see how he does in a higher tempo game. Even so, it's not hard to see why he got the footballer of the year in Netherlands playing like this.

578~~~
I was a bit giddy at our overall performance, but I didn't really notice it at all.

579~~~
Against top opposition Carrick and Blind will give us a really solid midfield. I'd swap Mata with Hererra and play both of them.

580~~~
Great début for Blind. Very composed on the ball, and also got stuck in too. Very promising signs.

581~~~
Brilliant debut. Broke up play really well, has a good first touch and does the little things very well. Very encouraging start.

582~~~
Marvellous debut from him today. Didn't look flustered at any point, so composed on the ball. Was great to see the midfield interchange today and offer so much creativity. Makes you realise what we've missed over the last few seasons. 

Early days yet though, hopefully a lot more to come.

583~~~
So much better than Fletcher, in a every way. The change in formation may have also helped him though.

584~~~
He's also dreamy<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

585~~~
I have to hold my hand up on this one, I was not in favour of buying him but he was excellent today, he was a big part of why we played with such urgency as his quickness of touch-pass straight into Herrera or Di Maria consistently got us heading back in the right direction and onto the front foot before QPR could get reset.

His positional sense is obviously good but bigger tests will come when he has players like Hazard, Yaya and Sanchez running at him, especially without a strong CB duo behind him, but in the bulk of games I expect us to have a lot of possession and his orchestration from deep will be very important.

586~~~
Kagawa replacement MW ? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

587~~~
lol, some/many peeps didn't want this fella at United

great buy

588~~~
Love how he always looks to release the ball early with a one touch pass instead of dwelling on the ball with 2 or 3 touches which creates pressure on the player and slows down the tempo. It shows he is an intelligent player capable of thinking 2-3 moves ahead. Would be a treat alongside Herrera, Di Maria, Carrick and Mata who are all intelligent players with whom he can be on the same wavelength.

 Was mostly economical with his passes, prerequisite for any deep midfielder, but looked to play the forward pass whenever it presented itself. Really competent defensively as well. Was just brilliant today.

589~~~
Nah, that would be Herrera or Di Maria. But Blind is pretty awesome too<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

590~~~
Nice to see him proving so many of you wrong. As I said before, the Falcao and Di Maria signings completely overshadowed his signing, however I wouldn't be surprised if he was just as big of a signing as both of them, absolute key signing for me. 

A lot of people like to shit on our defence but I still feel a big issue we've had is no protection in front of them which has made them look worst than what they are. Blind suits this role perfectly, sitting right in front of the defence. It also gives Herrera some freedom to roam forward which ultimately will help the entire team.

591~~~

592~~~
He needs to change his profile picture.

593~~~
Seemed incredibly calm, never looked like a debut.

594~~~
Blind >>>>>> Fletcher. He did well for his debut. Although he got pushed off pretty easily a couple of times. If he bulks up, he is a going to be a very handy player for us in the years to come.

595~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

Very impressive.

596~~~
So he was not one of the 3 left backs we signed this summer after all...

597~~~
His hair is nothing short of absolutely majestic.

598~~~
Just finished watching a recording of the game after working some overtime in the office!  Very pleased and for me Blind was MOTM..He ran the show, very very impressive debut and Di Maria, Rojo, Herrera and Falcao weren't too bad either! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I don't think he "ran" the show but he tidied up very well sitting deep in midfield. Also don't think he deserved the MOTM since ADM was better than him but you're entitled to your opinion of course.

600~~~
People keep saying its only QPR. The thing for me is whilst Herrera was injured and before we bought Blind teams like QPR were bossing our centre mid area. Literally running through the middle of the park at will. They would have come here 3 weeks ago fancying at least a point. One game into their partnership and that is clearly not the case now. We're back lads, time for teams to start fearing us again.

601~~~
Those passing stats are good but that's not what impressed me the most. It was actually his positional discipline. The way not only he provided cover for the defense, but also the way he moved to receive the ball. His positioning on and off the call was excellent. Always an option for Blackett, the key reason for not making those long cross field balls he usually does.

602~~~
It's been yeons since we bossed any midfield at all.

603~~~
He's more mobile than Carrick. Not sure why this lack of physical presence/needs to bulk up thing matters. Herrera, Blind and Di Maria will be more like a top class Spanish midfield, and we know how effective those can be.  And none of them are 5'7" midgets.

604~~~
I think physical presence matters in midfield especially when you the defensive holding mid. If you get pushed off the ball, then the attack is staring straight down your defense with no backup. Youre sort of the last line of defense before they reach your actual defense. So a CDM needs to be strong on and off the ball, not just when tackling. The 50-50s you have to win those.

605~~~
Yeah I remember at least 2 occasions where he floated into space at a jog and intercepted passes. Negated the need to tackle. Brilliant.

606~~~
If you have the mental ability to read play and have excellent movement, like these guys do, and have the ability to ride a tackle a la Silva, Di Maria etc, you don't need size.

607~~~
Indeed. And he made a number of slide tackles too. Aggression and size don't go hand in hand.

608~~~
Blind came to the club for Fletcher. It's Strootman I think who will be the next 'Carrick' but that's just an opinion.

609~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> is he praising his own debut?

Good performance by him. He bounced off opponents a couple of times too easily but he seems to he a nice tidy efficient and hardworking player. Hopefully he carries on in games with less space in the same way.

610~~~
Ok the opposition wasn't that great - but he was my MOTM by far and I can over the last 25 or so years remember few players who dominated so completely on their debut. 

It was a 9 out of 10 performance from Daley

611~~~
Very good performance. Seems a bright player who sensed danger well and used the ball efficiently with good awareness.

Him and Herrera provided so much energy in there today. Was refreshing to see.

612~~~
Excellent debut. Should've got him into the squad as soon as Holland were done in Brazil if he's going to play like that in midfield!

613~~~
Very composed, was everywhere and brought stability, awareness and energy to our game. Only 24, too. Very happy with him, great debut!

614~~~
Bring in Strootman (which I think is inevitable) and ship out Anderson (also inevitable), Fellaini, and Fletcher and our midfield really will be set for the next 5 years or so

Di Maria/Herrera/Strootman/Blind/Carrick as our midfield options <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

615~~~
His positional discipline for his age was unreal. He was always available for our center backs, covered for Herrera and di Maria going out wide and kept sensing any danger. What a fantastic debut!

616~~~
I've been thinking about that, if we do indeed go for Strootman where does that leave Blind...

617~~~
Linked defence to midfield, always available and protected the back four with his positioning.
We've done alright here, absolute feckin bargain.

618~~~
Said it in the match thread, he was far quicker, and more mobile than the reputation that preceded him.

619~~~
he actually surprised me with the shot, I never though he could use that much power.. herrera as well, I want to see more goals from our midfielders and as soon as there is always some player coming in the second wave and firing it home I'll be delighted

620~~~
I'm gutted I missed the game but my ABU mates said Blind was excellent. Anybody care to give me the lowdown?

I've said it quite a few times already, one of our most important signings this summer.

621~~~
Can't believe he's only 24. Hope he becomes a mainstay in our CM for the years to come.

622~~~
Di Maria/Herrera/Strootman/Blind/Carrick

Just look at those options <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

623~~~
Carrick seems finished tbf. So far the ones that were rubbish last year under Moyes aren't showing any signs of improving under Van Gaal and I don't think Carrick at 34 is going to be much better either.

624~~~
For somebody aged only 24, in his first game in a new country, at a club and stadium as big as ours, in a team where most of the players barely know each other ....  cant think of more difficult circumstances to make ones debut .... it was an exceptional performance.

He glided around in front of our defence mopping up passes and linking effortlessly with Herrera.  He can tackle, has great positional sense and a real no frills approach to passing.  Im assuming LVG knows this player's potential very well and so hope Blind will turn into a "Carrick' like signing.  From todays debut, he solves a lot of our midfield issues.  

Possibly the most under-rated of our summer signings but now, Im really looking forward to seeing more of him.

625~~~
So easy to forget that he's still so young. Add Herrera (25) and Di Maria (26) to that as well.

626~~~
And Rojo (24) and Shaw (19)

627~~~
100% agreed.  If we can get in one more world class central midfield player (which we surely will before next season), our midfield is stocked more than well enough to cope at the top levels of Euro football.

If we can strengthen in defence this winter, LVG will have laid down the solid formations for a very strong attack for trophies for his remaining 2.5 year contract and beyond.

628~~~
Still early days and came against an incredibly shitty QPR team, but very happy with his performance.  Looks like he's what we've been missing in midfield.  For the first time in what seems like forever, our midfield was a strength instead of a weakness.  Vidal who?

629~~~
I guess we all were a bit surprised when we saw him play. He adds well needed protection and balance to the team and gives the other players the freedom to express their creativity and skills. Wonderful debut and he seems to be a brilliant talent

630~~~
So solid. Liked his link-up between back 4 and MF. <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsc426be18.jpg" src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsc426be18.jpg"/>

631~~~
So much focus on our attacking acquisitions, he has come in under the radar and was frankly dam impressive.

632~~~
DM, but still a tonne more forward passes than Cleverley. SMH.

633~~~
By far? High praise considering Di Maria looked unplayable today

634~~~
If his passing range can be worked on he could become a real little maestro, but then again we have more attacking players around him so I guess a simple ball into them would be better.

635~~~
He just looks calmer with the ball evrn when taking it under pressure. It was like a hot potato with Cleverley.

636~~~
Think people are getting carried away because its night and day between him Fletcher and Cleverley. He has his limitations but will be a good addition for us.

637~~~
He speaks English? Nice.

638~~~
Looks intelligent with his movement, keeps it simple with his passing and doesn't try anything fancy. Was treated like a small boy by Fer a few times but solid start and he won't always come up against big, physical centre mids every week.

He'll improve with a bit more confidence and familiarity with the team.

639~~~
Fantastic performance today, kept it simple and protected the back four nicely. Gained more confidence as the game went on, hence the late shot. Hopefully he can keep this up, and continue to grow! Reminds me of Carrick a couple seasons ago when he just quietly went about his business.

640~~~
Thats the only thing that worries me. I'd hate to see what Toure would do to him.

For those that have watched him at Ajax, does he usually struggle with physical players?

641~~~
Blind is a far better DM than Strootman. The latter is a more a box to box midfielder, who can also play as DM. Stootman would compete with Herrera more than with Blind.

642~~~

Daley Blind won't get the headlines - Di Maria will - but the Dutchman was just what <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mufc?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#<b>mufc</b></a> needed, shielding back-four and launching moves

643~~~
Very pleased with his performance.  He showed great awareness with his reading of the game and his positioning all match and barely put a pass wrong.  I never even knew who he was before the world cup, and now he looks a very nice fit into the holding defensive midfield role.  He offers a lot more than a lot of other DM's in the league who are only there to destroy and get the ball away ASAP.  Blind looks composed, his passing range was admirable, and he even took a few opportunities to get forward when he knew it was safe.  ADM was my MOM, but Blind wasn't far off second, with Herrera third.  I think Herrera and Blind can form a nice partnership.  Bring in the likes of Strootman next year, and we are rolling in the center of the park again.

644~~~
I am delighted we have signed Blind. I will admit that I was unsure when we were linked with him but now he seems to be a brilliant signing. A CDM that protects the back four was exactly what we needed. Hopefully he keeps up the high standard of performance.

645~~~
I still wonder why we waited so long to sign him.

646~~~
I must admit I've had doubts about him, but this was a brilliant performance from him and I have alot more faith now that he'll prove to be an important addition to the squad. Wasn't tested too hard defensively though, we'll see how he fares when the opposition is stronger.

647~~~
Probably LVG didn't want Blind to be his first signing to not put to much pressure on him and spark the talk that he is bringing his men's in like Moyes did with Fellaini.

I think his trasfer was prepared for a long time and when the time was right it went through.

648~~~
Be interesting to see how he does against better teams. Can he keep a Silva or a Fabregas quiet?

649~~~
Very good today but not much pressure on him to track back much and he had loads of time on the ball. I think it is clear he is good on the ball and a great tactical player so he'll always be great in these type of matches. With the constant questioning of his physical abilities I'm looking forward to seeing how he does against big physical midfielders, even the average ones like Fellaini and Dembele as Carrick didn't handle them too well. Glad to have a proper DM in the side though, always thought we needed one.

650~~~
Said in when I was in the Newbie section as I have watched this guy at least 10 times live for Ajax last season when I was living in Holland and he suits us down to the ground. We have the creativity to open up teams we just lacked a player to sit and shield the defense and build our attacks and Blind is perfect for that. He may not be our best player but he is our most important. I said he will shock a lot of people with how good he is and was happy we bought him he is not as good a midfielder as Vidal but is what we need to protect the defense

651~~~
Was total class today, sure he had space but he used it so well.

652~~~
Finally we have a player who attempts from outside of the box! Not that QPR was much of a threat, but this would ease him into the league!

653~~~
Haven't had chance to watch any highlights but from the stands he was my MOM. Great performance.

654~~~
Personally think it was because he was happy with Carrick (was clearly upset when he got injured) and Fletcher as he had a fantastic pre season. Perhaps it was only after Fletcher's terrible start to the season Blind was a must buy to our first team.

655~~~
What a difference having someone who has head up when receiving the ball. His one touch play was excellent. He and Herrera compliment one another very well.

656~~~
Was better than anything Carrick has produced in ages.

657~~~
Very impressive debut. Going to be a fan favourite for sure. He'll get used to speed and power of EPL games. Today was a nice little warmer for him. 
Think he'll do just fine for us, even in the big games.

658~~~
Excellent today.

Test will come for him when pressed more though.

659~~~
He was great, however he was playing against witches hats. Absolutely no pressure on him but it was a near perfect debut from him. Very impressed.

660~~~
He was great, but hardly tested - not sure how he can get MOTM ahead of Di Maria.

661~~~
Had a feeling about Blind. In any other team, aside from Di Maria, I'd have said MOTM today.

662~~~
107 passes completed out of 112 attempts. 

95% pass completion rate. 

Metronomic is the only word fitting.

663~~~
Just what we needed. Love is Blind.

664~~~
95.5% so let's just say 96% <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Great debut from him though. I have to wait to see how he does against Leicester next week though. They will probably press us far more than QPR did. It will probably be a very tough game, but hopefully our midfield performs as well as it did tonight.

665~~~
He is what we all wanted Cleverly to be. Nothing amazing, just keep it simple and tidy up. Someone above me mentioned it, his positional game was excellent.

666~~~
That would make a great banner.

667~~~
Half the things I say would make great banners. People are just too lazy to make them.

668~~~
This would also make a great banner.

669~~~

670~~~
I understand why some call him slow, he never really has to run fast. he is totally in control and crusing through games. Even in training, he always runs at minimal speed and just jogs around. Everything is too easy for him.

671~~~
I watched him play for Ajax earlier in the season and he did exactly the same thing. His passing stats are unreal. Keeps possession and recycles play brilliantly. After his comments when we signed him and knowing a thing or 2 about midfielders I would be genuinely interested to hear Scholesys view on his performance today.

672~~~
'he is no Toni Kroos'

673~~~
Having intelligent players in midfield made such a difference. I genuinely can't remember the last time we bossed a midfield battle before yesterday. Daley Blind was my man of the match, excellent debut. Future captain.

674~~~
Or Fellaini in his 'defensive midfield' role (his best position according to some on here apparently).

675~~~
He is fecking gorgeous. That hair <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

676~~~
Nah, I think the people who held that view always wanted a tough-tackling, box-to-box, Keane-like midfield from Fellaini. I don't think anyone really expected Fellaini to be an intelligent, well positioned #6.

677~~~
Why does he need to be quick anyway?

678~~~
He doesn't need to be, but it's always an advantage.

It's just that he was supposed to be ridiculously slow, but in reality got about just fine.

679~~~
Not afraid to have a crack from distance either, almost led to Falcao goal on the rebound off the keeper. Its amazing that we had to cut all the stench from previous regimes to get a functioning midfield together.

680~~~
He's so dreamy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/14/1410712455251_wps_34_MANCHESTER_ENGLAND_SEPTEM.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/14/1410712455251_wps_34_MANCHESTER_ENGLAND_SEPTEM.jpg"/>

681~~~
The difference between them in that role is shocking.

682~~~
Wait till we get Strootman too.

Blind is superior to Fletch and Carrick in term of technical ability. Ajax seems to be one of the better teams producing young players with great skills.

683~~~
This, to me at least, was the key signing of the summer.  We could have 15 DiMarias and Falcaos on the pitch but it would mean nothing without the kind of midfield pairing that Herrera and Blind provide.  We finally have two dynamic midfielders with separate roles - someone who can cover that no-man's land behind the midfield and relieve pressure on the backs in addition to an attacker who can spur play forward.  Herrera could flourish with this setup, as it gives him much more freedom to leave his place in the middle and help set up play around the box.  Great acquisition.

684~~~
Did he just sacrificed his grunge band career for United ? Though not looking even remotely stoned as Shaw.

685~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PMOuT05Yi4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Decent enough video and music that isn't head-wrecking.

686~~~
Was impressed with him. But it was against QPR at home so I am not getting too excited. Will wait for a few more matches and tougher tests before we see how good he really is.

687~~~
Never going to get a more comfortable debut than that. But having said that, he played like he's been in the team forever. Kept the game ticking over very nicely.  

It'll be interesting to see how he'll do against better opposition who'll press a bit harder.

688~~~
I like him already. you can tell he's very intelligent both on and off the pitch.

689~~~
In big game, I'd love to see:


Pace, skill, and power there.

690~~~
Really impressed by his debut performance today. Made the right decisions, kept the ball moving, and read the game well. His presence gave Di Maria and Herrera the license to go forward all game. 

He'll be an important player for us going forward.

691~~~
Definite similarities with Carrick, although Blind appears to be more mobile. It's no coincidence that his presence coincided with a better performance in terms of possession and ball retention. Most noticeable aspect of his performance was that he's always available to receive the ball - he's an unfussy player when it comes to passing the ball, but he takes the pressure off his team mates by providing an easy short option and he's economical, moving it on quickly to keep the tempo up. Also noticeable how Evans and Blackett went long a lot less than against Burnley - that's because Blind took up intelligent positions to take the ball from them.

A couple of journos have referred to him as a continuity player in the papers, I'd say that's the perfect description of him. Going to be a very important, under the radar player for us.

692~~~
Don't think he has the passing range or 2 footedness of Carrick but seems more nimble footed on the ball.

693~~~
Not so many long balls by the centre backs. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it probably helps when you've got somebody at the base of midfield giving you options to pass to.

694~~~
Based on yesterdays game I thought he was uncomplicated and did the simple thing very well. In fact he played so well, he would have been my MoM had it not been for Di Maria's superb performance. On first impression he seems a very good reader of the game, and as we don't really have a ball playing centre-back he is ideally suited to take the pressure of the defence. Bought back much needed serenity in the final third. We finally have someone who can compete with Carrick or take up a similar role. 

I'd like to wait until he plays with teams and forwards who will pressure a lot more to really start raving on the back of this performance.

695~~~
How was he deployed at Ajax? Did he play with a pure defensive midfielder or he was the main one? Carrick's been a defensive rock for us for so many years, I hope Blind can replicate that contribution.

696~~~
He did play very well especially as it was his debut. The thing that stood out for me was he seemed to instantly know what was expected of him in that role probably because he's an intelligent footballer but also understands Van Gaals philosophy. Whilst others are still in the process of learning it you can tell Blind was just very comfortable in moving into the team. He is a very mature player for his age as well

697~~~
Blind is going to be LvG's Roy Keane. Not so much in terms of quality (although DB is already an important part of the team setup), but in terms of being the manager's representative on the pitch. 

Keano chimed with SAF's philosophy just like Blind will chime with van Gaal's. I can really see him leading by example on the pitch.

698~~~
Good on the ball but I'm intrigued to see how good he is defensively against much better opposition.

699~~~
He's great on the ball, but he'll have to bulk up a bit in that role where he's going to need to be a ball winner as well as a ball playing midfielder.

700~~~
thought he was brilliant, you could see him right from the first minute pointing, shouting, directing traffic. for a new signing this shows his bravery and his dedication 
his head must be on a gyro as its constantly spinning checking every inch of the pitch.
probably not the most talented player but very intelligent, runs all day and makes the right choice 90% of the time. but for ADM he was MotM for me

we've got midfielders this year lads <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> i cant believe it, actual midfielders!

701~~~
He's nimble and mobile on the ball, something I've been crying out for in years. Can he cover ground defensively though and win balls in the air in that middle of the park etc.. we shall see.

702~~~
He is one of those players who do a lot of work that goes unnoticed. His reading of the game, closing down runners, tracking back and giving our own players options is maybe not always clear to see but helps immensely.

703~~~
He was great at cutting QPR's passing paths and closing down the play. Good at interceptions, good at tackling, obviously it's just QPR but he's basically our Carrick type of a player, he's played 112 passes, 107 successful, half of them forward. Pleased with him.

704~~~

705~~~
LVG said himself that Blind has terrific ability to read a game and that's exactly what we all witnessed yesterday, vs QPR or not. He could prove one of our most important summer signings.

706~~~
he showed he is an intelligent footballer and did the perfect job. Considering it was only QPR I am looking forward to see him in bigger games. He and Carrick could be a solid partnership for 4-2-3-1 away from home in big games.

707~~~
Great we played with 4 central midfielders who could all have argued to be man of the match. Who would have thought?!

708~~~
You could be right here. Of course Falcao and ADM will grab the headlines but in order for our attacking players to flourish you need exactly a calm tidy "non-flashy" player like Blind. Plus, thanks to his awareness, reading of the game and tactical understanding / intelligence, he could become a big game player over time

709~~~

710~~~
Cleverley would have had a whale of a time playing with him.

711~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> all dutch speak english

712~~~
This. We had someone who wanted to take responsibility and take the ball off the defenders, unlike Cleverly and Fletcher who were constantly hiding from the ball. This has a knock on effect on our defence which looked  al ot better.

713~~~
More mobile than Carrick but I would worry when he was defending vs the likes of Costa, Lukaku, Adebayor against whom Caarrick can at least compete.  Will be interesting to see who is 1st choice once Carrick is back. I would go with Carrick for extra solidity and IMO , a little better technical quality, and occasionally penetrating passing. Blind vs teams that we are dominating should be the 1st choice DM he is perfect for the rest of the midfield.

714~~~
Better than most Scousers speak English, too.

715~~~
Embarassing from me, but I didn't know that.

716~~~
Great performance from him, kept it simple and ticking. Not going to be a hard hitting tackler but read the game excellently, in a similar mould to Carrick but maybe a little more dynamic at times. (Not saying he's better or worse than Carrick by that comment). Overall a brilliant performance, however playing against a QPR midfield which basically never put him under pressure once. We're kidding ourselves if we think it'll be like that more than 5 times this season. He had time and space whenever he got the ball (hopefully due to his movement). 

Think him and Herrera suit each other. Nice contrasting styles but both dynamic with and without the ball. Hope he continues to develop as he has over the last 12 months.

717~~~
Everyone seems to agree ⠠⠙⠁⠇⠑⠽⠀⠠⠃⠇⠊⠝⠙ was brail-iant!

718~~~
I think Blind might just take Carricks place in the team.

It was obvious yesterday how much more and how quick we press the opposition. Carrick (for as good as he is) is not suited to this style of play, much to our detriment.

719~~~
I liked the pace with which he hit his passes.  Never too slow like Fellani's usually are.  Blind's were mice and crisp.

720~~~
I've always been impressed with him, yesterday doesn't change that impression.  Good signing...

721~~~
Played it simple but tried to get the ball forward, something we have missed.

722~~~
He was the only defensive midfielder. Ajax played a 3 midfield with 1 DM and 2 attacking midfielders. And they played possession football, Blind was pivotal as far as ball circulation goes. If their central defenders were under pressure and struggling with build up play then they'd push out wide to the flanks and Blind would drop deep inbetween them to become the first station to improve build up and ball circulation from there.

His father used to be hard as nails as a player. I haven't seen much of that from Daley at Ajax, but I wouldn't be surprised if English football brings that out of him. I also think he played it more safe yesterday than he used to at Ajax. He's capable of good through passes, or a good long pass. Might see more of that against opponents that don't sit back. But with growing confidence, and as he improves, he should become a more dominant player.

723~~~

724~~~
This. Fletcher couldn’t provide any cover for the defence, I think they will be much better now with Blind ahead of the defenders. Plus, Rafael and Shaw will make huge difference on both ends of the pitch.

The thing with Blind is that his best role is defensive midfielder with two energetic players in Herrera and Di Maria ahead of him. That’s why they looked very well together- they’ve played in their preferred positions.

I am of the opinion that his lack of physical attributes will be a problem- at least until he adapts to the EPL. Time will tell how he does under pressure but he does look Busquets-esque in his style so I remain optimistic. Carrick is pretty shite under pressure, but the movement up front and midfielders keen to carry the ball forward make a huge difference for deep lying playmaker, as far as their passing options are concerned. Of course that doesn’t apply if you are playing hot potato game like some of our midfielders in the past.  


He is similar to carrick in terms of intelligence and positioning. He definitely is more mobile, but I don’t think his passing is on Michael’s level. Definitely not so two footed.

His game is Carrick-esque only with less hesitation on the ball (unless we’re talking about short periods of top-form Carrick).

I love how he turns his head around to see his options all the time, a trait of the best midfielders in the game. He does look like a natural midfielder.

725~~~
The thing with Blind is that it's certain he will improve. I don't think that physically speaking he is the most naturally gifted. He doesn't have the most athletic body, not that strong or explosive or fast. He's more of a diesel who will just keep going. Won't give up and will keep working his ass off. Even if he's failing as a player, he'll only work harder. He's very strong mentally and will do anything he can to succeed with us. He struggled at first at Ajax, whistled by their supporters, written off by most people. But he worked harder, trained harder, untill he succeeded. It's why he's so well respected at Ajax now, and kind of a cult figure.

726~~~
Really reminded me of Gareth Barry with his performance. And thats not a criticism as I rate Barry more than most.

Very good performance

727~~~
I could have sworn I heard Cleverley claim he was Van Gaal's type of midfielder, really Tom!

728~~~
I've watched the match again and was even more impressed the second time at showing with Blind.  He was pretty much always where he needed to be when it was required.  He won the ball and his distribution was stellar.  His passes seemed to always be struck with confidence and perfect weight.  They are the types of balls that then make the receiver push on in a similar fashion, building the tempo of our game.  I think his range of passing might be a little lower than Carrick, but at 24, I can easily see him benching Carrick because I think he will bring a lot more to the team overall and will provide a much higher work rate.

729~~~
I think you will find yourself mistaken in his passing range. He kept it fairly modest this time around with mainly 'safe' passes over fairly short distances, but one of the things he was known for with Ajax were his long crosses. Just think back to the beautifully p(l)aced ball on Van Persie in the WC match against Spain. He probably just held back due to it being his debut and he didn't want to make silly mistakes.

730~~~
When you saw him, how did you rate him physically? How do you think he'll stand up to someone like Toure?

731~~~
Good to hear that. He really needs to add a bit more physical presence to his game. Our midfield is pretty lightweight and looks culpable to being bullied.

Carrick's neither a tough tackler or aggressive player, but he's a big lad with some aerial presence about him.

732~~~
I can only think that we genuinely had interest in Vidal. Once we decided against him or he decided against us, we pulled the trigger on Blind.

733~~~
In fairness his job was probably to keep it simple passing wise, he always had Herrera and di Maria in support anyway. God it's been so long since we've had a proper midfield.

734~~~
I like his style - very neat and easy on the eye but also defensively astute and hardworking. Pretty much provides the perfect platform for the more attacking CMs like Herrera and Di Maria. 

Against the bigger teams he may need an extra body alongside him but nothing to be worried about at this stage.

735~~~
I'm inclined to agree with this I think. Although in no way is Blind a replacement for Vidal (as in, they are completely different players). 

Only alternative is LVG genuinely wanted to give time to his players (e.g. Fletcher) before realising and deciding they were not competent enough.

736~~~
I was impressed and think he will be a star but I do want to see how he copes with the 28 days zombie pressing a lot of PL teams throw at us

737~~~
One things that was more noticeable than others yesterday was how he seems to always know who is open and who the best passing option is. This leads me to believe that he will be able to cope with high pressure opponents pretty well.

He is obviously an intelligent footballer, which I think we have been severely lacking. To be honest, I think Van Gaal has made a point about bringing in more intelligent players.

It wasn't a surprise that Blind was able to come straight into the system and play his normal game. He understands Van Gaal's philosophy and is smart enough to execute instructions

I get the feeling Blind will be the first name down on the team sheet every week.

738~~~
We don't have anyone else like him, he should play most every game when fit.

739~~~
Carrick was always good at intercepting the ball though and reads the game well. Not to mention if he has time on ball he can put a ball 40 yards onto a five pence piece

740~~~
I would go with both Carrick, Herrera and Blind against tougher opposition, with Di Maria ahead of them and a choice of two from Rooney/Mata/RvP/Falcao

741~~~
Does anyone know what car he has? On the way to the game yesterday an absolutely mint Mercedes SLS drove past me with blacked out windows and a Dutch Number Plate and as LVG drives a right wheel drive car and he's the only other Dutch person to live in Manchester I've come to the conclusion it was him.

742~~~
I don't think our defenders hoofed one useless ball yesterday, and it was all because of this man.

743~~~
It was definitely him. There's no doubt about it. Don't take my word for it though, I spent 5 mins laughing at the turn back tony gif from Burnley.

744~~~
Even Di Maria and Herrera took turns plenty times dropping deep to receive the ball out of defense, we had atleast one midfielder showing for the ball out of defense all game long. Refreshing experience after watching Cleverley hide himself between four players to avoid taking responsibility.

745~~~
It was Rene. Looking for a job.

746~~~
Nah this one didn't have any sirens.

747~~~
Good piece on Daley being our most important signing this season <a class="externalLink" href="http://goo.gl/c9DznL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">goo.gl/c9DznL</a>

748~~~
He was excellent yesterday. Looks very promising if LVG keeps this system. 

ADM has been getting all the plaudits and maybe that's fair enough because he's a very exciting player to watch but I thought Blind was the guy who showed the most promise for the season ahead. There'll be games where the flair players like Di Maria drift out of the game but guys like Blind in that role are usually always prominent.

749~~~
Bang on..! Just what we needed and he was the rock that allowed our creative players to play their game. Will always be the unsung hero, the player we really miss when he's not there. I always remember Arnold Muhren being like that in the 80's a player you thought did little but when he was injured the whole flow and balance of the midfield was lost.

750~~~

His girlfriend is pretty hot.

751~~~
Not as much as him.

752~~~
I would have his kids if I could.

753~~~
This is the essential point. He is just emerging into the big time with Holland, and now United, and is a mere 24.

754~~~
Blind is major missing ingredient in my opinion. He was everywhere. He's the new "gimme" man, making himself available for a pass and screening the back three/four. Both he and Herrera complemented each other immensely. For the joy of watching Di Maria, take the unsung hero donkey work of Blind. Carrick with legs!!!!!

755~~~
reminds of Iturraspe from Athletic, no wonder Ander and Daley look good together in midfield.

756~~~
Really pleased how both Blind and Rojo settled into the pace of the game yesterday. I think there's always a worry that a player from overseas may not adjust to the Prem, but they both looked right at home, looked aggressive, calm when they needed to be, and barely a misplaced pass amongst them, which we've been massively struggling with recently.

757~~~
I admire the type of midfielder that Blind is and when people refer to him as doing the 'simple stuff', I don't think that does his role justice. He was outstanding and dominant, albeit against weak opposition, and he controlled and influenced proceedings just as much as di Maria and Herrera IMO.

758~~~
I've said it before and I'll say it again, loads of people in this thread will have red faces in a couple of years. He looks a very steady addition to the midfield, as he did for Ajax last season.

759~~~
Yeah, great shout. I think Iturraspe is a lot more athletic (lol) though, whilst Blind seems to have a stronger passing range - from what I've seen from his performances at the WC and Ajax.

760~~~
He should be a decent DM and backup LB, but strength is a serious concern for me. He was knocked over 2 or 3 times and this happened when he was at Ajax too. Hopefully he can get stronger without losing any quickness. He's 24, so it's not impossible. 

Played well against QPR, but they didn't press high at all, so I think people are going overboard here. He did well to move the ball side to side quickly in a way our midfielders have struggled with, but again, QPR were defending so deep he wasn't really under much pressure.

If the diamond or any 4-3-3 with a DM is the plan, he and Carrick should be a good battle for the DM spot with Di Maria and Herrera either side of them. Long-term, I expect Carrick will move on after this year or the next and another CM or DM will be brought in and maybe we'll see Blind and Mata fighting for time at opposite ends of the midfield with Di Maria, Herrera and Vidal/Strootman/AnotherSigning as 3 starting fixtures, the undroppable Rooney and then the final 2 spots in the front 6 open between Blind, Mata, Januzaj, Falcao, RVP, Wilson, and any other signings we make or youth players we promote.

761~~~
Iturraspe has a pretty good passing range too. Both are very good at spreading play or hitting a long-ish ball without being elite at it. I think Blind is a bit more reliable but Iturraspe is bigger, stronger and maybe a bit better at ball carrying. Both good DM's, though. So yeah, reasonable comparison.

762~~~
I'm sure he looks around and has his options sorted out <i>well before </i>he gets the ball - he hardly takes more than 2 seconds to pass the ball to another player or run forward with the ball. It's true he'll have to face 10 times the challenge he did yesterday, so I really hope he's up for it. Promises to be a more mobile version of Carrick.

763~~~
I think this is going to be the biggest difference for us. Teams won't be as effective at pressing the midfield if the ball has already gone.

Watching Cleverley and Fletcher take 4, 5 or 6 touches and do absolutely nothing with it was painful at the start of the season.

Does help a lot when you've got Di Maria and Herrera constantly moving and giving the man on the ball options though, which isn't something the aforementioned had sadly.

764~~~
So much blind love in this thread.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I'm out.</span>

765~~~
Yep, sadly this is very true. I still think neither of Cleverley / Fletcher has the same quality as him.

766~~~
This. Blackett didn't play a single hopeless long ball to our forwards. Blind was the foundation that we built the house on. I was over the moon watching the way he turned quickly and moved the ball forward quickly and intelligently. 107 passes completed is just an amazing number. 

I am of the opinion that he will go down with other great bargain buys we've had such as Vidic, Evra, and Chicharito.

767~~~
I like him a lot but i still think he could improve his tackling.

768~~~
My reaction when he signed was "Ehh he's a decent fullback but we'll see how well he does in midfield, not expecting much". I've only got one performance to go on since then, but my goodness I'm bloody excited to have him now.

769~~~
He played well, but still think he's behind a fully fit Michael Carrick.

770~~~
may i ask why you think this?

771~~~
Michael Carrick has carried our midfield for years without any sort of reliable partner. Blind has had one good game for us.

772~~~
There were a couple of occasions where in his efforts to win the ball back he was too easily brushed away by the opposition and he hit the deck. Hopefully he deals well with what should be a tougher examination, even physically,  on sunday. 

I liked the passes forward from him. They were often returned backwards by our attackers but it's important to keep probing and looking for that rather than hiding and passing it out wide all the time.

773~~~
Carrick was also rubbish last season. Your post makes him sound like one of the midfield greats or something.

I'm looking forward to carrick returning.  He shouls enjoy the movement of these new players. But I dont see him being guarateed to start by default. It's hardly as if a top top midfielder like scholes is returning who is so clearly on another level. Carricks a good player and hopefully he and blind rotate and botj contribute.

774~~~
It still amazes me how people can underrate Carrick after all this time. After the all time legends like Scholes, Keano and Robson, Carrick is amongst the best midfielders we've had at United. And its hardly a crime to be behind guys like those.

Granted he may not get fit or in form again at 33, no guarantees there. But if Carrick is fit he can offer a hell of a lot that Blind doesn't.

775~~~
he has, but he is also 33, and has shown time and time again his lack of pace leaves us very exposed to counter attacks with him in the DM role, he is also coming out of the back of probably his worse season asa footballer and has suffered a bad injury.

blind is on the back of his best season, had a great world, cup and his mobility is something we have been desperate for in midfield since Fletcher succumbed to his illness

personally i think we need to look to the future,carrick has been a good servant, but i think his time has come and gone.

776~~~
He may work on his physical game but I don't think he was brushed easily, him and herrera both looked like they want to win the ball cleanly so they fell down a couple of times just because they didn't want to commit a foul. He is better reader of the game than tough tackler but still better than carras IMO

777~~~
I dont think you can really say he's be worse than Blind at that, for the simple fact that for the last few years he's basically had to be a one-man midfield, so the comparison is totally unfair. Scholes managed about 20 league starts in his final two years, and every other partner he had - Anderson, Cleverley, Giggs, Jones - was hardly top drawer.

Carrick was playing in a midfield 2 alongside some seriously duff performances from our lads, and playing against teams that had 3 in midfield. He was getting outnumbered 3 to 1 at times, if Ando or Clev disappeared. He was caught out on the counter, yes, but that's because he had to do the defensive role, the playmaking role and join in the attacks. If he stayed deep to cover the back four, the attack stopped functioning altogether. The fact he held it together for so long is frankly amazing.

Blind was great this weekend, but he was in a midfield 3, and was playing alongside Herrera and Di Maria, which makes a huge difference. Play him alongside Cleverley in a midfield two and those numerous neat short passes are going into dead ends. On the other hand stick Carrick with ADM & Herrera, with Mata, Rooney & RvP moving ahead of him and his excellent range of passing can really open the game up quickly.

I think both players will play a role this season, and indeed both may play at once if we're playing tougher opponents. I certainly don't see Carrick as being redundant though.

778~~~
is his agent known as a 'blind salesman'?

779~~~
QPR did not press high enough up the pitch to assume the hoofing is dead, but yeah, 107/112 was good to see.

780~~~
finally someone with a nice long hair. He can be our Hargreaves vol2

781~~~
Hitting long balls under high pressure has not been our problem. I lost count of the number of hit and hope long balls our defenders chanced v Burnley when they had acres of space to move into. The problem was simultaneously that the player on the ball would refuse to travel with it and try to draw an opposition player off his mark, and our defensive players not making their markers work by even attempting to move away from them. Mainly Fletcher and Cleverley playing f*cking hide and seek.

Blind didn't do anything spectacular, he mainly just positioned himself to receive the ball from Evans and Blackett and passed it neatly on to Herrera/Mata/Di Maria/Rafael/Rojo. Looked good in their half too though to be fair.

782~~~
im not blaming it all on carrick, he has been a great servant to the club, but his pace has already been an issue, and will always leave us open to counter attack if he is the one protecting the back four.  he also isn't great at high tempo games, both when where on the offensive or the opposition is. he is best on slow tempo games when the game is played in front of him.

im not saying carrick is redundant, he still has a great range of passing, and is steady option, but i certainly don't think he should be first choice, i think we should be looking forward, and blind is our best option to do that.

weve held on to the past to many times recently, with Ferdinand, scholes....... lets not the same mistake again

783~~~
Carrick is not redundant, nor does one bad season or one good game from Blind mean he has no role. Blind still has to fight for that role, if that game has shown us anything was that competition will be fierce.

784~~~
Our passing out of defense has been a problem both under pressure and when not pressured. I think that was a big part of the problem with the 3-5-2. One less option for a defender to hit with a pass. The other team just put their wingers on our wing back, had one striker up against our 3 CB's and then we had 5 mids/strikers against 7 of their mids/defenders. Now, it's 6 vs 7.

785~~~
I meant that in the sense that our problem is not <i>merely</i> hitting it long when under pressure. That's an altogether more tolerable practice and is sometimes the rational thing to do. The biggest problem has been the failure of our players in our half to take advantage of open space. I think it's a failure of personnel rather than of the system.

Has there been a 'Blind leading the Blind' quote yet?

788~~~
Got to agree. Carrick has had to play with some absolute dross and still stood up. Was holding mf together ok his own last year. Fully expected him to be only cm to survive from last year. Will hopefully regain form with intelligent and better teammates like the ones he'll have now

789~~~
For those who are worried about his physicality, Blind went toe-to-toe with Yaya Toure in the Champions League as part of the the Ajax team that nearly embarassed City home and away in 2012/13. He held his own well back then.

Him and Eriksen were standout performers.

790~~~
That's reassuring because it was him and that nasty fecker Ramirez that I was most worried about.

791~~~
Too many love is blind jokes in this thread.

792~~~
For those of you with a long memory, Philip Cocu went to Barcelona in 1998 and a lot of people wondered if he would be good enough ( very similar to Daley with us). He stayed there for 6 years and was outstanding for them. He later returned to PSV as a player and is now managing them. I believe that Daley will be similar. He will be an outstanding player for us for 6 - 8 years and later retun to Ajax to end his career

793~~~
listened to you

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/511572172645863424/OXM0paDo.jpeg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/511572172645863424/OXM0paDo.jpeg"/>

794~~~
He was brilliant in last game for being his first. Hopefully he can unleash his longer ranged passing as well when he feels more comfortable and he can improve a lot if he just increases the amount of one-touch passes.

Nearly always he received the ball in the first touch, to pass it with the next touch. It isn't going to be very positive for us when we are pressed, unless he already has it in his rhytm to always just use one touch passing unless he needs more. 

Hopefully just a matter of being nervous and wanting to do well.

795~~~
What was his dad like as a player? Just out of interest.

796~~~
Awesome player think the Dutch Maldini/Baresi type. He'll never be as good as him but that's no slight. On a side note I think people are rating Blind a bit to highly (probably because the comparisons) Fletcher Cleverley and Anderson.

797~~~
Centre back/libero, could play full-back as well. He was a ball playing defender with a good well rounded skill set, without anything standing out really. Great player though, but just very balanced.

798~~~
Thanks. On the bold part: the opposition was also poor too. He needs to play more matches before he can be accurately judged.

799~~~
Love is blind.

Quite a good article on what Blind does.

801~~~
That is a damn good blog, remember it well from last season. Probably the only good thing to come out of that carwreck of a season was his analyses!

802~~~
I think I must be the only person on here who find blogs/analysis like that ridiculously over-complicated. All those pictures and lines and complex diagrams could have been summed up by "he's decent on the ball and generally picks the right pass". There really is nothing else to learn by wading through that mass of information.

Either that or just read the Van Gaal quote at the bottom.

<b>“He is a player who can see situations in advance. He can [therefore] always pass to the free player, and when he doesn’t have the ball, he knows when he has to press the opponent. That’s a very good ability to have.”</b>

803~~~
Reading his wiki entry it appears his only season as a DM was last season with Ajax. 

Also it appears he has played at RB in the past while on loan at Groningen. I wonder could he be an option for us there?

804~~~
No, it's modern football. Everything is so much more complicated and analysed even though football is a simple sport so it can be easily explained like Van Gaal did.

805~~~
With all the Philip Lahm comparisons you'd have to think so...

806~~~
Van Gaal only gave an appreciation, he didn't explained anything. The explanation of each process is way more complicated and can't be explained in one sentence.

807~~~
Blind not only has great vision, he seems genuinely pleased to play as part of a team and not to show off or do things he either shouldn't (like Fellaini throwing elbows like a whore tosses condoms) or can't (like Ando trying to dribble past three opponents).  

The point about Carrick, though, is well taken.  Before Moyes brought his wrecking ball and almost destroyed players like Carrick, Michael was a very effective midfielder for us, probably our most consistently solid player in the years after Ronaldo left us.  He was dreadful last season, but we should write him off just yet.  We'll see between Blind and Carrick who steals the cookie jar and gets to play against the top clubs.

808~~~
I actually think it'll be the both of them in a double-pivot, with either Mata or one of the strikers making way in the big games. They will afford the requisite protection for the defence and both have the ability to be more expansive when need be... Just hope Carrick is fit and ready in time for the Chelsea match.

809~~~
This, and we could play Herrera instead of Mata, in order to have a more solid midfield, if we use the 4-2-3-1 formation.

810~~~
Blind is tactically intellgent and composed, both qualities that we sorely missed last season. With that quality he makes the players around him play better as well.  (To make up an example, Blackett tried a lot less hoofed balls against QPR compared to against Burnley becuase Blind was often at the right space to receive the ball)

811~~~
I think the LCM in the diamond is a perfect solution for Di Maria. 
As we saw in the last game, the position gives him more freedom to dictate our play as a CM, but also allows him lots of space to run on the left. With 2 strikers and 1 AM, he actually has more support around him then playing as a pure winger.

812~~~
He played the "shuttler" role in Benfica too.

813~~~
Like I said on the 442 diamond thread, we were playing 352 system, transforming into a 442 diamond when ever we went forward. Why could it work? rafeal rojo blind and di maria allowed this to work. Remember with 352 it is designed for the third CB to come forward to help the CM 2, he protects those 2 so the team can outnumber teams, blind was doing that for herrera and di maria, so we were always ontop.

This is what makes blind special

the 352 vs QPR
________DDG______
_____evans blackett
________blind______
rafeal___________rojo
____herrera di maria

the 442 diamond vs QPR
_______DDG________
___evans blackett____
rafeal__________rojo
_______blind_______
____herrera di maria_

So has we all see, there is great tactical flexibility, has 352 kept changing to 442 diamond. Blind could possibly be the most important signing VG has ever made making this system work, has like many have said, one of the smartest tactical players any team could have. Blind's ability to play the CB/DM role is unmatched, he was the third CB always coming forward out of the 3 at the back, and making it 4 at the back, and outnumbering teams in midfield. Blind is doing what the third CB against swansea burnley and sunderland failed to do, outnumber teams in midfield, and creating balance to the 3 at the back. So when ever people question the system, it is a 352 and 442 diamond at the same time

814~~~
Good post.

I think one of the concerns on this formation is about protecting the flanks, especially on the right side.

From the last game, we can see that we did pretty well protecting the left side - Rojo is aggressive and strong, and he didn't have toomuch attacking duty since he had Di Maria in front of him. In addition to that, Blind helped couple of times and he was apparently very comfortable defending that zone.
Not so much on the right side though - we don't have an out and out wide player on the right side, so Rafael needed to attack very deep every time. Also you can clearly see Herrera struggled a bit protecting the right side, especially when a fresh Traore came on. 

Teams will start to realize this, and we need to figure out a way to deal with this.

815~~~
I saw our game again and his forward passes were very nice and crisp. Let's see how he does against liecster because he will have nowhere near as much room to operate.

816~~~
I do not see it being a huge problem, has its the job of guys like blind, di maria and herrera is their ability to dominate games, if the system works. The only time QPR looked confident was when DDG made a huge mistake which almost let QPR in, apart from that we were always on top. I think di maria will give us the speed we need to rip sides apart, the only time we could have problems is when we do not have a di maria in our lineup, can janazaj offer the same impact in terms of the acceleration di maria offers united? I very much doubt it

817~~~
This guy was criminally underrated before the WC and even at times during the WC. But, truth is, he is quite a revelation. Hopefully he carries the team tomorrow as well!

818~~~
They're man marking him, clearly affecting the fluidity of our game.. Needs to find some space for himself and get back into the game

819~~~
This lad has a wonder goal in him. I expect him to get grab 5/6 through the season from arriving late at the edge of the box.

820~~~
A sex god. Also a good footballer.

821~~~
looking pristine atm, great stuff

822~~~
He's very good in the air for being relatively short.

823~~~
To think a lot of people didnt want him. Too many people are swayed by fancy names and southern european players and their tricks and flicks.

This guy has been sensational.

824~~~
Yep and he is easily our sexiest looking player.

825~~~
He's not having a great game, he's basically doing neither of the two things that made him so good against QPR (breaking up attacks and contolling our posession). His touch has also let him down countless times.

Bit worried.

826~~~
Perfect positioning is all I can say about him

827~~~
Tidy.

828~~~
Are we watching different games?

829~~~
Settle.

830~~~
He was given all the time in the worst against QPR whereas Leicester are man marking him. He's doing well considering IMO.

831~~~
Blessed with supreme technique. So compact and efficient.

Not dictating the play so much today but he's not afforded the same time so thats natural. His defensive side has been top draw though.

832~~~
He's not getting much space to be honest, and we're being a bit cavalier at times, committing too many bodies forward and getting caught on the counter by Leicester. Giving him way too much to do, and plus all the long balls over the top have been targeting Rojo, not much Blind can do to be honest.

833~~~
Good game, again.

834~~~
He's having a good game, but he probably wouldn't have been man-marked like this before. He'll adapt to it and continue to develop as a player.

835~~~
He's been very good, not sure what you're watching.

836~~~
Extra! Extra! In today's edtion of The Daily Blind: he's <i>still </i>dreamy!<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

837~~~
just as I suspected...he's average at best defensively

838~~~
He'll benefit once Carrick is back hopefully.

We definitely need a solid pair in front of our laughable defence.

839~~~
welcome to engurland. He will learn and improve. He is smart enough.

840~~~
Where was the shielding? They just ran through us on counter attacks. Nothing new to us of course.

841~~~
Poor game defensively from him. He's a clever player, so he'll learn from it.

842~~~
He had a real shocker. His passing is nice and tidy, but did he win a single ball during the whole match? It was like a child playing against men. He couldnt get near anyone and they just walked passed him.

843~~~
Defensively, Still a long way to fill Carrick's boot.

844~~~
His positioning was poor today, he was much more deeper against QPR yet was too far forward today.

845~~~
Shouldn't be used as a scapegoat. He was quality today and one of our best players. You can't win games with that quality behind you. We need defenders and that's nothing to do with Blind....

846~~~
Wasn't very good defensively. Will improve though. The QPR game was always difficult to judge him on.

847~~~
Pace and physicality is something that concerned me when we signed him, our midfield has quality on the ball but is still prone to being bullied physically and he wont fix that, nor will the mythical return of Carrick.

848~~~
no shield to defense 5 goals conceded what else to say, all match we were vulnerable. he should help more. maybe he is good playmaker but not when you need suport the back line much. we should go for cattermole

849~~~
Really poor today, lacking in presence and athleticism.  He can't be our first choice number 6, need a similar player but more of a powerhouse.

850~~~
Wouldn't read too much in to his performance today defensively. There's no leadership in that defence and plenty of players making individual errors, gonna be hard for anyone sitting in front of that especially when he doesn't really know any of the players. Still positive on the ball though which is good.

851~~~
We lost our shape completely after the penalty. Before that he was doing fine.

852~~~
Think you'll find that the common concensus on Blind is that he won't offer much physicality. And thats fine when you have other players who can put that kind of shift in instead. We don't have those players which is where we came undone. Blind was fine today. I don't see much point in blaming him for lacking the qualities it was so obvious he didn't have before we signed him.

853~~~
Not convinced at all.

854~~~
I preferred De Jong at the time tbh. He's not as well rounded but he's brilliant at just protecting the back 4.

855~~~
Doesn't help that Smalling is jumping on his back constantly.

856~~~
Agree ... he was actually playing very well

857~~~
Guys like De Jong and Mascherano are ball magnets.. when the chips are down, you need these type of bastards in your team. Anyone who has played 11 aside, probably knows a dirty fecker like that in their team who does the ugly stuff but is like the spine of the team when the shit hits the fan. See Arsenal...

858~~~
I actually disagree, he won the ball 8 times today with interceptions, 2 tackles and came back to bail out the defence from crosses several times hence he made 6 clearances from his own box.

Overall the job was too much for one person, although he wasnt the only one trying. Ander won the ball back plenty as well.

Leicester just had so many attacks that even if our midfielders were breaking up play a lot, they still had plenty of others that led to shots

859~~~
I have not much faith in how we set up today, with Herrera to much on the right hand side we were to easy to pass through in midfield. If we started like against QPR we would be far more solid and balanced. It was far to difficult for Blind, but he did well all things considered.

860~~~
I was enchanted by him after QPR's game. But today... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

861~~~
I said last week that he reminded me of Carrick, for all the right reasons. This week, he's done the same, but for all the wrong reasons.

862~~~
All but one of their goals came from longballs or wing play, nothing to do with Blind at all.

863~~~
I thought he was good again.  Not perfect, mind you.  He isn't winning enough of the big duels in the middle of the park.  Our midfield is miles better than it was last season, for sure, but we need to work on our shape and discipline a bit.  ADM is very attack minded and I feel like Herrera is moving further up the pitch at times than he probably should.  Anyway, can't really blame Blind for our collapse.

864~~~
Had a tough game today. But this was a big test for some of our new guys. Away games in the Premier League can be like a bear pit, and he will learn from this and improve I'm sure.

865~~~
Thought he was fine. Just had too much on his plate. Doesn't help when the lads behind you are utterly clueless cowards.

866~~~
Think he's a great addition. Composed on the ball, technically very good and moves the ball around well. Would like to see him be a bit more combative, but does he have that in his game?

867~~~
He brings the same problems as Carrick for me. I saw him chasing the play at times today and he doesn't offer much of a physical presence. We've been seriously lacking a combative midfielder for sometime now and personally it is what I want offered from my DM. If you are going to go for the Blind/Carrick type DM then you need an energetic combative box to box player which we don't have either.

868~~~
Blind was fine today. He was firefighting all over the pitch, and can't do it alone.

869~~~
Shocking that some are looking to blame him today! I know some on here are eager to replace Cleverley as our scapegoat but to blame him is laughable.

Goal 1: do you expect him to play in defense?
Goal 2: do you think he should have been running in so Rafael didnt have to make a tackle? Was a dive anyway.
Goal 3: Dont know what he could have done better - maybe get closer to the player at the edge of our box for the cross/shot?
Goal 4: couldnt make up that kind of ground when it was a poor mistake from Rojo/Mata
Goal 5: ???

Unless you all think he was supposed to play in defense i really don't understand how he can be blamed, in fact he covered for both Evans/Smalling/Blackett/Rojo whenever they were dragged out of position - which happened a hell of a lot. He and Herrera controlled the game up till that brain fart from the ref, unless you want to blame two newcomers for not controlling the game after they got momentum.

870~~~
Especially when the back four are constantly getting dragged out of position, meaning he has to drop in, creating space in midfield for them to run into.

871~~~
Good post, most people just love jumping on a player without any solid basis

And as you pointed out those stats show he had a very good match

872~~~
This game was alot more difficult for him than QPR where he had alot of time on the ball. They put Nugent on him to stop him distributing it out of defence but I think he dealt with it well enough. He's had a proper taste of what the PL is about today in a physical sense. Like many posters have said already, its not his job alone to defend the back 4 and we need to find a formula where we can defend as a unit and that will only come the more this team plays together.

873~~~
One bloke can't protect an entire back four. He did pretty well for the most part.

874~~~
Finally, someone who doesn't just give their opinion for the sake of giving their opinion. Thanks for squaring up the statistics on his performance.

875~~~
Agree. Our shape disintegrated after that. All over the place. If Blinds playing in there it is his job to sort that out. I still think it's harsh blaming him like some have done and it's only his second game to be fair.

876~~~
Was a much tougher test for him today but I thought he played well enough.

877~~~
He was alright. Far from our worst performer, but nowhere near as impressive as against QPR.

878~~~
No one's blaming him for the defeat. Just pointing out that he seems to have obvious flaws to his game, that coincide with the flaws we, as a team, already have.

879~~~
Their chances came from long balls over the top effectively cutting him out of the game, can't be blamed at all.

880~~~
He looks far too small to play this role.

881~~~
I thought he was good at covering for our defenders, but we simply need another midfielder doing a similar job - Di Maria and Herrera are having to help the fullbacks. Remove a striker and get someone in beside him.

I think we'd see every other team in the league struggle by playing such an attacking line-up.

882~~~
He did what was expected of him and after Di Maria he was our best player today.

883~~~
When the team wins 4-0 everyone looks great, when the team loses 5-3 then you know the defenders on both sides had a shocker.

Blind did ok today, i don't think he should be the one gluing everything together in only his second game for United.

884~~~
Herrera was miles better then Blind.

886~~~
Can't believe what I'm reading here, I thought he was fine. The first goal is on Rojo, Evans who is in no man's land, Rafael who doesn't apply any pressure on the striker and the linesman because I felt the ball had gone out when De Laet crossed it. The second goal is all Clattenburg robbing us blind, the third goal is where I expected more from him because they played through us there but we had like six players pressuring the ball but no one seemed able to clear it convincingly. I don't think even Makalele or Keane could have done anything because they were individual errors.
We fell apart after their second goal but all those goals were avoidable but Blind would have needed to be a magician to stop those attacks.

887~~~
I think the commentators were saying.. not sure how much is correct.. but the Nugent was man marking him ( ala to Gerard).. so he was moving around and hence.. Rooney/Harera were coming down to pick up the ball..

888~~~
Are you feeling ok mate, for a moment there I thought you was being serious?

889~~~
Herrera was among the few good players to but I think Blind was the better out of the two

890~~~
Our midfield set up is like Real's last year with Blind replacing Alonso and Herrera replacing Modric, the thing is I am not sure that can work in our league in a lot of games, I think you need a physical presence in midfield in the PL. There are exceptions I know, I am sure many will point to the Carrick/Scholes combo in the 2006/7 season, but you were talking about a holding CM in his prime playing next to one of the greatest playmakers ever whose legs were still functioning fully.

891~~~
He was superb for 60 minutes. He's a classy player.

892~~~
This. I can't quite believe what I'm reading in most of these other posts. 

"Ji-Sung Blind" being one of them.

Thankfully, <a class="username" data-user="21825, @Ekeke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21825/">@Ekeke</a> was rational enough to post <i>actual stats </i>(imagine that, 'caf!) of Blind's performance, and contrary to consensus, Blind's defensive contribution was far from terrible, and let's face it, when did Blind at any point mis-place a pass, even when finding himself under man-marking pressure the whole game?

Blind did fine. I was pleased with him and I shall think that LvG will be happy with his contribution. What he cannot do is make up for poor positioning of the back four.

893~~~
I too feel we might need a more assertive midfielder in the near future. While Blind is a really good option he relies on others around him to extract the maximum out of his strengths. The current system with him needs central defenders who are extremely tactically aware and comfortable operating in an aggressive high line to ease the defensive burden on Blind.

Just like Ramos and Pepe did for Madrid with Alonso. Or PSG with Thiago Silva for Motta. Or Barcelona with Puyol and Pique for Busquets. Even our system with Carrick and Scholes could have collapsed I feel if not for Rio Ferdinand and his excellent mobility (Vida too but the effect wasn't as pronounced). There was some proof to be found later with him slowing down considerably and settling in deeper which lead to a drop in Carrick's performances.

Maybe one or both of Jones and Rojo in conjunction could embrace the responsibilities or a younger Rio but right now it's pure speculation and a pipedream.

Having said that, to address your point we might have the opportunity to sign the kind of midfielder you've alluded to Strootman come January if recent reports are to be believed. Very physical, doesn't mind doing the dirty work, feisty in the tackle and has some presence about him. He might need a bit of work transitioning to the position but the raw tools are all there plus a high game intelligence.

Saul Niguez would be another great option, albeit a little inexperienced so the learning curve for him might be steeper and patience among supporters might wear thin at times. He also possesses a higher ceiling than Strootman I feel and would be a better long term acquisition.

Really dig Carvalho too but I dunno.. Was a Moyes target and the trail has gone cold since Van Gaal's appointment.

894~~~
I thought he did well today, always available for the pass from the defense and did well overall. No complaints. I just think this new bunch like Rojo, Di Maria, Falcao, Blind and Herrera never experienced a environment like that before but unlike the shit players of yesteryear, they will learn from this and improve and we will improve as a whole. We are only 5 points of second so its not the end the world. Also unlike with Moyes, I expect performances to improve consistently under LVG, so we will be fine.

895~~~
Let's sort the opinions out from the stats :-

Daley Blind

Tackles - 2 (joint third highest)
Interceptions - 8 (Highest - next was Blackett with 5)
Clearances - 6 (all effective)
Pass percentage - 86%
Long passes - 4 (all successful)

Statistically speaking, WhoScored gave Blind a 7.4 rating, which, Herrera and Di Maria aside, makes him the third best performing player on the pitch.

896~~~
It started as real statement but in the end it turned out to be a joke. I just like defensive midfielder who is seen on the pitch and who adds extra bit of energy. Blind is tidy player but he disapeared in this game no matter what statistics he had. Yeah Cattermole, I actually think that he wouldn't be half as bad as you think anyway I wouldn't want him either. Let's wait for Strootman and until that hopefully Blind will get better over time

897~~~
When both full backs bomb forward, both your midfield partners bomb forward and you already have Rooney/Falcao/RvP ahead of you, your job as shielding player against an aggressive, counter-attacking team becomes very hard.

Did well in snuffing out attacks until the collective panic started. Didn't quite offer the composure or leadership needed but in his second game, was that really his job? Rooney, RvP, Smalling, De Gea, Rafael... I'm looking at you.

898~~~
Some fecking shocking stuff in here. He was fine. We had the game won if it weren't for the cnut ref!

899~~~
I swear to God for someone who's primary/secondary role is to screen the back four in that formation.. he went missing in action second half when things started to turn ugly.

900~~~
We did not have a physical presence in the last 6 years or so and managed to win the league on regular basis. In some games you need such a midfielder, but not the whole season. Jones can do the job when needed and that's it. I am not against it, but it is not a must.

901~~~
A lot different from his debut match. Leicester were more physical and quicker at closing down. He would of learned a lot about the league today

902~~~
This is typical Blind, he gets much blame when things go bad. He had some vital interceptions, and he is important in the buildup.

903~~~
So Blind is the new Carrick? Get's all the blame even when he was one of the better players!

904~~~
every holding player gets blamed if the team loses total control and if the defence get exposed over and over again; even the best like Alonso or Schweinsteiger. Its their job to set the pace of the game, to get control over the ball, to hold possession and to shield the defence. If a newly promoted side can score 4 times in 35 minutes, because they overrun us, he clearly didnt play good. Simple as that. That might be a decent performance for a side that battles relegation, but not for a side that wants to play champions league.

He didnt get the support that was needed but that cant be an excuse for the last 30 minutes. He struggled with the pace and physicalness of the game. I dont see how he can anchor the midfield by himself against counter attacking teams.

905~~~
The last 2 goals had NOTHING to do with him. Rojo makes a mistake and a long ball kills us, second goal again.... The first 2 goals were not regular anyway, so how is he to blame for that?

906~~~
way too much space between back4 and midfield, while the back4 already played fairly high. Thats the space where he has to be and he wasnt.

907~~~
Still, the goals were a results of something else, not that.

908~~~
Because the centrebacks were getting drawn out wide, and he was dropping in that vacated space. 

You'd rather the space be between the midfield and the goalkeeper?

909~~~
I was very impressed by him defensively in the last game, but today he disappointed in that department. He was still very good with the ball, but he should be better defensively than he was today for the position he is playing. Still, more than happy with his two performances so far.

910~~~
I am not sure if I said it here or in the newbies but he is not a robust enough defensive midfielder to be completely reliant upon. Especially in the premier league with the pace and physicality (thuggish players). He is going to get found out against rough-housing teams and attacking midfielders who don't play football, rather bully people on the ball in the hope that they make a mistake.

He is definitely a very tidy player and can play that role well enough if we function well enough for him to not have extended amounts of pressure on him. But I almost noticed the same sort of Michael Carrick syndrome of 'sit off the base of midfield and when he's on the ball get in his face as much as possible'. I feel as a defensive unit we have to be more aware that this is happening and have our defenders work to get them out of situations that effect us in those areas. 

This isn't a full on go at him but I was concerned even after the QPR game that players will learn to just bully him and I am not sure he is physically capable of rising above that.

911~~~
Didn't think he was too bad but I'd still fear about him coming up against strong midfielders. No idea what he was doing in the run up to their 3rd goal, seemed to challenge Smalling for a header when facing his own goal.

912~~~
So you are using a generalized theory to blame him even if the facts suggest otherwise, great. Rojo loses an areal ball, blame Blind. Oh Rafael makes a stupid error, Blind should have ....what? Rooney's lame clearance, Blackett's half hearted bloke, DDG not being at the races! How about when Rojo and Mata lose the ball, the fifth one. Let's blame the holding player, having a holding midfield player in front of you is not a license to lose it completely, defenders still have to do their duty and today they abandoned theirs!

913~~~
Why people blame this guy is beyond me. People must be blind!

I think he wasn't at fault for any of the goals in particular.

914~~~
Daley Blind was a major culprit today. Di Maria and Herera being very positive and attack minded players it was Daley Blind's job to shield the defence, and he failed. I think once Carrick is fit him and Blind will have to sit in front of the back four until the defence get their act together. We had a back four who have hardly played together, and it showed.

915~~~
It just creates another selection headache. In the modern game one player should be able to sit in that hole in front of the back four and hold midfield effectively. All the top teams have a capable player. Slotting a second player in there beside the anchor is just neutering our attack. Removing one more attacking player and placing another player in a deeper position. I am not sure that this is the answer, Carrick doesn't do any one on one defending but he does stand in the space a lot and recycle possession. If we had a proper hard battle one on one defensive midfielder then I could see a use for Carrick beside him but I just don't see the need to have two dedicated defensive midfielders and in the three others we have in Fellaini, Fletcher and Carrick they all have their combination breaking flaws. Mobility at the centre of them all.

edit: assuming when I say 'attack' I include those in advance of the anchor. i.e. Herrera and Di Maria with the 10 and strikers.

916~~~
wtf are you talking about. He could have done better at the 3rd and 4th goal, but thats not my point. I never implied that he is sole responsible for this result. At least Rojo, Evans, Rafael, Herrera and van Persie were worse. That still doesnt mean that he played well. He was nice and tidy with the ball and completely useless defensively. He´ll never be able to shield the defence on his own; not even against bad teams. He is an accident to happen in this role. He is often 5-10m out of position and he cant match the tempo of his opponents.
I said it before we bought him and after this performance tonight I am 100% sure, that he is not the player for that role. If van gaal wants to use him in this role he has to change the offence in a way that they contributes WAY more to the defence. Either that or we´ll concede plenty of goals.

917~~~
He was a ''major culprit'' but you go on to say that we need Carrick beside him, meaning you admit that he needed someone beside him in midfield in this tough away fixture. Then our back four was shambles, I agree but how is that his fault? We lost because the back four didn't apply themselves, whilst Blind wasn't as dominant as we'd have liked it is the individual errors that were to blame.

918~~~
I'd agree with you if we had 2 dedicated midfielders. I don't think we can count Di Maria as a central midfielder in the traditional sense. He's too good to be given responsibility to hold one position.

919~~~
I said we need someone besides him until our defence gets their act together.

920~~~
Blind was fine.

There's no way he was going to "shield" the defense alone. He needed help next to him. 4-2-3-1 was needed for this game. These guys took points off Everton and Arsenal and we expect Blind to "sit" and protect a sh!tty back 4?

Rojo was all over the place. Thank God Shaw is back there for WHU.

921~~~
The third goal I will give you but the fourth, are you nuts? Team us in forward motion and Mata loses the ball in a dangerous area, Smalling is out of position and Blackett is attracted to the ball, what should he have done in that short space of time?
We all suspect that he will be found wanting physically but this game doesn't reinforce that enough. He wasn't as influential as last week but he too was exposed because he was patrolling that area alone. 
I expect him to be adequate just until Carrick returns and for the big games he should play with Carrick.

922~~~
I think the number of forwards we have is limiting us on which formation to apply. Because Rooney is undroppable, we have to play him but we also have RVP, Mata and Falcao who have to play too. In a 4-3-3/4-2-3-1, or any formation that utilizes a double pivot we can't play three of those plus our best player. But if we could drop RVP and Mata, we could then play Herrera alongside Blind/Carrick, Rooney on the left, Di Maria(I think Di Maria is more dangerous drifting outwide from central areas and Rooney would in turn benefit if he is coming into the box later on during a move as Falcao woukd have occupied the defenders) at the tip of the midfield triangle, Falcao uptop and Januzaj on the right. I don't know the mechanics of how, but we need a double pivot and protection on the flanks, because stronger teams will rip us apart worse than what we saw today.

923~~~
Agreed, makes the attack function better by being the only one who seems to want to get the ball turn, look up and run forward with it.

924~~~
He did superb considering the way Leicester played. Not really the type of game to get the best out of him when most attacks were long balls drilled over his head.

925~~~
Showed just how bad QPR were. Blind wasn't poor but it was a good taste of what the EPL will be like. He won't be able to just sit back and dictate play as he pleases.

926~~~
That is a fair point about how the 2 CB's help the role of the holding CM, people always look at it as the holder basically covering and screening the back 4, but how the two CB's push out to protect and help the holding CM is also part of the role working within a well oiled unit, whether we have the CB's to do that I don't know though as yet to have them playing as good defenders yet let alone ones capable of a more evovled aspect of the role, and regardless I still think we need a physical presence in midfield.

Strootman is certainly assumed to be the preferred option by LvG and certainly ticks the boxes, I think Saul Niguez is too young, one to keep an eye on but we need ready made right now. Carvalho seems to have been more of a Moyes target I agree. Could Koke be an answer? and you'd have to think McCarthy will be catching the eye as well.

927~~~
Thought he moved the ball well today under far more pressure than at QPR, which I don't think was anything than a walk in the park against a dire squad with no belief or talent showing up at Old Trafford ready to get fecked, as happens a few times a season (Sunderland 2010 comes to mind, though there are more recent examples).

The goals were too direct and long to really implicate him.

928~~~
Nugent seemed to be following him everywhere in the first half when we had possession.

929~~~
Koke is a great player indeed. But I think he's more of a #8 than a #6. It'd be a waste of his abilities to shackle him in a more defensive role than he's accustomed to. If we hadn't bought Herrera, Kokw would be perfect for that position.

McCarthy is another excellent option. Accustomed to the league, very good passing ability on top of defensive awareness.

930~~~
He had a very poor game yesterday. His lack of composure was disappointing and also put pressure on the other players. When Leicester were putting pressure on us, every time he got the ball he panicked and just hoofed it forward, so basically he was inviting more pressure.

His position is key, and he needs to be the cool head in our midfield. Hopefully yesterday was and exception because he is adapting to the new league and maybe he was surprised by Leicesters physicality.

He is very good when we have tons of possession and we're building from the back, but he needs to step up his game when teams press us and run us to the ground.

931~~~
Am I the only one who thought he was decent? He covered our defenders well on quite a few occasions and his passing was decent as well.

932~~~
I agree.

He had a fair bit of pressure put on him, and was tracked continuously. Considering the same, he did alright. His defensive stats were good too, I think he did alright. Obviously he needs to pick up on the frenetic pace and physicality, but he'd cope well I reckon.

933~~~
Yup, he was man marked. Even the camera man spotted it and highlighted it some time during the play.

It was actually visible on the pitch too, Daley was making some weird runs that didn't really make sense unless you spotted that man-marking on him, he was trying to get himself some space and lose the marker or drag him away from defenders to play the ball. Of course, it would've looked better if our defenders didn't fecking hoof it again.

934~~~
Don't think much of yesterday was Blind's fault, he was abandoned by Herrera and Di Maria and had a cracked toilet behind him in Blackett and Smalling and it didnt help that Rafael and Rojo decided to play as strikers. Can't expect him to do all the work by himself...

935~~~
Somebody needed to tell the FB's to stay back for a while to kill game off. We have gone from overly defensive last season to bloody gungho this season. Poor Daley cannot cover for everybody. They need to be told that it the FB's go forward someone else has to drop back to cover. They aren't doing that. They are all bombing forward, which is exciting, but yesterday was suicidal. Then the ball goes over the top and their attack is right on our CB's who were all over the place. Someone at the club needs to be doing defensive drills with the defenders or it will never get better. The attack is fabulous, the defence is crazy.

936~~~
Maybe if LvG decided to go 4-3-3 with Di Maria in the front 3 and 2 #8's then Koke and Herrera with McCarthy as the #6 would work. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

937~~~
Nice.

But you forgot Ronnie as LAM in the front 3. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

938~~~
Damn! Must remember to add him as well as Varane and Hummels to the defense! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

939~~~
I thought he was great first half, second half could have been a bit better but most of the goals we conceded were individual errors, you can't do much about it, and Lvg should have made a tactical change and put Herrera right beside him. I saw the match again, our left hand side of Defence with Rojo and Blackett were hilariously bad. Rojo was awful Positionally and Blind had to fill his place which meant there was space through the middle, while Blackett kept losing individual battles and did stupid errors due to which we were on the backfoot. In the first half alone they made 5 mistakes together due to which they attacked and tested us. After saying all this one thing which i am delighted about is, its the second match in the Row in which Blind, Herrera, Di Maria all "Midfielders" have been our best players when was the last time we could have said that? .

940~~~
I agree with both posts.


Someone compared our formation to last-season Madrid. In RM this was different, because they had devastating trio up top capable of both creating and scoring. With Falcao, Rooney and RVP we need more support from the midfielders. In return, when they (Di Maria and Herrera) went up the pitch AND the fullbacks bombed forward he was asked to hold Leicester on his own. You can’t let that happen in this league, no matter what the opposition is.

I think he did really well considering the circumstances. His lack of physicality is obvious but he was asked to do way too much today. I’m actually positively surprised how good he was with his passing and under pressure. Better than I thought actually.

941~~~
I am not sure what you are trying to say.

the comparison to real madrid doesnt make much sense. They played a classic 433 switching to a 442 when defending. Bale, Di maria and Benzema are all hard worker, while Modric and Alonso are both very intelligent players. 
I agree that di Maria plays a different role this season. He has to run the whole offence, while for Madrid he played slightly deeper and was just one of several options to create something. For United he is a offensive midfielder with a free role, that is allowed to go where ever he pleases. He has to provide tempo, creative spark and width all by himself. For Real he was more of a hybrid between central midfielder and attacking midfielder. 
Herrera is also nowhere near Modric´s level. Modric will give any team genuine balance, while Herrera has a lot to learn. He reminds be a bit on Khedira. RvP and Falcao are also not necessarily workhorses. 

Uniteds lineup was closer to a 424 than to a 433 and in this kind of lineup you need a classic defensive midfielder/destroyer to balance things. Someone like Busquets, Martinez or Mascherano. Blind is a player similar to Alonso (obviously a couple of levels worse) and just not up for the task to anchor a team on his own. 

If the United performances reminded me of anything it was the german national team and how they played before the worldcup; with two central midfielders who were both no traditional defensive midfielders, (Schweinsteiger=blind, Khedira=Herrera) and 4 offensive players that contributed little to the defence. Opponents were constantly allowed to bypass the midfield and run at the back4, which made the back4 look terrible, even so individual quality wasnt the problem. 

Its obvious that I dont rate blind but besides that he is the wrong type of player for this system. He might work in a classic 433 or in a 4231 with hard working winger. In these lineups his sense for intercepting passes and playing smart defence could shine while his defecits cant be exploited. I agree that his passing looked very crisp besides being almost man-marked.

942~~~
I thought his movement was quite intelligent for the Cambiasso goal. Rafael had been dragged into the central area and it meant Marshall was left free in a wide left position, if he had got the ball then he would of had masses of time, Blind was rushing over there to cover that danger. After 2 games it's already clear what people mean when they say how defensively intelligent he is.

944~~~
A lot of posters seem to be saying play him at CB, I thought he as a DM or LWB?

Seems far to lightweight to play in the centre, he looks tiny?

945~~~
Played a game there during the World Cup I think. But yeah, his best position is midfield, and then wing-back.

946~~~
He's not a CB, if i remember right he played there only once last season at Ajax. He had spent most of his career as a LB, a pretty mediocre one if i may say, until De Boer decided to try him in the holding midfielder position in Ajax's reversed triangle midfield formation instead of Poulsen at some point in last season. He flourished in that position because he could put all the well developed aspects of his game, like good positioning and coverage of space, good distribution from behind and the ability to keep the defense and midfield connected, into full effect.

I don't see LvG using him as a CB unless we return to a formation with three CBs because that system requires defenders who are good on the ball. I'm just happy we have someone other than Fletcher or Cleverley who can play in our midfield when Carrick isn't available. In the previous seasons we really suffered from the absence of Carrick, our build up play could be described in 3 words: Get it wide and we simply couldn't impose our tempo in games.

Once Carrick returns LvG may try Blind as a LCM and give Di Maria a more advanced role, we are trying to make a new start with many new players in the squad fighting for places after all. I just don't want Blind to receive the same unfair criticism Carrick has because of the problems our sheer lack of physicality creates in the midfield and defense.

947~~~
Hoping for this myself, especially away from home, seen him play this role for Ajax a few times. Stick Shaw in at LB and move Rojo inside and we should be far more solid.

948~~~
I think he's been great since his arrival. We were completely at fault for the goals and there can be few criticisms levelled at Daley for the mistakes and overrun nature that we allowed to happen. 

Smalling and Rojo as CB with Shaw at LB. We simply cannot allow Blind to leave his post without a 100% fit Michael Carrick back. Fletcher is not capable to fight the fires our attacking minded players would leave him to deal with.

949~~~
I thought he was decent. We lost, so that equates to everyone is sh*t again.

I thought our midfield 3 are playing very well together. They pass and move, very quick to turn possession into an attacking threat. Rooney initially helped connect them to the front two, but then he had a brain fart for the last 40 odd minutes.

Certain players lost their head and as LVG said, we stopped playing as a team. I am pretty sure when they watch it themselves, which LVG should make them do, they will see where they screwed up.

To me, if Rojo had done his job instead of day dreaming, they don't get the first goal. Rafael, thinks before giving the opposition the chance to get a penalty they don't get the penalty. Both these events gave Leicester belief. They were fighting for everything, but creating sweet FA. From that moment on last years players resorted to last year and caused mass mayhem in the team.

950~~~
Whats the general consensus on how he did on Sunday? My impression was Leicester nullified him with a marker and a long direct ball

951~~~
They had somebody on him a lot of the  time so he wasn't able to dictate the play as much. Many other teams will do the same so he'll have to adapt a bit more but I thought he did alright. Definite improvement on anybody else we have for that position at the moment.

952~~~
think blind did well against Leicester considering he the defense behind him was appalling and he got no help from the players playing infront of him!

953~~~
Yes. And now, of course, every team is going to do the same.

954~~~
Seconded. He was OK. By min 70 he was doing a 1-man job. Given it was his 2nd game in a much faster league it wasn't a surprise he slowed down. We needed the team especially Herrera and rooney to drop and give him more help at that point but instead the team went looking for more goals exposing everyone.

955~~~
My immediate response had been to wonder where on earth he'd gone for the last 20 or so mins of Sundays horror show, but I believe someone else mentioned it on here, he's basically being asked to do the role of two in the diamond, usually you have two holding away from home, or in Mourinho's team at times potentially all 3 screening the back four.
He still for me, looks an incredibly useful, intelligent player, particuarly for the fee we paid.

956~~~
Not impressed by him today.

He completely panicked when pressed by West Ham 2nd half.

957~~~
You really need to watch it again. he was throwing himself in front of everything. Perhaps his passing not great but for a holding midfielder he did very well

958~~~
Dodgy, gave an awful back pass in the first half that should've resulted in a goal as well

959~~~
He made 1 or 2 errors here and there but other than that he was okay. Really up against it today.

960~~~
He made one or two mistakes, but he took care of the defensive role quite well.

961~~~
All our players did and always do. Its like we can't get over the 'injustice' of having one of our players sent of instead of thinking we are playing West Ham at home regardless of 10 men or not.

962~~~
Don't think all our players completely collapsed or panicked today atleast though there was some effect.

Blind as DM cannot afford to have some many dodgy moments and low 80s passing percentages to boot.

963~~~
I thought he worked really hard, his lack of pace and strength is going to be a constant issue though IMO, we certainly need another option to compete with him as a #6 and no I don't mean a player who is heading towards 34.

964~~~
Thought he was slightly dodgy up until the red card, but he zoned in once Rooney got himself sent off. Protected the defence well at times, but f*ck me he's slow.

965~~~
Blind plays like he is here a few years already. Fairly composed and comfortable when we are on in control, pace is an issue when we are bombarded through the middle, but he has done a lot better than I expected.

966~~~
I dont know what people are complaining about, I think hes a great player, always available for the ball, intercepts, and great forward passes

People here complain way too much, when for last 2-3 seasons, all we had was, cleverley, anderson, carrick, giggs, and sometimes jones in midfield

967~~~
He covers the full backs very well. He prevents crosses coming in and stops quite a few long shots by sliding in. Happy we actually got him now. If he bulks up a bit, I think he can be a very good player for us. He will also learn from Carrick when he comes back.

968~~~
Great signing. Will get even better next season once he gets used to everything and settles in. He looks composed and it is obvious he is a good footballer.

969~~~
He's a funny one Blind. What he does well he does brilliantly, but what he lacks, he really lacks. If that makes sense?

Still think we lack a physical 'destroyer' in the middle.

970~~~
I don't think he's better than Carrick

971~~~
I think it was his worst game so far but he did okay. He did panic a few times, which wasnt great. You can normally rely on him to keep calm

972~~~
Me too but I think there's not much between those two.

973~~~
he is perhaps the slowest player on planet earth. we need more physical presence. He can pull the strings when the opposition is but I still feel like we need to improve heavily on his position. Eithe him or carrick is not the solution. Be it Vidal or Strootman we need someone capable to outmuscle opponent aggresive enough to be feared in that midfield... Anyway he can become decent squad player in the future, maybe better than cleverley maybe not he is at least better fitting player than fellaini..

974~~~
He'd do well to be half as good as Carrick was at his best.

975~~~
Neither is Blind's position.

As for Blind himself, clear resemblance to Carrick obviously but his running style and sometimes his passing with outside of the foot screams Scholes to me.

976~~~
He is just 24 and he is playing as midfielder just a little more than one season. He will develop and get better. After the game against QPR people were over the moon how good it is, now he is just a good squad player. Reality is he is something in between but he will became first team player quality sooner rather than later. He can became very good DM.

977~~~
I think he will go on to play a key role as a squad player for us in the following years, ending up like Park, O'shea etc as a highly respected professional. I think it's safe to say that he wasn't LVG's first choice lest he'd have been here in July or thereabouts, LVG is aware of his limitations and will no doubt attempt to sign Strootman or another robust CM in the summer. 
Next year we will be back in Europe, CL/EL, and we will need a big squad again. Having him ready to come on in case of injuries is several levels higher than perpetually waiting on Anderson/Cleverley to come good.
Meanwhile he is been useful to have around and remember he is still settling in the team, league and country. But you are right he has nothing on an in form Carrick, Carrick will flourish behind Herrera and Di Maria, this is a guy that will tell you that a thirty-eight year old Ryan Giggs has been his best partner, over the last three years! He has been, literally, a one man midfield since Scholes lost his legs.

978~~~
We don't necessarily need to play with "proper" DM/DLP. With one of those players incoming they would send our midfield to another level and we could use their assets. So maybe playing two box to box players. Strootman more defensive one and Herrera more offensive one and infront of them di Maria always helping. I think them three would work in 4-3-3. Blind is overrated as defensive midfielder. Premier League is twice if not more the league eredivise is where Ajax walks the league apart some tougher matches with PSV. Blind doesn't remind me Scholes at all tbh..

979~~~
Good enough performance. Can't ask for him to dictate every week, so got what we needed from him.

980~~~
He was a little dodgy with possession a few times. Thought he was decent apart from that though.

981~~~
Definitely better than the Carrick we have at the moment (injured). After Carrick comes back to fitness I wouldn't mind if they rotate. Great signing.

982~~~
Played well apart from the 2 horrific, freak moments. Moved the ball neatly and was never massively out of position, though West Ham weren't really in the game enough to make that an issue. 

Looked comfortable chasing and pressing up the pitch despite his lack of pace, so maybe he and Carrick or he and the next CM we buy (Let's call him Kevin S. No. K. Strootman) can play together when we need a bit more solidity and Herrera is playing as the 10, out right (or sort of both if we play the way Citeh often do) or Herrera is injured.

983~~~
Maybe he does lack a bit of pace to be real top level but he invariably pops up in the right place at the right time defensively. He must be good at reading the game and figuring out where he should be at a particular moment for the position he's playing. Ok a couple of dodgy moments on the ball yesterday but generally I think his passing has been really excellent. I think I prefer him there to Carrick tbh. I guess when we play to top teams we'll learn alot about him.

984~~~
He suffered from the Johny Evans syndrome yesterday. Misplaced and under hit passes galore.

Was very good after the red though.

985~~~
I really like this guy, I'm not sure why? The way he thrived under the pressure after Rooney got sent off was brilliant to see. Champion mentality right there.

986~~~
6 Clearances
1 interception
4 blocks
Won 75% of his tackles.

He did not do great passing yes, but in second half he did his job very well . Shieleded the defense very well, got his clearances long. Passing is 83% which isnt bad considering most of second half he was to lump it forward.
One more thing, he absolutely bollocked mccnair and rojo for not coming out with the ball. That i think is something people dont notice but is very important part of our attacks.

987~~~
I'm really chuffed with him, feel he has cemented his position in the first team already and Carricks involvement should only be occasional now this season. Defensively he's doing a great job and once we have an established back line he isn't going to be as stretched. Really happy with how our midfield is set up right now.

988~~~
True but something i like about him is he is willing to be direct and not just look to get the ball out to the wing. Yesterday in the first half there was a ball to Di Maria (who should have done better) which cut straight through their midfield and defense which really impressed me. I'm not saying hes better than Carrick but i dont think Carrick would have tried it.

I dont think yesterday was his best game, gave the ball away a bit and had a few misplaced passes that could have cost us on another day (back pass to Valencia wtf?!) but i do like him so far and think he adds steel to our midfield. Really reminds me of Hargreaves (hopefully not too much though!)

989~~~
He's doing really well right now although at times you could see he's still not adapted to the pace of the league, he will improve even more as the season goes along.

990~~~
He was actually trying to orchestrate whole midfield and defense behind him as you've said. I've seen him calling Herrera ( per Ander ) couple of times to either press or get back to his position, he was sort of reminding people what to do, I liked that. Plus it's those two who try pressing game more and more often, if we can get whole team to press it will be amazing.

I like this guy overall, definitely my #1 CDM at the moment.

991~~~
Ive been pleased with him overall, but in the last 2 games when the tides turn he's lost some composure. Cant be faulted for that tho. - the teams new, he'll bed in well.

992~~~
For a brand new signing, he's been great. More than his money's worth. Don't forget we paid just £16m for him.

993~~~
His passing was a bit sloppy but still a good performance by him.  He has a good read of the game and covers a lot of ground, which I just can't see Carrick doing at this point in his career.  We should certainly have Carrick as a squad player but IMO Blind should be the regular in that position.

994~~~
That was Rojo's price, Blind was actually £13.8m which is a very good deal

995~~~
Strootman has limited creativity and slows down the passing game. He is great to cover for creative players who are lacking on defensive workrate like Mata but in possession he is significantly worse than Blind. Extra muscle on midfield is great but if your defense is built around keeping possession you can't compromise on ability on the ball. 

I don't think you have seen the Eredivisie in recent years, the last team that walked the league was PSV a decade ago. These days the top teams drop points all over the place and easy games are rare. Blind is used to play with a high defensive line in both league and CL. There are not that many DMs around who have his kind of skill set and experience and who are not tied up at another top team.

996~~~
There is this one dimensional mentality from some people, we got to have this attacking midfielder and this defensive midfielder. I still think fans want this so called muscle in midfield, without factoring in their ability

997~~~
There were a few times when he was standing unmarked in his position and our defenders were just refusing to pass to him, instead just passing it round the back, started to get really annoyed.

998~~~
I'm so glad we signed this player, love him.

999~~~
I feel he's got a second yellow just waiting to come.

1000~~~
looks like a great signing for us.

1001~~~
Thought he was excellent today.

1002~~~
I must confess I could see him getting a second yellow during the game.

1003~~~
So could I. Apart from that, I was impressed. Lovely weight on lots of his passes, has enough awareness to release the ball immediately.

1004~~~
There was one point near the end today where someone just smashed the ball at him from about two yards, and he controlled it like he was Zidane.

I really like him, I just wish he had a bit more about him physically, and in the tackle. Very good signing though.

1005~~~
I think he is but was playing with a yellow card to his name for most of the game.

Still i think he'll turn out to be the best bit of business for us in which is saying something!

1006~~~
He's got great control of the ball and always manages to make the right passes, just what we need to shield the defence though there was danger of him getting sent off today.

1007~~~
He does a lot of things right but he does dive/over-commit at times which causes problems and can get the ball away cheaply at times. Still its a promising start for him and when Carrick is fit we've got good options between the two as well as playing both if we want control.

1008~~~
I'm already a massive fan of him and he looks like a really good addition to our squad.

He is so calm on the ball, picks good passes, makes himself available and has a good tactical understanding. Before we signed him, a lot of people had a go and said that if we are going to sign him, it was just because of him being Dutch. I think he already proved people wrong and looks like a proper value for money signing.

1009~~~
Goes to ground a bit too much, was worried after he picked up a booking, but looked pretty good overall.

1010~~~
I have to admit he has really impressed me and I think he has the hardest job in the team, he doesn't really have a midfield partner and he is playing in front of a very inexperienced CB partnership. Today he managed his game well after the early yellow and made some excellent interceptions.

1011~~~
Something i like about him is hes got a pass in him. After watching Fletcher and Cleverley in possession they would seem to work off the ball well enough to turn and play a forward pass - something Blind does well.

My point is, my god i'm happy we finally seem to have a central midfielder who can pass the ball forward!

1012~~~
Very clever footballer, nothing flashy but so efficient. Very important to the team.

1013~~~
I think he did very well today until the last 10 minutes when the whole team was shit except De Gea of course. He seems to be an intelligent player and his positional awareness seems to be good as well. Thats what happens when you grow up in a footballing household I guess.

1014~~~
Don't get why Everton didn't put a man on him constantly like Leicester and West Ham.

Anyway he was pretty good today just like QPR with less pressure on him.

1015~~~
Absolute bargain. He's playing an incredibly hard role and is often quite lonely in the centre but he's doing a job for us.

1016~~~
was very good in the first half but faded away in the second. He needs to play with Herrera but Valencia did the job as well, anyway he needs to learn how to shoot. His two cleverley-like shots at the edge of the box it got me mad but overall decent performance he will do fine for us, as he will play a lot of matches and will have a chance to improve as there is no palyer to play at his position at the moment. Thorpe and Fletcher noo.. well maybe Carrick is back soon

1017~~~
He's clearly a higher class of midfielder than we've seen in recent years and we should be thankful for that. Technically excellent and reads the game so well. Most of his passes have a purpose, either to retain possession or probe spaces to attack. I also like how he's brave enough to shoot when has a sight of goal. We've missed that quality from the middle of the pitch. Looks like money well spent.

1018~~~
Amazing first half. Still good but less so in the second because the ball went predominantly aerial.

Everton ballsed it up by not marking him at all though.

1019~~~
I think he's going to be one of those players that people will always be wondering why he doesn't pick up more cards. There's quite a few like him who relish a tackle and are forever crunching in or doing cynical taps to slow the game down and referee's are aware that if they aren't a bit more lenient with this type of player, they'll be off a ridiculous amount of times and refs are taught to try and keep it as an 11v11 spectacle where possible.

When other players do it out of character, they get carded, it's not fair but it's how it is.

1020~~~
Another solid performance, I'be been very impressed with his efforts so far.  He doesn't seem to make too many mistakes, and seems to be a calming influence in tight spaces.

1021~~~
Biggest compliment to him is managers are realising they have to put someone on him to stop seeing so much of the ball. In the second half you saw Naismith stick close to him and something similar happened vs Leicester

1022~~~
Absolutely brilliant today. De Gea just edged him out from a MoM performance.

1023~~~
I love him already. Such a step up from our midfield options in the past couple of seasons. Quiet efficiency and a stunning weight of pass. Could time some of his tackles a little better but hey, it didn't harm Scholes's career!

1024~~~
Really like this guy. He's calm, he's intelligent, he has great awareness, he's a slick passer and he's got a nasty side. Him and Herrera both have a competitive edge and don't seem afraid to stick their foot in if need be. Our midfield has lacked that for as long as I can remember. On top of that they both have world class hair as well.

1025~~~
Another positive performance form him. I feel the best is still to come from Blind.

1026~~~
Fast becoming an important player for us, long may it continue.

1027~~~
His anticipation to just step into passes from the opposition is excellent. Seems to tidy up so many wayward passes. I always wince as it looks like he's taken one or two steps too many, but he still always manages to get his pass away neatly when the opposition are closing him down. I think he looks very useful when he steps into the opposing half, as his passing to the wide players is very quick and accurate. Shame he didn't have his shooting boots on, but I really want him to grab a goal. He seems to have a good, rasping shot on him most of the time.

I don't think he gets the credit he deserves overall since he's been with us. Whenever he makes a sliding interception, or is the centre of some slick playing out from the back, the commentators just don't say anything. It's never mentioned after the game by pundits. This sort of dirty defensive stuff was purred over when Fernandinho was doing it last season.

1028~~~
Would be great if could also learn how keep the whole formation in one piece while team's defending. There was way too many holes in midfield and defense today.

Apart from that he looks bright and always physically and mentally prepared for further matches as his consistency is progressing with much needed haste.

1029~~~
Very promising early signs from this guy.

He reads the game very well.

1030~~~
How is he supposed to do that by himself ? It has to be a collective effort.

1031~~~
He's looked good in the home games, but he's tended to have acres of space half the time. 
Still want to see how he copes against teams with better midfields. But he's clearly an improvement on what we've had recently, so good stuff.

1032~~~
Not his fault though since this formation makes us susceptible to being outnumbered on the wings, it is also his duty to snuff out danger on the flanks and sometimes he is left isolated when the two flanking him are dragged out. I think if we played 4-2-3-1 which enables us to defend in two banks of four we'd look more solid as the wingers/inside forwards would pin the full backs back track them. 
I think the team is suffering from as a whole from Van Gaal's attempt to fit everyone in.

1033~~~
Usually by shouting from top of his lungs: 'Hold the f****n line ! ! !'

1034~~~
I'm sure he shouts (not that I can hear him from my living room) but if only it takes a shout to position correctly players, there wouldn't be half as many defensive cock ups in the league.

1035~~~
True that. If only Strootman was fit this summer we would probably be a stone right now in midfield.

1036~~~
Yup, there's also almost whole defense formation on itself that brings even more problems to the whole tactic and to be fair for Blind, he already doing us a huge favour by staying cool in most of critical situations.

1037~~~
In tough matches, him next to Carrick should offer us plenty protection and decent ball movement

1038~~~
By the end of International break, we will have Carrick along with Herrera to provide bit of depth and variety in midfield. Main test will be against Chelsea for how Blind and the others manage the midfield.

1039~~~
I thought he was excellent today, his technique is far better than I expected it to be.

1040~~~
Surprised to see how much time and space he had on the ball today. Martinez looked like he did feck all in terms of preparation for this game.

1041~~~
That would be ideal at the moment.

Even unfit Carrick would offer more balance than Fellaini and probably even Fletcher. Hopefully we will know something substantial about him before Chelsea & City clash.

1042~~~
He came from Ajax , technique is very important there .

1043~~~
I love it when he runs a few steps back and then plays a pass because he's now created the space for it. Lovely stuff today.

1044~~~
I didn't think he had his best game today, I was cursing him for not playing the simple ball more often

1045~~~
For the Chelsea/City games we need a five men midfield behind Falcao, no doubt about it otherwise they will tear us a new one. 
--------Blind---Carrick------
-----------Herrera-----------
--Rooney--------Di Maria--

1046~~~
Don't think anyone would be too unhappy with that midfield. It's light-years ahead of anything we've put out in recent years.

Pretty much all those players (in the central 3) are solid, work hard, have tactical discipline, pass well and aren't just one-dimensional destroyers.

1047~~~
Rooney is suspended for it, well the Chelsea game at least. I think we'll see:
Probably what we'll do for big games all the time this season when all are fit (put in Rooney for RvP of course). Gives us Di Marias ability and pace and pressing as an attacking mid, you have Herrera's creativity further back but also the defensive qualities of Carrick and Blind.

1048~~~
That is also a solid line up but I don't think the diamond has enough balance to shut out a team like Chelsea or City, we need our dangerous players on the wings to pin back their full backs and at the same time avoid a two on one on the flanks. If Rooney is out then Januzaj plays instead, carrying two No.9s in this type of match is asking for trouble imo.

1049~~~
When we defend we've generally used a flat 4-3-3, Mata pushing up in the middle and the strikers defending wider so that we don't get isolated on the flanks. Di Maria in the hole would have a free role pretty much, to drop deeper or drift out to the flanks or run and press through the middle. Don't think there's any chance Januzaj starts against City/Chelsea in place of one of our strikers anyways, unless we get an injury, but I think there's every chance that it could work with the players we have. Herrera and Blind are both hard workers and having Carrick behind will let them roam the pitch more and close down wider areas, knowing there are 2 others in the middle always.

1050~~~
I would love to play this lineup against Chelsea, i think with this lineup we can go toe to toe against them or any other top side, with Herrera, Carrick and Blind we have enough defensive players as Herrera likes to get stuck in and is very adopt defensively, while with Herrera, Di Maria, Falcao and Rvp we have more than enough attacking ability to hurt them, if i were LVG, against Chelsea i might play Janujaz in place of Rvp, Janujaz and ADM running at Terry or Cahill would certainly test them and Terry might slip and give away a penalty, Rvp and Falcao both physical strikers are the one's terry, Ivanovic and Cahill likes going against.

1051~~~
A Blind/Carrick combo would be good in possesion, but I do worry that they would struggle to match the physicality of a team like Chelsea. We still lack that proper physical presence in the centre imo.

1052~~~
I agree especially when RVP is offering nothing for me to justify handing over control of the match to the opposition.

1053~~~
Today he was terrific

1054~~~
Strootman cannot come in soon enough. The issue being is Blind suited to be more advanced than the DM role? I thought even DM was further forward than his normal position?

1055~~~
Yeah, I reckon Strootman will probably be the answer to that particular conundrum. No idea which role suits Blind better though, he looks very good in the role he's playing now, I just think idealy he needs someone else in there with him that can put themselves about a bit more.

1056~~~
That's why i don't mind seeing valencia in big games.

1057~~~
It's the best we can do to be honest, but it's really not that bad. Carrick is a pretty good physical presence and if he can get even close to his 12/13 form (I think he can) then he'd be a great player to have in there. Just adds so much calmness on and off the ball.

1058~~~
I'd much prefer:

-----------Carrick---------
Herrera----Blind-----Di Maria
----------Mata---------
--------------Falcao--------

1059~~~
Credit to him, he did well enough today. You could see the differnce it made when Fellaini came on and started running round like a headless chicken. 

It'll do for now (well it'll have to) but long term I expect a few new bodies in midfield, and I do fear for us against Chelsea/City.

1060~~~
Love him.

Just get Scholes in to teach him how to shoot. Please.

1061~~~
Think we'll get Strootman in January so I won't have many worries long term. Herrera, Strootman in front of Blind or Carrick is a perfectly balanced midfield trio IMO, behind Di Maria, Falcao and then either a winger like Januzaj or a striker like Rooney.

1062~~~
Amazing player, my favorite United player now. Watched United live for the first time ever and thought Blind was calm & very composed and won the ball in midfield quite often. Loved it!!!

1063~~~
??? Didn't scholes play this role quite successfully a few times towards the end of his career? 
I thought he was very good today. Particularly in the first half. Very intelligent young man!

1064~~~
He has been good so far and was brilliant in the first half today. He seems to fade fairly rapidly around the hour mark though and seems to lose his positioning, making big holes through the middle. Hopefully his stamina picks up as we go through the season.

1065~~~
Before this game his shooting looked pretty good, had quite a few long range efforts well struck that were on target. Just didn't go well for him today I think. I reckon he'll score a screamer or two this season

1066~~~
Yes, but if you noticed the whole team was a bit niggly in the second half, gave a little too much space to Everton. He had to cover a lot of ground and his hopefully his stamina will pick up. I am quite confident that Blind's over all play will improve. He seems to be a manager's player like wanting to repay all the faith that he is being shown by being asked to play in midfield.

1067~~~
That driving ball forward,,oh how ive missed you.

Yeah it sometimes carries too far or is a little ,but it puts all the players in advanced position,controlling and turning for goal,or in at it.

He s a wee belter,always moving ,thinking,reading what going on.

1068~~~
I thought he was very good again today. I don't know where we'd be right now if we hadn't brought him in. He reads the game really well and, unlike Carrick, isn't afraid to put a challenge in. He really needs a bit more support defensively against top half opposition though.

1069~~~
Slowly becoming my favourite player at United right now

1070~~~
If Carrick is fit for West Brom I'd like to see Blind further up the pitch and Carrick play as the anchor. 

Blind has done very well so far imo.

1071~~~
I enjoyed his performance today.

1072~~~
Really good today IMO.

1073~~~
He hasn't faced a top opposition yet, but it's clear to see that he was a very good signing. Chelsea/City will be where we can see if he really has it to be the starting DM for United. Tremendous improvement on Fletcher/Fellaini/Cleverley/Anderson

1074~~~
He reminds me of what I thought Hargreaves would be, except the left footed and Dutch part. Oh and this one will definitely never score goals. But that tenacity and crisp passing is more than enough in his role.

1075~~~
I think I understand what you are saying.  However, I see it more like this...in past games the opposition was pressing him a bit more and he was quite effective moving the ball around quickly to maintain possession.  In the first half of the Everton match he was actually given quite a bit more room to operate.  Therefore, instead of the quick one touch passing, he was actually able to stride with the ball forward and play more decisive passes.  Think of the pass which sprung Rafael down the right for the cross that lead to the ADM goal.  In the second half Everton pressed up more, partially looking for the equalizer, but I also thought it was in no small part to changes they made in not wanting to give Blind as much time as he had because it looked too easy for us with the ball at his feet.  Full credit to him.

1076~~~
Right there with you.

1077~~~
I had this in another thread, but the more I think about it the more I think it makes sense to just play Herrera as the 10 and let Valencia help out Rafael with Hazard. Not sure Mata would get much change out of Matic there, whereas Herrera's superior mobility could cause them more problems. Agreed on the rest, though.

1078~~~
Seems like he's a bit wasted to play just as a 'pure' DM, screening the defence. His positioning and tackling aren't that great, whilst his energy and passing would make him a good box to box CM.

1079~~~
I don't know, I think it does suit him. He knows where to be and IMO makes it easier for the transition to happen between defence and midfield. His passing is good, he's good at intercepting. The only thing is he at times looks a little slow and not as physical. I wouldn't change where he plays. He will only get better once the understanding grows. After all, he kinda does stitch to the team together. Everyone is looking and feeding off him at the start of our possessions.

He is intelligent and calm. He has the technical ability to match as well. I like him a lot.

1080~~~
Seems like when we're defending, the opponent often have free shots from the center, right on where a DM supposed to be. Don't get me wrong, I like that we have player like him who is technically good, good passer, and willing to work hard.

Compared to Fellaini as DM, Blind is like Busquets and Makelele being fused together. But I'm just being spoiled watching Carrick for years, with his clever positioning.

1081~~~
If Carrick is fit for the Chelsea match, I could see this being effective.
       Carrick
Valencia - Blind
       Herrera
Di Maria - One of our #9s

I think Blind is intelligent enough to do a job there and it would give us a solid side defensively that has the pace and movement to catch out opposition on the counter.

1082~~~
I really enjoy watching him play. So efficient and intelligent.

1083~~~
Quickly for me <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1084~~~
Pleasantly surprised. I basically thought he'd be decent in a John O'Shea kinda way, his ability on the ball is a fair bit better than I thought.

1085~~~
If he keeps playing well, you won't be the only one pleasantly surprised.

1086~~~
I don't think it is wise to use someone who has not played a single game for months against one of the best teams in the world. Not to mention that our defending is lacking and a poor DM performance could spell disaster for the team. Blind should retain his defensive midfield position.

1087~~~
I really enjoy 'looking' for Blind. He is one of those players that ghosts around and sorts shit out but nobody notices it. Kind of like Makelele (but obviously not on that level... yet). Seems dependable and will grow into the team and become a key clog over the course of the season I'm sure.

1088~~~
He is a very good player. That said, I do wish he were a bit more physically imposing. In our current system, I must admit that if given the choice I would have prefered Nigel De Jong to him in the summer.

1089~~~
You can be physically imposing without cracking through people every second tackle.

Blinds really surprising me at how he shadows intercepts and drives a ball forward usually forward.

He and Carrick covering and supplying a front four i cant wait to see,even ander in a three on paper looks a really  solid trio.

I was for deJong in the summer at a desperate moment and im much happier with what we have got instead.

1090~~~
Well basically I want a midfielder who does 'crack through people every second tackle'.

Intercepting and stuff isn't physically imposing. It is useful of course. But we are still a little soft I think. NDJ is quick across the ground and is a warrior. If we are to play with a sitter, I'd like someone like him, or Mascherano perhaps.

1091~~~
We certainly are missing that smasher type,even just to come on and sure things up.

We always have Fellaini<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1092~~~
My man of the match against Everton. Thought he held up the midfield really well despite us missing Ander. Kept things ticking and always moving around to offer himself. Has superb pitch awareness like Carrick too; picks out team mates really well and calms the game.

1093~~~
He was excellent yesterday.

1094~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AoVLTai1kE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1095~~~
Was that deliberate? If so - well done to you sir

1096~~~
He was good, but man of the match? That's insane.

1097~~~
Faded badly in the 2nd half, allowed runners to drive through midfield and should have put one attempt on target with the time and space he was afforded, even form that range. Good performance but there were atleast 4 or 5 better players on the pitch. (De Gea > Di Maria > Rafael > Falcao).

1098~~~
Yeah we now have the potential to field a solid midfield three for the tough games.
------Carrick---Blind--------
------------Herrera---------
---Rooney--Falcao--ADM--
with Rooney and Di Maria as inside forwards flanking and moving about Falcao with freedom,Rafael and Shaw providing the width.

1099~~~
It says a lot about the weakness of our midfield prior to this season that three of our summer midfield signings have become integral within a month.

1100~~~
Still makes too many elementary mistakes, but I'm happy to put that down to nerves and the process of settling into the side. I've not seen anything to be overly concerned about, at any rate.

I actually think he can easily make the DM position his own for years to come. I don't understand the people who claim he'll end up a squad player in the long run. Seems good enough to be a starter, for me. Probably only lacks a big passing range, but that's less important when we play as narrow as we have been doing.

1101~~~
This will be a problem with him i feel, his lack of athleticism and physicality is telling. it affects us in transition hence why we are still so vulnerable on the counter, when he pushes up I know if he doesn't get the ball then we are in trouble. We need a system which affords him protection form his midfield partners, Herrera and Di Maria have to help him out in that regard. On the ball and tactically he is very good. He distributes well and is alway saveable to receive the ball, this league my be too physical for him, time will tell.

1102~~~
Carrick and Blind together in midfield seems a bit too lacking in the physical and combative. Play one of them plus two all-round midfielders. We need another guy like Herrera.

1103~~~
Don't know! Just my opinion <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> guess I appreciated what he did the most though I'm probably overreaching here

1104~~~
Indeed. I think a Blind/Carrick combo would struggle against players like Toure. 

We still need a Strootman.

1105~~~
The fact he hasn't been used as a utility player is helping him too, given the defensive absentees if would have been easy to shift him around. But giving him a run of games and the chance to cement a position in the team is something i wish SAF would have done with Jones.

I hope Blind gets some extra help for the games against Chelsea, City and Arsenal because he will need it! but so far i have been very impressed with him.

1106~~~
I didn't think anyone would notice <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1107~~~
I'm just happy that we have a decent, solid midfield now and Blind plays an integral part in that. It will take a few more outings, especially against tough opponents, before I can call him my new favorite dude. But very very promising indeed.

1108~~~
He is playing well enough for me. I don't see what some of you guys above me have against him. Once the whole team is better drilled, no one will speak a bad word about him.

People over rate the whole physical thing. Last season a declining Xavi and his midget Barcelona lads went to the Etihad and passed City off the park. Yet every week we kept hearing how powerful Toure and Fernandinho were. In fact, a lot people do Toure an huge disservice, he is an excellent footballer and would be one weather he was big or not.

1109~~~
I actually don't think he's been as impressive as some on here are stating. Sure he's been decent, with a good game against QPR, but he still makes errors that could cost us goals.

1110~~~
Easy to forget that he's still only 24. There's still loads he can improve on. Wouldn't be surprised if he even managed to add some physicality to his game. He has sufficient tenacity already.

1111~~~
If we can bulk him up properly he'll be even more stellar. I don't buy this bulking up costs agility crap. Some f the most agile players are bulk eg Ronaldo, Zlatan, Aguero..if we can add 5 kilos int eh right area by next season Blind will be even better. He's great now but can be outmuscled at times.

1112~~~
We have a very young group, and people forget this things.

1113~~~
You don't get very far in the Ajax academy if you've got the ability of John O'Shea on the ball.

He's wonderfully composed with it, plays the right pass practically always, taught from very young.

1114~~~
I'm sure he will adapt to the physical aspect with time.  He comes from a league where it doesn't matter as much, it's not like he's slight of frame and can never develop physically. Its also an overrated part of the English game - if he/we can keep the ball moving well enough it won't matter. Some people who clamour for another Keane-like enforcer forget just how good he was on the ball too. The uncoachable aspects like intelligence on the ball Blind has in spades. 

He is quickly becoming my favourite player.

1115~~~
He is basically doing what I thought Gareth Barry could have done for us if we'd signed him. The bonus is, he's a long term signing rather than a stop gap. Doing well for us at the moment.

1116~~~
Blind's a very good player in the making. In the build up to the Di Maria goal against Everton, he played an important yet understated role. Held on to the ball a split second longer than others might have and effectively forced Rafael to make the right run - once he had, the ball was beautifully weighted into his path, Rafael put a great ball in that Baines struggled to clear, Mata with a lovely assist to Di Maria, followed up by a great finish.

Very good goal, underpinned by Blind's patience and intelligence. I can't wait to see a trio of Blind, Carrick and Hererra in a big game.

1117~~~
He is left too exposed by his midfield partners currently as Mata doesn't have the workrate required for this formation when the other two midfielders are as attack minded as Herrera and di Maria. I am actually excited by the idea of signing someone like Strootman and playing a midfield of Blind - Strootman - Herrera and pushing di Maria on to the wings in a traditional 4-3-3.

1118~~~
"Left exposed", like for Carrick for the majority of his United career!

Hopefully, the two of them in tandem will give us a really solid platform.

1119~~~
Yea I could notice that he was demanding Rafa to bomb forward multiple times in the game.

1120~~~
I have my reservations about a potential Blind-Carrick partnership. Can definitely see it being deployed at City or even against Chelsea if Carrick is fully fit by then and we'll get to see how that goes.

1121~~~
Given the weaknesses in the back line, I'd say having the extra midfield insurance is a necessity.

I'd love to see the following against Chelsea (won't happen, mind):

Carrick--Blind
----Hererra
Januzaj--ADM
-----Falcao

1122~~~
If we play Rooney, Di Maria and Herrera infront of Carrick and Blind it probably makes up for their lack of dynamism. Carrick can be the one who sits while Blind is given the freedom to go forward.

1123~~~
I agree. It's the English way of thinking as long as you're a strong lad, you're fine. But the football skills are way more important and there are smaller players who can be physical if needed as well. As you said, Toure is primarely a very very good footballer

1124~~~
I watched him against Everton and he was always in a great position to receive the ball during the first half. He was in acres of space and often turned and drove through midfield before giving it to one of the forward player's; really turning defence into attack. This has been a common theme with him to be honest. He's been an 8/10 in every game for the first 45 minutes, has been roughly a 7/10 at 45 - 60 minutes and has been a 4 or 5 for the last half an hour. Naturally we've been hurt on a few occasions in the last half an hour and this is one of the reasons.

It's clear he's still acclimatising to the speed of the Premier League. He either needs to manage his current stamina levels better and leave some in the tank, or work harder on his fitness to be able to maintain the pace throughout the game. It's completely understandable though, coming from the Dutch League.

1125~~~
He's basically the Dutch Gareth Barry.

1126~~~
Considering he out-performed the English Gareth Barry on Sunday (in one of his first games in a new team/league) that's a little harsh.

1127~~~
Definitely better than Gareth Barry. 

His ability to control the game from the middle, for one, is superior.

1128~~~
Blind is already looking as good as Gareth Barry at his peak. In a year or so, Blind will be much better than Gareth Barry ever was.

1129~~~
I always thought Barry looked totally out of his depth for City and was extremely lucky to last as long as he did in their team. It made me want to tear my hair out when people compared him to Carrick.

1130~~~
His last season with them was awful. I remember one game where he scored one (or two) own goals? Just looked like he didn't belong.

1131~~~
I don't think that's fair. He was a crucial member of the side that won the Premier League. He wasn't flashy and he wasn't a superstar, which is what lost him his place in the side, but he was a calming presence who added balance to a side full of top talent. Fernando and Fernandinho are better players on paper but I don't think either offer the same balance to the side. I don't think he's as good as Carrick and he isn't necessarily the same type of player but I do think he was just as important for City as Carrick was in our last top side.

1132~~~
I can't figure out if people are underrating or overrating Barry here.

1133~~~
At times against Everton there seemed to be too much space between him and the rest of the midfielders. I don't think the players have quite figured out how to play this system perfectly yet, which is good because already the midfield is so much better that it was. For example I feel at times when we're under pressure the 10 should be dropping back a bit more to help out, but against Everton Mata was playing more like a striker than a midfielder and it left Blind too isolated.

Overall I think he's been fantastic. He gives the impression of a very consistent performer with his excellent technique and quick passing ability. Sometimes I mistake him for Mata when he's on the ball!

1134~~~
I guess I can accept that. I thought De Jong was a much better player and Barry only got in the team because he's better on the ball than de Jong and Mancini didnt feel the need to play a destroyer like de Jong next to toure when city would dominate most games. I've seen way too many people say he was about Carrick's level which just wasn't true at all.

1135~~~
I think people tend to underrate him at times, myself.

1136~~~
Barry was a good player for City for the most part. They got rid at the right time, but he served them well. The comparison isn't all that harsh albeit I do think that Blind reads the game better and is that touch more refined on the ball.

I'm a big fan of this guy and I enjoy his performances, but I don't think it's unfair to suggest he isn't regular starting material for a team with our eventual aspirations. He'll be a brilliant player here overall, though, I'm sure of that. Exactly the kind of squad player you want.

1137~~~
It really isn't this is a league where athleticism is important especially in central midfield. I just don't think he will be the guy we want him to be long term unless he has protection in the middle, in all our games it has been too easy to get at our back line and he is our defensive midfielder. He will struggle 1 on 1 against the very best attackers.

1138~~~
Best value for money out of the new signings

1139~~~
Our cheapest summer signing but fast becoming one of our most important. He reads the game superbly and because of that his positioning is always excellent. When one or two of his teammates close someone down he's always nearby to mop up the loose ball, and that's important. 

He is becoming a key member in this team because whilst he might do the unflashy/unspectacular stuff, he knits everything together, provides a solid platform and enables the attacking players to be creative. He links defence and attack really well and a big part of me doesn't want to see him ousted for a more robust DM, I think if we let him develop naturally he will become more rounded and a brilliant player for us.

1140~~~
Going to be a fan favourite that's for sure. Does an unnoticed job, is tidy and efficient. 
Hope he stays fit, him and Herrera could form and excellent partnership in the middle of the park

1141~~~
Hard to dispute that but if you've read stories on Blind's ascendancy at Ajax you'd have noticed how he went from the most ridiculed player to the one the fans sang about. His story is about someone who has fought hard to be where he right now, I'm sure he and the coaches would have noticed how he is physically and steps are being taken to rectify that as we speak. He will bulk up even though he will never be as strong as an ox he will be just strong enough. The physicality can be remedied, to an extent, but what he has in abundance can not be taught or bought- intelligence and tactical awareness.

1142~~~

1143~~~
Comparing Blind to Keane?  Seriously?

1144~~~
No chance even at £60m that is Di Maria

1145~~~
He will play LB tonight

1146~~~
Enjoyed this.

1147~~~
Sounds like a good guy. Hope he goes from strength to strength.

He didn't want any involvement with Keano <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1148~~~
I don't think anyone would welcome comparisons to a club legend after a handful of games, unnecessary pressure.

1149~~~
Where do these things come from anyway? Do journo's just make this bullshit up? Not a single fan I've spoken to has compared him to Keane, I haven't seen it posted on here, he doesn't even play like Keane or play the same role. Do they just go "some fans have compared you to.." having plucked it out of their arses?

1150~~~
Yes.

1151~~~
I feel calm with him there, relaxed when he has the ball, unusual.

1152~~~
I always feel he is an upgraded Kuyt. Blind has good tactical awareness, huge stamina, workrate, always fit and his basic technique is also very good because of his Ajax history. Kuyt always grew in his rol at whatever club he was. He even scored in a Cl final. I feel like Blind is the same, he will grow to the level required of a team with title and cl winning aspirations. He needs some time to develop (especially on his strenght) but if he develops like he did the past 2 years, he will become a huge player for us in the future.

1153~~~
Sir Alex Ferguson likes this.

1154~~~
Nah, for all his brilliant moments, he is still showing a lot of mistakes for someone at 60m. LVG describes them as "unnecessary losses of possession" namely misplaced passes and the overly excessive amount of crossing he does. I don't think anyone else in the team crosses the ball as much as he does. He should realize by now that his crosses have never resulted in anything for us yet. Of course, when he decides to do something else other than hoof the ball into the box, it is usually brilliant and ends up in a goal for us. I mean, the first time he decided to not hoof the ball into the box against Everton, Falcao scored. And that's why Blind is the most value for money.

1155~~~
Was pretty crap for Netherlands tonight. I still think he's pretty average, the weak link in our midfield.

1156~~~
Looking forward to seeing how he gets on against the better midfields in the league. Not convinced he is good enough, but very happy to be proven wrong.

1157~~~
"Average" is very unfair on him. Certainly going off the games he has played for us anyway.

1158~~~
Lunacy! He's pretty good. Helps the defense out by being avilable when we have the ball(so no more hoofs from Blackett), and positions himself well when the opposition has the ball. Is clever with his passing and usually makes the right call. That's pretty good attributes for a sitting midfielder with two b2b players in-front of him.  I'd prefer him as a rotation player rather than someone who is nailed on to start every game.

1159~~~
What position did he play for the Netherlands overnight?

1160~~~
Left back.

1161~~~
Well, that's the reason. He is entirely different player when he plays as a DM.

1162~~~
I was so excited when we were linked with him and i am glad he signed for us. He has taken off right from the start and i hope he continues this good form.

1163~~~
Completely disagree with this. His crosses have been pin point with a beautiful arc on them. Yes, he puts in a long one once in a while but he mixes it up perfectly. He dribbles it wide, sometimes he dribbles and cuts into the centre and also puts in long crosses. keeps the opposition on their toes. It's never a repetition. It's upto the strikers to anticipate how the ball will arrive and utilize it to the maximum. Our forwards movement in the box is a bit underwhelming when you see the available talent. They need to get on the end of those crosses. More frequently he'll lose possession but that's allowed. He's the creative heart of the team and we don't play tiki-taka. As long as we have the better overall possession he can pull of as many risky passes he wants. There's a very good chance it'll end up with a goal. 

Coming back to the topic at hand, 60M can never be a value signing for me. He's expected to be doing unseen magical shit for that kind of money. Blind on the other hand is a good example of value for money.

1164~~~
I'm not sure if you are on a wind up or not? Can't see the white text! We have bought someone who is easily ranked as one of the top 3 players in the league. I'd say he's the best and for £60m that for me will be value. Blind has done well but I feel he will end up as a very good squad player when we buy a Strootman type. Plus with Carrick back I think Carrick will prove to be better.

1165~~~
As you mentioned he is the creative heart of the team and the whole point of having creative players is so the team is creative and doesn't have to resort to something like crossing. There are times when it is correct to send in a cross but for the most part, crossing is the most basic form of attack in football, usually something one does when they can't or fail to go through the middle. Keep in mind though that I am referring to head height crosses. I believe in 2011, 1.6% of all crosses lead to goals in the league. (So far 0% of Di Maria's crosses have lead to goals for us) It is an art reliant on quantity, not quality, something that weaker teams without the creativity of the likes of Di Maria resort to. I admire the world class plays Di Maria makes when he is not sending in crosses, but when he is, he is disappointing because that is something he can very easily improve on. I admire that he is trying to mix things up, but in his case, it is simply too much because it is not also the first time. At the world cup, no other player sent in as many crosses as Di Maria. Like all good players, Di Maria has his flaws and this is his one. If you want to talk more about it we should move to the Di Maria thread. 


Ok I take back the words "a lot of" but he is stilling make uncharacteristic mistakes for a 60M signing with an example above. Strootman is a #8,not a #6. Carrick and Blind are very similar players but the difference is that Blind has been brought up with Ajax and also that Carrick is 33. Maybe under a team with the typical English philosophy, Blind would be a squad player but not under LVG philosophy.

1166~~~
Blind would have been classed as too small by most English/British coaches despite being 6ft.

1167~~~
What is this even supposed to mean? Carrick is a brilliant player no matter what 'philosophy' is being used. The only thing Blind has over Carrick is more mobility (Not that Blind is very mobile either). In all the other areas Carrick is better and if he can regain his pre-Moyes form then he's ahead of Blind for my money.

1168~~~
Spot on. Put Carrick alongside Di Maria and Herrera and he'll hit form too, IMO.

1169~~~
Carricks a quality player but Blind is the future, and Carrick represents the past. Not saying he hasn't got things he can offer but Blind tackles more and has had more shots already even if off target than Carrick in the last 2 seasons.

1170~~~
Yea fair points. Blind plays further up the pitch too. Not by much but a bit more than Carrick

1171~~~
That's the problem with Carrick, over three years we relied on player who is decent and when he hits the form can be very useful but apart his one season he wasn't anywhere near top class. He should be classified as squad player at best and still some people claim he should start. We should have raised the level of our midfielders long time ago, that is why we had these problems in last couple of seasons. Anyway we are in this process of rebuilding and it needs time get the right players in the team. Herrera is excellent acquisition the lowest level player we should be looking for. Di María is world class. Blind is good by as well but no more than that HE also should be future squad player. He doesn't have high ceiling and we should go for better players or give our youth chance. I believe Ben Pearson can be better player as he is 5 years younger and looking already decent in that position but wasn't given trust yet..

As for Blind vs Carrick I would prefer Blind as he is more mobile than Carras who will be 34 but none of them looks like they would boss the midfield but we will see when Herrera is back and helps the defense enough he can make look players around him better which is what we will be expecting from him this season..

1172~~~
Carrick was more than just decent. He's been brilliant for us and in the latter years he's had to deal with midfield partners of the caliber of Tom Cleverley, Fellaini, Anderson and Giggs/Scholes whose legs had gone. He did as much as any man could given the circumstances.

Put the mobility of Di Maria and Herrera either side of him and watch him return to his old self.

1173~~~
Carrick thrives when he doesn't have to move forward a lot which is why he was perfect alongside Giggs and Rooney in the second half of 2011. He revelled in that sitting role allowing Giggs to do his thing, now even if he is older he will also thrive alongside Herrera since Herrera is more than helpful defensively, that is before considering the Di Maria fear factor and the fact that he is a tenacious little so and so himself. I like Blind and think that he will play a huge role for us, if he develops further, but a fully fit Carrick starts for me, every time.

1174~~~
I think in the big games Blind, Carrick and Herrera will start. ADM will behind 2 from RVP, Rooney and Falcao

1175~~~
Shhh no logic, only extreme opinions please!

1176~~~
What has 'he has more off target shots already' got to do with being a better DM?? It's like saying Lescott has more goals than Rio, hence he's a better CB.

1177~~~
In big matches I think we need both Carrick and Blind and also think they'll do well together. Both need options for passes and a bit of mobility around them though and we've got that now.

1178~~~
Isnt it time to stop going in defense mode? If we do that, every match the pressure will be on us, and with our defence sooner or later we'll get slammed. We should think about our own qualities, you also dont see City putting Milner as a #10 or Yaya Toure as a 10 for more stability.

1179~~~
We're too open to just go gung ho against the likes of City and Chelsea. You don't see City changing because they're already solid enough.

We try and just attack one of them two and we'll lose 6-1 again.

1180~~~
A midfield which contains Blind, Herrera, di Maria isnt too attacking at all. Blind is a pure CVM, Herrera a box to box who is very good defensively and works extremely hard, and di Maria also a very hard worker. Our midfield is defensively more stable than lets say Arsenal's midfield or City's midfield.

1181~~~
Leicester proved otherwise. 

QPR proved otherwise when they remembered they actually had to have a go.

Teams have just waltzed through us for as long as I can remember, we need more stability and cover defensively otherwise against the better teams we'll get dry bummed.

1182~~~
Yeah being able to score goals is a definite negative... He didn't say that it was blinds only strength over Carrick, nor did he indicative it was exhaustive, so why pretend he's listed it as his only quality, you may not agree but come on.

1183~~~
That was not due to our midfield, but due to our defence who were shambles. (Blackett for example). We had literally no problems vs QPR btw. But more important, its not like Carrick will do the work, he is no Martinez/Alonso/Matic etc, if we play Blind/Carrick, I reckon we'll never win a top match.

1184~~~
It was exactly due to our midfield. Opposition runners breaking through the lines and either dribbling or getting passed the ball and then they're immediately onto our defence. We used to get away with it years ago but obviously with the shambles that we are now we can't.

QPR had three seperate opportunities where they should have scored.

1185~~~
I'd like it if someone filled in for him occasionally and let him go out wide to put a cross into the box. He's very good at it.

1186~~~
Part of another dodgy Dutch performance again tonight. Not sure hes a real option for us at left back.

1187~~~
Yeah Blind looks pretty woeful as a Left-Back. It must be said, he sprints like he's on a treadmill...

1188~~~
Don't like him at LB, thought he was a threat going forward. Why do they not play him in midfield like we do? The defence was woeful.

1189~~~
He's far more comfortable in midfield. Didn't expect him to be this good really. i agree with the sentiment that he should be played ahead of Carrick if it comes to a toss up between the both of them. Otherwise, playing them both together shouldn't be discounted either; having Carrick sitting as a platform at the base of midfield could free Blind to play higher up.

1190~~~
LvG hasn't played him at LB for us at all yet and it isn't as if the opportunity hasn't been there.

1191~~~
Blind and Carrick are more than good enough to ensure we land a top four position by May.  The real question is whether we need a more pure defensive midfielder such as Strootman or an all around midfielder such as Vidal to complete the project going into next season when we'll challenge for the prem trophy AND compete in the CL.

We just don't have the answer yet, but we'll know a lot more about what Blind is capable when we get through festive season and we're into a new transfer window.

1192~~~
I think a lot will depend on how he and Herrera settle into their roles. If Herrera continues as he has been- bordering on world class- then we could spend on a more defensive option. On the other hand if Blind acquits himself well in the biggest games then I don't see the reason for splashing on a DM. We could keep Carrick around, fill out the squad with the likes of Pearson and Perreira and spend big on a world class wide attacker. It all rests on how they perform this season.

1193~~~
The only threat from Netherlands tonight was from Blind's crossing. He's a good player.

1194~~~
"Woeful?" Give over.

I'll admit I didn't watch all of the game but his crossing was their main source of creativity in the second half. He's clearly an acceptable option at left back if push came to shove.

1195~~~
Are the Dutch really short of LB options? It would seem to make more sense to play Blind in midfield instead of De Jong if they have someone else to play LB.

1196~~~
Is Strootman a pure defensive midfielder? I've never heard him described in that way before.

1197~~~
Nope, he's a box-to-box midfielder who's defensively adept, which is probably why many refer to him as a defensive midfielder.

With Blind, I haven't watched the match, but going by the comments, I'm not too surprised that he doesn't look comfortable defending as a left back. He even struggled playing as a left central defender. For some very strange reason, Blind seems to be worse defensively out wide than in the middle. This really surprises me as he covers a smaller area when defending out wide than when defending in the middle. He often gets caught out when playing on the left side, but in the middle, he takes excellent positions and is able to recover when he's out of position.

This really is strange to me...

1198~~~
Strootman's not a pure defensive midfielder.

1199~~~
Won't embed but this is his interview from Soccer Saturday for anyone who missed it:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/teams/manchester-united/9521842/blind:-i%27m-working-with-the-best#ooid=FwcXM2cTrw-KsRTd-EtjcPBOuz0_try9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/watch/vid...he-best#ooid=FwcXM2cTrw-KsRTd-EtjcPBOuz0_try9</a>

1200~~~
Do you think Bale is a better player than him? We would have never got him if Madrid didn't feck it up (even if we threw 60m at them). We are extremely lucky to have him even at that price.

1201~~~
This could be due to his lack of pace.

1202~~~
Think he has been doing that for what its worth, shoots a lot for my liking but dont mind as our other attackers arent really in the best of form.

1203~~~
I do acknowledge your point here and believe that you've made a fair point as players with a lack of pace have a tough time recovering against pacy players, but players who have very good spatial awareness and read the dribbler well (i.e. very good man marker) can make up for their lack of pace. Blind has shown very good spatial awareness and reads the game very well. I believe his primary issue may be his man-marking. It seems to me that he often overcommits in closing down his man, and this results in the opposition taking advantage of him overcommitting. It's probably the reason why he's an average left back but very good defensive midfielder.

Pace would be useful for below-par man-markers who can recover their position and standing against their opponent. It's why many of today's full/wing backs get away with their not-so-good defending due to their abundance of pace (Alba, Bernat, Moreno, Alves, etc.).

I just realised that I answered my own question lol.

1204~~~
I love watching him, great player. I think he could be world class defensive midfielder if he was bit higher. He is not weak, it's just that he could be winning more air duels if he was bit higher, or ground tackles if he had bit longer legs.

1205~~~
Very solid today but sometimes I think he is given too much space to cover. Herrera and Mata need to help out more.

1206~~~
Only bright spot that 45.

1207~~~
Its his lack of pace that really is the issue.

He's a quality player with a good brain, but look at him for their goal; looks like he's running in treacle.

1208~~~
Yeah, I think bit longer legs could help him there too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . He is quite qick with his feet and acceleration, but isn't the fastest on long runs.

1209~~~
He's been our best player tonight so far - 52nd minute.

1210~~~
I don't buy all this praise Blind is getting for tonight's game.  He's a defensive midfielder and we have been defensively suspect again tonight down the middle very similar to the Leicester game.

1211~~~
Good goal.

1212~~~
I thought that was an exceptionally well taken chance for his goal. Something special.

1213~~~
Deserved that goal. Our best player tonight by a wide margin.

1214~~~
Intelligent finish.

1215~~~
Reminds me of a Carrick goal. Placement over power

1216~~~
Best player on the pitch.

1217~~~
I like how if someone gives the ball away or plays a shit pass, he's the first give them a bollocking. Good man.

Nice goal too.

1218~~~
Apart from the goal he didn't handle Sessègnon at all. Ran him ragged.

Put him on Toure and he'll get bullied.

1219~~~
Kinda reminds me of Arteta.

Nice and tidy on the ball but just not imposing enough to be that anchor in front of the defence.

1220~~~
To echo great goal but, could not handle Sessegnon at all.

1221~~~
Wow I thought he was phenomenal tonight. His work rate and tenacity is fantastic.

1222~~~
He needs better partners in midfield with defensive awareness. I've seen him pop up on the left flank and run all the way round to handle another attack in the middle.

1223~~~
What on earth he could have done better defensively, they barely created any chances apart from goals?
Nice goal btw, altoough he was quite invisible for half an hour in second half. But still, our best player IMO tonight.

1224~~~
Great on the ball. Offers absolutely no defensive shield whatsoever off it. 

That would be my analysis of him so far.

1225~~~
He was one of the better players but phenomenal stretches it now too much

1226~~~
Thought Alan Smith was way too harsh on him, there was little support from the rest of the midfield.

We need to pair him up with Carrick

1227~~~
Lovely goal from him.

1228~~~
I genuinely though he was MOTM and had his best game for us.

1229~~~
I cant understand those that say he doesnt do enough defensively. You see him putting out fires all over the pitch, nicking the ball away, intercepting passes, always available for the pass and looking to play it forward. I mean what more can you ask of the guy?!

So Jones rushes out to press the midfield and one of their players exploits the space, scores and Blind should have done better? Really?

1230~~~
Way too much is asked of him defensively and it shows. He can't do much more himself.

Pound for pound I think he's the shining light this summer but in a 1 striker formation, he needs someone alongside him to offer a bit more steal. If we're going gung-ho, then sure leave him there alone - he's capable. The problem tonight was we were just too deep as a unit but there just wasn't enough pressure from the players further forward.

Nice goal though, one of them had to go in eventually.

1231~~~
I thought he was one of the better players but not phenomenal. I'd expect a bit more presence from a DM to start with

1232~~~
Our best player, probably. Not sure what Alan Smith was wittering on about, Sessengon didn't do a great deal aside from the goal, which had little to do with Blind.

His ball retention is very impressive.

1233~~~
I think he could've done better defensively. Had he not scored the goal he would've had an average game imo.

1234~~~
I disagree that he had a bad game, Sessengon's goal was Shaw and Rojo's mistake. Blind could not have closed him down, he was not fast enough. Apart from that he did well, and his goal was fantastic. Put in a hell of a physical challenge which I have not seen from him recently, stood up to that cnut Morrison for sure.

1235~~~
Really nicely taken goal. A shame his other efforts were so poor

Did a decent job defensively, but not a good one. He made 4 tackles, 2 interceptions and 3 clearances which is a very fine workload for a player in his position however Sessegnon enjoyed himself way too much and was a constant threat to us in areas Blind is most responsible for. Blind was unable to get a handle on him in particular.

1236~~~
He could get a *cough* prescription that could fix that. He is Blind, after all. Might be glaucoma.

1237~~~
He really reminds me a bit of Busquets. Not as good - obviously - but I think that he shares some of Busquet's good charachteristics. Always looking for the ball, always free to find him, always his head is up looking on the pitch. He slipped twice in space of five minutes but otherwise he was by far our best player tonight. Also, the goal was very good.

1238~~~
Goal was lovely.

1239~~~
Basically played as a one man midfielder with five forwards to aim for. Fellaini occasionally dropped in line with him, but otherwise he was there with acres of space in front of him and nobody to take the ball and turn.

As for Blind as a player - I still don't know what to make of him.
I appreciate he's an improvement on what we've had, he's calm and has the positional sense that Cleverley lacked, but I'm still not <i>that </i>convinced by him yet.
Still need to see more of him.

1240~~~
Yeah, taller, my bad. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1241~~~
He can develop into that, Blind is such a smart player, he plays it simple and is exactly what United needs, he'll never get the praise he deserves.

1242~~~
Love him when he's on the ball, but he really lacks power in his game when he's not.

1243~~~
I'd echo the Arteta comparison. He was poor today and the goal will mask it in this thread.

1244~~~
You know, sometimes if people have made up their mind that they don't like a player, then they will always find a reason to fault him for something that isn't even his fault.

1245~~~
Our formation is leaving him with way to much in defence when the opposition is in transition. That team structure needs sorting out asap.

1246~~~
I thought he was fantastic today.

1247~~~
I don't know what it is about Blind but he seems to split opinion completely, some people think he's been very good, some people think he's been poor.

I like what i have seen with him to be honest, very calm and tidy player, good passer etc.
I have watched games and thought he's had a good game and then i have seen people on here say they thought he was poor. Its strange.

1248~~~
I agree with the general sentiment. 

For 14mil he is a great addition to the squad. At worse he will be a good squad player-based on his performances so far.

1249~~~
He's a very clever player, very good at making those interception and, as you say, putting out fires. I absolutly agree. He's very Carrick like.

But he's almost hopeless at dealing with a player running directly through the middle. He just doesn't have the physical presence, or pace, to deal with it. Thats why I'd like to see him given a physically strong partner to help him out.

1250~~~
Best player on the pitch today. Did his job and kept possession. Maybe could have done better to cover for the 1st goal conceded but that was a culmination of everyones feckups and not just Blinds.

Great goal to help us grab a point. There is definitely more of that in his locker!

1251~~~
As much as I hate to say it. He looked like Fellaini was born to partner him because of this reason.

1252~~~
Seems to be happening alright. Commentary team gave the impression he was struggling. I thought he had a decent game. We had more posession than any other team at the ground this season.  Blind played a big part in that, with and without the ball. Lovely goal too but the performance was grand without it.

1253~~~
He must have covered 20 miles today! He seemed to always be were the ball was. Saved us a point as well, so I don't think it's unfair to call him MOTM.

1254~~~
Enjoyed his performance today. We're starting to dominate possession a bit more and he's a big part of that. Great composed finish for his goal and I think 20 yards is his maximum range. That shot he had from 35/40 yards was ridiculous, unless you have some insane shooting ability you should never be gifting possession away like that.

1255~~~
I honestly think he's been one of our best 4 or 5 players over the whole season so far. I don't know why some people can't see it.

1256~~~
Right about that, the problem is people expect too much when they hear the description Defensive Midfielder but can't seem to understand that it's a job that requires partners with defensive nous. Playing what looked like a 4-1-4-1 in the first half and even when Fellaini was there he had too much to do as he would be expected to hold in the centre but then there he was also needed to snuff out danger on the flanks. Then ahead of him and his partner there was a ghost, defending is a team effort and when one of your partners is defensively inept then your task is difficult. He is not superman nor is he a Mascherano.
I'd play Carrick beside him and Herrera ahead of them in a 4-3-3, we urgently need to tighten up.

1257~~~
I like him. Nuff said.

1258~~~
I like him a lot. This coming from someone who didn't want us to buy him in the first place. As well as doing the basics as you'd expect from a holding midfield player, from time to time he provides moments of real quality. In this game, his superb long ball which sent Di Maria through and of course, his finish to make it 2-2.

1259~~~
Agree with this. And he carries himself like a Utd player – a lot of confidence and a lot of heart. More than can be said for many of our players. First one over to the away fans too.

As someone pointed out he's great at keeping the play ticking over and with someone next to him to break up play he can work his magic. Herrera was that guy I thought, at least for now – clearly not fully over his injury.

1260~~~
I do like him, but god damn either stop trying those long range pot shots or practice making them actually hit the target!

Granted, it was his long range goal that saved us a point. But still.

1261~~~
Yes that sounds good. Fellaini is not a defensive midfielder.

1262~~~
I've been very pleased with Blind so far this season. I'll throw my hand up and admit that I thought we were getting a utility player who would be another squad member that didn't justify his spot when he was called upon. I'm very happy to be wrong on this one. For me he has been a great replacement for Carrick and has done for us what Carrick did so well, keeping possesion and spreading the ball around. It is an understated, yet crucial role for us and I'm not suprised he doesn't seem to get much recognition like Carrick didn't up until a few years ago.

I don't want to test out this theory, but I think if we were to swap out Blind and replace him with any player in our squad even technically better ones like Herrera in that role, it would be a disaster.

1263~~~
Right on, if he was partnered with a more solid midfield player, in a balanced side, he wouldn't have too much to do defensively. We could pair him with Herrera, instruct Herrera to pick his moments and play Di Maria as the most advanced midfielder- the problem is we will be confining Rooney to the flank and we don't have anyone ready to consistently start on the other flank. So a diamond with Carrick at the base, Blind on the left, Herrera on the right and Di Maria at the tip seems like the best way to go currently.
------------Carrick----------
---Herrera----------Blind---
------------Di Maria---------
----Rooney-------Falcao---
I feel Blind could do well in the role Di Maria has been playing from a defensive perspective whilst also passing it about, plus he has a fine cross and long pass on him which could work in releasing Di Maria and Shaw.
So far I am happy with him as he is a massive improvement on what we had and I also know that he wasn't brought in as a long term starter, if he grows into one well then that would be a bonus. We can't lose with him (,the signing that is) we won't!

1264~~~
He pushed forward a bit too much at times today IMO but he had a thankless task as the only proper CM in our team, we really need a CM partner for him, preferably a mobile, physical one who is right footed to balance him out. All in all he has hugely surpassed my expectations and he has the fight and attitude I want to see in a United player.

1265~~~
He was great today. West Brom basically sat back with ten men in their own half, it gave Blind no options when he was on the ball and for some reason no one was really dropping deep to help him. Blind largely did his job well against a very mobile West Brom side.

I definitely suffer from blind devotion though. There was a moment in the first half where he did a slide tackle and it looked like swan drifting over a winter's lake. He didn't even win the ball either, the elegant bastard.

1266~~~
Good to see him grab a goal, a really nice finish. Could prove an important one come May.

1267~~~
he is improving with every match....what a great aquisition. His best years are ahead of him.

1268~~~
He is genuinely one of the slowest players I've seen for Manchester United.


But I think he's brilliant.

1269~~~
He must be scoring a few long range shots in training for him to have 2 or 3 attempts every game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

His goal was more controlled though, good finish.

1270~~~
Yeah, his shots from range aren't too great but you won't improve if you don't practice them, and it's not like he's making stupid decisions with his shots. He just finds himself in great shooting positions so if he improves that, then all the better for us. I'd much rather have that then somebody who is afraid to shoot from range.

1271~~~
I think he's performed EXACTLY how the majority assumed he would. a good solid improvement over our other options in defensive midfield. but i dont think he's our "answer" to the long conundrum thats manchester uniteds inability to field some genuine top class quality in central midfield. if i had to call it, He's going to play a big part in our fortunes over the next 2 or 3 seasons, but not as a starter. i think we will be in for a starting CM in the summer or january.

1272~~~
I'm one of the ones who thought he was quite average. I thought the goal would mask it but his performance up until then wasn't that great. I'm not sure how much blame I attribute to him though because we do leave him fairly exposed.

1273~~~
He was our best player even before the goal. He was never known to be flashy. Does his job quietly. he's almost a Carrick replica with lesser passing range and slightly more aggression. We would have lost too many points if it wasn't him quietly controlling the midfield.

1274~~~
Agreed. He did a decent job and was clearly putting in the effort and workrate, but the main man he needed to keep quiet wasn't quiet at all. He was very loud and hurt us very much

1275~~~
He's decent, but he has to "sit" more. He's pushing forward too often.

1276~~~
So basically you're saying he's the new Carrick?

1277~~~
I think that is a valid criticism, he needs to play a more restricted role unless he is being paired with Carrick because he lacks the pace to make up for lost ground and get back in position in time. I also think that he takes too much upon himself putting out fires anywhere and everywhere which leaves us exposed in central areas.

1278~~~
Going through what Carrick has been through. He's practically a one man midfield. Expected to do it all by him self. He can't be everywhere breaking up the play, making interceptions, tackles, mopping up loose balls, marking Sessegnon(sp?), starting off our attacks and everything in between. Some of our other players need to play with more intelligence. He will benefit from Carrick returning (if we get the Carrick of 2012/13 back).
I thought he was good last night. Took his goal well. Gets into good positions on the edge of the box to get shots in but was ballooning them over before. Lots of composure in that shot and if he keeps them down from now on he will get a lot more goals. His reading of the game is superb. It's obvious why he was the only choice of LvG from that Dutch team.

1279~~~
You took the words right out of my mouth.

Blind would have been on top of Sessegnon for the opener had he not been dragged out of position to cover for Shaw, who looked like he was running through treacle after being caught way out of position upfield.

1280~~~
I've been impressed with his passing and how positive he is on the ball. Defensively he did all he could considering he had Di Maria, an injured Herrera and Fellaini next to him while going forward I could have almost sworn he was supposed to be our #10 not Mata. Really impressed with him.

Put Carrick next to him and we have 2 very good midfielders who can pass a ball as well as anyone. This will also give Blind a bit more freedom to go forward.

1281~~~
He was completely alone at times in midfield. He picked the ball up from our defenders and there was no one close to be seen. It made it difficult for him to bring the ball forward especially with WBA pressing

1282~~~
Couldn't have put it better myself and we need to address that lest we will pay dearly in the next two fixtures. Don't know which Carrick is coming back- he is a notorious slow starter but in his thirties and without a pre-season- but he'd normally be the most natural partner for him atm. Carrick can hold and Blind goes around fire fighting- boy do we need him for that given the predictably consistent brainfarts from our defenders! Herrera and/or Di Maria just ahead of them to provide energy, aid the pressing and creativity. With Di Maria's propensity to turn up on the left we could play a narrow 4-2-2-2;
------------De Gea----------
Rafa--Jones--Rojo--Shaw-
-----Carrick-----Blind------- 
------Herrera-----Di Maria--
-------Rooney---Falcao----
Then hopefully we sign someone like Schneiderlin/Mccarthy or a true worldy like Koke as Carrick winds down. I think this is the most stable line up we can field this season. Herrera has a good understanding with Rafael and Di Maria continues doing his LCM/LW dual role but with less defensive responsibility. Off the ball Di Maria, Herrera and Rooney will lead the pressing, with Blind and Carrick mopping up.

1283~~~
It was already said but he should start with Carrick on sunday. He had a good game but didnt have any help in midfield.

1284~~~
Fantastic signing. The only player who has been good in every game this season. When Herrera is fit, these two will create a great partnership on midfield.

1285~~~
Had a pretty average game yesterday, aside from the goal. Some dodgy passes.

Something of a leader on the pitch though which is good.

1286~~~
The man just delivers.

1287~~~
He put some good shots on goal from distance in his first couple of matches.  I really only remember a few shots that I thought were pretty poor considering the time he had to make them.  A couple were last night.  I like the fact that he is having a go though.

1288~~~
The poster you quoted needs to understand you can't have it both ways. If Blind had that mentality then we'd have left WBA with a loss. The team needs more Daley Blinds. Players willing to shoot from distance aside from di Maria.

1289~~~
Apologies for doing my stats nerd thing but that comment had me questioning my own recall, hence I went looking for stats.

93% pass completion, with almost two thirds (43/74) of those passes forwards. That's pretty damn impressive IMO. 4/4 tackles and 2 interceptions as well.

It's his partners in midfield that let the side down really. Herrera completed 81% of his passes (less than half of them forwards: 15/32) with Fellaini doing almost exactly the same in the second half. 2 tackles and 1 interception from mop-head, 0 and 0 from Herrera.

Recurring fecking theme at United these last few years, only one of our central midfielders turning up on the day. Blind and Carrick both to start against Chelsea, please.

1290~~~
I suppose it's not surprising, as Carrick divides opinion and both players are very similar in style. You are going to get that with players whom have more substance than style and aren't very flashy.

Personally, I am a very big fan of Blind, just like I am with Carrick and perhaps I'm a bit blind-sighted to their flaws as I appreciate the type of player they are more than any other. In saying that however, I didn't think Blind was great like some are saying and the goal covered an otherwise mediocre match from him. Still, he's been very good in every other match so far.

1291~~~
I agree.  I actually think he's got a good shot on him.  Carrick very rarely attempted shots on goal and they never had any bite to them. He tried to curl or finesse them in from distance.  It's nice to have a midfielder try to blast some goals in from outside the box.

1292~~~
Mr Dependable Daley Blind

1293~~~
Edge of the box is fine, but he clearly doesn't have the shooting ability to score from 35 yards. When he tries from there, as he did once yesterday, he's just giving possession away. He should know by now but LVG needs to tell him that too.

I was happy with the signing but he's exceeded my expectations by some distance thus far. He's settled very quickly.

1294~~~
I'm fairly relaxed about, as long as its at the right time. If there's time left on the clock, or we're already in front, or we're dominating possession and more chances will come, I'm cool with it. As we saw vs QPR, when Falcao got a chance from a rebound, things can happen when you shoot. Plus the opposition has to close you down, which can cause movement in the defence for others to work with. Nothing better for a defender when its obvious what the opposition player will do.

The trouble is when its your last chance of the game or you're having trouble putting sustained pressure on the opposition. In those times you need to play the percentages.

1295~~~
Really like the look of him. Gets the job done, usually in a quiet fashion. Once the team really start ticking, I imagine he'll be incredibly important for us to keep the balance.

Am I the only one who's noticed that he loves putting his passes miles in front of the receiver if there's plenty of room for it? Might be confirmation bias on my part.

1296~~~
He really needs to build on his athleticism. Makelele and De Jong weren't the biggest of DMs but they were aggressive and strong. Blind gets into good positions to disrupt play but the other midfielder can blow past him on sheer strength alone. I think he's already a good signing for us, let's hope he can become a main starter for us for the next few years.

1297~~~
I honestly don't think I've seen him get blown past. His lack of physicality gets overplayed imo.

1298~~~
There were a few times yesterday where he tried to break up their play high up the pitch but wasn't strong enough in the challenge. When they went past him, he also didn't have to recovery speed to make up for lost ground. 

I reckon a season of English football will improve his football tremendously.

1299~~~
I'm looking forward to seeing him play with a proper partner in a 4-2-3-1. I don't think Herrera is suited to playing as one of the 2, he's better playing a similar role to Oscar IMO as he's best as an AM. We need a physical, athletic CM in there to compliment Blind's reading of the game and positional qualities.

1300~~~
Blind covered more ground than his team-mates (11.48 kilometres), played the most passes (74) and did so more accurately (93.2 per cent) than anyone else on the pitch.

1301~~~
Showed some great leadership qualities in the final 20 minutes of the game. Put in some great challenges, and had the balls to strike a few from long distance. Really hope he can kick on from here and become the leader from the back 5.

I really like this player.

1302~~~
I thought Carrick would come on for Mata, who had a really poor game. Herrera looked a bit rusty, I think he just needs more games though and would not drop him, unless it was tactical for Fellaini purely so that we can be more combative.

I would not pay much attention to whether the passes were forward or not considering Blind was in front of the defence with the other midfielders pushed up.  And there were still one or two really duff ones in there from Blind. Not as many dodgy ones as Shaw or Herrera or Januzaj or Mata though I guess.

1303~~~
Yeah, agree with all of that. I think Carrick, Herrera and Blind are all quality CMs and our options are better than they have been in years. It was up to me, all three of them would start against Chelsea. I wouldn't start Fellaini and I'm not so sure he'll make the grade in the long term but I do like his attitude and would be delighted if he proved a lot of people wrong.

It was just that Hererra's rustiness (sore ribs?) and Mata's anonymity reminded me of previous seasons where we often saw only one CM willing or able to stand up and be counted.

1304~~~
Was our best player on Monday, a really good performance from him. He was let down on the couple of occasions by his defence.

What impressed me most is that he's managing his stamina much better. His first few games of the season he was really good for 60 minutes, but then was a complete passenger for the final half hour. He has clearly either got up to speed fitness wise or realised that you can't sprint for 45 minutes in the first and keep up the same level in the second half, and managed it accordingly.

He was a real 8/10 from minute 1 to minute 91.

1305~~~
I wasn't sure about this signing I must admit (though was basing this on his LB performances) but I have been very impressed. Consistently very good

1306~~~
Also made 3 key passes (the most in the team in front of Di Maria and Fellaini with 2 each) and scored

Blind does a good job in his role and rightfully draws comparisons with players like Busquets. But the defensive workload in midfield is more than a job for 1 man. Ander helps a lot winning the ball up the pitch and Fellaini did his part when he came on too.

Di Maria "cheats" a little on his defensive shift with the others expected to pick up the slack. And given what Di Maria has been doing going forward, that can be okay. But it can also cost you in big games which is why I wouldn't be at all surprised if we moved Di Maria further forward in the future and got another Ander type who will do work both ways, for the other side. Strootman would be the obvious candidate.

1307~~~
So far, he's adapted to the BPL very well. His physique could be better to suit the BPL's more rough play, but besides that, He's doing quite well. Was by far the best player on the pitch last Monday, and I'm hoping he can keep managing his more balanced stamina.

1308~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV3Yt-asDNw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Impressive start to the season. My only concern is that we're giving him too much to do when our pressing fails which means he has to cover lots of space.

1309~~~
That's true, in some parts of the game he was all alone in the middle, that's why I think Carrick should starte besides him on sunday.

1310~~~
Agreed. He's having to cover far too much space on his own. He needs another holding midfielder/DM beside him if we're going to press properly. I noticed in that cross near the start that Januzaj jumps for it and van Persie literally does nothing. Perfect cross and he doesn't even attempt to profit from it. 
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1311~~~
Would like to see him partnered with Carrick in a 2-man defensive midfield vs Chelsea.

1312~~~
I love this man. His positional awareness is in a class of it's own. His concentration is relentless as well, no wonder Van gaal loves this kid. For a small guy he's really good at salvaging balls in midfield and keeping the engine ticking in midfield. Bossed the midfield surprisingly well with Fellaini today.

1313~~~
I thought he was poor today tbh.

Chasing shadows, been impressed with him in his first few games, but concerning that Chelsea was the first real big team we've faced and he was 2 seconds off the pace.

1314~~~
Oscar took him out of the game today and he was playing too restricted with Mata and Fellaini leaving a bigger gap in front.

1315~~~
He's fantastic on the ball, but I think he needs a more dynamic partner defensively like Herrera, although Fellaini did well.

1316~~~
Wow, really? Maybe I am blind. Always possible.

1317~~~
That's how we keep justifying Gerrard playing. Good on the ball but constantly needs protection from the likes of Henderson/Allen, etc. But Gerrard's 33 or something.

1318~~~
Could you say that he took Oscar out of the game equally in the first half though?

1319~~~
Thought today was one of his worse games but i think Oscar on him made things more difficult

1320~~~
Okayish performance today

1321~~~
Like Carrick, his contributions are vital yet subtly unnoticed. Wouldn't blame you for being blind <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1322~~~
He really needs to shape up. At times he really looks unable to contain the likes of Hazard or Oscar because they were too quick for him.

Other than, he did well. It was a solid display for me.

1323~~~
He's been pretty good since he arrived but if we're talking about him being a key player long term then I'm not at all convinced. I know they're quite different players but if you compare what Blind offers us at DM with what Matic brings to Chelsea....

It's still very early to be judging him tbf, we'll see how he goes.

1324~~~
Shame he's not taller as we lose a lot without another big head in there.

Decent game but some ridiculous passes.

1325~~~
I think he'll ultimately end up as a squad player here. He's a good player and all but if we get Strootman as expected he's the one going to miss out.

1326~~~
A bit worrying after such a good start to his United career. The system didn't help him with Fellaini and Mata typically elsewhere on the pitch.

1327~~~
gg 100% pass completion 2nd half

1328~~~
He did allot more than most give him credit today. I thought Hazard and Fabregas didnt enjoy the space and Blind had plenty to do with that.

1329~~~
I thought he was really good today. Not sure what he did wrong?

1330~~~
Had a really good game at the base of our midfield. The only worrying thing is his lack of pace.

1331~~~
Goal down I was wanting LVG to take him off as he was essentially playing as a centre back vs only Drogba. Better than Cleverley Fletcher and Anderson we need better to win the league. Great squad player eventually though and good signing overall.

1332~~~
Very quiet game in a very good way.  The classic example of keeping things steady and shutting down their options.  Toady was never a day for him to be turning up with his crazy shooting on the edge of the box.

1333~~~
I thought he played well, was clearly told to sit deep and at times was dropping between Smalling and Rojo when we brought the ball out.

1334~~~
Agreed.
I appreciate he's an 'intelligent' player, and an improvement on the old guys. But still don't think he's more than a squad player ultimately.
Watching Matic today (and since January) - that puts it into perspective for me.

1335~~~
Very invisible today, but in a good way. To be honest, I think he was the silent/invisible force behind the squad today. I think he had no chance to shine against Chelsea today, yet still really tried to do so.

1336~~~
I think he did alright. He's a bit slow but you cant have it all.

1337~~~
Like him, but surely long term we need a better (bigger, faster) DM.

1338~~~
I'm with you here. Thought he was more than decent when he had the ball. Shame our attackers couldn't turn and face their defence when he fizzed some of those passes in.

1339~~~
I think he was decent today. Very impressed by him and think that it has been a great signing for us. A very competent and intelligient midfielder.

1340~~~
Was great today. Well very good.

1341~~~
One thing I like about him is he always finds space for a pass to him. He really makes an effort to find space. Carrick can learn from him.

1342~~~
He did well. Tough game but he showed he can perform at this level.

1343~~~
Agreed. I think to a large extent you want the player in that role to go unnoticed. It's a sign they are quietly going about their job. When the back 4 are passing it about round the back he always shows feet and more often than not starts the attack, rather than passing backwards again.

1344~~~
I thought he did really well. In a perfect world we'd have a bigger, faster version of Blind. But that would be if we were trying to progress from say a very good side to a seriously challenging for the Champions League side. We've to get back into the top 4 first and Blind is more than good enough to help with that surely.

1345~~~
Strootman is a box to box CM. If someone is going to replace him in the starting lineup it's going to be a new DM.
But that's the same question again to buy a CM who is good in defense also or a pure DM.



Anyway people already saying he'll be a squad player and all. He had a good start to PL football, let him do the work and see how it goes. I think he can only be better and who knows maybe he's in LVG's long term plans. It is possible.
Surely we need a new CM but I wouldnt write him of so easily, I mean push him to the bench.

1346~~~
I don't particularly like that "he does a lot of work you never notice" argument as it requires very little proof to make. It become difficult to prove that a performance one person sees as "invisible because he's so intelligent" was actually more "invisible because he's a bit ordinary".

For example, someone like Matic does a lot of these supposedly unnoticeable tasks too yet somehow manages to look excellent every time I see him.

1347~~~
I'd never worry about having him in the team, but he's not someone who can do it all alone in there. To be fair, there aren't many who can.

1348~~~
Kind of how I feel.

1349~~~
In the excitement of a match it is very difficult to analyse individual players. Plus you are only as good as the players around you, so again it is very difficult.

But overall i felt United coped with Chelsea well in places and it was a far more even contest than most expected. Blind played his part in that and so his contribution must have been comparable to any other Chelsea midfielder, and that is good enough for me. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1350~~~
The stats back it up though. Haven't checked today's game but was getting stick for being ineffective against WBA yet stats revealed he was by far the most influential CM on the pitch.

EDIT: Just checked. More passes, more accurately than any other CM today. By a margin.

1351~~~
I thought he was pretty poor in all honesty. Often second to the ball and got run past like he wasn't there over and over. He'll probably only get found out like this against the better teams, so he will obviously make a good squad option. He's not of the calibre to compete at the top level though.

1352~~~
Passing aside. Equal highest number of succesful tackles of any CM, attempted twice as many tackles as any of them and made 4 interceptions (no other CM made more than one)

He's a really busy, quietly effective player who is obviously doomed to be persistently under-rated. The perfect replacement for Carrick!

1353~~~
Maybe it's just me, but you only seem to comment negatively on him.

1354~~~
I thought he did very well, his lack of physicality worries me a bit but we knew that about him anyway. He's not disappointed me so far and will only get better. Can see him becoming an excellent squad player in the long run.

1355~~~
Basically this, he's going to be a good signing but right now I'd still take a fit again Carrick over him and Carrick himself obviously needs replacing

1356~~~
I just call it how I see it. Always said he's a squad player and others obviously share the same belief.

1357~~~
Always? He's only played a handful of games. Sounds like you're pre-judging him. Explains the inaccurate assessment of today's performance too.

1358~~~
That's fair enough, but before the transfer you were dead against it, and after we sign him, you only want to speak on him when he (in your opinion) hasn't played well.

1359~~~
If ever there was going to be a game where his lack of pace and physicality was going to be exploited it was this one, yet he held his own in that midfield and played a very solid game. There were one or two times when Hazard skipped past him, but Hazard can do that to anyone.

1360~~~
Heh. As I thought. So annoying when people pre-judge signings.

1361~~~
I like him a lot. Needs a world class CM alongside him if we're really going to push on and start dominating games in midfield, but I think he's been excellent so far.

1362~~~
He just has so much defensive work to do. Fellaini in the side offers-really- no much more defensively than Herrera would. Blind has to do a lot for someone who isn't the biggest nor quickest, which I really find impressive. He's a good player, nothing more than that, but I want to see him play beside Carrick to have someone who is also able to take some of the defensive work off his shoulders.

1363~~~
Well, based on what I saw at the World Cup I didn't really see a top level player in him. I'm of the belief that we'll need a really good player in his position to compete at for the title and in the CL, which is where we want to be.

I'm not alone in thinking he was poor today. He got beat to the ball and dribbled past too much. He's certainly a hard worker and is calm in possession, but I just think he lacks the next bit. The physical side/aggression in defence and the quality on the ball. He's like a hybrid of Fletcher and Carrick, but not as good at either in what they bring.

1364~~~
But then wouldn't you rather have that World Class midfielder and Herrera, who is obviously better than Blind?

1365~~~
Agree with the last bit but think he's more effective than you're giving him credit for. Seriously, compare his stats with Matic and Fabregas from today's game. You'll be surprised. And he's only getting used to the PL too. For a newbie he's actually doing really well.

1366~~~
This and I don't know what people expect of him, to stop every attack single handedly ? Even though today Fellaini supported him well. Chelsea's attacking players have overrun and will do so again against better midfields with more robust DMs than Blind. To put up the figures that <a class="username" data-user="23607, @Pogue" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23607/">@Pogue</a> posted in a match of this nature is a very good achievement on his part. And it's good to remember that this is only his sixth match in this league and without the benefit of a preseason.

1367~~~
I'm not sure why people are obsessed with pointing out Blind's size and physical capabilities. We get it, he's not the size of Matic. But does it really matter? He holds his own very well, his positional awareness puts him 2 steps ahead of opposition, he's always in the right place at the right time when salvaging balls, his concentration is relentless, his decision making is solid, he's extremely vocal, shields the defence intelligently, he is very comfortable on the ball, always available for a pass to get the defence/forward transition going and Van gaal loves him. He's got everything you want in a DM. Unfortunately, most of the work that a DM does is not directly visible to people unless they really observe him. The only thing directly visible is how fast he runs and how big he is, and that is a very ignorant way to judge a player of his intelligence. Carrick is a lot bigger and quicker than Blind yet his biggest complaint was how 'soft' he was in midfield, so it isn't how big you are, it's about how imposing you are in your actions and decisions. If you're still unconvinced, Scholes is 10cm shorter than Blind and he never had a problem with physicality in midfield <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1368~~~
He reads the game so well.  We lost the ball and he saw the centre backs open up and dropped in the middle. 

This guy will be our captain soon,  aslong as a more flashier player won't  come n replace him

1369~~~
That doesn't particularly surprise me as I thought he was at least decent today and has been good generally since he arrived. 

I just prefer it when people point to actual evidence (be it stats, incidents from the game or whatever) rather than just saying "he does a lot of work you don't see and is at his best when he is invisible" as it's a fairly lazy argument. People do actually regularly notice these supposedly unnoticeable attributes.

1370~~~
Hes one of those players that no one will really make any comments about, because he makes everything work and tick along. If that makes sense.

1371~~~
Exactly. And if I have to comment, he passes the ball forward enough and has got a decent shot in him apart from doing the basics right, so can't really ask for more. Happy with the signing.

1372~~~
That is how I am towards him. I didn't notice him a whole lot which is probably a good thing - though not always. He's an important part of the team though. Fellaini seems to play better in a box-to-box role when he has Blind worrying more about the defensive duties and just sitting deep. He will probably be taken out when Carrick is fit or we sign Strootman but he'll be a good player for us in the long run I think.

1373~~~
Absolute tosh this is mate.

1374~~~
He needs a partner so that he's not doing all the defensive work himself. We're so open because we've only got one bloke screening the back four so I think we need Carrick alongside him, at least until we sign Strootman or whoever.

Aside from that though, he's exceptionally tidy on the ball and if given time will always pick the right option which is nice to see. I do think his complete lack of right foot harms him at times though, he could play in some decent passes if he had one.

Did notice today that he (and Smalling actually) were playing the Carrick-esque low ball through a crowd of players, fired into a striker. Those type of passes are vital for the attacking pace of the team and when done right really put the opposition on the back foot and open opportunities. Great stuff to see.

1375~~~
I thought he played well, I'm a big fan of his actually. I think his worst game was West Brom and even then he popped up with a vital goal. 

For the first time in years we held our own in midfield against a top side and I think Blind played a big part in that.

1376~~~
I would have that world class midfielder next to Herrera and Blind behind them. As for di Maria, I would like to see him out wide, or in a pure attacking role.

1377~~~
His pace and strength is fine. I don't care what Football Manager says.

1378~~~
I admit I pre-judged him, I was negative all summer about the possibility of signing him as I thought he looked too slow and weak for the PL. So far I'd say he's done very well and seems to have some leadership qualities about him. My only point would be that we shouldn't draw a line under his name as if that role in the team is sorted, we need to add competitive depth in midfield IMO.

1379~~~
We won't be wasting di Maria out wide.

1380~~~
Good point that I thought about afterwards but couldn't be arsed to edit <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1381~~~
He played wide in the last two games so maybe we will.

1382~~~
This. This. This!

1383~~~
Hardly knew he was playing for most of the game, but in this type of game that is to be expected. He plays the role for the team that no one notices at the time, allowing other flashier players more freedom while giving us a solid based to build on. He really is the type of player that we won't realise how important he is to how the team plays until he is missing I feel, much like Carrick when he first arrived.

Though the key for me, is that we actually managed to match on of the top teams in midfield for the first time in a long time. His contribution goes a long way in allowing this to happen.

1384~~~
I don't know what game you lot were watching, and why do we like to slate our players so much? He was very good in that one man midfield, and he sat just in front of the back four and passed it out nicely. He's a fantastic player and good enough for the first team, put someone like Vidal [a true warrior and ball winner] next to him and you'll appreciate him more. He's not going to boss games physically, but he'll do it in another way, by dropping off, picking up the ball from CB's and starting attacks, and i noticed that whenever Rojo was out of position, he dropped into CB, he wasn't unnoticed, he had a very effective game.

1385~~~
Blind was the signing I wanted all summer..

Nice and tidy, disciplined, good vision and positionally aware...

Being a long time since I seen a United midfield hold their own against a top team.

We'll get there guys

Imagine a Carrick, Blind and Felliani( if he keeps his form up, have my doubts) midfield

1386~~~
Had this feeling all game and it had me at such a welcome ease. I didn't have to pull my hair out at the utter lack of basics and cowardliness in midfield like years past.

1387~~~
It felt good didn't it?!

1388~~~
Like drinking water after a whole day's thirst and getting head at the same time, ahhhh

1389~~~
Very intelligent player, I like him a lot. His movement, anticipation are very good and he always makes himself available for a pass which is great to see.

1390~~~
Defensively - Blind is much better than Herrera. As a playmaker/attacking midfielder - Herrera is much better than Blind. So who to use depends on what kind of world class midfielder we have next to them.

What impresses me the most about Blind - is a) his composure on the ball and b) his intelligence. He passes the ball around and hardly ever puts a foot wrong - and he is very good at picking up opponents running into our box.

1391~~~
If he has a Strootman type alongside him, he'll be a better player for it.

1392~~~
Vidal? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1393~~~
Lets get the bad out of the way fist....err... he is slow and.... he did.......... hmmmmm, not so easy this one, I'll come back to it.

Needs help, Fellaini Di Maria and Mata were good but all at the other end of the pitch. Apart from him being slow that we all know about. He seems to have no weakness, passed well, reads the game well, covered well, worked hard, pushed on when needed and linked up the play well. All of this we know so what am i missing? Oh yes the bad.... He has floppy hair! Gets in his ears and he cant hear the other players.

Anybody with weird hair cant play ball, look at Fellaini he... no, not him anymore, ahhh Best, he had floppy hair too and he was... well no suppose not! Bobby Charlton he had no hair surely he.... no not him either. I''l find one example sooner or later. Steve Bruce ahhh yes, a center half with a mullet type thing, defenders cant play ball or get anywhere near 20 goals a seas..... hmmm not him either. I will find one leave it with me. Law had flowing locks? Beckham had floppy hair? Giggs too? Even Keane had mad Hair! Ruud now he had floppy hair too but you see he was Dutch, he could get away with that. If blind was Dutch there'd be no issue with his hair. Like RVP he's Dutch, with his Badger style. They are all a bit mad over there. Nobody would take any notice. Told ya I'd find something

Buddy Di Maria would never be wasted anywhere at Old Trafford, as long as he was given the freedom and courage to go an play.

1394~~~
The crowd were actually nervous when he kept passing it around with De Gea and the back four but he's so calm on the ball. He played it around with them and started a lot of United's moves passing the ball around. That was the trouble last season, the defense had to put in many long balls cos they didn't have anyone in THAT position who would take it forward. He's always making smart runs and ready to accept a pass. A very intelligent footballer.

1395~~~
I thought he was excellent today, stepped his game up to another level. He made more passes, more accurately than any other midfielder on the pitch, and all against the best team in the country. If true the 100% second half completion stat is ridiculous against Matic, Fabregas and Oscar.

The first step to improving our game is to learn to build attacks from defence and avoid the long ball, and he is the perfect player for that. Always drops to pick up a pass, always turns to bring the ball forward, but he's intelligent enough to keep recycling it amongst the defenders if the forward option is too risky, and wait to draw the opposition in. Carrick imo is too keen to play it forward at all times.

Im looking forward to see a midfield containing Blind, Carrick (Strootman) and Herrera.

1396~~~
He's doing very well, and there's no reason for him not to improve, he's only 24 & playing in a new league.

Him & Carrick will give us a really solid base in games like yesterday's.

1397~~~
let me guess, you are British?

1398~~~
I feel that ship has passed, he'll 28 early next year.

1399~~~
You see Blind and then see Cleverley and Ando who seem to hide behind the opponents to avoid getting the ball. Perfect replacement for Carrick.

1400~~~
Finally we have someone who drops back and brings the ball forward. We no longer have these huge gaps between defenders and midfielders which results in hoofing the ball forward

1401~~~
Its interesting.  If we can go in to january or next season with blind fellaini herrera di maria and one or 2 more additions,  we could pick and chose a midfield that matches the needs of a variety of matches.

1402~~~
Unsung hero!

What he does for us ain't flash, it won't lift us of our seats, it won't make us go wow!

BUT for me he was one of our best players out there against Chelsea, his positional awareness, intelligent passing makes him a outstanding player. Yes he ain't big and ain't aggressive enough but his only played a handful of games in the PL!! If his playing like that after a few games then surely he can only get better with more experience?

I was sceptical when we bought him but out of all our signings excluding ADM, Blind has done execeptionally well!

1403~~~
I think he's one of the really big positives from today.

When accompanied by an actual midfield and not a bunch of attackers he's shown, against top class opposition, that he can help stifle them. Bar a few defensive, individual errors we looked quite comfortable defending our area I thought and Blind/Fellaini did a very good job of stifling Chelsea's midfield.

1404~~~
I think he's class, serious case of man love for him.

1405~~~
He lacks a little pace, but a player like Ramires has bags of pace, and I'm not sure I would swap them, other than for my FIFA career, that is. He's great at intercepting and really facilitates play for both defenders, other midfielders and the attack. Great option to have.

1406~~~
I had him as my Man of the match, just oozes calm. Fellaini was great but Blind was sublime.

1407~~~
The performance should been seen within the context of the opposition. We were playing one of the best teams currently in Europe which makes the performance even more impressive.

1408~~~
I barely noticed him yesterday. Not sure if that's good or bad for a DM.

1409~~~
An intelligent, sensible player that every team would love to have. Great game by him yesterday, kept things tidy and under control.

1410~~~
Definitely a good thing.

1411~~~
I thought that he was absolutely class. Chelsea had very little going through the middle, particularly from Oscar and Fabregas, and this was down to Blind (and the imperious Fellaini).

Blind is showing that intelligence can be more effective than pure pace or strength.

1412~~~
Just re-watched the match and realised I was probably a little harsh on him earlier. He was quite good. There were a few errors but aside from that he was good.

1413~~~
Blind plays in a very high pressure position coming up against the best players of each team we play, and I think he does the job brilliantly.  He has the potential to become a top top player for us.

1414~~~
For a player in his first season in the PL and only his second in CM(According to what i've read so I'm open to correction on that from followers of Ajax/Dutch league) he has done really well.

1415~~~
Been impressed by him, at times he gets really isolated and exposed but he always wants the ball and never gives up, going to be an important part of the squad for a while I think. He needed more help from Fellaini and Mata yesterday at times as they were both to eager to push forward and didn’t drop back enough to make passing options but until we get a more settled side that sort of thing is going to happen. Yesterday wasn’t his best game but he is a big improvement on what we have been forced to watch in midfield for last few years and the only thing that really holds him back is he lacks a yard or two of pace.

1416~~~
Agreed. I thought we'd bring him in as a utility player given the positions he can cover but he's making the position his own. Recycles the ball well, intelligent out of posesion and has shown he can be a threat at the other end to.

Excellent signing so far. So obviously Dutch.

1417~~~
I came onto the caf last night after the game and I'm pretty sure that at first glance, there was a concsensus of criticism for his performance, which I found odd.

He was excellent yesterday.

1418~~~
He covers the spaces brilliantly. Very intelligent. Although his lack of pace was very obvious yesterday.

1419~~~
Thought he was good yesterday, another game where hardly any other midfielder is near him, therefore leaving him to cover huge amounts of space and always be available for a pass attacking wise. 

Good game, doesnt light up the park, not sure he'll ever dominate games to the extent where he's a clear MoM but strong solid performances are what we've needed from our CM's. Still think he'll do well alongside Carrick allowing him to have some cover next to him. A midfield 3 of Blind-Carrick-Herrera would be good technically and positionally I think, potentially for tough away games (such as city)

1420~~~
He only cost 2 million less than Balotelli too -  money well spent by United.

1421~~~
He's slowly becoming one of my favourite players. Very clever little player.

1422~~~
I'm getting the feeling he's going to be one of those players who is really well-liked by the fans since he seems to be level-headed and is a good player who goes about his business and plays his game effectively.

1423~~~
I think he has done well, wouldn't call any of his performances spectacular though (admittedly as DM "spectacular" isn't really his thing).

I do feel that he is prone to taking a few too many long shots from 30 yards (as is Di Maria) when there are other options, but generally he is a great player to have in the squad.

1424~~~
Also as a chant - how about "Daddy Cool"

Daley, Daley Blind!
Daley, Daley Blind!

And so forth..

1425~~~
Seems to be the thing to do, I looked at several player ratings and they either had him playing great or playing like crap.

1426~~~
People aren't willing to accept that he's good, they've passed a judgement on him last Summer when we got him instead of precious Vidal and won't change.

1427~~~
That could almost word for word be applied to Fellaini as well.

It's early days for Blind anyway, his current level of performance is good (not "decent", not "great" just good) in my opinion,  but I rarely notice his defensive contributions. As someone said, you can argue that in his role being invisible is a good thing, but I never notice him making good tackles or interceptions - normally when I see him he is ticking things over, carrying the ball out of defence, protecting the CBs and getting forwards a lot.
It will be interesting at the end of the season to see how he has done.

1428~~~
He is simple but effective.

1429~~~
I believe he was very good yesterday and i think he is adjusting rather well to the level of difficulty of the PL games. I don't know what people exactly expect of him but i do get a feeling that he is going to receive the same kind of "treatment" Carrick did by some of our fans, until the 2013 season of course. My opinion is that our back four and Blind, who plays in front of them, are put under a lot of pressure mainly because our first line of defense, in the midfield, is very poor and doesn't do much to slow down the opposition's build up play.

First things first: Blind, in his 6 PL appearances, has made 3 tackles, 3 interceptions and 3.5 clearances per game. These stats make him one of our best defensive players on the pitch. Only Jones has more interceptions per game. Blind is also the midfielder with the most clearances per game for United. And for the record Matic has made 5.7 tackles, 1.7 interceptions and 1.7 clearances per game. Fernandinho's stats are 4 tackles, 1 interception and 2 clearances per game while Flamini has 3.4 tackles, 2.6 interceptions and 1.7 clearances in the PL. Gerrard's stats are close to Blind's (1.3/3/3).

If you compare these numbers and the next thing that comes to your mind is " but we look way worse defensively than our rivals' " you will understand the point i was trying to make in the first paragraph about our inability to press and regain possession in dangerous areas. One could say the same thing about the scousers this season. Gerrard is also doing a sound job but Liverpool, without Suarez and (until now) Sturridge can't press high with the intensity the did last season. As a result their opponents get past their midfield more easily and have more chances to expose their defensive weaknesses.

Anyway, back to Blind. Our midfield is crying out for a ball winning midfielder, a player with the ability to be wherever the ball is and close down opponents. When Falcao, AdM and Rooney learn how to press high as a unit and how to combine well and create traps in order to steal balls in the opponent's third things will get much better. Blind can not operate as some kind of breakwater in front of the defensive line. He's not that type of holding midfielder, he plays the position like Carrick does and he depends on his good positioning to block the central channels. His good distribution of the ball allows us to have our CM and both FBs in more advanced positions when we're setting up attacking plays. These are the things he can offer on the pitch. It's not his fault our opponents find it way too easy to get the ball in our third and he can not turn into some kind of "physical monster" just because we need that physicality and energy in our midfield.

1430~~~
Already you can see an intelligent, technically adept and versatile footballer who is quickly bedding in. 

OK, he hasn't got everything right but he is still just 24 and less than two months in to moving to a new team in a new country! And already an improvement on anything I saw in central midfield last season.

Pleased to have him and more to come from him, I think.

1431~~~
If he was allowed he'd wear a baseball cap backwards whilst on the pitch.

1432~~~
Also has more premier league goals

1433~~~
Fecking amazing signing.

1434~~~
You've just described Herrera. I think if you look at how he plays, he loves to close down, harass and is a decent tackler.

1435~~~
We are trying to turn him into a ball winning midfielder. He seems to be adapting rather well in that role but he still needs time and practice. Don't forget that he used to play as a modern #10 at Athletic Bilbao in a 4-2-3-1 formation that demanded a lot of high pressing. Yes, he closes down opponents but he's used to do that more in the final third than the middle of the pitch. Pressing on the whole pitch and tracking back require extra energy levels and different mentality if you're an attacking player. Same thing goes for Di Maria, who played as a box to box midfielder with much more attacking duties at Real Madrid alongside Modric and Alonso. If Herrera becomes comfortable on both sides of the pitch, like Modric, i agree with you that Blind will also find more chances to flourish.

1436~~~
Turning out to be one of the best signings of the season imo.

1437~~~
Completely agree with you, <a class="username" data-user="49797, @Rooney in Dublin" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49797/">@Rooney in Dublin</a>.

1438~~~
Truly impressed by his performances. Reads the game very well.

Brilliant signing thus far.

1439~~~
Tidy player and suited perfectly to his role, can't argue with him for the price we paid, good business.

1440~~~
It's easy to look good in his position because our CM was average in the last few seasons

But to be honest he's very good....very very good and i love him already!!!!

I just don't understand why Van Gaal has bought him on the last day of the transfer window

1441~~~
I think we flirted with Vidal for large parts of the summer. Also, there was talk of Barcelona interest in Blind, perhaps he favored a move to Spain and for whatever reason a move never materialized?

Anyway, I'm delighted. He's brilliant, and a steal at £13.8 million.

1442~~~
Well Vidal is different to Blind. Even if would have signed Vidal in the summer.....i still think we would have needed a player like Blind or Carvalho.
I still would like Vidal for the right price (If Juventus are going out of the CL in December then i hope we're making another move for him).

1443~~~
Btw

Has the maybe turned down the chance because of Daley's move to us???

1444~~~
He's already appointed as the head coach for Holland after Euro 2016 (replacing Hiddink).
Hard to turn down that opportunity for another assistant coaching job

If all our players had Blind's brain we would be winning champions league trophy next season, easy peasy <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1447~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Great idea.

1448~~~
I like it!!!

1449~~~
I saw a lady on the train today that looked extremely similar to our Daley except she had breasticles. Let's just say I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

1450~~~
Another thing I like about Blind is...he is not afraid to pass it to a player who is currently being marked.

By trusting his teammates control and ability in the centre of the pitch, he has stopped the constant easy pass out wide! which has become the norm over the last few seasons.

1451~~~
Yes! I feel that he adds a little bit of guts on our midfield. He might be a defender, but he has some guts in making the move forward happen.

1452~~~
This typical that nobody is saying anything about him, because somehow is missing in this game. He really needs to get out of jog mode for the next 45 minutes.

1453~~~
Not based on today, but I'm yet to be convinced by this guy.

1454~~~
Blind wasn't in the game for me today. Fellaini was a lot more involved on and off the ball and I don't if Blind's first half booking affected his performance. Definitely needs to improve and hopefully will the more he plays in PL.

1455~~~
He kept the ball very well in some tight spots today. His job is to start attacks and break up play and he manages that effectively. No issue with him whatsoever.

1456~~~
You would probably think a fit Carrick moves Blind to the bench. So he'll be rotated more and have less pressure on him and can develop.

1457~~~
Thought that was his best performance for us so far. Looked solid in extremely tough circumstances. Encouraging signs looking ahead.

1458~~~
He was fantastic today if you ask me. Kept the ball, done so much good in the first half when Rooney/ Januzaj / ADM were hell bent on losing the ball creating City counters, I'd say he was our best player untill that fecking red card that got everything upside down. He was good in the second half as well, he's new to the team, new to the league and you wouldn't say that if you didn't know it. 

He's a great player to have, delighted with him.

1459~~~
Don't think he did badly at all considering his game was limited by the softest yellow card imaginable and having to sit infront of a defence with as much experience as an amish virgin.

1460~~~
Exactly. Some of his movement to get out of tight spots was brilliant today. Contrary to some i think he has really stepped up against Chelsea and City. He is exactly what have been lacking for a few years now.

1461~~~
I would agree but with our center halves unable to stay fit or getting suspended, looks like he may be needed at CB for a bit. Definitely needs some time for sure though.

1462~~~
He does his job fine IMO, the issues are behind him and in front of him.

1463~~~
Played a solid match IMO. Some good interceptions and solid on the ball as usual. Yellow card was harsh.

1464~~~
I thought he was excellent today (and pretty much everytime I've watched him). Mr. Consistent.

1465~~~
You might as well never be, if you aren't already.

1466~~~
Think he played well again. Still kinda invisible, but had a few good plays and his passing is excellent.

1467~~~
He's a very good player that does the simple things well. He's always available for a pass, too and almost plays like a third centre back at times. A lot of his work goes unnoticed.

The one thing he hasn't got in his game is that ability to truly boss a game, or the physical presence to command a midfield. But then again, you wouldn't really expect it of a player of Daley's calibre and stature.

I believe he'd be very good next to Herrera over a run of games. Someone who will take the ball off him and play forward.

1468~~~
He's been solid so far. Pleased with him.

1469~~~
Strange post. What do you expect from him. 



I like how he plays, reall calm and confident in possesion, comes for ball, controls things, his passes are accurate, good defensively.

1470~~~
Decent as always. This bloke is so 7/10, it makes Dennis Irwin nervous.

1471~~~
A couple of years back our midfield would've gone into meltdown with 10 men against a team like city. Today we coped much better than I expected and I thought Blind was great.

Ironic that after all these years without a midfield, when we finally get one we don't have a defence.

1472~~~
Was watching the MUTV phone in after the game today, as if i wasn't depressed enough, some Scottish guy comes on and staright away has a go at Blind..
like what the actual... out of all the players on the pitch today? you pick on Blind? really?

1473~~~
He must be Blind. Soz, just had to. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1474~~~
Was one of our best players today IMO. Looked very good early on especially when we were controlling most of the ball, but then later on had to be very defensive of course.

1475~~~
Did well today I thought, better than against Chelsea

1476~~~
I think he's great and he's fast becoming a very important player for us. A steal at £13 million if he keeps this up.

1477~~~
Good performance today, for me in terms of £/talent he's been our best signing of the summer so far.

1478~~~
thought that he was excellent today. He always seemed at the right places and his control under pressure was great.

1479~~~
Yea i'm really a big fan as well, you look at Erikson at Spuds, and obviously players like Suarez at Liverpool.. im trying hard to remember a player who came out of Ajax who's been a total dud in the PL?

1480~~~
Agreed with the majority of people above - I'm not sure where any negativity about his performance comes from today. For me he was very good once again, absolute bargain.

1481~~~
I love Daley, he does his job well and is so damn cool and composed about it. Smooth as silk the lad.

1482~~~
People keep saying he's invisible but that is usually the case with players of his ilk, he's not a deep lying playmaker like Pirlo or Alonso, he's a screener, a holding CM that reads the game well and passes it off efficiently to the 2 CM's in front of him, I believe the modern term is recycler.

Personally I'd love to see him play with two top class box to box CM's in a midfield 3.

1483~~~
Exactly..! Been a great buy and as mentioned earlier he's managed to stop our norm of the ball continually going wide at every given opportunity.

1484~~~
Confident Herrera and Di Maria can be those 2 with the chance.

1485~~~
Hope he can make the next step soon and start controlling things and do things that get "a bit more noticed" if you know what I mean

1486~~~
Like doing a Keano? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1487~~~
I dunno what he has to do to be a bit more noticed, he probably sees the ball more than anyone else in the side.

1488~~~
He's been great. For me the most consistently impressive of all our new signings.

1489~~~
I still don't think he's the answer to our DM problems, he is incredibly slow, haven't seen that many good tackles from him either. He also doesn't look like much of a physical presence which is something we clearly need badly. 

He's been decent and consistent, but not brilliant like some here are suggesting. Very good rotation player to have around though, especially for his price tag.

1490~~~
Simply do not get the people who are unconvinced by Blind. He's been great.

1491~~~
I'd agree with this.

1492~~~
He's just brilliant. Leaving a lot of people on here with egg on their faces.

1493~~~
It's probably the same bunch who were convinced he was average before he arrived and haven't quite been able to admit they're wrong yet.

1494~~~
What more do you want from him? Want him to go and score 30 yarders or put in 10/10 tackles every match to convince yourself he is good enough to be a starter for us? Btw, would like to know your opinion of Carrick as he is most similar to Blind.

1495~~~
He's been the most consistent of our summer signings. Love the composure he brings in midfield and always looking to keep the ball moving. We still need another midfielder, but Blind's settled in very well.

1496~~~
Also, to those unconvinced by Blind, go watch the Burnley game again. It was horrible. We couldn't even get the ball from defence to midfield because Fletcher was hiding. Blind always shows and starts our game for us. He doesn't have speed and strength, fair enough, you cannot have it all. It's how you make up for it. He keeps the ball for us, he shows up in the right place and is clever when pressed. He isn't world class, but he doesn't have to be.

1497~~~
Statistically he was our best player again yesterday. 90% success rate and our most passes. Many of them are sideways or backwards but that patient build up to try bring out the opposition seems to be a ploy that LVG likes. He seems to be getting used to the pace and physicality of the Prem too after being brushed aside too easily against QPR in particular.

1498~~~
Yeah I agree with this really. Does some things really well in all fairness, but then some things are really poor. Like he'd get a foot in to win the ball back one minute, then next minute a player has passed him too easily and he's chasing them as they hurtle towards our back line.

I can't get over how slow and un-agile he is also. For somebody with the physique of your average player, you'd expect at least decent mobility.

1499~~~
That's the problem. It's not easy to have 2-3 world class midfielders in their prime in your team. We were lucky to have Keane/Scholes during their prime just like Barca were lucky that Xavi and Iniesta were together for their era of domination. But it's not like every top team has 2-3 world class midfielders playing together. You need smart players like Blind as well.

1500~~~
Yes

1501~~~
See that's the problem. You are obviously after the flashy old fashioned centre back's tackle, that wipes out the defender and the ball. Blind wins a lot of tackles and interceptions, but he does it in a clean and IMO more impressive way. 

A big slide tackle might look better for the cameras, but he does a lot of good work in front of the defense.

1502~~~
To me he's one of those players where you need to have a decent understanding of the game to 'get'. Hes a facilitator for others, rather than someone who grabs the limelight. Scholes was similar in some aspects of his game (always after receiving a pass, impossible to get the ball from) and look how long it took for some to realise how good he was, even with his goals and passing range added to the mix. Carrick is very similar too, and some fans still think he's rubbish. Players like Blind will always have detractors, no matter how good they are, just because they're not showy.

1503~~~
We actually don't get dominated in CM any more. People want too much these days...

1504~~~
This is very true, 'Scholes the passer' wasn't rated until the last 2000's. It was always Keane that everybody loved, and Scholes was just a good goal scorer.

1505~~~
His name isn't Arturo Vidal.

1506~~~
Well he impressed Danny Murphy.

1507~~~
Considering he looked (and played) like such a thug, Danny Mills seems much smarter than the average pro. He's spot on about Blind too.

1508~~~
That's Danny Murphy.

1509~~~
Ah. He's still right though!

1510~~~
Love his game. Technically and positionally sound. He helps so much with our transition from the back (Remember the trouble we had with this in the first few games this year) and has a pretty good passing range. You don't need a DM to be a physical beast. Milan played Pirlo and not Gattuso furthest back in their diamond back in the day, though it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a Vidal / Strootman kind of player as one of the other midfielders.

Herrera and Fellaini could be rotated in the CM / AM positions if we were to persist with the diamond.

1511~~~
Well once Carrick is back to full fitness I'd rather him start over Blind. He can do most things Blind does and is stronger and a better passer. With Herrera and Di Maria around him I actually think Carrick can thrive because last season he was pretty much a 1 man midfielder and couldn't do anything.

1512~~~
Pretty much my exact same thoughts.

1513~~~
He's been immense for us, really hope he doesn't go to bench next season if he carries on performing at this level. Midfield is actually the least of our worries at the moment, ironically.

1514~~~
At one point yesterday Rooney kicked the ball aimlessly away while we were under pressure and Blind gave him an absolute bollocking. Positive to see he's not concerned by reputations and also that he seems to value possession of the ball much more highly than other players we've got (not especially Rooney, he was just the example I noticed).

1515~~~
Alonso has played in some of the best teams in Europe and for Spain for the last 10 years despite being slow, and unathletic. Pirlo and Carrick to a lesser extend aren't gifted athletes but more than make up for it with technique, intelligence and tactical competence from their managers.

1516~~~
Thought he'd be a poor signing myself (wasn't all that convinced that his world cup performances were representative of the player) but he's done really nicely. Nice to have another player in the starting XI who I don't have to worry about not doing their job or hoping they'll turn up.

1517~~~
I really do not get the critism of him to be honest, he looks a class player definate name of the team sheet for me at the moment.

1518~~~
I think Blind really showed his value against Chelsea and City.  We pretty much held our own against 2 top quality midfields and Blind's calmness, ability to take the ball in close circumstances, passing and discipline were a major, major part of that it seemed to me.  Really happy with him.  No way I would drop him for Carrick.

1519~~~
I think the main problem with blind in the current set up of Fellaini/Rooney pushing up high and him fairly on his bill centrally is that he might not quite have the range needed. He keeps possession well and works calmly but think we're getting a disconnect when it's just him and a big gulf to the attackers and he doesn't have Carricks range imo. 

Tbh though I think the problem there is that we need to have someone stay a bit more deeper and breakforward as the move develops such as in the 2nd half against city once we found our feet again. Whereas in the first half whilst we had some decent spells I think we couldn't make the most of it because there was too much of a disconnect. I think that would help everyone out personally as get more cover if there's a counter and can work in Di Maria/Januzaj a lot easier.

1520~~~
What you are describing it exactly what we had when we played with Di Maria Blind and Herrera in the middle.

1521~~~
Im actually surprised so many people see Blind's value to the team and respect him.

Normally these types of players are always overlooked.

1522~~~
Pass completion rate of 92.3% yesterday. A man down against Manchester City, that is very impressive.

1523~~~
Haha after having no midflield for a while I think most can now see and appreciate a proper midfield player.

1524~~~
I'd love to see it tried I just wonder if LvG thinks that trio lacks physicality.

1525~~~
Off topic but I was watching the deer hunter yesterday and Daley blind is the spits of john savage !

1526~~~
He has become an absolutely integral part of our midfield and it would seem he's one of the very first names on the sheet. There was talk of Carrick replacing him when he returned to fitness, but I don't see it myself. Not as long as Blind plays like this. He's our engine, really.

1527~~~
Don't think I'll ever get over this view of his pass <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1528~~~
Love is Blind.

1529~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/V1CRjrA.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/V1CRjrA.jpg"/>

My WiFi is named after him!

1530~~~
The way I see it, Blind is basically our version of Busquets/Lahm. Not on ability, but in terms of how important he is to us in the midfield.

Before we brought him over we had so much trouble linking defense to attack with Fletcher not doing his job; as soon as we replaced him with Blind in midfield we were much more cohesive in attack and communication between defense and offense improved due to him always being on position to receive passes.

1531~~~
I agree with him, I started to rate Blind but he is not and never will be world class unless he massively improves which I don't expect as he looks like not a player of high potential from what I've seen.. He came at the last days of transfer window for no reason.. I feel that Pearson have much higher potential and its a shame that reece james didn't get his chance in midfield as I think he wouldn't do much worse... anyway Blind turned out to be a good player for us which is good to see but someone bigger who can impose more more in the game is pretty much needed. We always look very fragile at the back with him as def. midfielder, he is a good passer and when we have ball he is brilliant player to have but when we face the counter attack he is the slowest player in the universe, he could race mertesacker and it would be a draw.. and he lacks any strenght. He reads game pretty well but thats not enough he is often late in tackles and recieves early yellow. We definitely need a better midfielder. I mean he profites from the fact that he played under van Gaal who can make some players look better imo as he gives them certain instructions.. Fellaini and Valencia are decent players even Young. I believe if we have someone like Vidal/strootman or that hogher class/quality player we will dominate even more. Blind good squad player for me, no more than that

1532~~~
If you compare us with Blind to us without Blind the difference is night and day.

1533~~~
The most important player so far was Herrera imo, more important than dimaria, only had one bad game after rushed back from injury. Blind is always good when he has got good players around him same with Carras obviously if he doesn hit top top form like he did last fergie's season.. Blind is good player and hes got his place in the starting XI just because he palys good and because he hasnt got any competition - true fact.. Fletcher, Pereira, pearson and 34 old carrick comes the closest in contention for the place

1534~~~
Except we look better defensively when Herrara doesn't play.

1535~~~
he has his one or two mistakes per match when he sets opposition to counter attack apart chelsea match when he did it 3 or four times in the first half but again he was rushed back from injury and fellaini took his chance.. Blind is little more cautious but makes this odd mistake per match also. Herrera is apart that brilliant footballer who is everywhere, look at his stats. I believe he had in one match something like 90% accuracy passing 8 successful fecking tackles which is what carrick does in three matches, 3 interceptions  one or two blocks and some clearance, scored one and had assist... his defensive duties are well underated he is everywhere and wins the ball a lot puts pressure on defenders but doesnt look as calm on the ball as Blind apart that debatable fact I would consider him certainly a better player

1536~~~
Imagine midfield of 

Blind
Herrera - Strootman
Di Maria

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1537~~~
Reckon that's more to do with us using only 1 striker and 2 wingers who help out defensively instead of the full backs being isolated.

1538~~~
He got criticised a bit on MNF by Gary Neville for playing too many square, safe passes. I think it's a bit harsh. He can't be expected to do everything on his own. He's basically closing the opposition down, winning the ball back, making key tackles and interceptions starting attacks off and allowing the attackers to play. I can probably accept if he's not playing the risky final passes as well but I think we need Herrera next to him because he offers that and he doesn't shirk his defensive responsibility either.

1539~~~
Yeah and it results in the other CMs staying more central to help out blind. With the diamond, Di Maria and Ander were practically playing as LM/RMs at times leaving Blind in the middle on his own.

1540~~~
Sounds silly, it looks fairly obvious that's the task he's being assigned to accomplish and he's doing it excellently.

1541~~~
Yeah. The diamonds great going forwards and in possession, but the full backs get caught out at times especially against big teams so I can see the risk in playing it in big games. In a 4-3-3 with wingers we can use Di maria centrally to get the best out of him, but then we force Rooney wide or have to play Valencia or young, none of which is ideal.

1542~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1543~~~
Both Herrera and Blind have proved themselves to be very successful acquisitions, however, Ander is more important for the team than Blind is imo.

1544~~~
He's got a particular skillset, if he would be playing with Modric for example, he would connect brilliantly and make him a better player. A bit like Busquets with Xavi and Iniesta. Whereas someone like Cleverly seemed to really negatively influence some basic midfield patterns. 

Although not fast, Blind was a really reliable and intelligent left back for Ajax by the way, also against big teams in the Champions League, and for the Dutch team during the qualifiers. In some matches I would prefer playing him there ahead of Rojo, if Shaw is not fit.

However, he's not even close to Carrick on form. Might take a couple of years for him to reach that level too, and he might never reach it. He's still young though, plenty of time. Pretty satisfied with his performances up until now, but if he would play like this for Everton or Schalke 04, not many people would rate or notice him. 

Van Gaal played with Danny Blind at Sparta and then Blind was his captain at Ajax. They've known each other very well and obviously Daley played for Holland in Brazil. Van Gaal knew exactly how good he was and was just a phone call away from signing him. Still took him up until the end of the market to sign him, says it all really. Van Gaal was looking for a better player and he was right, we still need that extra quality in midfield. However unlike Cleverly, or a post illness Fletcher, Blind is good option to have in our squad.

1545~~~
I quite like Blind. The fact is, he has managed to hold his own with and - to a fairly large extent - nullify two midfields involving players like Toure, Fabregas, Matic and Oscar. All whilst playing beside Marouane Fellaini, too. His resilence to deal with the league's physicality is ever growing, you can see it in his newer found confidence in attacking aerial balls. He intercepts play well, and does every that Carrick was doing at his best, albeit currently at a lower level. That said, one thing he possesses that Carrick never had is his intent to pass the ball forward and play under pressure. The major criticism Carrick will always have from me is that, despite being the cool composed man in our midfield for years, he often went crab-mode when it got real tough in big games. It does seem like it's a bit of a Dutch thing, I don't know. We barely produce players in the mould of Carrick or Blind.

It is a shame he is pretty slow. If he had a lick more pace, he could have the conventions neccessary to be one of the best holding midfielders around.

1546~~~
He's a good player don't get me wrong but bloody heck, he's so overrated on here its actually hilarious, people are comparing him to Busquets, Lahm now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He doesn't even get to play in his "Proper" position for Holland and that's by the last 2 national team managers.

The thing that annoys me is the fact that people were bashing Cleverley for doing the exact same things Blind does, I mean wdf? Sideways passing, tidy simple passing, keeping the play ticking these are things Cleverley was getting destroyed for doing yet Blind gets praised for it, have I missed something? Cleverley and our other midfielders got a lot of slack for not doing any hollywood passes or throughballs or even tackling, I haven't yet seen Blind do that either and from the matches I've watched he's hardly shown anything worth drooling over.

I'm not for 1 second suggesting Blind isn't good enough, I think he's a good player who can cover a variety of roles, I also think he's a fine addition to the squad, I just don't get all this premature hype.

1547~~~
He plays with far more composure and forward passes than Cleverley has for years now. But yes, it's true, his tackling average is pretty low, but he averages 3 interceptions a game - that's almost double say, Matic and Fernandinho (both average 1.7, I believe). A select few are going overboard, but I think it's more appreciating the role he plays.

1548~~~
Cleverley got slack for constantly shying away from wanting the ball, taking any responsibility, and shitting his pants every time he received a pass under any vague amount of pressure. 

Basically everything that Blind has shown he isn't.

1549~~~
I quite agree however I think he is not far from carrick rather very close as carrick is 34 after disaster season (not that others weren't on par with him last year) and he will get overrun if he plays that deep role against bigger teams. Blind has more stamina and mobility IMO, but still cant match him simply because his passing is not as crisp or direct. With this I just wanted to say that we really lack world class midfielder in this holding or defensive position STILL YEARS because carrick in top form one of the best in league in his years was maybe close but never reached top class. Blind is not answer either he stopped the gap for some time but he needs to work on a lot of things to be considered at least at level of carrick.

And calling Blind versatile player is the biggest shite ever stated, sorry mate but you are not alone, he is completely out of place to run down the wing even his performances at WC were extremely overrated because he had blinder in first match. Players dribbled past him dozen times and he has his pass but not quite quick feet to beat a player and get to the cross, also doesn't have any muscles to compensate these weaknesses. If anything he is on par with Janmaat who is lower table player at most. Look how awfull netherlands are with hidding playing him there. His position is CDM and he cant play there not as LB not as CM. Its like playing Rooney at RB, yes he would do his job but it would be harsh to paly him there as he is three times player at other positions and we have got players better than him there. although rooney how I don't like him I think this comparison is not exact as he is one of the players who could play anywhere on the pitch - extremely versatile, anyway he has also preferred position in which he is much better, currently looks like its the tip of the diamond.

We can only hope that Blind will live up the expectations some optimists here have about him..

but we desperately need one midfielder of world quality Blind is not that..

1550~~~
He offers far more to our midfield and team than Cleverley ever has. He moves the ball quickly and his passing is excellent, it's not just sideways passing either is it? He's always looking to move things forward but sometimes simple passes to keep possession are required.

Surely you can see that he's far better than Cleverley, right?

1551~~~
He's seriously been compared to Modric?

1552~~~
Nah, nobody has compared Blind to Modric in this thread.

1553~~~
I will compare him to Modrić.

Modrić > Blind

1554~~~
No.

1555~~~
You mean Blind just doesn't have the same vision?

1556~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2820194/Daley-Blind-risks-just-takes-easy-option-Gary-Neville-blasts-Manchester-United-midfielder.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ille-blasts-Manchester-United-midfielder.html</a>

Bit of a needless comment from Neville I thought. Does he not realise what kind of player Blind is?

1557~~~
Gary wrong again.

1558~~~
Gary Neville once again should feck off.

Edit: May be Not. And I think this is the video where he talks about Blind, but It's actually about RvP than him. Blind is a refreshing change from What we have in midfield these past years(with the exception of Carrick). Earlier in the season It was great to see him and Herrera inter changing their positions, and both of them making themselves available for a pass.

1559~~~
If Blind plays the risky passes Neville would like to see, he'll give the ball away a fair bit and with a suspect defense that'll bring trouble.

1560~~~
It's another showing of this archaic British attitude that midfielders should be constantly making big passes, running box-to-box and scoring goals or they're not doing their job right. It's the same thing that leads people to put Gerrard as a centre-midfielder in their Premier League XIs when his two best seasons came as a right midfielder and playing behind the striker and also the same thing that led to Carrick being left out of the England setup despite being the best midfielder in the country prior to the last Euros. In short its why the national team is a mess.

1561~~~
Neville didn't seem to like Mata and Kagawa, maybe Blind is next.

1562~~~
Blind does play it a bit safe though. I don't think Neville is too being too harsh there.

1563~~~
I am not sure why people are so defensive about some players, no one is suggesting that he has played badly at all but there is nothing wrong in expecting more from a player

1564~~~
Football Fans.

I agree though, I like Blind but I'd like his passing to be a bit more positive from time to time.

1565~~~
He's a defensive midfielder, its his job to keep it ticking and safe.

1566~~~
It's like him moaning why Makelele or De Jong never made 40 yard defense splitting passes. 

Gary really has a stick up his ass with us recently, I don't quite understand why.

1567~~~
Neville has proven himself to be quite the idiot over the past 12 months.

1568~~~
But Neville played with Carrick....
That's all Carrick has done for years! 
Neville and Scholes came out and defended Carrick for this kind of stuff....

Believe me, I'm starting to question somethings with this team and it's management but, Neville can do one here! 

He criticized him yesterday for not bending a 35 yard pass, past three defenders, on to the foot of RVP....Moronic unless you are David Beckham or Pirlo! 

How quickly that goal and that pass in the WC is forgotten

And before the derby, when Noel Gallagher said he'd have De Gea straight in the City team, Neville started defending and bigging up Joe Hart.

Incredible scenes. Cringe!!

1569~~~
I think Gary was just looking for something to praise RVP for before he criticized him and Blind just got caught in the cross-fire. The first example where Blind 'failed' to make the pass was laughable - it was never on.

1570~~~
Neville comes across so unbiased you would think he is Scouse. 

Criticism of Blind is ridiculous, Scholes hasn't been feeding balls through to RvP for nearly 2 years and even when he was I can't remember him creating chance after chance in his final season.

I do wish he was a little more pro United, probably a little bitter his bro was sacked for not understanding that cones aren't part of LvG's philosophy.

1571~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

In fairness, I don't think anyone knows what this "philosophy" is

1572~~~
Yeah, agreed. He can't win. If he hadn't looked for those examples of Van Persie's runs not being picked out the headlines would be all about "Neville slams Van Persie!"

He's being paid to give opinions about football. I'd far rather he occasionally criticise some of our players than stick with the bland old boys club crap you get on MOTD, where criticising fellow professionals seems to be out of the question. Really unfair the way people on here get so irate about him for daring to have an opinion.

I do think he's wrong on this one. Not only because it's a little harsh on Blind but because if he can only come up with three examples Van Persie making a decent run over 90 minutes of football (two of them tenuous, at best) than it's obvious the main issue isn't the lack of vision in central midfield.

1573~~~
There are games where you need mobility and not physicality. Those games without mobilty you will have rings run round you.

1574~~~
The Philosophy is very simple, possess the ball, attack with speed (stab the opposition) and never trust your talent, think about you are doing.

1575~~~
An even simpler philosophy would be just to "win" 

But I'm old fashioned like that <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1576~~~
I certainly remember something Van Gaal said about the philosophy being to stop playing instinctively and start playing intelligently. Something about training players' brains so they make better decisions about what to do with the ball. But what those decisions might be Im not quite sure. I would love someone to definitively answer this question but I suspect only someone who has actually played football under him could do it. And they all seem so vague about it Im starting to think all his players have to sign non-disclosure agreements before they are allowed on the training pitch.

1577~~~
Usually in the PL you need a mix of both attributes in most games to play box to box midfield.

1578~~~
His use of English is so fecking obtuse at press conferences I do wonder how he gets his message across at training. I come away utterly confused about this philosophy based on what he's saying in interviews to the press, so feck knows what intellectual heavyweights like Smalling, Jones and Rooney are taking home from his briefings. I really hope he's speaking in Dutch and using someone who is fluent in both languages to translate.

1579~~~
You know what, it occurred to me he is playing up his difficulties with English as a way of deflecting. Just because he has notoriously bad relations with the media, maybe he is hiding behind this language barrier thing. Im probably completely wrong, but I have never in my life met a Dutch person with such faltering English.

1580~~~
Well, he said on Friday that he didn't want anyone to be sent off.....Smalling was clearly confused by that <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1581~~~
I think the truth of the matter is he is just that rare thing: a Dutchman who isnt naturally gifted with languages. Apparently at Bayern his German was a source of much ridicule and mirth as well.

1582~~~
...maybe even his Dutch is confusing...

1583~~~
didn't Steve McClaren win a league with Dutchenglish?

1584~~~
There is no shame in not being able to master English as completely as Steve McClaren mastered Dutch.

1585~~~
It's not a bad theory. I remember last season people saying Pochetinno was fluent in English but chose to use a translator, as a barrier between himself and the press.

Dunno if you saw any of Trappatoni's interviews in "English" when he was close to being sacked from the Irish job but they were absolute gibberish. Always suspected it might have been intentional.

1586~~~
I agree with Neville, Blind plays in a way that is way too safe for us, we should be taking riskes and expecting more verticality from our midfielders.

1587~~~
If its verticality youre after, Fellaini has that in abundance.

1588~~~
I'm looking for the verticality Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick used to offer, there's no point on having a midfielder if he's not going to pass through the rival lines. Playing it safe and being steady is not good enough for a Manchester United midfielder.

1589~~~
You are right, but I would say there are some teams who put more emphasis on the physicality. Maybe we will bulk them up a bit or they will realise they have to fight for every ball. Any player coming from a different league will be shocked that someone wants to disconnect them from the knees down.

1590~~~
He controlled almost every game he was in even during his final season, at least in the Premier League, he imposed himself against other midfielders "out-passing" them, he understood exactly where to put the ball in order to make space for other players and make the team advance. This is something we have been lacking for a long time and only a few special midfielders can produce that, don't know if Blind is the one for that job.

1591~~~
Verticality means playing the ball forwards. Blind passes the ball forwards. A lot. Completed more forward passes then either Matic or Fabregas attempted when we played Chelsea, for example.

1592~~~
Oh right. I was thinking about verticality in the sense of being a lanky streak of piss.

1593~~~
While true, the point is that Scholes wasn't putting Van Persie in with key passes game after game. He was trying the occasional long direct one that Van Persie could bring down and try to make a chance out of and they tended to connect well. Less often than Song was putting Van Persie in for Arsenal and not a consistant thing. As you say Scholes was more about controlling the midfield and being influencial on the ball. He wasnt playing all the passes that Neville was pointing out should have been played in behind the defence for Van Persie by the likes of Blind on his wrong foot.

1594~~~
Not enough passes forward they said, passes as much forward passes as Matic they never said, avg pass length higher than Matic they never said, more keypasses than Matic they never said, more chances created than Matic they never said, the midfielder everybody gets their tit out about, is statistically worse than Blind. Blind will always get this, he has had this criticism for a while now, fact is, that its just bullocks.

1595~~~
He may pass the ball forward but those passes don't necessarily beat the opponent's line which doesn't help us gain the space we need to bring the best out of our forwards. I think he's a good, safe midfielder, kind of a Hargreaves type, but criticism that he's not a Keane-like midfielder or a midfielder that can impose himself in games in the way we need a United midfielder to do is right, maybe we should not be asking that for him also.

1596~~~
Exactly, why did we bought Herrera/di Maria then? To require this from a CVM would be a bit ridiculous, he shields our defence and distributes the ball to the players in front of him Herrera/di Maria/

1597~~~
This, it's like people don't get the concept of division of labour, everyone of your midfielders can not be playmakers this is why we had Rooney and Fellaini in cm. Well they didn't quite manage this but it should not fall on Blind, even when Scholes was doing his satellite navigator stuff there was always a Carrick or Keane( he was more complete than the latter) to establish possessional superiority by playing these unimaginative square balls. If he wants an uninterrupted thirty five yard hollywood ball show he can watch one of England's old matches with Gerrard in his pomp. What we missed o Sunday was players like Di Maria and Herrera i central areas playing those types of passes. Blind was fine imo, what we need is drive, tenacity and creativity flanking him not him throwing away possession at every given chance. Imagine the carnage that would have occured if Blind had Di Maria's 63 fecking % pass completion!

1598~~~
Did Carrick do that? It's all about roles and the players who were fielded to do that were just laying it wide and running into the box. Do fans think we have signed Superman who can shield the ridiculously porous defence, originate moves and at the same time be the major creative outlet?

1599~~~
That's my thoughts regarding it too.

1600~~~
Against West Brom I actually thought he tried to Hollywood ball into Van Persie a bit too much and felt he should have been cycling possession more.

Neville was only able to pinpoint 2 moments and perhaps the ball was on (one of them it wasn't particularly). But when you're playing with 10 men and have little opportunity to get forward, is the hollywood ball and going for the killer seriously the best option. You want to make your forward play count and play the percentages.

1601~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Phil Neville had a little punditry stint for the Be In Sports channel this past PL week end. It made me laugh to see him there.

1602~~~
I don't think he's really overrated if I'm honest. People just really appreciate his contribution having been used to really inept midfield displays over the years.
I think the Lahm comparison is as straightforward as they come by the way. A full back turned into a deep lying playmaker. Is not too hard to see that similarity, surely? The difference is that one is one of the best players around the last couple of years and the other isn't. The job they're expected to carry out is very alike though. Which makes the comparison valid in my opinion. Comparing players should be in terms of jobs they are tasked with as opposed to ability, if you ask me.
Could the reason he doesn't play his "proper" position for Holland be that the next best left back isn't all that whereas the midfielders in contention for a spot are pretty good? Just asking, I don't really know who the next left back in line is, Martins Indi?

EDIT (Just to give my two cents on Blind): In the beginning I was a little wary of jumping aboard the bandwagon, what with the opposition he had faced, but after his displays against Chelsea and City I'm convinced he's good enough for us in the role he plays.

1603~~~
I don't think anyone has said he's at that level, he's just a similar type of player. 

And there's a big difference with what he, busquets or players like him do. They sit in front of the back four and pick the ball up off them and pass the ball around everywhere. It's about having the intelligence to play the right pass and he's definitely shown that. Not to mention he has good positioning so picks up loose balls a lot and gets tackles in too. What cleverley did, and what he got bashed for, was always just playing pointless passes. He just wasn't good enough all around and he never had any intent in his passing. He wasn't playing the role that blind is, he was always a more attacking role that required more creativity in his passing, he just never had it.

1604~~~
Given that Blind played in a 3-man midfield, why should he be adventurous as the deepest midfielder of the 3. Rooney was supposed to be our dictator from midfield, but he was poor in dictating our tempo and rhythm along with being poor in his passing, overall. How can one really criticise Blind for not being adventurous in his passing, especially when we were down to 10 men and had one less attacker on the pitch?

To me, he's a very good defensive midfielder, and I've been really impressed by him so far. He's great at recovering from situations; his positioning is excellent; he's great at retaining possession and providing an option to central defenders; and he's good at filling in for our out-of-position defenders.

I think he has the potential to be a very good defensive midfielder if not world class. He's made an instant impact for us as a defensive midfielder, and he was the sort of player we badly missed in the past several seasons.

1605~~~
He's already starting to look brilliant to be honest. He does exactly what LVG asks for him, nothing less and more importantly - nothing more. He has tackling and interception stats which are better than Carrick ever had in the league. His decision making on when to step forward and press and win the ball back or force some extra passes from the opponents to kill their counter - and when to just fall back - is world class. 

Can't think of a defensive midfielder who does that thing in particular better than him right now.

1606~~~
Yup, this whole criticism of him not playing this or that kind of ball is rather cringeworthy and simply deflecting all the blame away from Rooney ( because out of the trio that played against City you'd think that he's <b>the</b> man that's meant to take the play forward and dictate the tempo ).

1607~~~
Look at how much our distribution has improved with this guy in the field. Very confident on the ball and the defenders don't hoof the ball as much as before. They have belief in Blind and pass the ball to him. Along with all of this his interception and positioning is top notch. Loving this guy already

1608~~~
How did you work that out? If he had footage of Rooney not playing the right pass in the same situation he would have used it.

The fact he had so few examples to use says more about Van Persie than it does about any of the players who were supposed to be supplying him.

1609~~~
'He does what LVG asks for him, nothing less and more importantly - nothing more.' Wow - BRILLIANT!

1610~~~
If there's one thing that pisses Van Gaal off its when his players do more than is asked of them.

1611~~~
Not exactly what I meant, it's not down just to Neville's analysis. It's more down to the fact that in the midfield trio we've got against City you can clearly see the three roles given there: box to box Fellaini, #6 Blind and something around #10 Rooney. If people expect Blind to be more adventurous with his passing ( not just this one pass that he didn't make to RVP ) then they need to be reminded that he's pretty much shielding our defence and we shall not forget what a pile of shit he's in front. 

When the last obstacle that's in front of our shit defense is going to start playing more risky passes then we're going to get absolutely destroyed by opposition. He simply has to play it safe and it's down to Rooney/Mata ( in this kind of formation ) to take care of those risky passes that will get our striker on goal.

1612~~~
Ok, yeah. Agree with all of that.

1613~~~
Can he play centre back?

With Carrick back and he looked good against City he should be playing in the midfield but at the same time Blind doesn't deserve to be dropped.

1614~~~
Good question. Id rather see Carrick back there though, he is more experienced and will be better placed to organise the others at the back IMO.

1615~~~
A good few inches taller too, right?

1616~~~
Blind has lovely hair. Not strictly relevant but I thought Id throw that out there. With him in the team Woodward should be out there looking for a hair products partner.

1617~~~
Well Fergie kicked that excessive workrate and endeavour out of Rooney!

1618~~~
My missus has been away so the match at the weekend was the first one she's seen this season. Her first comment when Blind came on the screen was "Who is <i>he</i>?" I take it she's a fan.

1619~~~
Ok fair enough, but I still can't see Blind being a long term solution at CDM, we need much much more from someone playing in that position. Just keeping play ticking isn't enough. We need some drive, physicality and long passes from deep, something like what Ferdnando does for City. He was pretty much signed last minute anyway so I don't think LVG see's him long term either. I think LVG wants to try Strootman in that position if he regains fitness, which I think would benefit the team more.

1620~~~
Neville is speaking lots of nonsense these days in short.

1621~~~
What makes it worse is Ingurlands Gary Neville said sod all about Cleverley on this issue even when he had far more license to be more creative than Blind has.

1622~~~
If we were playing a midfield 2, with a number 9 and number 9.5 as our forwards, then your comment would have been fair.

However, we've been playing a midfield 3 ever since van Gaal came in. In a midfield 3, we have two players who can offer that forward drive with at least one of them offering some physicality and the other/both having the ability to dictate play from midfield. As a result, our 3rd midfielder will most likely be someone protecting the defence and providing the rest the freedom to play their game. If this 3rd midfielder plays a more risky game, how will the attacking players play at their best if they have no assured protection?

Having said that, if we have Carrick anchor our defence with Blind beside him and Herrera ahead of them, then you should expect more drive and forward play from Blind. However, as our deepest midfielder protecting our defence, you shouldn't want him to be too risky in his game.

1623~~~
Yet another reason why Blind is so useful.

1624~~~
And another reason why Van Gaal was so keen to keep "The Translator" around at Barca all those years ago.

1625~~~
Blind completes 3.6 long balls/90 mins and Fernando only 2.2. Blind's avg. pass length is 19m compared to Fernando's 15m and Blind passes forwards more often. Fernando's passing is limited and was the biggest criticism of his game from Portuguese league watchers on here. Fernando's passing ability is certainly not something we need. His physicality isn't giving him much advantage to his defensive game either as Blind beats him in everything. Blind has 5.8 tackles+intercepetions/90 minutes to Fernando's 4.1, Blind makes more than twice as many clearances and Blind is more successful in 50/50 duels as well. Blind is pretty much better than Fernando at everything.

1626~~~
Its a common misconception that all Blind does it sit in front of the back 4 and mop things up. If you watch the games we have played well in/one. Blind is usually at the start of most of our successful attacks, finding the front men up the pitch with his passing. I'm not saying he has some fantastic range of passing, but his passing does seem to be somewhat underrated.

1627~~~
Love it when its all laid out like that. 

Perception Vs Reality.

1628~~~
Hmm,  I've watched both this season and Fernando has clearly been the better player. Fernando was also performing much better against us prior to the sending off. Those Stats are impressive but Fernando still looks the better player for me.

1629~~~
I watched a game recently, maybe it was against Villa can't remember but Fernando had a complete mare. He has played well this season though I admit, but I don't think its clear cut that hes been better than Blind.

1630~~~
Yeah, I'll admit Blind has some pretty impressive stats but I don't really look into those any more when looking at players. Apparently Rooney is better than Aguero if you wanna go by stats.

1631~~~
I mentioned nothing about stats...

1632~~~
Nothing on his performance today? I thought he did rather well, especially bringing the ball out from the back.

1633~~~
Am I the only one that thought he looked more comfortable as the left centre back, then Rojo has all season? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1634~~~
No. And the way he brought out the ball is what is needed. Both Rojo and Blackett don't seem to have that ability.

1635~~~
Another decent performance, his abilty to put in good performances every week without any drama is a blessing when those around him can't stay fit for more than 90 minutes.

If only Smalling and Jones could learn from him...intelligence is a valuable asset to have as a player.

1636~~~
Did fine, thankfully Palace offered very little in attack but him and McNair certainly bring the ball out the way LvG likes.

1637~~~
Wasn't tested as much in defense, so looked great but his ball control and passing looked so much more effective once him and Carrick swapped places and he got closer to goal. The difference between Carrick and him is that when Blind takes a shot he means to score rather than just probe because the ball happened to be there.

1638~~~
Also put in one wicked cross in the end, should be taking our corners really instead of Di Maria.

1639~~~
He was asked to perform a number of roles today and did his duties admirably. He's like the glue in this side,  keeping it altogether at the moment.

1640~~~
We are definitely much better at keeping the ball because of him. Rarely puts a foot wrong and just gets the job done. Future captain material.

1641~~~
Maybe he speaks spanish and De Gea translates in English ??  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1642~~~
He's our seven out of ten every weekend, no matter where he plays. I really like this lad.

1643~~~
Considering he played slightly out of position, he played well again. He seems to have a commanding and calm air around him. Future captain, sure of that.

1644~~~
I think he needs to be more assertive in the mix-up with McNair. He was coming head onto the ball where as McNair was more sideways so he was positioned better to deal with it imo. He also left his man to go over there so I think he should be making sure he stopped that ball through even if it meant bulldozing over McNair. Other than that though he was good.

1645~~~
As usual did well, great player to have in the squad.

1646~~~
He's a very intelligent, tactical player. Perfect for what Van Gaal is trying to do. 

With the way prices are inflated nowadays we might end up looking at his signing as a steal.

1647~~~
He is proving to be a valuable and versatile player, isn't he? Seems like a consistent and reliable performer and an excellent signing at this early stage.

1648~~~
Who said Blind is slow? I saw him keep up with Frazer Campbell a few times and he thwarted him too!

1649~~~
Yeah, I think that was mostly his fault, but you can't complain too much when he's playing out of position, particularly alongside a very young partner.

1650~~~
Yeah he looked more assured at LCB than Rojo has this season. Infact Carrick looked good there too.

However, Palace were a bit shit.

1651~~~
Future captain in the making. Superb reader of the game.

1652~~~
Very good today (except for that foul-up with McNair, of course) but his ideal spot is in that space ahead of the backs IMO.

1653~~~
What he's shown so far is that there's never really an occasion where he shouldnt have a spot in the team. 

If we signed 2x £50 million CMs to play in a midfield 2, he should still be in the team somewhere else in a fullback or CB position

1654~~~
I'm going to say that he's the best crosser that the team has had in years. Is balls from the left are consistently excellent. Just watch him when he gets out wide.

1655~~~
the way he brought the ball out of defense was just a joy to watch. His decision making is fantastic too.

1656~~~
Would the potential signing of Strootman not put his place under threat? Especially is as it seems we are going to stick with 4-3-3.

1657~~~
Even if Strootman did come I'd have Blind as our best left sided defender.

1658~~~
He's good. Press him all you want, and he'll just move away, and calmly pass the ball to a team mate. The fact that he's not big like Toure and Matic will mean that he'll be massively underrated.

1659~~~
You mean CB? Surely he's not up to that long term, i'm not knocking the guy I'm just not sure if he's a long term starting player for United, especially if we get Strootman, and a top CB in finally.

1660~~~
Don't know. Very intelligent player, a bit slow but reads the game extremely well. Partnered by someone more physical and he'd be great.

1661~~~
Daley Blind is arguably one of your best players at the moment.

Funny, how during transfer rumours hardly anyone rated / wanted him.

People are often so clouded by prejudice over appearance / physical attributes, whilst overlooking essential attributes such as vision and intelligence.

1662~~~
Would Strootman even take his spot though? Doesn't he usually play with another DM beside him like De Rossi or De Jong?

1663~~~
That's the thing with him,  I just don't know either, like everyone says he reads the game well, and looks great alot of the time, but with 4-3-3 we will play only one other genuine CM, and we are apparently after Strootman still, so we would then have Herrera, Strootman, Carrick, Felliani, and even Di Maria for that one spot, which just confuses things with him long term for me.

1664~~~
Exactly, he'd be in contention with Herrera/Fellaini for a box-to-box central midfield spot.

1665~~~
Not sure tbh, but like I say above if not we would then have 3/4  players for that one other CM spot, which made me think he would be bought as a DM.

1666~~~
So 3 £28 Million +  players for one position, and arguably Di Maria is best through the middle too, then Blind's backup would be the aging Carrick, if so it makes me think Strootman would be a daft signing anytime soon.

1667~~~
For me, he's been our best player this season.

1668~~~
Yeah, but I'd hope that by signing Strootman we'd chuck Fellaini away, somewhere.

1669~~~
I thought this too.

1670~~~
I'd sooner sign a proper DM rather than Strootman, we need that type of player more.

As for Blind, he was good today but he should only ever play in defence (either CB or LB) in emergency situations. He's at his best in midfield and would likely be horribly exposed against a strong team. Palace were very poor today.

1671~~~
What a signing he has turned out to be. One of the cheapest and arguably one of the best out of the new recruits.

1672~~~
I'm really liking Blind. No fuss, does the simple things really well. He has to improve on a few things, but very happy with him.

1673~~~
He has been our best player this season IMO. In every game he has played really well. His top level isn't as good as Di Maria's and co, but he always gives a decent performance. A bargain signing.

1674~~~
He's making me re-think my position of signing a DM like Carvalho as one of our highest priorities.  

Guess I'll have to find a new propsect to advertise for.  Would have to be a CB, obviously...

1675~~~
If a few more were half as consistent as him, we'd be doing quite better.

1676~~~
I still remember when I was laughed off here when I said that Blind we'll play for us at CB at least few times...

1677~~~
Wouldn't want to see it happen again though. He is slow and not exactly tall. Sure he did an OK job against Palace, but that was basically because they didn't want to attack. Against any half decent team he would be in trouble.

1678~~~

1679~~~
Good news for him, he looks much better as a DM than a LB.

1680~~~
Scored a screamer for Holland last night.

1681~~~
I've heard it was a deflected strike though

1682~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OixrQu1E19a/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1683~~~
He likes shooting from midfield. We haven't had much of that in recent times.

1684~~~
What a hit! Deflected or otherwise, he gets some power behind that.

1685~~~
I think he was one of the few Dutch players that actually turned up last night. He has a fair distance shot in him doesn't he?

1686~~~
Always beautiful to see left footers crack one from distance

1687~~~
I remember saying when we signed him that he might end up being out cheapest but most important signing. Still early days of course, but a few months in and I'm still leaning towards that view. He's not flashy or spectacular but he's become a very important cog in our team and one of the first names on the teamsheet. 

On Sunday him and Carrick complimented each other perfectly. They were constantly swapping positions and Blind obviously felt more comfortable surging forwards knowing that Carrick was comfortable enough to fill in for him in defence and he didn't have to bust a gut to get back immediately, he could stay in midfield for a bit. 

He's been consistently good given all the chopping and changing going on every game.

1688~~~
Noticed it too and was very positive. Previously when Blind has pulled away his marker, who then becomes almost a second striker - the only option we have had - has been a forward pass which was only available when the AM also pulled his marker wide at the same time - so RVP could drop down in to free space and receive a pass.

When the AM and Blind didn't perfectly synchronize, we've instead resorted to just restarting the entire operation which has lead to a lot of static and pointless possession for our defenders - just rolling it back and forth until that option opens up. With Carrick or Blind as a centre back, it opens up another option which is brilliant as well.

Take the Chelsea game, Blind pulls Oscar to be a second striker - in which case the DM area is completely free and we have the option to just drive in to that area and instantly having done a good deal of penetration. With Carrick and Blind interchanging, or even Jones when he has the opportunities as his drive is an incredible tool to use - we'd just have a different level of build up.

Instead of just passing it side ways until we can find that really long pass up field centrally. I also think that as RVP's/the lone strikers tactical job is to drop in these occasions we need Januzaj and Di Maria or the CM's to make the run forward.

Too often RVP makes a run to receive the ball, and when he does we have a line of Di Maria-CM--RVP-CM-Januzaj which leads to nothing. Di Maria and Herrera when played in the diamond did that so brilliantly - they made the run forward when someone made a run deep so they were already at pace when RVP received it.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/30885/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/30885/dasdawawadYour-team-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/30885/dasdawawadYour-team-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

The times we did do it correctly, Blind and our defensive line were way too far from the midfield and offense in general so we had huge gaps which the opponents could use. If there is another player stepping up in to that space as soon as the the DM pulls away their marker - we'd look more tighter together with less space for the opponents to use if they win the ball back fast. One of the CB's should be recreating the triangle by pushing forward in to the space.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/30886/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/30886/dasdawawadYour-team-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/30886/dasdawawadYour-team-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

1689~~~
Doesnt make up for all their shite penalties tho, does it?

1690~~~
I sincerely hope that Blind does not play in centerback again for this game. Because the moment he plays two games in centerback in a row, he'll get injured .... we have a curse on our defence, I tell you ... <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1691~~~
Great, another injury.

1692~~~
Gone off injured after 18 mins

Ffs

1693~~~
Looks like it. He hasn't recovered from that challenge and is getting subbed.

1694~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> + <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> + <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Hopefully it is just a knock and nothing more.

1698~~~
you fecking what....

1699~~~
... WHAT

1700~~~
...

1701~~~
That makes 5 out of 6 of our signings that have been injured and it's already November. You're next Di Maria!

You just have to laugh. Laugh and angrily smash everything in a 2 metre radius.

1702~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82396, @Sied" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82396/">@Sied</a> was right......

1703~~~
We are cursed this season, without a doubt.

1704~~~
So with Carrick and presumably Blind injured, we're left with no fit holding midfielders. Excellent news.

1705~~~
It's every season really. With multiple different managers as well.

1706~~~
It can't be real.

1707~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The curse of the players that find themselves at centre-back for Manchester United <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

How bad did it look?

1708~~~
3 injuries on an international break.....

2 of them haven't even kicked a ball....

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1709~~~
Ain't watching it mate....Too busy getting angry over Bale's receding hairline

1710~~~
Christ, at this stage it'd be easier to make a thread to track players who <i>aren't </i>fecking injured.

1711~~~
Might have to start banning Internationals at this rate.. FFS

1712~~~
If this was football manager or Fifa you'd have switched the computer off and started again. The size of the injury list is just obscene.

1713~~~
Fletcher holding against Arsenal? Let's hope Blind's injury isn't serious.

1714~~~
That shouldn't have been so easy to call <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Am I right in saying every single player we have who can play defensively has now been injured at one point this season?

1715~~~
No Blackett is fine.

1716~~~
De Gea
Rafael
Jones
Evans
Rojo
Carrick
Blind
Lingard
Young
Falcao 

Those are the injured players....Pretty sure I'm missing someone

1717~~~
Beyond caring now.

1718~~~
Walked off apparently so fingers crossed it isn't anything to keep him out for a long time.

1719~~~

1720~~~
Just when you think our injury situation can't possibly get any more ridiculous.

1721~~~
Hate international football.

1722~~~
Came to this thread thinking he may have scored, who am i kidding?

1723~~~
Its a sad day when Flamini will be the best holding midfielder on the pitch.

1724~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The center back curse is real

1725~~~
When Keane done his knee in 1997, he came back on for a few mins and also hobbled/walked off......

1726~~~
I don't mean who's available at the minute. I mean have suffered an injury at some point this season. Blackett had some sort of small injury a month or 2 back didn't I? Or maybe I'm confusing it with his suspension.

1727~~~
Herrera could hold.

1728~~~
That's what i meant he hasn't been injured, he had cramps, i think.

1729~~~
I hate seen players thread being bumped these days. My first thought is that they are injured. 

Also every player we have sold/loaned out seems to be staying fit. Nani was injured for a huge amount of time the last two years and so far i dont think he has missed a game this season. Bizarre.

1730~~~
Probably the worst injury we ever got when it came to momentum, same with Rooney's ankle in 2010.

1731~~~
Oh right, well then give that lad a new contract! I don't care about footballing ability any more. I'm just impressed he can string a few games together.

1732~~~
Ah we done alright without him....Wasn't until Giggs and Pally got injured and Neville, Becks, Butt and Scholes had to play with injuries that the shit hit the fan that year.

My point was, Blind could have sprinted off, it's no indicator as to how bad/serious an injury is

1733~~~
That's a joke, isn't it? De Gea and Blind now. Other teams hope for players coming back after qualification games, our situation gets only worse and worse.

1734~~~
I think that all our players have been injured or had knocks except Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj.

1735~~~
Anderson has been waiting for his chance.

1736~~~
Van Persie was too tired to play at the start of the season. Does that count?

1737~~~
FFS!

1738~~~
I am hoping this is not serious and Carrick is fit to play vs Arsenal, just in case. Fletcher it is otherwise.

1739~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1740~~~
Its Fletcher and Ando time.

1741~~~
sh1tebag guy fell on Blind for no reason

1742~~~
Joke post right?

1743~~~
This is a joke now.

1744~~~
FFS, enough with all these injuries. It's getting beyond ridiculous.

1745~~~
Right so now we have 2 players who were very rarely injured at their previous clubs and are now injured at United. LVG is a fecking dinosaur man who spends too much time on fitness <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1746~~~
Not really. He has in the past.

1747~~~
As soon as I see a "Player X 2014-2015 Performances" thread at the top of the forum now, I know what to expect.  Insane situation.

1748~~~
Are you fecking kidding me? 

I hate internationals so much.

1749~~~
I think I'm free to travel to London to play next Saturday. Anyone else available?

1750~~~
We may as well close down old trafford, and just open up a hospital in the grounds for injured United players

FFS, and then people complain about LVG having less points than Moyes, this injury thing is an absolute joke, have we ever had this many injuries in our history?

1751~~~
This season is fecked. There was some voodoo, Indian burial shit when that new turf went down. Either that or Fergie sold his soul at the cross roads<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

1752~~~
Another injury eh?

fecking Moyes and his training regime.

1753~~~
Anyone see the match? Did it look serious?

1754~~~
Injuries are all part and parcel of the game. I mean look at Chelsea with, erm, um....

1755~~~
It takes over the whole freaking game for us it seems.

1756~~~
Diego Costa?

1757~~~
It's from 12th November.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://injuryleague.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/141112.jpg" src="http://injuryleague.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/141112.jpg"/>

What is the case with Newcastle?

1758~~~

1759~~~
feck, feck, feck...

1760~~~
Oh feck off.

1761~~~
Oh, ffs.

1762~~~

1763~~~
What a clusterfeck this season is. Nothing LvG can do with this shit heaped on him.

1764~~~
Un-fecking-believable <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1765~~~
For heavens sake. This is not fair.

1766~~~
Possibly out for the season?

1767~~~
How does Custis know that, surely he's jumping the gun.

1768~~~
fecking unbelievable.

1769~~~
Arghh ...

1770~~~
He could be, but lets just say he won't play against Arsenal. If it is ligament damage then it's not good.

1771~~~
Yea rest of the season must be speculation. Probably just basing it on the fact it's ligament damage to claw in the retweets.

1772~~~
We are good for the top 4.

1773~~~
FCUK this is so infuriating. Definitely will buy in January now

1774~~~
what the f'ck, I was coming here to moan he's out for a game or 2..but all season!?

FARRRRKKKKK.

The jinx of playing centre back, eve for a game or two!

1775~~~
Hiddink said maybe knee ligaments strain, maybe tear. Hopefully just a strain, or else we are fecked.

1776~~~
Ruptured?! feck off...

1777~~~
Next!.... if true then...ah feck it <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1778~~~
Feel sorry for him. First season here, playing well and then this happens.

1779~~~
fecking ridiculous this.

1780~~~
I have never believed in luck but can we stop having the next 5 games and our best players so far threads from now on <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1781~~~
Oh feck! He has been one of our top 3/4 performers this season. We will miss him. It is a shame as Herrera is just coming back and I was looking forward to seeing them together again.

At least Carrick is back for now.

1782~~~
He left the England camp with an injury, so don't count your chickens yet.

1783~~~
There is a pattern tho,some building teams/play from the back and we are doing the same with injuries now,central midfielders are next.

1784~~~
He's playing the worst case scenario game.

They did the same for Costa saying he was out for 3-4 weeks, and played the next game.

Baines was out for 3-4weeks, and now is likely to play next game etc.

Let's hope so!!

If we end up plahing Fellaini and Fletcher a lot, or worse still call Cleverley back, we're never getting top 4

1785~~~
Twisted and ruptured ligaments. Astonishing.

1786~~~
Fecking international break.

1787~~~
Worst case scenario, he's out for the season.....
Best case scenario?....2-3 months, IF he hasn't damaged it too much.

Either way, we may kiss our 4th place goodbye right now...No way we will get it if this sort of shit continues

1788~~~
F*cks sake. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Probably our best player since the start of the season.

1789~~~
with Herrera, Carrick, Fellaini and di Maria to choose from in midfield it is not a disaster. As long as we get Blind back soon....

1790~~~

1791~~~
Don't forget Fletcher and Ando...

1792~~~
It's all guessing game at the moment. Let's wait for official or more concrete news. Hiddink said that "it could be just strain or it could be tear which will be a blow." Even he doesn't know full extent yet idiots like Cuntis are making up stories and people are reacting to it.

1793~~~
Not as bad as I thought, phew. He'll still be missed though.

1794~~~
Not a rest of the season job, but not great.

1795~~~
Good. He'll be back in time to injure himself during the FA Cup 3rd round.

1796~~~
Oh fecking piss off.

1797~~~
Rest of the year.

1798~~~
How can anyone know that this quickly? Surely he'll need scans before we know for sure?

1799~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Arsenal away
Hull Home
Stoke Home
Southampton Away
Liverpool Home

In the next four weeks.

1800~~~

1801~~~
Now it's time for Pereira, Pearson or any youngster to step up.

1802~~~
That's what I was wondering about.

1803~~~
How is it possible to know the extent of the injury so soon?

1804~~~

1805~~~
Disappointing, I've liked what I've seen so far. Thankfully those "out for the season" reports seem to be false. Still 4 to 6 weeks is significant, especially at this time of the year and with Carrick out too. These injuries are so frustrating. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1806~~~
Aaaah! Still not good, that takes in the Christmas period at worst and of course he has our medical staff looking after him.

1807~~~
Official club account saying "possible thigh injury." <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1808~~~
Torn knee ligament, yet only 4-6 weeks? Wouldn't it be closer to 4-6 months if his knee ligaments were torn? Way too soon to know the extent of the injury anyways, theyre probably guessing. We'll find out more in the next few days probably.

1809~~~
Thigh injury, they didn't watch the game then?

1810~~~
Do we even have 11 first team players that are fit now?

1811~~~
Noooooooo <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1812~~~
Oh feck off.

1813~~~
I don't think they do.

1814~~~
FFS yet more injuries, will this nightmare ever end.

1815~~~
They're saying he did his knee ligaments. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1816~~~
If we were actually doing well I'd be furious but the fact that we're shit and piling up more and more injuries its gone to the point of being comical <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1817~~~
Who ?

1818~~~
ITV official twitter account quoting Dutch TV.

1819~~~
I really don't think we're going to catch a break this season. It seems like as soon as one player returns from injury, we have another one, or even two, taking his place!

1820~~~
From twitter ..

Confirmed by Dutch television station NOS: Daley Blind has torn his knee ligament. He'll be sidelined for 4 to 6 weeks.

1821~~~
Nah, Herrera can come back in.

1822~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1823~~~
Without maybe Carrick and Blind there is an opportunity. And even if Carrick plays he is a contender for the CB position.

1824~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://nos.nl/data/teletekst/gif/P804_01.gif?v=1416169100" src="http://nos.nl/data/teletekst/gif/P804_01.gif?v=1416169100"/>

From NOS.  At Least a month. Initial diagnosis is a tear in the knee

1825~~~
Do they still use Teletext in the Netherlands instead of the internet or what???

1826~~~
Wow, is that teletext? I still remember when I read on Eurosport's teletext that Ramsey signed for United. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1827~~~
This is ridiculous. Devastated!

1828~~~
feck fecking feck feck.

1829~~~
Since i'm a positive person, i need to say that it is at least 4 to 6 weeks but it could be 4 to 6 months, at the moment they only know that his knee is damaged.

1830~~~
Depends on which ligament. Full ACL tear? Yeah, you're looking at 6 months minimum (possibly more). Minor MCL tear? 2 months at the most typically. The word "tear" is fairly vague. It's the complete tears, where the ligament is entirely severed, that require surgery and long recovery times. "Tear" can also mean the ligament is only partially severed (seems to be the case with Daley), which in some cases can heal on its own or with minor surgery. Either way though, the recovery isn't nearly as lengthy.

1831~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1832~~~
Fecking raging.

We're screwed against Arsenal. No back line and no decent screening midfielders.

1833~~~
So is that everybody injured now or do we still have someone functioning?

1834~~~
Wasn't Carrick's groin not meant to be that serious? We need him now more than ever..

1835~~~
feck this shit man!

1836~~~
Thats why we need a big squad with dependable players. Injury prone players + has beens such as Fletch and Ando need to go

1837~~~
Same..

1838~~~
Fletcher back in the starting 11 <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1839~~~
Unfortunately the lack of europe has meant us trimming the squad. I think Fletch and Ando will be gone. If by some luck we do get europe we will seriously need to build this squad up. Rafael, Jones and Evans will be wetting themselves if they don't get fit soon and stay fit.

1840~~~
Nooooooooo!

1841~~~
The international break can feck off. No good has ever come of a mid-season international break.

1842~~~
Light the Anderson signal

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://d2tq98mqfjyz2l.cloudfront.net/image_cache/1282512473941341.png" src="http://d2tq98mqfjyz2l.cloudfront.net/image_cache/1282512473941341.png"/>

1843~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1844~~~
Fantastic...

Sadly, Fletcher is a complete passenger these days.

1845~~~
Calm down, Carrick will be fit. His 'injury' was reported to be very very minor, mostly left out as a precaution.

So we should still be able to field a midfield trio of Carrick, Herrera and Di Maria, which looks alright to me.

1846~~~
Unbelievable, even the best case scenario means he likely wont play again until the new year. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1847~~~
I hope so. Many reports I've read seem to imply he'll be out against Arsenal.

1848~~~
Lindigard
Val..Smalling..Mcnair..Shaw/is he fit
Januzaj..Fellani..Fletcher..Di Maria
Rooney..RvP

I'm sure not all of them are fit and look at that midfield <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1849~~~
The problem!!!

Di Maria and others have another games on Monday/Tuesday + we're having more training sessions

I mean this tweet says everything about our season

1850~~~
If it makes anyone feel any better, Vidal got injured for Chile the other day.

Clearly getting into the groove of things for when we come knocking in January

1851~~~
Let's just pretend Carrick will be 100% fit and ready for Arsenal.

1852~~~
Three international breaks in 9 or 10 weeks is bloody ridiculous.

1853~~~
Bloody brilliant.

1854~~~
I'm laughing now, genuinely just don't know what to say anymore.... wow.

1855~~~
feck international football is all I have to say.

1856~~~
Typical. So damn annoying.

1857~~~
It really is.

1858~~~
Cue Carrick, Fellaini and Fletcher as our midfield on the day

1859~~~
That would be a nightmare.

1860~~~
FFS Sky are reporting out for the rest of the season.

BREAKING NEWS: Daley Blind set to miss the rest of the season through injury. More to follow.

1861~~~
You're trolling right?

1862~~~
Bummer

1863~~~
I fear finishing fourth now. Just too many fecking injuries and no matter how good a team you got, when half of the players are unavailable at any given time, then there's not much you can do.

Our injury record is worse than Arsenal and that's criminal.

1864~~~
just posting what I read on twitter from Sky Sports News.

1865~~~
They aren't saying anything at the moment. Don't wind us up, we are in a state of mass hysteria already.

1866~~~
TeamTalk (which is a site run by Sky Sports) are saying "possibly lengthy layoff" but no timescale.

Hiddink said "I'm rather negative. I think it's a medial ligament that is twisted. It might be a rupture."

1867~~~
In Paul's defence, their reporting it as a 'long lay-off' on the website.

1868~~~
I am not winding up , something I would never do, I only copied what I was reading at the time.

1869~~~
What the actual f*ck is up with us and injuries this season. Absolute joke. Our midfield should be erm, interesting against Arsenal.

1870~~~
Nothing wrong with that.

1871~~~
Same shit, different player. It's a blow but there'll be plenty more.

1872~~~
Bloody hell. This is madness. What can we do to catch a break here!?

1873~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1874~~~
Cheers , but really the message I copied was the one on Twitter, does not help that they took it off making me look like a right twat. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1875~~~
That's a fake sky sports account.

1876~~~
Well except for the fact that Fletcher is not up to it anymore and Carrick has barely played this season.

1877~~~
really , I did not know that , only been on Twitter a few days, feel like a right dick now.

1878~~~
Asking for a 'break' right now probably isn't a good idea. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1879~~~
Oh ffs

1880~~~
happy with last season were you? theres a reason we spent so much on cms

1881~~~
Another huge blow. Need Strootman this january.

1882~~~
If he's torn his knee ligaments then he won't be back training for at least two months.  I'm riddled with knee ligament injuries and there is no way they heal in just 4-6 weeks!

1883~~~
Ha, good one.

No more injured players.

1884~~~
F*cking typical - Blind has been one of our best players this season.

Hope he can come back ASAP and put in the same performances after his injury.

We're screwed for top 4 if these injuries carry on.

1885~~~
We will need to spend big money in January

1886~~~
feck this shit... so typical, though.

Blind is such an important piece to our puzzle in linking our defense to attack so this is troubling. I hope Carrick can do the job meanwhile.

1887~~~
We're so seriously f*cked for the Arsenal game that it's not even funny. Right now our line up is looking like this...

Lindegaard, Valencia, McNair, Blackett, Shaw, Fellaini, Fletcher, Mata, Di Maria, Rooney, Van Persie.

Actually, I guess it could be worse. We're just going to have score 3-4 goals to win. And who knows, with the carousel that has been our back 4 this year, this group might do the best yet! Fletcher starting a game scared the sh*t out of me though. Especially with Fellaini. What a frightening midfield pairing that is! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hopefully Herrera will play instead of Fletcher!

1888~~~
Why no Herrera in that lineup? And is Carrick injured? If so, then things are looking very bad...

1889~~~
Add in De Gea, Rafael, Falcao and Smalling who all should be fit, possibly Carrick?

1890~~~
Bullshit.

1891~~~
It's a good job that we bought some players this summer that's all I can say otherwise we would be in danger of getting a hiding in our next game. As it stands things still don't actually look catastrophic by any means just yet. As long as Herrera plays. I don't think I could physically stomach watching Fletcher & Fellaini for 90 minutes. 

Up front we've still got all the firepower needed to bang in a few goals. But we're still waiting see those three click together because right now it's just not happening and that's what I'm worried about for the Arsenal game. Not just our defence, but our lack of goals.

1892~~~
fecking hell rumors ranging to fin being out 3 to 4 weeks to it being season ending.    We are done for the year no way we get top 4 with this crap happening every single day.

1893~~~
De Gea won't be fit. There's no way Falcao will start or even feature at all by the sounds of the concerns over his knee. Carrick maybe but it's not looking likely right now. Rafael has returned to training. But he can damage himself just by being awake so who knows.

1894~~~
Smalling is back, he only got a 1 game ban.

1895~~~
Hmm, well that is something. Although after the derby, I'm not sure I trust him to come straight back into the team.

1896~~~
I guess LVG should sign at least 10 bloody players last summer to have a normally functioning football team.

What a farce.

1897~~~
Midfield of Carrick, and Herrera is a better bet than Blind, and Fellaini, so could see an upturn in our performances if we can get and keep those two fit.

1898~~~
Fecking knee injury. I fear he comes back as Owen Hargreaves...
On a more positive note, I'm looking forward to having Carrick back in his role. He offers us a lot more penetration in his passing, which is what we've been lacking lately.

1899~~~
No we don't.

1900~~~
F*cking f*ck f*ck sh*t w*nk

1901~~~
Aye you're right January is no time to spend big, we'll only end up buying over priced rubbish, better to see it out and get the right players in the summer.

1902~~~
umm, Smalling, Herrera are fit. Rafael is back in training already for few days now and Carrick can be fit too. Evans can be fit I guess but I am assuming Smalling will start ahead of him.

Arsenal's defense itself is hardly in good shape and with Koscielny and Debuchy out, they have their own worries, so yeah it might end up a high scoring game and who defends less badly.

1903~~~
This. Oh and cnut

1904~~~
Umm... Can I pass you a tissue?

1905~~~
More like
Lindegaard, Rafa, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw, Carrick, Herrara, DiMaria, Mata, Rooney, Van Persie. 
That is a very solid line up, not sure what all the panic is about. It's not like we play more than 1 game a week.

1906~~~
Typical. Fecking typical. Our best player this season <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1907~~~
I don't trust Smalling after the derby. Everyone can make a mistake. But not 2 completey boneheaded decisions in 5 minutes. And I'm more worried about our defence because of our attack. We're not scoring enough goals and our star front 3 just haven't clicked yet so it's not like we can rely on our attack for goals. It could be worse though, as I said, at least we signed some players this summer.

1908~~~
Some reports saying 4-6 weeks while others claim he's out for the entire season. That's a pretty significant leap. 

PS: Feck off. What the feck is going on with us?

1909~~~
It was a derby so emotions were flying high and rational decision making was not there. It's not like that boneheaded decision making is part of Smalling's game usually, so he will definitely come out stronger after that. Arsenal are wank in defence, all we will have to do is have a go at them and tear them to shreds. Our midfield will take care of the defending against them. Also, reports say DDG will be good for this game anyway, so that's reassuring.

1910~~~

1911~~~
We're truly cursed. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

I reckon Daley was set to play left centre back against Arsenal too. I guess it'll now be Blackett, possibly partnered with Smalling at right centre back.

1912~~~
F'n Hell. What a nightmare season for injuries.

1913~~~
But at least his dad says he's out only for a few weeks and not the whole season

1914~~~
I'll take 4-6 weeks after hearing rumours of "season ending" etc, I watched the game, it didn't seem so bad, he even played on with it for a short while so season ending seemed a bit odd to hear.

1915~~~
I genuinely fecking give up. The worst bit about all these injuries is that they won't be mentioned by the media when talking of Van Gaal "struggling". 

Of course he's fecking struggling he doesn't have a squad to pick from.

1916~~~
Gutted for him, he had settled into the Utd team and was playing well...then this happens, such a shame for him.

I hate knee! injuries the most!

1917~~~
Exactly! Everyone on the cafe should take note too, expectations should be lowered in all honesty.

1918~~~
I will be surprised if he comes back before the holiday fixtures.

1919~~~
It just isn't possible to pick a consistent team which is a big deal, especially when you are trying to incorporate new tactical ideas. It's like a bloody sunday league situation at the moment, where you just wait and see who didn't get too shitfaced the night before and actually shows up.

1920~~~
That is what you get for playing CB for United...

Hope he will recover soon, it is a shame for United and for him because he was one of the most consistent performers on the pitch and the first name in the starting 11. I just hope he will find the same form after the injury.

1921~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's true though!

1922~~~
Welp...that's all I can say here.

He's been so important for this season. I just hope that he isn't that dearly missed in the next few matches.

1923~~~
Just stop them training and have them playing wrapped in bubblewrap.

1924~~~
I wonder if the 4-6 weeks is for him to return to training as opposed to returning to playing, as that seems really short for a ligament tear.

1925~~~
By our standards 4-6 weeks is actually positive.

1926~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's just sad isn't it...

1927~~~
Just read through the last few pages and am absolutely shattered for Daley. He's made a pretty good start to his career for us and this happens. I guess it's not as bad as it could have been if it is 4-6 weeks, but still, it leaves us in a bad situation especially if Carrick is out too. I'm not sure I can handle Fletcher in midfield again <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. 

These injuries are beyond even being funny to me now. I cannot believe how unlucky we have been. They will probably cost us a top 4 spot.

1928~~~
Blind was my favourite player.
I also think that he is our best outfield player.
With him injured, this is a MASSIVE blow to us.
Some people are suggesting that we shouldnt buy heavy in January. I think we should. I think we should buy some squad players, so that as each player gets injured another will be available to take his place.

1929~~~
Any good physio's up for sale in January?

1930~~~
You're looking for negatives. Smalling was very solid against Chelsea, the best team in the league, and that was his first game back and lacking match fitness. Even outperformed and saved Rojo a few times.

1931~~~
The media's not accounting for these injuries when critiquing LVG is worse than the actual effect they'll have on our team? Strange...

1932~~~
Oh, van Gaal will see Mertesacker and be in a good mood... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

Mertesacker's mistakes gave Bayern the first two goals in the Cup final in 2010...

1933~~~
Yeah I <b>literally </b>mean that that is the worst bit.

1934~~~
At this rate van Gaal will be playing soon.

1935~~~
Yeah, bit of an asshole post - sorry about that. But honestly, who cares what gimps like Jamie Jackson and Craig Burley think?

1936~~~
Of feck off.

1937~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1938~~~
Ffs...

1939~~~
I knew it. I just fecking knew it. The moment he slotted into that cursed centerback position ... It was only a matter of time before he too gets injured. Knee ligaments, at that. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> 

This is so frustrating.

1940~~~
Leave it to our medical staff. He'll be lucky if he ever plays again.

1941~~~
If Arsenal play high line then <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1942~~~
Forgive me if I'm late to this fellas, but here goes...OH FOR feck'S SAKES.

1943~~~
The squad players will get injured also.

1944~~~
Are.you.fecking.kidding.me. 

What the hell's going on at training?? Do we have them engaging in mortal combat with each other?? Maybe we should draw 11 players from the Caf since it looks like even the coaching staff are going to get injured too <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1945~~~
You get injured
I get injured
EVERYONE GETS INJURED!

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1946~~~
Maybe our medical staff are so good that they can find injuries that other clubs can't.
I suppose van Gaal is famous for promoting youth. He doesn't have much choice now.

1947~~~
Why did he have to play as a defender for us? That's like blood in the water for the injury sharks. I blame Van Gaal for not knowing this.

Jobs safer than playing center back for MUFC:
-polar bear photographer
-Sherpa
-cleaning skyscraper windows
-bareknuckle boxing
-Spinal Tap drummer

1948~~~
This. This! <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1949~~~
Who can he promote who's ready to be promoted? Of the players is United's first team,  Fletcher isn't up to it, Herrera doesn't strike me as a holding mid ditto Fellaini.

1950~~~
For the holding mid role? Pearson, Thorpe or Reece James can all play there but doubt we'll see any. I don't think Carrick's injury is too serious though and expect we'll see him.

1951~~~
What if its 4-6 Garry Neville weeks??

1952~~~
Fe.kin hell....<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1953~~~
If we have any members here who know any form of voodoo, now's the time to make yourself useful.

Whatever spell it takes to break this curse, please do it!!

1954~~~
If we don't then we can safely kiss 4th place goodbye. You can't win without having players around.

1955~~~
We could offer opposition players the chance to be a United player for a day and stick them in our defence. When they inevitably get injured it will level the playing field a little.

1956~~~
No chance he's back within 6  weeks even if it's not a rupture. It was a bad enough sprain to leave him hobbling a little bit.

1957~~~
Human sacrifice. Anderson. Checking Edit...

1958~~~
Don't you get the impression that injuries get underestimated? I agree that it will likely be longer. I would rather be given an longer timescale, so it is a pleasant surprise when they come back earlier. Instead we are expecting players back and their injuries appear to drag on and on.

1959~~~
It won't matter cause he would get injured immediately.

1960~~~
Hopefully thats true, i wouldn't get too carried away about the return date until you hear it from the Dutch camp.

1961~~~
Has there been confirmation of the injury? 4-6 weeks sounds rather optimistic if its ligament damage... Absolutely gutting but got to hope Carrick can recover for Arsenal

1962~~~
Well I hope you don't get caught by police before you finish the ceremony. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1963~~~
We'll be ok IF the others stay fit. He's a cog that can be replaced. He's not that influential to the way we play or at least his influence could be replicated.

1964~~~
It's a disaster, no two ways about it, but I hope Van Gaal promotes Thorpe/Pearson because I have no faith in Fletcher/Anderson stepping up. These injuries will confine our season tp write off status before the January window.

1965~~~
As long as we don't play them as emergency defenders!

1966~~~
I agree. I really hope that Thorpe or Pearson gets a chance as the holding midfielder

1967~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Gary Neville will now figure out how important Blind has been to our team

1968~~~
wow, LVG has said a number of days ago he's never experienced injuries of this scale....bet he just can't believe this. He's having one hand tied behind his back at the moment, feel sorry for him...

1969~~~
Yep his Dad confirmed it on dutch TV I believe. I guess a scan at hospital needs to be performed first, for a concrete evaluation though.

1970~~~
Gutted for him. He's been our most consistent player this year. We'll miss him a lot.

1971~~~
Don't have the energy to feel gutted anymore, just kinda surprised it took this long for him to get injured. Out of all our new players, who hasn't gotten injured yet ?

1972~~~
Di Maria <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1973~~~
Don't worry, he hasn't played in defence yet. He'll get injured if LvG even dreams of going to 352 with him as wingback

1974~~~
And even he has had some injury scares already. 

Do we just love buying injury prone players or what?

1975~~~
This is a horrendous season for injuries this is why we won't finish in the top four.

1976~~~
This is ridiculous. Our entire midfield is injured

1977~~~

1978~~~
He's been one of our best this season. And lets be honest, the others won't stay fit.

1979~~~
What the frig else can go wrong?

1980~~~
Too early to call but if we don't it will also largely be due to our squad simply not having enough strength in depth. That's what squads are largely for, to cope with these periods of first teamers in the physio room, and to enable the rest and rotation of them when fit.

It's not just the gaps in our first XI that need sorting.

1981~~~
Januzaj and Mata possibly I think?
I don't know, I'm so fecked off right now.

1982~~~
What's wrong with those two, not putting the effort in. They should have had at least one injury.<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1983~~~
What's especially disappointing is that he's been one of the players who's been really good every time he's been on the pitch. Hasn't had a bad game.

Same is true of Rafa, who's been brilliant in every game he's played, but then we've come to expect injuries from him.

1984~~~
If Di Maria gets injured and this Blind injury turns out serious I give up on football.

1985~~~
Leicester away?

1986~~~
Still at least this season we have a midfield to get injured... I mean could be a whole lot worse

1987~~~
Rafael was great that match. But for you that is probably his fault that blind man was a referee? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1988~~~
I can see us managing with Carrick in Blind's place but I don't see how we can shelter the defenders with both of them injured.  It would leave the back completely exposed.  The only player I can think of who might have filled that role in the past was Fletcher and he is past it.

1989~~~
Beyond ridiculous now, here's who's out

-----------De Gea------------
Rafael--Jones--Evans--Rojo
Lingard--Carrick--Blind--Young
---------OG-----Falcao----------

1990~~~
Definitely missed that guy. He was prolific.

1991~~~
The general line seems to be that its a 4-6 week injury.

So factor in our medical team, and I look forward to Blind's return just in time for pre-season.

1992~~~

1993~~~
Jamie Jackson hasn't a clue.

1994~~~
Better not be true.

1995~~~
The idiots in the media have actually labelled him 'the new tinkerman' as if he's just changing the defence every game because he thinks it's funny.

1996~~~
Do you work in PR? That's a very positive spin!

1997~~~
To be fair, it <i>could </i>be whole lot worse. 

We have an injury crisis but can field a midfield of Fellaini, Herrera and Di Maria.

Compare that to when we played a title decider (almost) against City a few years ago and had to play - was it Park and Giggs?

1998~~~
I have more faith in Park and Giggs with Ferguson on the touchline than Fellaini, Herrera and Di Maria with Van Gaal.

1999~~~
I had a lot of faith in SAF but in that game I had zero confidence, which proved to be the correct amount of confidence to have. 

Whereas I have high confidence those three can take care of the midfield against Arsenal. Not as high as if Blind and Carrick were available. But clearly the mismatch is much smaller.

2000~~~
No disrespect, but that's a bit silly. Especially in the context where City's midfield was at its peak, Giggs was on his last legs and kept giving lacklustre CM performances... I don't really like Fellaini but he's in good form, and Herrera and Di Maria (especially the latter) are top players.

2001~~~
I said "faith", i know i'm wrong.

2002~~~
Ah ok. Sorry then, misunderstood you.

2003~~~
I wish more religious people I know used the word "faith" like you do <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a>. Most of them seem to have this notion that faith and belief are interchangeable.

2004~~~
Any news then? Thought he was having a scan on his knee Monday? I'm fearing the worse.
Been a stand out player for us this season.

2005~~~
12 injuries in total for us ffs.

2006~~~
Don't think we'll hear anything till the presser - just hope it's not "he has a knock" and then we are left to wonder.

2007~~~
His twitter following is up 72% if that's what you mean?

Oh, and the Dutch press reckon Blind's Dad has said 4-6 weeks. Medial ligament tear.

2008~~~
Gutted for the lad, one bright spark this season.

2009~~~
Daley Blind's dad stated this immediately after the injury, without any scans.
He is not a doctor, so I dont trust his assessment.
We need to hear information from a Man Utd official.

2010~~~
Pretty sure he said he had a lot of water around the knee, and will need to wait for that to settle down before any scans will reveal the damage.

2011~~~
Could be out for six months according to LvG <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2012~~~
6 fecking months!

2013~~~
Big loss <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2014~~~
Awful luck, he was doing so well.

2015~~~
feck

2016~~~
We have to go out and buy in January, we just have to.

2017~~~
You gotta be kiddin me. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Arguably our best signing out for the whole season, feck off just feck off.

2018~~~
To be fair, it's potentially out for upto 6 months. Sounds like we'll know more in a few weeks.

2019~~~
fecking ridiculous. So infuriating.

2020~~~
Sick. I think he's been brilliant. We'll have to sign Strootman in January now.

2021~~~
Terrible news. Carrick has to be fit now.

2022~~~
My heart just dropped when I read that on BBC website.  Absolutely gutted, he was really settling well and looking like a great addition.  Up to the rest of the squad to come in and do the business now.  Just got to pray that the diagnosis has been exaggerated and we may see him again this season.

2023~~~
Awful news.

2024~~~
feck you world.

2025~~~
That is horrendous. Possibly the best signing LVG has made.

2026~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2027~~~
Come on Fletcher.

2028~~~
Frick sake!

2029~~~
His dodgy English has come into play. Helen Evans just said it won't be 6 months as first reported, that's what Van Gaal was trying to say.

2030~~~
Well thank feck for that.

2031~~~
Praise the Lord!

2032~~~
10 days apparently. Scans are fairly useless immediately after a knee injury. They need to wait for all the swelling to go down.

Van Gaal is probably being a bit pessimistic by talking up the worst case scenario but - with the season that's in it - who can blame him?!

2033~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://mtc.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/F507629E001147250121818419200_3357041b78a.0.1.14092624766541274019.mp4?versionId=28bd1kn3YpuE7KJHEJ0RJ6mbXkz7m7OB" target="_blank">https://mtc.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/F5...p4?versionId=28bd1kn3YpuE7KJHEJ0RJ6mbXkz7m7OB</a>

2034~~~
Our inspiration and not at all confusing new leader. With such a coherent communicator in charge you have to wonder why our team has looked so muddled so far this season?

2035~~~
Horrible for him personally and a blow to the team, <b>but </b>this doesn't really instill me with pessimism. He's done a good job and would probably be a regular starter the rest of the season, but we do have Carrick as well. <b>If</b> he stays fit and plays at half the level he did during his super season, Blind shouldn't be a too big loss. A big "if", though.

2036~~~
You're pulling at my heart strings, Louis!

2037~~~
Thank feck we have enough midfielders now to cover up the injuries.

2038~~~
The above video suggests he was very clear in fact. Blame the dodgy journos for the announcement.

2039~~~
Just when we thought we found a proper holding midfielder for once. Well, its back to sink or swim with Michael Carrick.

2040~~~
Change the thread title back?

2041~~~
Any chance to jump on LVG eh? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The ultimate Moyes apologist.

2042~~~
Ah. Only just saw that. yes. Journos 100% to blame. Spackers.

2043~~~
Thank feck, the thread title almost gave me a heart attack!

2044~~~
Aye, because having a history of defending one under-performing Manchester United manager means I'm chomping at the bit to attack the next one.

You haven't really thought that through, have you?

2045~~~
Same as the way everyone who got on Moyes' back early are now doing the same to LVG?

Just because you defended one doesn't mean you're certainly going to defend the next, and vice versa.

2046~~~
"Blind is not ready to play. He has now a brace on his knee, 10 days' rest, then we have to make another scan and we can say more about his injury. It's not so bad as the doctors are thinking after the match, but it shall be a long story, I believe, but not six months or something."

According to the transcript on the United website.

2047~~~
You've been attacking LVG at every opportunity so far this season, taking constant little digs at him.

Strange really, you spent 3/4 of last season defending Moyes and yet 10 games into this season and you've been all over LVG.

2048~~~
Not sure if that's a rhetorical question?

But yes, a lot of the people on here who were quick to get on Moyes case have been quick to complain about Van Gaal too.

2049~~~
What an absolute farce.

2050~~~
Not that worried about Blind, with Carrick and Herrera on the way back we'll manage fine I guess.

2051~~~
Keep going to the first page of this thread

Where it mentions his injury in the thread title and the first post is then

"Welcome to Manchester United"<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2052~~~
Thank you. Seems pretty clear to me.

2053~~~
Well this thread is a roller coaster!

2054~~~
It's really not strange at all, if you think about it. This thread isn't about me but feck it, might as well clear this up once again before letting things get back on topic.

Anyone (like me) who believes a new manager needs time will be consistent in this approach. Hence, you won't find a single post from me on here anywhere suggesting Van Gaal isn't up to the task or should be sacked. Obviously, the fact we've had our worst start in decades means the jury is still out but would be madness to write him off this early.

Regarding criticism of his tenure so far, the fact he spent so much money in the summer means we should probably expect a bit more from the team at this stage than we saw under Moyes last season (as opposed to the reality, when our results are actually worse) Also, you have to bear in mind that the reason a lot of people stuck with Moyes for longer than seemed sensible was because they had utmost faith in Fergie's decision. Something we will have learned to do as fans of the club throughout Fergie's time in charge. Obviously, this no longer applies. So it stands to reason Van Gaal won't get the same unswerving loyalty from fans who backed Moyes on the basis that Fergie always knows best.

Hope that clears things up but you really should have been able to work this all out for yourself.

2055~~~
Wow! An agenda nicely inside a little bit of irony.

2056~~~
Haha

2057~~~
Dont like the sound of that.

2058~~~
Mmmm. Not 6 months isn't necessarily good news. 3 or 4 months out will mean him missing a hell of a lot of important games.

2059~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/79161000/jpg/_79161679_mutweet.jpg" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/79161000/jpg/_79161679_mutweet.jpg"/> 

How was that allowed to be posted? What clown runs our twitter account?

2060~~~
Not in anywhere near the same proportions. Van Gaal has pedigree so the caf en masse is making an obvious allowance for his bad start. No one is even panicking at all yet. Compare that to Moyes after the consecutive home losses to Everton, Newcastle and WBA last season.

2061~~~
It's not even live which makes it even worse.

2062~~~
For sure. Although those results were much deeper into the season, so it was fair enough that people ran out of patience.

I'm just disagreeing with the idea that you can group people into "Pro Moyes/Anti Van Gaal" vs "Pro Van Gaal/Anti Moyes" camps. A much more realistic split would be "patient" vs "impatient"

2063~~~
It just shows our state when "not going to be 6 months" is a positive.

2064~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> 

I was watching the match live when the injury occurred. Does the fact he walked off the pitch pretty comfortably might suggest the injury is not as bad as it's being made out in some quarters?

2065~~~
Even that's a little black and white. There seems to be a continuum from "patient, trusts SAF optimist" to "impatient pessimist" with the importance of each factor varying from individual to individual. Unfortunately the negative end of the spectrum tends to be populated by people who are very black and white. It's a little like the situation 3 or 4 years ago where, if you didn't "Hate Glazer" with sufficient venom, you were automatically labelled a "Glazer lover". Haters tend not to see grey.

2066~~~
Afraid not, Sults. Do you remember when Heinze did his ACL? He actually played on for a good few minutes. It's possible to completely rupture a knee ligament without much pain. Apparently partial tears are more likely to cause extreme pain.

Not my own experience, mind you. I was in fecking <b>agony</b> when I did mine.

2067~~~
I think you need to draw a Venn Diagram! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2068~~~
How long is he out for then?

2069~~~
Van Gaal can't really say how long he'll be out for.

2070~~~
Cheers!

Blind was a player I wanted to see pair up with Carrick and Herrera as a midfield 3, especially against top teams. I reckon the pair as holding midfielders would have been perfect.

2071~~~
Oh God no.

On ACLs - mine was painless (I kind of exploded it when I skied into a cast iron pipe going a little too fast) except that, until I got it fixed, every now and then the loose end would get pinched between the tibia and the femur - that was a microsecond of 11 on the 10 point pain scale.

2072~~~
I walked around on a full rupture ACL for about 9 months, walked off the pitch and drove to hospital, took 9 months of being told it was medial ligament and would heal before some bright spark spotted that my knee and thigh weren't attached through the middle :-\

2073~~~
NOT six months.. Or something like that.

2074~~~
If he misses a good portion of the rest of the season I think we could be in real trouble to make the top four without decent signings in January.

2075~~~
Did you fail comprehension in school?
Pogue spent his time disputing weak arguments based on assumption levelled against Moyes more than anything else. He wasnt defending Moyes  but was pointing out how some arguments were flawed. There is a difference and it was reasonably clear. Maybe try reading things a couple of times.

2076~~~
I keep hearing from people who seemed to feel very little pain. Starting to think I'm just a massive pussy (had my suspicions about that for a while, mind you)

2077~~~
Nah, done mine in March and initially I screamed. Compared to the people I've played against and with, I'm confident in saying that I'm more pain-tolerant nonetheless injury-prone. A mate I was playing with said that it sounded horrible.

2078~~~
Looks like I missed all the fun today...

2079~~~
Me too.  Was looking forward to that a lot.

Blind Carrick
Di Maria, Herrera, Rooney
RVP/Falcao

is a front 6 that is as good as any in the PL right now.  So frustrating we cant see all 6 fully fit and on form play together and we are no approaching December!

2080~~~
It's laughable that " won't be out for six months" is actually a good news. Back in the old days, fans would've shit their pants if they'd heard someone out for 2 months.  Now we  take 3 months in a heartbeat

2081~~~
Naah, Fabregas-Matic
Willian-Oscar-Hazard
          Costa is at least as good as that front 6.

2082~~~
LvG's comments make the situation as clear as mud. Basically until the next scan we wont know anything concrete and can only hope for the best, it was such an unfortunate injury as well, just utter bad luck as opposed to fragility like some of our others.

2083~~~
Had Blind played CB for the Dutch before? Just wonder if he became a victim of us having just playing him as a CB and then the Dutch needing someone to cover since the other guy was carrying a slight knock.

It's weird how these national team coaches end up playing players in their not so natural positions because they've filled in at club level decently. Like when Jones/Smalling took over RB for United, they seemed to get picked right away as RB for England.

2084~~~
Rojo's seems to be the same, it's not an injury due to him being injury prone, he just fecked himself in a way that even the most robust players could do.

2085~~~
It makes far more sense to back LVG, and give him more time due to his record over the past 20 years as a proven top class manager, who's won titles in every country he's ever managed (and who has a notorious history of slow starts with his new clubs) then to back Moyes just because of some misplaced faith in Fergie's ability to pick a successor (especially when he could barely come up with a decent reason for that person). In fact, I'd suggest that backing Moyes just because Fergie said too, and ignoring all sense and reason is/was particularity stupid. As for the argument that LVG spent more money so should do instantly do better, well that is a pretty flawed argument too, as LVG is having to practically build a new squad and first XI, having lost experienced leaders like Vidic, Evra, Rio, Giggs...and all from a team that finished 7th last season. Moyes inherited a team that had just won the league, threw £70 odd million at it, and still finished 7th, while showing no signs of progression.

You were incredibly lenient with Moyes last season, constantly calling for more time and defending him, when most were coming to the realisation that it wasn't working. Now I'm not saying that that is in itself wrong, but to me you're now showing double standards with LVG, as you've been on his back (and far more outspoken then many) with you're little digs and questions. Its quite obvious that you have an agenda, whether intended or not. If there is no agenda, why did you spend so long defending Moyes up until around the latter stages of the season when even you conceded the battle, yet just 11 games into this season seem to be questioning a far more proven manager, and not backing him in the way you did with Moyes?

2086~~~
I think any digs aimed at LvG (something I know I'm guilty of) are rooted in the fact we expect better from him, because of his reputation. It's possible to have faith in the long term, but to criticise performance in the short term.

Basically, we now have the right man in charge, but it's not clicking at the moment - in that situation, you have to give him time. Last season, our manager was a crock of shit - he should've been sacked far earlier.

2087~~~
The thing is, his reputation is for slow starts, I mean he even warned us that it will be a difficult start. Its not like this has come out of the blue. He said the first 3 months will be tough, and so many people just ignored it, and were talking about walking into the top 4, and title challenges. I understand the frustration (I'm frustrated as well), but this isn't an unexpected situation. If things don't start improving by January/February then we should start worrying. 

Agreed on the second point. Although I'd go a step further and say he should never have been hired in the first place (something that the majority thought at the time in fairness)

2088~~~
We were warned about his slow starts, but it doesn't really stack up when you look at our fixtures - we drew against Burnley and lost after being 3-1 up against Leicester!

2089~~~
If we're still getting those kind of results come January/February time then I'll be surprised (and worried).

2090~~~
Burnley: this was before we bought our new 1st teamers. I remember at that time we were playing with the likes of Cleverley and Fletcher (who were woeful) and I also remember seeing Anderson make an appearance against MK Dons. This was one of our first games of the season, where our morale/confidence was low due to Moyes. Morale/confidence cannot be lifted by a new manager over a single Summer. It takes time. Since then you can see we are now prepared to fight right until the final whistle. This was not the case at the start of the season.
Leicester: you can't blame the manager. The moment Leicester scored their 2nd goal, our players panicked and started hoofing the ball forward, only for it to come back at them 15 seconds later. We were attempting to park the bus, which simply isnt the LvG way.

Lets also not forget that recently we have been decimated by injuries to first team players. This continues to be the case, so can you really blame LvG?

2091~~~
Something about Blind? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2092~~~
Handsome bugger though isn't he.

2093~~~
Out of our injured players what ones are that much better than the players that started the Arsenal game? Rafa/Valencia Jones/McNair Blind/Carrick Falcao/RVP? Not much improvement from what I see but I will give you Rojo or Evans over Blackett but would we play with 3 at the back? A lot of smoking mirrors here in my opinion we need 3-4 better players still to come in (transfer market)

2094~~~
I think in tough games that playing both Blind and Carrick would be a great option. Likewise it would have been a major help in dealing with the uncertainty caused by our defensive injuries.

2095~~~
Sure is.

2096~~~
Dammit, stop bumping this thread, I keep thinking there will be another photo of him.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2097~~~
Shaw was injured for most of the game.
Blind was injured.
Falcao (instead of RvP) was injured.
Herrara was injured.
Rojo was injured.
Rafael was injured.

This is half our first team.
With the above players in our team, I believe we would have dominated possession in the Arsenal game.

So yes, with half our first team injured, this will have a huge effect on our results.

2098~~~
Can we talk about Daley Blind please? Lol.

2099~~~
LvG said he was supposed to having a second scan sometime this week right? hope they let out the results to the public quickly..
Out of all our injuries, his depressed me most, hes been so influential in starting our attacks from the back, I thought we missed him against Arsenal, the back 3 & DDG struggled again in finding a reliable ball out from the back.

2100~~~
Where are the pictures?

2101~~~

2102~~~
It'd definitely be good to rest Carrck where possible.

2103~~~
That would be a real boost

2104~~~
Good news, light at the end of the tunnel. We can't rely on Carrick to play 4 games in 8/9 days. He can't do it anymore.

2105~~~
Fantastic news if true.

2106~~~
That means he would be out for six weeks which was what was originally predicted.

2107~~~
Great news, hopefully once he's back Di Maria, Shaw, Rafael and Jones be back too and it'll be the end of our injury crisis.

2108~~~
This is how I've been thinking on our injury front for the least 2/3 months. We always seem to pick up fresh injuries though. Fingers crossed for the press conference later.

2109~~~
Well to be fair apart from Rafael and Jones the newest injuries of Shaw, Rooney, Di Maria, De Gea, Blind  have all been freak type accidents and not from being weak bodies unlike Rafael and Jones. Its just bad luck really, surely it cannot continue to plague us?  We actually have good depth in every area of the pitch expect full backs, so the fact that we've relied on youth in some areas is really down to bad luck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2110~~~
Whats it say? Can't read it at work

2111~~~
"<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">manutd</a> manager Louis van Gaal says Daley Blind could return from his knee injury in time for the Christmas fixtures <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mufc?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#mufc</a>"

2112~~~
Awesome, thanks!

2113~~~
Grr, make a separate injury thread you feckers!

2114~~~
There is one, and I created it. I'll update it now.

2115~~~
Interesting to see if he keeps his place once he's back or if LVG plays only either him or Carrick. Once everyone is fit, our midfield really is getting crowded with good players

2116~~~
Since the squad has settled a lot more now in midfield just as Blind gets injured it could easily be mistaken to credit Carrick for it. I like Blind, he has had a fantastic season prior to injury but I can't help but feel safer with Carrick in front of the back four, maybe like I previously stated its because we're most settled and organised.  Will have to play Blind either way over the Xmas period, I'm confident in his abilities to replace Carrick and do just as good of a job.

2117~~~
Sorry for those of you who think I'm bumping this with news.

Any idea when he's back? Carrick has been a good replacement for him, but I really can't wait to see this guy back in the team. I can definitely see him being a starter for the next five/six years for us - similar to Carrick.

2118~~~
According to PhysioRoom he's back on Boxing Day.

2119~~~
I'm seriously interested in seeing how a Blind-Carrick midfield duo would work. Although the fear is that it could see us shift to the dreaded 3-5-2 on a more permanent basis.

2120~~~
Just too defensive for me, enough dare and creativity.

2121~~~
Yeah, that'd be a formation for tough away days at most, even then when you were trying to close out the game. That said its nice to have the option.

2122~~~
LVG's favorite formation is 4-3-3. If we'll get more more quality players and fully balance the squad 3-5-2 will be only used as an option.

2123~~~
The luxury of having more than one defensive midfielder I suppose!

2124~~~
a 4231 would be interesting for big games if we brought in someone like Reus, although it would mean  a lot of good players get benched. 

----Blind-Carrick
Reus---Rooney--Di Maria
----------RVP

2125~~~
With our luck to injuries we would do just fine with a little bit of Fergie's rotation.

2126~~~
Interesting how people say if we had a formation with Mata, Rooney, Falcao, RVP and Di Maria in it, that formation would necessarily be too attacking and unbalanced. Yet a formation with both Blind and Carrick in midfield would be too defensive. But if you put them together and form a hybrid - OK so you really do have to drop one of the attacking players, but if you have Carrick and Blind with Di Maria, Rooney and Mata ahead of them and either RVP or Falcao up front - is that still too defensive? Is it lacking creativity? Carrick is very creative from deep, Blind passes the ball well and can link defense with attack better than anyone else except the guy standing next to him. Seems pretty balanced to me.

2127~~~

2128~~~
I can't tell if this is suppose to compliment our fans or not <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2129~~~

2130~~~
Good news.

2131~~~
He makes them sound like Ultras <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2132~~~
YES!

2133~~~
Great news, we need him.

2134~~~
So what does it mean? About two weeks and he is ready to play?

2135~~~
Miss his presence. Hope he gets back soon.

2136~~~
Miss him simply because Carrick is not Gerrard and can't play 90 minutes every match.

2137~~~
Miss him too, hope he to see him as soon as possible

2138~~~
Kinda similar to Carrick so would rather have Herrera or Fellaini

2139~~~
Carrick has looked tired these last two games. Having Blind during this period would have been great.

2140~~~
He greatly impressed me before his injury, does a lot of things that go unnoticed but he makes a big difference. Get him, Rojo and Di Maria back and we'll be in much better shape.

2141~~~
When is he back?

2142~~~
His distribution is good, not nearly the passing range of Carrick but he can also but in a long ball, he thinks (not always acts) forwardswise, not likely to lose the ball unneccesarily, can play under pressure, is mobile, knows when to attack, tactically sound, has positional awareness with his blocks/interceptions and can bring the ball from behind, he is exactly what we need. He was playing excellent from day 1, in a new league, after a tiring season and in an unbalanced team, if we give him time, he'll certainly be good enough for United. Need him back.

2143~~~
When is this guy back?
He is my favourite player and I really do think we are missing him especially when our defenders begin their sideways/backward (to De Gea) passing.

2144~~~
Back in training this week and a possibility to travel for the FA Cup tie.

2145~~~
That early? I don't think philosophy would allow that.

2146~~~
Depends on how he is training I suppose. Wouldn't rule out a sub appearance at some point in the next week or so.

2147~~~
We have missed him, not a coincidence we haven't stood up to any decent team in midfield since he was injured. The reason? Carrick, good as he is, can't handle pressing.

2148~~~
I like how he makes himself available for a pass and how he tries to keep the ball forward and not backpass it. These are simple aspects of football that have a big impact on the fluidity of the game.

2149~~~
I think our lineup will be this once he gets back:

--------------RVP/Falcao-------
-----DiMaria--------------------
------Rooney--Herrera/Mata--
Shaw------Blind--------Rafael-
---Jones-Carrick-Smalling-----

2150~~~
Really looking forward to seeing him and Carrick line up together.

Could anyone that's there live today please keep an eye on them and report any off the ball communication and interchanges between them that TV will miss please? Intrigued to see how they manage the situations they face today.

Ultimate flexibility with these 2 involved.

2151~~~
Really glad he's back, hopefully he will continue to take the ball out from the back rather than the defenders looking for 50 yard balls all game.

2152~~~
Interesting that Van Gaal didn't pussyfoot around and put him straight back in the team. Usually with other players his "philosophy" would dictate that he'd give a returning player 20 odd mins as a sub first before putting him in the starting 11.

Must rate him very highly.

2153~~~
I think this is definitely the case. He may be a bit rusty after a decent lay-off but hopefully he gets through and does well.

2154~~~
Yes, He's crucial to orchestrating play from the back. His absence has been exposed by the lack of ball playing defenders. I'd expect there will be a lot more fluency to our play back to front, when he's in midfield, and not covering left back. The only thing is minutes on the pitch to get up to speed, or lack of....

2155~~~
Weird that Rojo not playing.

2156~~~
Tbf, Blind is one of the few who can hit a pinpoint 50 yard pass.

2157~~~
He loks miles off the pace. Bizzare decison to start him tbh.

2158~~~
Still looks injured, but calm on the ball. For that reason alone prefer him over Evans (or at least the Evans we've seen in recent games).

2159~~~
Reads things so well and covers effortlessly at the back. Great to see him back in the side.

2160~~~
Rather him than Evans.

2161~~~
Apart from at the very start where he lost out massively to pace, I thought he looked fine. Took out some good positions defensively too, covering space that others might not have. Plus, we're actually distributing from a back 3, the hell?

Am I missing something?

2162~~~
I've only seen the second half, but he was the only bright spot I tought.

2163~~~
I don't get the point in starting him as a third centre back. Why not just play him in midfield and ditch having the extra defender?

Sorta calls BS on LvG's policy of introducing players back into the team after injury when he plays 90 minutes after 2 months out.

2164~~~
Looked a bit tired in the first half but his World Cup crossing brilliance was on show once he switched out wide. Thought I was one of the best players.

2165~~~
My MOTM, some beautiful passes and interceptions all game long.

2166~~~
Love this guy, future legend.

2167~~~
He showed more on LWB in half an hour than Shaw ever did. Saying that, hopefully we don't use him as CB anymore.

2168~~~
I just about gave it to Valencia as Blind did have a couple too many inaccurate passes, as you'd expect in his first game back. However his overall performance, getting forward and supporting play and also making a great contribution winning the ball, he was definitely in our top 2 today

2169~~~
Great crossing. Leave Carrick to play defensive midfield.

2170~~~
He did well considering it was his first game in about two months.

2171~~~
Good game. Usual performance tbh, always consistent.

2172~~~
The only player for us today that had a good game IMO, read it well, put in a couple of decent balls and didn't panic.

2173~~~
He's an 8/10 player anytime he steps on the pitch. We could with a couple more like him.

2174~~~
He's such a smart player and when Smalling slipped he reacted almost immediately with vital run and clearance.

You can see how much he worked hard to get back after serious injury. Full professionalism.

2175~~~
What a beautiful football brain the boy has. Very good game from him, first name on the teamsheet for the next game.

No one comes close to him in the rating for Southampton game.

2176~~~
Comes back from a long injury, played out of position but still puts in a performance, Blind is a player who always gets 6/10 at least, we need more players like him

2177~~~
1st name on the team sheet

2178~~~
Our best player today certainly. He put more decent crosses in 30 minutes at wingback than Shaw and Valencia had managed combined in twice that period.

2179~~~
Great to have him back. Showed minimal rustiness.

He has quite a cross on him as well.

Now can we please play four at the back and partner him with Carrick in midfield, instead of fannying around with playing one of them at CB?

I believe we'll be a much more solid unit with him in the side.

2180~~~
The only positive we can take from that game is Daley Blind.

2181~~~
He's one of our most important players. Nothing spectacular but very consistent and intelligent.

2182~~~
A few too many misplaced passes in the 1st half for my liking, but his crosses were really good towards the end of the game. Wonder why it took so long for anyone to try them though. But I do think he should be played in his favorite position whatever that is instead of just moving him around at will.

2183~~~
Was poor, but has valid excuses in being injured and been thrown in at LCB for the first time then LWB. He's really slow though, not quick enough to be playing wing back imo.

2184~~~
I think he's been fantastic (sounds silly with that outcome, I know) today, very good in defence, good ball playing, good intercepting play and great crosses when moved to LWB. Makes me wonder though, didn't he started training with us like a week or week and a half ago? What about the 'match fitness' bullshit?

2185~~~
Not really sure I agree with your assessment. Thought he was one of our better players, and put in some handy crosses when drafted into the left wingback position.

2186~~~
Yet he created two of our best chances with the quality of his crossing from that position.

2187~~~
The back 3 looked a lot better with him and immediately noticeably looked less composed when he moved to wing back. At wing back he swung in some great balls too.

2188~~~
Should be in midfield.

2189~~~
Definitely the best we have at playing in the back 3. Not so good at LWB though, purely for his lack of pace, but he didn't do too badly there. Put in some good crosses, but he lacks the pace to recover. But I thought we looked good with Shaw's pace on the left, and Blind supporting coming out from LCB.

2190~~~
Of course he is important too, but found that also amazing. Probably thats just for other palyers, dutch players are excluded. Just like Strootman, his injury issues are not relevant.

2191~~~
One more thing- with performances like today, I think he should be awarded with a spot in midfield. Don't throw around such a good player like Blind. 

The same applies to Di Maria and Rooney I suppose.

2192~~~
He had a good game, looked a bit tired in the latter stages of the match but that's understandable.

2193~~~
Mr. reliable. Future captain and really the only one who had a clue what to do.

2194~~~
I don't think he was any good at LWB. Like Shaw, isolated and didn't do much going forward. Thought he played well at CB though.

2195~~~
Love the guy but don't like these numbers since his debut:

With Blind: 4-2-3
Without Blind: 7-3-0

2196~~~
Irrelevant, our record with di Maria in the side has been similarly poor, most would argue that he's our best player.

2197~~~
Strange numbers, he's always been solid.

2198~~~
very much this.

good to have someone who is just equally as good playing in 3 or 4 different positions.

and shaw is not a wing back. unless we start playing with 4 at the back again then i'll prefer blind or young over him if van gaal keep on insisting using this 5-3-2 formation<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2199~~~
Couldn't agree more buddy, we have nothing coming from out wide this 3 at the back is really a 5 for us not surprised we are not creating anything as Valencia and Shaw pass back constantly and never hit the bye line.

2200~~~
No he wasn't.

2201~~~
Best player on the pitch along with Smalling. He can do so many different jobs it's absurd, and he has just went back from injury!

Bargain.

2202~~~
Those are very strange numbers.
The same can be said for Di Maria, too - we tend to lose or draw with him in the side.

Blind is my favourite player, due to his intelligence and consistency.

2203~~~
Didn't think he was as good as people are saying. Maybe I just didn't watch him closely enough though.

2204~~~
Looked a bit rusty but nice to have another technically solid, intelligent footballer out there.

2205~~~
Great to have him back and fit. Good first game back, though did worry at times about his pace when balls got played behind him a couple of time.

2206~~~
won couple of challenges and this place goes crazy and votes him MOTM he really is a fan favourite. He had really poor start to the game and misplaced a lot of passes but raised to the game and was good overall eventually, good return from injury. Anyway Smalling's performance was much better and Valencia's .. arguably third best player for us but by some distance from the two.

And he should play in midfield. Don't know why we should play him and carrick at the same time it's either him or him..

2207~~~
I thought he did well for clearly not being fit enough to play an entire match as a midfielder.

2208~~~
I don't get this. Blind, while coming back from a serious injury, starts the very first game he is back in. Rafael, on the other hand, has to wait for weeks and weeks and then only gets a half to play in even though he has been training since weeks. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2209~~~
It took a while for him to get into the game but he rose to the challenge and played well. Don't think we can blame him for losing.

2210~~~
The most intelligent footballer in the squad bar none. Stick him back at DM and our MF will tick like clockwork

2211~~~
Excellent game especially considering he hasn't had any game time since his injury. Did better in that left wing back position than Shaw despite not having the pace, a couple of excellent crosses and I was more confident having him at the back than Evans or Blackett.

2212~~~
We seem to have spent so much of this season making excuses for players not being fully match, not fully recovered from an injury, or not playing in their preferred position. 

Then we have the one player who's had the most serious injury of the lot of them and he slots straight back into the starting line-up, runs his socks off for 90 minutes and put in an accomplished performance playing in a position that he hasn't played for us much before. If only we had more Daley Blinds in our squad....

2213~~~
hes brilliant isnt he? love the guy already. He was born to be Man Utd captain imho

2214~~~
Our very own Phillip Lahm? No pressure Daley.

Infact, I always thought he was going to be this reliable consistent versatile player - but I think he's shown to be much more than that. For me he's been our best player this season, and our distribution from deep suffers badly (whatever formation) when he's not in the team. 

I think he's been our best player this year, and disagree that Carrick is a step up on him in that midfield role. I want him back in that position, preferably alongside Carrick. He covers space and presses so intelligently that I feel he's wasted in defence or at wing back, without even considering his fantastic distribution play. I can understand playing him in defense or wing back in the short term though, because he's stupidly one of our better options there too.

2215~~~
Our best signing of the summer.

2216~~~
Our only summer signing that looks to be worth anywhere near what we paid for them so far, yes

2217~~~
Totally agree, has such a good sense or awareness and the intelligence to go with it. Great buy for us.

2218~~~
Thought he looked good. Sure on the ball, good confident defensively. Thought he led and understood what LVG wanted from a Left sided CB in terms of where they should be attacking wise. And it was first time I thought we looked like we had a better shape, with him and Jones going forward to link up with RWB and CM's etc. Give another option for a pass but half way through opposition half.

2219~~~
LVG has a history of liking intelligent players, over skillful players.
Furthermore, Blind, De Gea, Carrick, Rooney, RVP, Shaw appear to be guaranteed first team starters. 
Next year, these are the players most likely that we will be fighting for the title. The other players appear to be replaceable. 

As any football fan will understand, the performance of a team is related to fielding a consistent starting 11. Chelsea are the best example of this.
Rotating your squad just for the heck of it, wont do us any good.

When any of the above players are available, they will almost certainly be starting the match (to maintain consistency).
Other players could be asked to prove their match rhythm/fitness before they are considered to start a game.

2220~~~
Our best midfielder after Di Maria

2221~~~
He should be the first midfielder on the team sheet, we look so much better when he's involved.

2222~~~
I'll admit, I am very disappointed with Di Maria. For £60M.
Am I correct in saying that Blind was our cheapest purchase?

2223~~~
He definitely seems like Captain material to me, I think LvG should even consider it next season as I wonder if he keeps playing Rooney in midfield as he likes his Captain to be there as opposed to being a forward.

Yes, £13.8M I think.

2224~~~
Thought he looked very good on the ball and on reflection was probably the only bright spot from yesterday's game. That pass for Mata when he was at LB was sexual! He needs to play in midfield. Either with or replacing Carrick.

2225~~~
Daley effect in Netherlands, in 2014, 181 people born with his name, against the 60 in 2013.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/JesseWieten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Jesse Wieten</b> ‏@<b>JesseWieten</b> </a> <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/JesseWieten/status/554989234990612481" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">6 h6 ore fa</a>
Daley Blind-effect (?) zet door. Nooit zoveel Daley's in Nederland geboren als in 2014: 181. Het vorige record was 2013 met 60.

2226~~~
I'm pretty sure LVG doesn't really rate Rafael.

2227~~~
Blind has been back in training for over 2 weeks. Rafael only got a half to play because he got injured again and Daley wasn't meant to play the 90 but had to since van Persie got injured. Valencia has also been quite good so there was no reason to drop him.

2228~~~
When he got moved to LB, I saw the best crossing of all season from the left. He delivered about 2-3 inch perfect crosses in succession and showed us what Shaw should have been doing all game.

2229~~~
Double it in 2015 and they will be born on Daley basis.

2230~~~
He's a very smart player and always looked so composed - something you couldn't say about a lot of our players. 

I really like him.

2231~~~
Wasn't convinced when we signed him, but looks to be a good signing, our best by far this season, if you take into consideration the price.

2232~~~
I see what you did there. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2233~~~
I don't know why people are complaining so much about LVG starting Blind after being out for so long.  He was one of our best players over the weekend and gave us a lot of needed composure in the back.

2234~~~
Like  a metronome. I trust him completely.

2235~~~
Carlsberg dont do football players. But if they did, theyd probably be Daley Blind.

2236~~~
I don't think that's entirely true.If I am not wrong LvG mentioned that Blind had been training with the team for about 2 weeks before he played against Southampton.

2237~~~
Blind was training with the team before Christmas. He posted a picture and tweet saying so.

2238~~~
Same was with Rafael. Has been back in Carrington for quite some time now but wasn't starting/playing. Only got to play 2 halves. One second half, and broke his cheekbone when he started against Yeovil.

2239~~~
Rafael is precious and fragile though. You have to be gentle with him.

2240~~~
Carrick is the most intelligent. He's a matured Blind.

2241~~~
Agreed.And with a more expansive passing range.

2242~~~
Disagree with the first part. There are times when Carrick disappears, Blind is always in the right place and always knows where his first touch should take him.

Carrick is a better (or perhaps just more confident) passer.

I want to see them play together in midfield.

2243~~~
It's early yet.

2244~~~
Your underrating of Carrick is borderline criminal. Carrick has been instrumental in winning us several titles and been part of the team that was in the CL finals thrice in four years including winning it once. Quite how Blind, who to be fair is intelligent is better than Carrick is beyond me.

2245~~~
Where did i say Blind was better than Carrick?

2246~~~
You suggested that Blind is more intelligent than Carrick. Yes?

2247~~~
Hardly, I rate Blind higher than Carrick and there are a hell of a lot or people who would agree, especially supporters of other clubs, equally there is a huge amount of fans who rate Carrick higher.

2248~~~
He's nowhere near Carrick. It's a laughable to even suggest so at this point given he's played about 5 games in midfield for us and not done anything out of the ordinary in any of them.

2249~~~
No, i said Blind is better at making himself available for a pass and at keeping the ball under control and moving. Whilst theres a good reason we went on that winning streak with Carrick, theres also a good reason we play with a vast ocean between defence and midfield when Blind isnt there.

2250~~~
Scored a goal? That's out of the ordinary for a defensive midfielder.

I wouldn't say Carrick does anything out of the ordinary either. I wouldn't expect a defensive midfielder to be doing something unexpected.

2251~~~
Carrick's been a lot better defensively. Blind looks like heh as a good pass on him and is generally positive on the ball but his defensive game needs work.

2252~~~
I know Carrick has been here a while, and has been a top player here for a while, however this season I see no difference in the level of performance between the two players.
Its blatently obvious what we miss when Blind isn't in the team, and its also obvious what we miss when Carrick isn't. 
If LVG was smart he would build the team around those two players being corner stone of the midfield.

2253~~~
I think they've both been good defensively in different ways. Carrick has much better anticipation. he always knows where to be. He makes it look easy, the way he just steps into interceptions. Blind has been good too. He's mobile, he gets stuck in and makes great challenges. He harries the man in possession and presses more than Carrick does. Both players are fairly poor at set piece marking though.

I think Carrick's composure edges it, but Blind has been the best of our summer signings, and overall one of our best players, along with Carrick.

2254~~~
Blind gets so much hate on Dutch forums. Almost everyone except Ajax supporters hate him. He's too slow, he doesnt have any strenght, he cant shoot and the most heard opinion is 'he doesnt pass any ball forward, he's a sideway passer who doesnt take any risk'. 

Even when our national team is playing almost everyone dislikes him. Just like RVP.

Funny thing is, i believe redcafe voted him MOTM in our last game against Southampton but in Dutch forums they call him the worse player on the field....

2255~~~
I'm not sure on this. They both show lots of intelligence, but I would say they both excel in different areas.

Blind's ability to offer himself for a pass and to be in space is better than Carrick. By some distance I think. The games against Chelsea and City where he was on his own in midfield. Compare those to Carrick against Arsenal, who whilst being good defensively was almost seemingly hiding from the ball. However, I think Carrick spreads the play better, moves it into the attackers better, knows when to play the ball low and hard or when to have it hold and hang.

I also think Blinds covering of space and sniffing out potential danger is better. A moment against Chelsea really amplifies this notion. Hazard carried the ball forward on the left, our whole squad got dragged across, he brought it inside and switched it to Willian. Whilst the rest of our squad was busy turning and shuffling back up the pitch desperately, Blind was there, waiting.. he won the ball immediately, danger snuffed before it had really begun. Again, another contrast - N'Zonzi goal for Stoke where Carrick gets dragged towards Bojan/Assaidi after Fellaini had lost it. We ended up with 3 players ball chasing pretty much, and an N'Zonzi standing completely free in the middle on the edge of our box.

I think Blind is better at pressing. Multiple times a game we'll see him pushing someone back towards their own goal. Not once yet do I remember him getting overturned as a result, because he seems to pick his moments very well. When other players do, one ball later and they've taken themselves out of the game and are desperately trying to recover. Not Blind.. not yet anyway.

Carrick is more likely to put in a last ditch tackle or block. He's less likely to get dribbled as he screens well but always keeps himself in contention. I don't think he gets taken on quite as much. Not that Blind does much either, but more.

Looking at the stats, Blind averages 2.8 tackles and 3 interception per game this season. Carrick 1.8 and 1.5 respectively. To caveat this, Blind has mostly played in the diamond formation with 4 at the back, and Carrick 5 at the back. If we take Carricks from last season, it's 2.1 and 2.8. Season before 2.3 and 2.1. Both lower, but again admittedly, he wasn't quite 'alone' (though it seemed that way) in the midfield so had less opportunity to make tackles/interceptions presumably.

I appreciate that I'm trying to paint a picture of generic strengths over another using individual moments. But whilst those moments stick with me and lend as a good comparison, I wouldn't say that I let them dictate my over-arching thoughts.

For the most part, they are completely interchangeable. They outshade eachother in different areas but they are accomplished at absolutely everything required for the role.

2256~~~
Didn't look like Championship player? That's not ordinary for United midfielder.

2257~~~
But is ajax one of those clubs where you either like them or you don't. If that's the case the fact he's an Ajax or ex Ajax player might contribute to the hate.

2258~~~
This it's really getting on my nervers and it's just laughable, the contrast between the ratings of Blind here and over there are huge, the majority would tell you that fecking Clasie is much better.

2259~~~
Didn't he just win Eriedivisie player of the year last season?

2260~~~
Yes.

2261~~~
He did, but I think there were some Ajax legends in the jury so it's not acknowledge as right here.

2262~~~
It's quite funny as, these we're the same people all saying Blind isn't good enough for United and we shouldn't sign him. Hes actually been our best signing of the summer so far. Comes back from injury and is striaght back in the starting 11, none of this needs to get back match rythm and fitness nonsense.

2263~~~
Sure, he's proven a ton of us wrong.

I thought at the price he'd be a good signing for us. But I now see him as a huge part of our team going forward for a long time. I think he'll be a massive player for us, and has potential to be a United captain.

2264~~~
And yet as soon as Carrick was back in the line up we went on a decent run where we won a lot of games.

2265~~~
I strongly disagree. Carrick looks great when there is absolutely no pressure on him, while Blind can cope with it and still be effective. 

I don't think there is much between them in terms of defensive attributes, certainly not <i>a lot</i>. Daley has better interception/tackle ratio too.

2266~~~
Sure.. but I think that was somewhat coincidental. We'd been playing some good stuff up to then and played well against Chelsea and City. In terms of the midfield battle, we haven't looked so accomplished against those 2 in a while for the most part. And Blind played a huge part in that.

Results wise we've done better with Carrick in the team but performance wise, we've been better with Blind in the team. However, I would say that I think it would have been the same pattern either way.

The main difference is that our results were inconsistent with 4 at the back. Then we went on a good period of results (with some awful performances) with 5 at the back (mostly). Swap Carrick or Blind or have one for all and I think it would have pretty much been the same.

2267~~~
Carrick wasn't the only change for one, Fellaini made a big impact too.
EDIT: And of course switch to 3 at the back

2268~~~
Another fair point.

I think Blind and Carrick are interchangeable. I think they outshade eachother in different areas but ultimately both are accomplished at absolutely everything required for that role.

2269~~~
Is this relevant? Look at how many lucky results and poor performances we've had since Carrick is back, I doubt it has to do with them per se. Actually, just name the decent to okay performances we've had since Carrick is back, total irrelevant post.

2270~~~
spot on.

2271~~~
Nice post, just to add that Carrick is faster then Blind and stronger. The speed thing could be a little problem, but as long as someone is behind him, his reading of the game will fix it (also a Chelsea game, when Hazard just left him, but he didn't run after him, but moved in a different position, so when Rafael attacked Hazard, Blind was already waiting behind).

Anyway, I like them both.

2272~~~
Yeah I'd love to see how we'd do with the two of them in the side for an extended period. Something like this maybe?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/34852/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/34852/A-352-less-Macnhester-United-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/34852/A-352-less-Macnhester-United-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

Herrera could fill in anywhere in midfield I'd say. Fellaini or even Jones could fill in for Blind and Carrick when they're injured. Plus whatever midfielder I'd hope we'd get soon.

2273~~~
That is the side and formation I've been suggesting all season, I really hope we get to see it at some point.

2274~~~
Yeah me too. This is a little off topic but you could also have a 433 with Blind, Carrick and ADM/Herrera as the midfield 3 but with the amount of number 10s we have, I think it might be better to have Blind and Carrick there on their own. Our defence isn't great at moving the ball forward but if you have Blind and Carrick in front of them, it surely wouldn't be a problem.

2275~~~
We should just play Carrick and Blind in a 4-2-3-1 system with them as double pivots. The 3 attackers in front could be anyone of Mata,Di Maria,Rooney,Januzaj and Herrera. The system also has the advantage of us playing a lone forward, a role in which RvP and Falcao have shined in before.

Edit: Damn it!! <a class="username" data-user="85523, @Tyrion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85523/">@Tyrion</a> had just posted something similiar above...

2276~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Tbf, <a class="username" data-user="81416, @Cassidy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81416/">@Cassidy</a> kinda beat me to it as well.

2277~~~
Yes. Swapping Mata with Januzaj and then even Rooney with Herrera/Mata (playing Rooney up top or either of the other two).

I'm really hoping for a midfield 3, with Carrick and Blind in the middle and an AM in front of them, with two wide players. Super impressed to see Blind play a whole game, looking solid through-out after that lengthy absence. Definitely prefer him in midfield though.

2278~~~
I was thinking that but I think with the amount of number 10s we have a 433 might cause issues as we'd either play narrow or shove Rooney/Mata out to the wings. A 4231 would let us attack similar to the diamond imo plus Blind and Carrick should be stronger defensively and give LVG the ability to play the possession game he wants.

2279~~~
<a class="username" data-user="85523, @Tyrion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85523/">@Tyrion</a> 
That's what I was trying to get at. If we'd play Herrera/Mata as an AM ahead of Carrick and Blind, and in between di Maria and Januzaj. I'd prefer to play an actual AM there and play Rooney (or van Persie or Falcao) as a lone striker. 

The problem with this is we've obviously got 3 star strikers on massive wages all expecting to play all the time. But it's better them being disappointed and the team being balanced than continuing playing players out of position.

2280~~~
I like this guy more and more. Very intelligent player.

2281~~~
That pass to Wilson <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2282~~~
Not his best match but still okay to good, he can be a key player for us.

2283~~~
Very tidy, consistent player that most don't notice, sort of like Irwin was.

2284~~~
If he had any pace about him, I honestly reckon he'd have the ability to be one of the best left backs in the world.

As it is, he's just a great player to have in the squad. Love him.

2285~~~
If we put an actual midfield in around him, we'd look a team. Positionally aware, tough and a good bit of skill too. Would absolutely love to see Carrick and him protecting a back 4.

2286~~~
Didn't have the pace to cause much of a problem for QPR isolated as a wingback, but got into the game when we went more compact and he played as a LB.

2287~~~
Seems to be one of those always reliable players, always gives his all and is consistent with his touch, passing and decision making and will pretty much always give you a 7/10 performance.

2288~~~
Very good again. Hes not exactly blessed when it comes to the physical side, but his understanding of the game is top notch. Kinda funny we have a player who is the polar opposite on the other WB spot.

2289~~~
His positional awareness is great, some great interceptions once again !

2290~~~
So impressed with this guy. That bit of play to set Wilson free down the wing was lovely. Just reliably good pretty much every time he steps out onto the pitch.

2291~~~
I thought he did well. But he's not a left back. Lots of spaces in our defence on our left, which a better team would have exploited.

2292~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2293~~~
We need a gif of that pass he played to Wilson <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2294~~~
This is what I don't get.

We play 3-5-2 presumably because LVG doesn't trust the defence and the cover thereof but if we played Carrick and Blind as the base of midfield in a 4-2-3-1 we'd be absolutely sorted both defensively and attacking wise.

2295~~~
Our most consistent player this season, IMO.

2296~~~
He's a very intelligent footballer. Understands and reads the game really well. Classy player without being spectacular.

2297~~~
Love the guy.

2298~~~
Proper footballer. Just has the basics that some of our players don't.

2299~~~
The tackle and pass to put Wilson through was world class. Very classy and intelligent player. I really enjoy watching him play.

2300~~~
He's so calm and composed, it's a delight to watch. His pace (or lack of it) is a major bummer though.

2301~~~
Can't believe there were clowns on here who doubted him when we were signing him

2302~~~
Simple, the manager is more interested in ensuring that 3-5-2 proves him right instead of giving his team the best chance for a win. Him, Carrick and Rooney/Herrera/Di Maria looks so obvious it's painful.

2303~~~
Very intelligent player. Him and Carrick are very alike and they are both some of my favourites!

2304~~~
I need to see a gif of that pass to Wilson

2305~~~
I second that motion!

2306~~~
Solid solid player, and always reliable, never gives the ball away, i feel with him and Carrick in the middle we would have excellent possession and hold our own against top sides, while in previous seasons we used to crumble against any half decent side, i feel the stupid formation is holding us back we actually have terrific players.

2307~~~
Easily our best signing of this season, and one of our best in recent years too(if he continues like this, but I see no reason why not, if he is playing this good in this period, he'll always be good).

2308~~~
That was brilliant...came into the middle to cut out their attack and then carried it on before springing Wilson free

2309~~~
Pretty impressive coming back from 7 weeks out and just slotting seamlessly back in, seems to be one of LvG's first names on the team sheet when fit.

The fact he has experience of the LvG 'Philosophy' is encouraging in that the other players will improve the more they become accustomed to it.

2310~~~
4-2-2-2 has to be a serious consideration when Luke Shaw is back, the two holding of Carrick and Blind should allow the full backs to be very attacking and the two wide attacking midfielders could play a roaming role with one striker making runs in behind (Falcao / RVP) and another dropping off (Rooney or Mata).

Angel di Maria as a LAM, he will have an excellent cross but also he can drift central, I'm sure we will have one of our other wide players performing well enough as a RAM, the team might have the balance needed.

2311~~~
His father taught him everything about football mentality and his father was taught by Van Gaal. Almost a finished article with that kind of continuity. He only needs to sustain his usual consistency and learn just few more things about dynamics in the Premier League.

Can't say anything bad about him. Doing everything right at the moment and somebody here said before about being a future United captain material... If things will go that way then perhaps watch this space... unless we'll sign someone like Strootman but that doesn't mean anything now.

Laughable price for a consistency we lack in some United players these days.

2312~~~
Yeah. His crossing, passing and intelligence are genuinely world class for a fullback. Just doesn't have the athleticism.

2313~~~
If you could clone him I'd start 3 Daley Blind's

2314~~~
Intelligent with decent technique, keeps it simple. Like him a lot.

2315~~~
He's a very good player. Just proof of how important footballing intelligence can be.

2316~~~
Surprisingly enough, he's easily my favourite signing from summer. His beautiful hair certainly doesnt hurt his cause. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2317~~~
-



Assuming a successful summer, transfer wise, I'd go for 4231. Substitute Carrick for Strootman or Pogba. Rooney as no 10.



   ------ Rafael------Smalling -------- Rojo--------Shaw----------


     ------Strootman/Pogba   ======    Herrera/Blind ------------

         ------------ Januzaj------------------  Di Maria---------------------
                           ---------------------Rooney------------------------

                              -------------------Falcao/RVP-----------------------------

2318~~~
Would be a serious lack of pace in the team if that were to happen. That said, his footballing brain is excellent. I'd clone his brain for sure.

2319~~~
So, Blind's come out and responded to Gary Nevilles critique of him saying he plays too many square passes, takes the easy option... 
I don't think he needs to have justified himself, his performances this season have been right up there with DDG before his injury, it's staggering that out of all our players Nev would take aim at Blind, but then minutes later talk up Carrick, and Carricks role in the side, yet they're basically the same player and perform a very similar role with a similar degree of consistency.

2320~~~
Very odd choice for Neville's criticism. Only Carrick and De Gea have been as consistently excellent this season (Rooney's been up there too, though not quite so consistent.) I can't say how many square passes Blind has made - I don't pay much attention to stats like that because they so rarely say anything accurate about the actual football on the pitch - but what's been noticeable when he's on the pitch is how fluid he makes our passing, how much more easily we move the ball forwards when he's there at the base of midfield recycling it.

I think Neville likes to pick a United player who's doing well every now and then and have a go at them so everyone notices him being nice and 'objective' about United. He was slagging off de Gea long after everyone else had clocked on to the fact that the lad's brilliant, iirc.

2321~~~
I've noted that too, he's able to bring the ball out of the back and generally gets our play progressing forwards instead of having our back 3 recycle the ball endlessly between them and DDG, for me, he's been an absolute bargain in comparisson to the fee's we've paid out for others over the last 18months,
Nev was also critical of Mata at the time when we purchased him, which at the time seemed surprising, yet in hindsight we can now see where he was coming from so despite the fact he seems overly critical of United and our players at times, he may have a point somewhere that we can't see. (perhaps?)

Anyway here's the Blind article incase anyone missed it, he also speaks in trusting LvG's methods and formations <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/daley-blind-manchester-united-midfielder-8492192" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ey-blind-manchester-united-midfielder-8492192</a>

2322~~~
I said it in the Summer that he could be our most important signing this season because he adds the necessary balance to midfield and this was a glaring weakness in our squad before his arrival. Carrick is a different type of a midfielder and no one else can do this sort of job at all.

We should not forget how young he still is. There are some areas, like shooting, where I am pretty confident he will further improve (goal against West Brom was top notch). His on the ball technique is brilliant.

2323~~~
Like most said above,he is intelligent and thats why he can adopt with any problem,some players looking like bots compared to him.

2324~~~
Blind is performing well, and I'm pretty sure van Gaal has been happy with his performances.

2325~~~
feck off. He's incredibly blessed. Angelic.

2326~~~
When Blind has played in DM for us it's almost looked like a back three anyway, with the central defender pushing up. But as you say with the added benefit of actually being able to build from the back. We shouldn't need to play three central defenders when we have Blind playing on the pitch (provided he isn't filling in at left back).

2327~~~
This is what I've been banging on about for ages. Blind or Carrick as the CCB so they can push into midfield and make it the diamond when in possession.

2328~~~
Aye, with Carrick or Blind sitting in the midfield we usually end up with 6 defenders. Its ridiculous how deep we are at times with the ball, the 5 backs and Carrick will be in our own half just hanging around when half of them don't need to be there. Its a huge reason why we are so shit in attack imo.

2329~~~
I guess this is continuing the theme of bashing United's foreign young players.

2330~~~
Isn't Blind just following his manager's instructions? Think he's been great.

2331~~~
So neville is again talking bollocks..

2332~~~
Love these kind of posts. 

Not really.

2333~~~
Why? Most of us had only seen him at the World Cup where he played in a few different positions and didn't look anything special.

2334~~~
Of course people that doubted the move aren't clowns. This is just Rossi's way of making sure everyone else knows he's some kind of expert talent spotter whilst everyone who didn't spot Blind's obvious excellent ability to carry water is a moron.

2335~~~
Also because he doesn't rely on his physical attributes at all he will likely give us a long career. The fee is even lower when you divide it by the number of years we are likely to get from him, whatever role he plays in the team, that won't need replacing for a long time if he does it well.

2336~~~
Against QPR when they were very attacking Carrick was pushed back anyway and basically made a 3 at the back.

If it were me I would play Carrick as the central centre back, Blind as a holding CM, Fellaini as the box to box, this makes us defensively very solid, Angel di Maria as the CAM with Rooney up front partnered by Falcao or RVP unless the manager thinks Wilson will get goals consistently in these 16 games.

In striker we are a little slow but I think Angel di Maria running at players from central midfield ensures there is enough pace, Falcao or RVP will play off the shoulder of the defence and the timing of their runs in behind should allow us to cause opposition defences problems.

The key is the wide areas, the wing backs need to be wingers that can defend, Valencia can do it on the right but he lacks the cross. Rafael has a better cross but I'm not sure if he can beat his man consistently, perhaps Fellaini drifts a little to that flank to give him the overlap. 

On the left we could have done with Young but his injury means Shaw, I haven't seen enough of him here but Angel di Maria will be roaming so he might find himself putting crosses in from either flank and he has an excellent cross in my opinion.

2337~~~
Good Jesus <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously, you really think I'm trying to make myself out to be some sort of super scout?! Get a grip!

I had seen Blind play for Ajax a good few times and he was always very consistent in his performance. 
Then you add the World Cup into the mix.....Great passing, good vision, consistent, good positioning and anticipation, and all this at the height level. 
Then, we see his national team coach become our manager, a manager who loves Blind and Blind who is a big believer in LVG, and it was a clear no brainer to sign him!

Doesn't take a super scout to spot that! 
Course though, he probably wasn't good enough for some as he doesn't have a 90 rating in FIFA

2338~~~
That's what counts tbf...

2339~~~
That was my issue....I could not understand why people were saying no to him.

Nowt to do with me being a spotter of talent.

I thought Rojo was absolute dogshite but, he hasn't been bad at all.

2340~~~
Worst game of his United career; though he's been great so far. Seems his passing goes a little at left back (having watched him for Holland since the World Cup). Crossing usually impressive but not today.

2341~~~
Competed hard against Phil Jones for worst passer on the pitch. I suspect he finished a close 2nd. The weight of some of his passes was astonishing for someone who is normally so good on the ball.

2342~~~
Thought he did good.

2343~~~
He's clever but not a LB in this type of football. I know most will disagree but I prefer him in the #6 role to Carrick, he might not have as good a range of passing but he moves the ball much quicker into the forward players and recycles possession faster in general.

2344~~~
I love Carrick, but I agree with your reasoning for Blind.

2345~~~
Way too slow for a fullback

2346~~~
Play him as a CM. Wasted as LB.

2347~~~
Probably his worst game for us. Mishit loads of passes/crosses and generally didn't look comfortable with overlapping januzaj. 

Still showed good tackling skills when it mattered though.

2348~~~
Hopefully back in midfield at the weekend.

2349~~~
after Shaw/Rojo/James my 4th choice, can about do the job but it is like rooney as b2b, just wasted there atm.. those misplaced passes the lad thinks he can do van persie link up again. should be used like cdm nothing else

2350~~~
Just isn't a left back. If we weren't going to start Shaw, I'd rather Rojo at left back than Blind.

2351~~~
The simple passes were well off from him tonight. The one in the first half to Januzaj which he over hit was highly annoying.

He can definitely play the LB role, but give me Shaw with a winger in front all day please.

2352~~~
He wasn't as good as you make out in the world cup IMO. I thought he'd do OK for us as a sort of squad man/utility player. Didn't realise his passing was as good as it is. Suppose there was the ball for RvP's header against Spain, I had that down as a one off

2353~~~
Nah he was always very consistent.

I just couldn't believe some of the people on here.....We had finished 7th, looking to rebuild, without a midfield and people were saying no to the guy because he basically wasn't good in FIFA....It was a no brainer.

Nowt about me "spotting talent"....I always thought Rojo was shite but he seems to be OK here

2354~~~
He made several goals in the tournament with excellent passes from a leftback position

2355~~~
Intelligent but average player with a real lack of pace.

2356~~~
Our Gareth Barry and I mean no disrespect a great squad player and a quality addition.

2357~~~
He is a CM/DM and needs to be played there. Sick of moving players about into positions they can't actually play all that well. His lack of pace is startling though. Would like to see he, Fellaini and Mata in a race.

2358~~~
His worst performance for United by far. He's better in central midfield but a better LB than he showed last night. Never got to grip with the conditions or his man. He'll have better games. Still think he's quality wee player.

2359~~~
Pretty much. Good utility player but I'd still prefer Carrick in midfield and Shaw at left back. He was useless last night as he doesn't have the pace to overlap.

2360~~~
Nice to see how highly the Ajax fans rate him and how they still love him

(It says 'THANKS DALEY')

2361~~~
If LVG is worried about playing 4 at the back, why cant we play 4 at the back with Carrick and Blind as the protection in a 4231 type. Will allow Carrick and Blind to both play in a position they are comfy in plus bring out the best of the rest (and give us options on the bench)
This will allow a choice of three from Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, Herrera, Fellaini and then the 1 to be either RVP, Falcao or Wilson.

2362~~~
He's been brilliant so far, so many interceptions, tackles, aerial battles and he's putting pressure, best outfield player so far.

2363~~~
Great tackle and pass for the first goal

2364~~~
This guy.

2365~~~
Does he play this role better than Carrick?

2366~~~
For me he's one of the first names on the team sheet.

2367~~~
Clearly the best of the summer signings. And he was the cheapest.

2368~~~
Yep. Bargain.

2369~~~
He's so pwerty

2370~~~
Said it before, our best summer transfer by miles. Probably followed by Rojo.

2371~~~
Looking good again. Should always be starting in that role.

2372~~~
That ball to van Persie was a peach as well. I was waiting for him to bring back that type of delivery we saw in the World Cup, and he duly did so. Now can we please keep to the diamond with him as anchor?

2373~~~
No surprise we play with more attacking intent with a forward thinking player like Blind.

2374~~~
He keeps it simple, he knows how to give passing options to his teammates and he applies good pressure after a lost ball.

2375~~~
Brilliant thus far.

2376~~~
Solid so far.

Would like to see more forward passes <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2377~~~
He had one to diMaria/Falcao vs West Brom I remember.

2378~~~
He's better than Carrick. I'd rather see him start than Carrick, in all honesty. They're both very good but Blind is more attack minded than Carrick which is needed when we're playing against the weaker teams of the league.

2379~~~
<3 What a player

2380~~~
Against any team outside the top 6, he needs to be playing at DM. At home? he needs to be playing against any opposition at DM. Excellent performance.

2381~~~
Tidy little player for 12 million or whatever.

2382~~~
Watch how often he comes deep to get the ball. We are so much better at moving the ball because he helps out the defenders.

Breaking up play very well too.

2383~~~
Better than Carrick in every showing this season for me. He actually tries to win the ball, Carrick just shields the defence and therefor invites pressure. He is also more attacking minded in his passing, whilst being almost flawless.

2384~~~
Fixed. 

Sorry.  Couldn't resist.

2385~~~
The lad is brilliant. It's so pretty to see him make himself available and just pass it on.

2386~~~
Carrick's passing range is greater but Blind has more 'buzz'. His energy, mobility and dynamism are things Carrick lacks. We've got more oomph with Blind at #6.

2387~~~
In the very first minute he had a go at Jones for passing it back to DDG when Jones could have given Blind a simple pass as there was no need to go back. Good to see.

2388~~~
The only thing Carrick has over Blind is his organisational skills. You see him organising people around him and Blind doesnt do that, he just gets on with his job

2389~~~
He just understand the game, he is one of the best player at reading the game too. He is essential for us, now.

2390~~~
I saw that too, it tells you about his positive mindset.

2391~~~
I said it before in the other thread, carrick's injury is a blessing in disguise. Blind simply better in the anchor role.

2392~~~
great stuff from him so far. looks a bargain now for the price. literally Carricks heir.

2393~~~
£13.8M for Blind......A big plate of humble pie for me!

2394~~~
I think this will come in time, its his first season with us after all

2395~~~

2396~~~
Referring to him and RvP

2397~~~
Our best summer signing. Who would've predicted he'd be the most important out of all big name summer signings.

2398~~~
Yeah exactly, just talking about what you get with the two players right now and why Carrick was probably put back in when he got fit

2399~~~
And two assists.

2400~~~
Basically a Carrick with a bit more attacking intent and end product having cost less. Couldn't have asked for more <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2401~~~
Found it funny when the commentator said that Utd fans ask "what does he do ?"

2402~~~
Man crush. Brilliant signing.

2403~~~
Masterclass.

2404~~~
Very good game from him

2405~~~
They were also talking about how he just plays the easy pass, when earlier in the game he played the through ball for RVP's goal which was anything but the easy pass

2406~~~
He's Carrick with a forward pass.

2407~~~
very shrewd signing from LVG. Dependable, talented and controlling. Exactly what a team needs...

2408~~~
The commentator said "United fans might ask what he does for the team."

Err, no we wouldn't because it's very, very obvious, you knob. MOTM today.

2409~~~
Moves it quicker too, touch - pass - move.

2410~~~
Yes they did and even in the moment they said that, the pass he attempted wasn't easy.

2411~~~
Brilliant player, absolutely love him

2412~~~
Gun player and does the simple very well.

Captain after Rooney

2413~~~
Great performance with some superb performances. 
10/10 would watch again.

2414~~~
Don't think he could have played better today, apart from maybe scoring a 30 yard screamer. Top performance and kept us ticking over and the tempo high - which is exactly what we need.

2415~~~
He's brilliant.

2416~~~
What a player. Can't believe we got him that cheap in this inflated market.

2417~~~
Have to admit that I was very skeptical when we signed him, he's been a brilliant signing so far. Could easily be a key player for us for years.

2418~~~
And probably the least favourable. Negative Comments all summer about us signing him.

2419~~~
Easily best buy of the summer. Head (and shoulders) above the rest, maybe bar Rojo.

2420~~~
Majestic today. Linked up the defence/midfield/attack all by himself, had some brilliant tackles and interceptions and puts the cherry on the top with a brilliant assist

MOTM easily

2421~~~
MOTM by far. He was different class today and I can't recall him making a mistake today. Well worth the £15m we paid for him.

2422~~~
MOTM comfortably today, he moves the ball so efficiently and crisply when we win it back that we seem quicker all round with him in the #6 role.

2423~~~
Fantastic player, absolutely fantastic. I prefer him to Carrick to be honest.

2424~~~
I chose Rojo for MOTM but Blind had a great game as well. Helps that there was no pressure at all on the ball from Leicester City.

2425~~~
By far the best player on the pitch. The thing is, people say that all he does is "the easy stuff" but there is a skill to being able to pick up pockets of space like he does and then have the vision and passing range to spread the play and start attacks.

2426~~~
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Things Blind does better than Carrick</span>

<ul>
<li>More mobile on the ball, he is technically very gifted.. holds onto the ball with comfort and composure, it allows us to play despite being pressed by opponents because defenders know if they pass it to Blind, we aren't going to lose it. He can wriggle away and hit a forward pass.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Links up play better. He creates more triangle situations due to his movement to receive a pass. He makes it easier for others to play.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Can drift into wing or forward positions and create danger... because he is comfortable technically and running with the ball he can drift into attacking situations and not look like a duck out of water. He has a good feel for a delicate pass too.. Carrick isn't great at those soft defence-splitting passes, whereas Blind has a wand of a left foot.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>More aggressive tackler. Presses higher up the pitch and wins ball far in advance of the halfway line and allows us to counter-attack high up the pitch.</li>
</ul>That said, Carrick is better at defensive coverage and is proven against top teams. Unfair to compare them now, I still think we need to see Blind against top sides before we laud him as the Messiah. He is definitely a better player than Carrick against weaker sides and if we are to play a more attractive style of football, we need Blind in the side.. not Carrick.

2427~~~
He makes the basics look easy. Control the ball, look for space, pass the ball and move to get the ball.

2428~~~
Class today again. Proving to be an excellent signing, especially because of his versatility, consistency and intelligence. Still young too.

2429~~~
I've said this before, he should be the first midfielder on the team sheet.

2430~~~
He filled out the role perfectly today, MOTM clearly. 

It's the kind of game that suits him, though, when he has time and space to dictate the play. He has yet to prove that he can be as dominant when he's being pressured in an end-to-end game.

2431~~~
What an excellent player this guy is. Quite possibly our best outfield player this season.

If he was more of an athlete I think he'd be one of the best midfielders kicking around.

2432~~~
Masterclass. Easily the MOTM.

2433~~~
played a very good game. don't know why we'd be looking at another box to box player.

2434~~~
If anybody actually has to ask that, football isn't the right sport for them.

2435~~~
Magnificent player. What a great buy.

2436~~~
Well done Blind. First time I have seen him look like a genuine Man Utd player. He controlled the tempo, was outstanding in tight spaces.....could be a really wonderful player for us if he can maintain this form in bigger games

2437~~~
I love that he plays the ball in front of our defenders, forcing them to stride forward instead of dally on the ball.

That trait was something Scholes had as well. Ups the tempo in a very subtle but clever way.

Also comfortable under pressure.

2438~~~
What a game, reminiscent of Blind's awe-inspiring debut performance vs QPR where he completed 95 % passes from a total of 112 with 2 crucial tackles and sat deep, intelligently stifling out danger. Except his overall team-play seemed even better today from an offensive standpoint, threaded a couple of beautiful passes. And a calming presence in the center of the park to boot, easing a lot of pressure on the centerbacks.

2439~~~
£14m from Eredivisie isn't all that cheap really. IIRC anyone more expensive than him has either been a super-hyped talent or a forward of sorts.

2440~~~
Still, if you look purely at the price compared to his ability, there's no way you can look at it without it being a bargain.

2441~~~
Ran the show from midfield and showed great positional sense at times to help out our defence.

2442~~~
94% pass accuracy
5 interceptions
4 clearances
3 tackles won
2 assists

2443~~~
Yeah Blind was expensive for that league, I remember comments in the summer from Ajax that said they wouldnt let him go for a reasonable price because they wanted to keep him one more year and then after that they'd be more interested in letting him go at the prices players tend to move for.

Its just that he's settled as well as he possibly could have and playing his game just as easily in the premier league as he was for Ajax. So even if it was expensive to Ajax, its a fairly low key price for us for such a good performer.

2444~~~
He is one of the main reasons Ajax became champions three times in a row. De Boer changed him into a holding midfielder exactly because of the calming presence you mentioned. He compensates his lack of pace with excellent tactical awareness and therefore he is always one step ahead of his direct opponent/opposition. 4 years ago when he came back from his loan spell at Groningen he became a scape goat and the public opinion around him ( here in the Netherlands, especially the Ajax fanbase) was a bit cruel and now here he is bossing the midfield at United.

2445~~~
Considering his importance to the team and ability, I'd still categorize it as cheap. I doubt you can find anyone like him for the price we paid.

2446~~~
Lets put it this way, if Spurs bought him last summer and he played as he has for us, then next summer we tried to buy him they'd be telling us it'd cost £30 million.

So yes a bargain.

2447~~~
My MOTM today. Thought he was excellent.

2448~~~
Yep, that's spot on mate. 

His time, performances and positional change at Ajax under De Boer were discussed at length on the Caf during the summer transfer window and a lot of what you said came up at a time. Just hoping he further brings that totaalvoetbal mentality and success to United in terms of domestic and European silverware like papa Danny did for Van Gaal's Ajax. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2449~~~
With Rojo looking solid recently ...all LVG's signings are starting to look like winners apart from Herrera who possibly was more of a Moyes signing that LVG picked up on.....but Herrera for sure could become outstanding too but I am not sure LVG rates him after having a proper look at him

2450~~~
Jesus, you'll offend plenty with that statement

2451~~~
Let's make a prediction: He'll end up this season as our 2nd best player only behind de Gea. 

For me, he is already our best performer of all outfield players this season.

2452~~~
he had a great game, this matches really suits him when he can get on the ball a lot and sorta dictate the play from the back. He can play through balls too. BUt I guess much better oppositions will come and we will play away from home so he needs to show it at that time.. but improvement on Carrick for sure. Still we need at least one defensive midfielder..

2453~~~
does great against the weakest side in the league suddenly becomes the best player.. logic

2454~~~
What a player

2455~~~
If he can manage what he's showed us today on the road, we'll have some midfielder on our hands. He clearly thrives when he's been given space.

2456~~~
It's remarkable how quickly he has slotted back in after his injury, straight in to the starting XI without any sub appearances and has put in a couple of excellent performances.

2457~~~
He's been great all season. And the season was what he was talking about, not one game.

2458~~~
Saw him as a good depth signing but he really has impressed in midfield, think he should be starting most of our matches and paired with Carrick in the tougher ones

2459~~~
I'm thinking of leaving my wife and kid for him

2460~~~
He's not been great all season, that's just not true.

Was fantastic today though.

2461~~~
I agree it wasn't his only good game, played well whenever used as CDM but as I mentioned above tougher opposition will come, they will press higher and so on. He is very comfortable in games like this passing around when no pressure on him, Carrick would have a good game as well today as he is also rather passing DM than tackler.

Anyway Blind won good number of challenges and I liked him but I don't want to get carried away. We need another CDM to make competition for Blind as Carrick has got possibly the last season in him next year..

2462~~~
Except that he was excellent in pretty much every game he played against any opponent.

2463~~~

2464~~~
Need to sign a midfielder to compliment him in the summer. It's clear Blind is the future #6 in our midfield. Get a more powerful box to box option and we'll be set.

Been very impressed with Blind so far. I still think Carrick is the better of the two, but Carrick will be 34 in the summer, and should be treated as so.

What's bizarre is Herrera - Blind midfield sounds on paper great, yet Herrera is constantly benched.

2465~~~
Fantastic game and he is without doubt our best signing from the summer, certainly on a £/talent basis.

2466~~~
To back-up my words, these are comments after the City game earlier in the season:










Post Chelsea game:









Of course, there were few negative comments inbetween, but majority of people is happy with him throughout the whole season, not just after the game against worst team in the league. He's been excellent this season taking everything into account.

2467~~~
I prefer him there to Carrick. He's more dynamic and a more adventurous passer. I'm not sure yet if he's quite as solid defensively, although his tackling and interception stats would suggest he's fine in that regard.

2468~~~
He has though.

He's barely had a bad game.

2469~~~
Pogba?

2470~~~
He has been a cracking buy, proving he is our best holding player at the club.

2471~~~
He was poor against Cambridge and that was last week.

2472~~~
excellent is exaggerating, really man<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

This was his best performance and made another when he could be awarded MOTM it is true but apart that he was just about good and had some average games at LB/LWB, he has the consistency tho, so I'm starting to like him..

2473~~~
That's who I'd want, but think we will go all out for Strootman

2474~~~
I would have been happy with Strootman before his latest injury setback. Need to see how he recovers now.

2475~~~
This is exactly why the Carrick injury news isn't too bad. Cracking player, perfectly suited to the philosophy.

2476~~~
Pressing doesn't bother him at all though, he's absolutely comfortable in taking possession surrounded by players

2477~~~
He seriously deserves better midfield partners. A defensively sound box-to-box midfielder and another very creative one with a good goal-threat would make the perfect 3 imo.

2478~~~
I don't know where to find it but I'm almost sure he has better defensive stats than Carrick. I think that the difference attacking-wise when he is at the base of midfield is much bigger.

2479~~~
Disappointed that I missed the match. I love watching him play.

2480~~~
f**king brilliant player.

best signing of last summer imo. remember being more excited about his signing than di maria.

2481~~~
And in his thread the comments pointed out that it was by far his worst game for us yet, and even then it was only below average. He's been consistently one of our best players in nearly every game.

2482~~~
Had a great game, I think

2483~~~
He played left back in that game.

2484~~~
He was average against Southampton as well and like the rest of the team disappeared in the reverse fixture against Leicester.

He's been good. There's no need to exaggerate his performances.

2485~~~
he's absolutely pirlo I know

2486~~~
Aye, I do seem to remember reading that he makes more tackles and interceptions per game than Carrick. If there's any basis at all to my feeling that Carrick might still offer more defensive security, its probably that he's more conservative in terms of his positioning, whereas Blind is quicker to push on and attack. Either way, I agree with you. I prefer watching Blind in that position due to his attacking output.

2487~~~
He was still probably our best player in that game as many of the comments afterwards allude to. I'm not trying to paint him as one of the best midfielders in the world or anything like that, but it's absolutely true that he has been our most consistent outfield player this season. Absolutely delighted with him as I knew very little about him before he came, so he has surpassed all expectations I had and I imagine others are in the same boat, hence the praise.

2488~~~
It's what makes him so good. Not many players can do that.

2489~~~
Im much more interested in his twin, Danny Blint, who seems to be playing for us.

2490~~~
Once again, I love him. He's calmly assured in everything he does, just like Carrick, but 10 years younger.

2491~~~
He really is like a young, left footed, dreamy, Michael Carrick.

2492~~~
He's a bit of a hot head, short back and sides hair cut, bundles of pace.

2493~~~
It's not exaggerating in any way to say he's been one our best players and is extremely consistent.

2494~~~
I have to say I was against this deal in the summer, but he is the best signing we made. I thought he'd struggle with this league, but he's physically up to it.

2495~~~
I'm a huge fan, prefer him to Carrick and I'm a big Carrick supporter.

2496~~~
His style of  play reminds me very much of Dennis Irwin, always dependable, rarely has a bad game.

2497~~~
---------Blind-------------
----The-------Rest--------



please.

2498~~~
Same stuff was rolled out with Carrick for years. Was always apparent to anyone who actually went to the trouble of watching the game.

2499~~~
Didn't watch a lot of his father but how good was he and can Daley become as good as him, if not better?

2500~~~
He's making a lot of you look like utter bell ends. 

I remember reading through this thread when we signed him and people were saying he was average and at 24 had no scope to improve. Just a snapshot of the sort of shite that appears on a worryingly regular basis on here.

I'd dig them out if I could be arsed. I'm sure they know who they are.

2501~~~
I have no issue being wrong. I do not take this stuff too seriously.

2502~~~
Blind only had a significant impact in the last two Eredivisie seasons, and the time he spend as a holding midfielder was one season. He was *really* bad in his first season as left back and even after showing some improvement in his second year his contact would probably not have been extended had Boilesen not been injured.

Vernon Anita was the key player that reinvented the DM position and helped Ajax win the first two of four championships, and in honesty was the better holding midfielder (except he made a dumb transfer to Newcastle and is now rotting away there as that club has no clue how to use him). De Boer is blind as a bat when it comes to judging midfielders and messed about with failed experiments like Janssen before injuries forced him to play a technically gifted player like Aissati and later Anita in that position, which proved crucial in their second season half comeback. After Anita left De Boer mucked about with that turd from Liverpool (Poulsen) when injuries yet again rescued him as he was forced to move Blind to DM and again the team rapidly improved. Blind only made the world cup squad as Holland has no half decent left backs, and I doubt Blind would have made a transfer without his WC performance and Van Gaal. Blind made the most of the chances he got, but he can't complain about luck in his career.

2503~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/daley-blind-deal-confirmed.391391/page-37">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/daley-blind-deal-confirmed.391391/page-37</a>

Here we go.

Enjoy the first few pages. Love how all of a sudden the Caf had loads of posters who watched Eredivisie regularly.

2504~~~
I was very unsure of him as I'd only watched him for the Netherlands.

He's been excellent though. One thing: He's not got the pace to play as a full back. DM please.

2505~~~
I like players like him. No fuss. Liked the assist he supplied to RVP and hopefully it gives him confidence to do that more often which would add a new dimension to his game. MOTM today.

2506~~~
Not really a new dimension he's demonstrated his eye for a pass and the ability to pull it off - remember RvP's flying dutchman vs Spain? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2507~~~
Has anyone mentioned how dreamy he is? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2508~~~

2509~~~
.

That man knows what he's talking about.

2510~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I think that you are in love.

2511~~~
I definitely am <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

His missus isn't half bad either <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2512~~~
Yup, has it in him to do it on regular basis.

2513~~~
I prefer him to Carrick in that DM role. Needs to be played there too, not shifted out to LWB or whatever.

2514~~~
I was really impressed at how often he found a forward pass to feet today. He really cut through their midfield in a way that only Carrick has managed for us in recent years.

2515~~~
Well to be fair he still gets an enormous amount of cristism here in the Netherland. A lot of people want Clasie in our NT midfield. They dislike Blind because he -according to some people- doesnt take any risk and always goes for the sideway pass.

Personally i didnt expected him to be good enough. A decent squad player but no first 11. So far he is proving me wrong.

He is a bit of a special case though. he wasnt good enough to be in the Ajax squad, their fans were even wistling at him. Ajax almost sold him to some Belgium club but my hometown club FC Groningen loaned him. He became a left midfield and did very good. he returned to Ajax to play as a left back but after a while Frank de Boer placed him in midfield because Anita left and de Boer thought that Blind had to footballing brain to play as dmc. He did very well there, he had a great WC and now he's playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. He just keeps proving people wrong.

2516~~~
So Herrera and Mata then.

2517~~~
Fellaini and Herrera rather.

2518~~~
That's a bit harsh dont you think? You think the best player of the Eredivisie only got the chance to be in the squad because Holland doesnt have a decent lb? Even if they had one, he'd be in the squad in stead of Clasie or Wijnaldum. Blind would defo get a transfer, not to Man Utd per se but he had good performances in Europe too and was arguably the best player in the Eredivisie, you can point it to luck, I'd rather point it to hard work and the ability ti acclamatise.

2519~~~
Quality performance. I love the way he positions himself. You can tell how he's a proper, proper central midfielder by the way he adjusts his positioning and has an awareness about him. He's never just standing around. And it's all the more contrasting when you put someone like rooney next to him who is more of an attacker.

He should be our first choice holding midifelder ahead of Carrick Imo.

Definitely.

2520~~~
He keeps getting called a squad player by many here, but I keep asking, on what basis is that judgement made?

2521~~~
A good performance yesterday, nice to see him push forward at times during the match which proved to be affective.

2522~~~
How anyone could watch Blind and still think Carrick is good is beyond me. Blind does everything a player in that role should do, move around the pitch, shoot when necessary and spray some passes, not stand still and play it to the fullbacks.

2523~~~
I never understand why people compare Blind defensively to Carrick. The latter is always effecting the game due to his immaculate positioning, which is why people say that you don't realise how important he is until he's not there. Blind is a much more "in your face" type of DM. Not in the sense that he puts himself about, but he's a lot more mobile than Carrick and is a able to nip infront of players and intercept the ball when he anticipates passes. 

He's not as good as Carrick yet, he gets caught out at times and he hasn't got the passing range, although he's still a very good passer. Carrick is brilliant, and it's exciting to know that Blind will be learning of such an assured midfielder, it bodes well for the future.

2524~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Carrick is gash. He ruins so many attacks it's unreal.

2525~~~
There is no need to try and downplay Carrick when praising Blind.

 Unfortunately Carrick is now creaking, I hope he jacks in playing for England.

2526~~~
What a ridiculous comment. In no way, shape or form is Carrick "gash" nor does he ruin attacks. He may struggle to create openings due to the limited formation we've been using, but he has the greatest passing range at the club and probably in the league, so if there were clear passes that he'd have to make, he'd make them.

2527~~~
Kinda off-topic, but people tend to forget that Carrick coming back from injury was when we actually started winning games. He was great in November-December and doesn't deserve the hate. As for Blind, I love the guy, strikes me as captain material.

2528~~~
Carrick has better ability in his leadership and positioning himself on the break, which both he and Blind are a bit iffy with as they lack pace. Carrick does that better, whilst Blind is far better under pressure and with his technique. I'd say Carrick is better in the air and more physically conditioned. Of course, a lot of this will come to Blind with time, so I'm really impressed.

2529~~~
Can't be arsed to find the quote again but on point that Blind "shoots when necessary" I'd have to disagree. It got to the point where I actually muttered "for feck sake" before he shot and it went in. He'd benefit a lot if he learned to use Scholes-esque disguises and slip someone in, because sometimes the shots just aren't on. He's not got a bad shot on him though so I don't mind him having a pop from outside the area.

2530~~~
That's also when we started playing really tedious and going to matches started to feel like a chore. 

Funny that.

2531~~~
What is this bullshit?

2532~~~
So you enjoyed watching us drop points more regularly? Interesting.

2533~~~
It's the truth is what it is. 

I enjoyed watching good football. That run was full of horrific stuff. If I wanted to watch dull football but winning I'd watch Barcelona. I want entertainment with my football.

2534~~~
At this point in time I'll take boring 1-0 wins over losing 5-3 to relegation candidates. We've not been exciting to watch all season bar a couple of fixtures, that's nothing to do with Carrick. You're just going to have to accept that becoming the best team in the league that plays the best football may take a season or two longer than you'd expect.

2535~~~
He's just like Carrick except he's not a massive fanny and occasionally does things with the ball.

2536~~~
No it's definitely bullshit.

2537~~~
Thank feck we sacked you.

2538~~~
Well, if anyone knows anything about talking shit it's you.

2539~~~
But just think of the (backwards) pass completion stats!!!!

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2540~~~
But you know that this myth has been dispelled some time ago?

2541~~~
Anyone who hates on Carrick doesn't understand the role he plays for us when he is in the team. Of course they have also conveniently forgotten his contribution towards the team for almost a decade. There is a reason why his team mates regularly praise him.

2542~~~
Amazing that people still say that about Carrick. Just last year Fergie was calling him the best English player and the best midfielder in the EPL, what does he know, eh?

2543~~~
Wher does the illusion come from that Carrick is better defensivelyem? Blind has more interceptions, clearances per game and wins more tackles, in terms of the percentage of duels won they're similar. I think Blind acts faster and is more aggresive, while Carrick really shields our defence. Vs smaller teams I prefer the former, but vs top teams that's quite risky.

2544~~~
Take that bit longer to filter through to idiots, evidently.

2545~~~
Fine, replace "backwards" with "utterly pointless and removing all momentum". 

He also said Phil Jones was the new Duncan Edwards, spent 7 million pounds on Bebe, refused to sign any good midfielders and let Pogba go on a free because he thought RAFAEL AND PARK JI SUNG were better options. 

Maybe you should put less stock in what one man says.

2546~~~
Anyone else realise he speaks exactly like Van Gaal when questioned about football. He always talks about the way we play, and possession and keeping the ball. He probably is Van gaal's favourite student as I think he gets the "philosophy"  more than anyone in this team. We need more players with his thinking in the team.

2547~~~
He's always injured when internationals are around the corner anyway.

In regards to downplaying Carrick, it's happening. It's the first time since 2010 (when Fletcher eventually started to fade away) that we've had a proper alternative. Blind has had his fair share of passive/safe games. His most memorable performances are against Leicester and QPR. No reason to downplay him either.

2548~~~
You can take Ajax away from them, but you can't take Ajax out of them.

2549~~~
With all due respect but that doesn't mean much at all. Remember the Jones comparisons? I do think Blind is an improvement on Carrick already. He reads the game just as well and obviously is way younger, has more drive in him. He is like the Carrick of a few years ago.

2550~~~
Yeah, it seems that the players from Ajax who go to the PL tend to come good. Think they are a great school for Footballers.

2551~~~
Because he doesn't have to win the ball back himself to be doing a job. Cutting out options due to his positioning, which then forces opponents to go long for example, is just as effective as going in making tackles and interceptions.

2552~~~
He's nothing like Carrick a few years ago. When Carrick was quite young at United he wasn't anywhere near as comfortable on the ball as Blind is, and their style defensively is completely different.

2553~~~
Carrick a few years ago was one of the best CM out there. Their style is also not that different at all defensively. Both read the game very well, both cannot rely on pace or physical strenght but intelligent positioning.

In 12/13 yes, but he wasn't young then, so I assumed you were more referring to 2007-10 period. Also, reading the game is an essential for their role, not a style. No one chooses not to read the game for the sake of being a different type of player; which would be a completely average one.

They don't have pace, but Blind is a lot more agile and mobile than Carrick. That allows him to nip in to make interceptions and press higher, and it is also why he's more comfortable under pressure. Carrick defensively is just there, quite simply. Good players don't play the ball to players who aren't available to receive it, and that's pretty much Carricks philosophy and why his defensive contribution often goes unnoticed. As I've mentioned, Blinds contributions defensively aren't hard to spot at all.

2556~~~
Still doesnt mean he's better defensively, and you could argue that Blind's style fits LVG's philosophy better. I think LVG wants to play like Barcelona did/does, with direct pressing and 'aggresiveness'.

2557~~~
It doesn't, you're right, that's where it comes down to personal preferences and opinions. You implied in your post though that Blind is better defensively because of statistics like tackles, interceptions and clearances, which is also not a given, as explained. One thing I will say is that you acknowledged that Blinds style is more risky vs better sides, and risky is something I wouldn't want to associate with defending. 

At the moment, Blind does tend to get caught out at times, and it was most evident vs City where he's against better players. That's something he'll improve with experience, he's only 24, but Carrick's style of defending is effective regardless of opposition whereas that's not the case at this moment in time for Blind. I do agree he fits the philosophy though.

2558~~~
It's risky if he's the only one who does it, but if LVG can utilize it good, it's a strategy which works 99%. Barcelona didnt have the best defenders, but because of the pressure they put, they conceded almost nothing and countering them became close to impossible. Carricks method doesnt always work, especially when you play vs dynamic players, against Arsenal for example, he was almost none existent, they werent pressured and with players like Wilshere, Cazorla, Ox, Sanchez, you just invite them to put pressure on us. That to, is a system which requires your team mates to help, people have to close down openings, position themselves excellently and you're solid as a rock, something SAF really mastered imo. Other than that, I think Blind was amongst the better players vs City/Chelsea, he got caught out at times, but I dont know anyone who wouldnt vs such brilliant dynamic players. Even Matic got caught out plenty of times vs Players like Coutinho, Sterling, Silva and even Milner.

It will be interesting, here in Fox they showed how United were defending, closing players down immediately, others covering the players who went closing down, if we master this, I think it's the best way of defending, we also have the right defenders with pace and tackling abilities to accomplish this. Jones, Rojo, Smalling are relatively very pacey for defendees, still havent seen someone beat Smalling on pace.

2559~~~
But that's the thing, Barcelona's style of play wasn't risky because they had the players to perform it who understood what they were doing. By definition, for something to be risky there has to be a considerable chance it won't work, and Barcelona were pretty much flawless during their prime. 

With regards to Carrick vs Arsenal, he was non existent more due to the fact that the ball wasn't getting as far as him. We had two young centre halves next to Smalling and we constantly gave the ball away in defence and left ourselves exposed and outnumbered. If you're so sloppy in possession, there's no style of defending that would have been successful.

2560~~~
What a shithouse post.

2561~~~
For van Gaal's "philosophy", it's not a stretch to say he's the most important player at United.

2562~~~
It's something which LVG has always done, he did it with the Netherlands before the injury of Strootman, if we get Strootman, I wouldnt be surprised if he's gonna insert that style.

We lost the ball vs Arsenal too much, same can be said vs City. But unlike vs Chelsea, our midfield was none existent and defensively they did nothing. There were openings, Arsenal could put pressure on us and we couldnt catch them, with Carrick as the only CDM then, it was way too dangerous.

It's also a style which isnt unknown by Blind, Ajax did the same last season and were very solid defensively without having the best defenders, since Blind left, it has collapsed.

2563~~~
He was playing next to Fellaini, who had an abysmal game, keep ting giving the ball away and left him exposed. As I say, that's not a failure in Carricks style of play, if you keep losing the ball in stupid areas you're pretty much helpless.

2564~~~
Well at a certain period, later in the match, Fellaini did more work than Carrick. He was actually winning the ball and tried to block balls.

2565~~~
Worst post of 2015 so far.

2566~~~
It's almost as if you've completely forgotten what I've been saying about why Carrick is so good defensively during this whole debate.

2567~~~
I think it's quite louzy, it looks like its an excuse to doing literally nothing. He didnt influence the game in any point, he got caught out all the time, with that argument, Carrick is never at fault. It was true that we were sloppy, but Carrick didnt do anything and his approach was way to passive.

2568~~~
Ramsey was pretty much anonymous all game bar one shot and eventually was substituted. Coincidence?

Edit: I've also just been reliably informed that Carrick actually made the block which lead to the 2nd goal in this particular game. Interesting stuff.

2569~~~
What a non-argument, what about Wilshere and Chambo.

2570~~~
The notion was that Carrick was asked to perform specific duties on Ramsey. No idea why you'd mention Chamberlain when he was playing on the wing. As for Wilshere, he was playing left of centre which is where Fellaini was (or wasn't).

Anyway, we've gone off on enough of a tangent already. I've outlined how Carrick's style of defending is effective regardless of the system, and you've given an inaccurate example of one game that may suggest otherwise, so I'd like to think I've put a stronger case for Carrick being better defensively than Blind.

On the contrary, I like Blind and I think he is very good defensively also, and will only improve with experience. It's a lot more satisfying being able to appreciate to players ability without having to go out of my way to downplay the other, but a decent debate has been turned a bit silly now so we'll leave it there, there's not a lot more I can say on the matter.

2571~~~
This is not FIFA, man marking isnt part of our game. With all those changes of positions it would be silly to look at the player who's opposite on the line up. 

There's not much you've said about Carrick accept for his invisible contribution of whom  you havent really given examples. Carrick's best defensive performance was vs City, why dont you give examples of that, where he was actually helping the defence, clearing blocks, intercepting, positioning himself and others.

2572~~~
You do realise man marking is a tactic that is used in every game? Charlton-Beckenbauer in the 60's, Keane-Vieira, Xavi-Pirlo in the 4-0 battering a couple of years ago. Fletcher always used to man mark Lampard when we played Chelsea, there's a few well known examples. You make tactical preferences in order to nullify the opposition, that's just blatantly obvious and if you don't understand such basic aspects of football then it explains why youre completely ignorant to Carricks qualities as a footballer.

In terms of examples, they've already been covered. Carrick comes back, we suddenly stop conceding and start winning games. To reiterate, "you don't understand his influence until he's not there" whys that even a quote? Because the best examples of his defending aren't obvious.

Anyway, the best thing I can present to you is a video Gary Neville does, which is pretty much Carrick for beginners;

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDgAC2dQfqM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2573~~~
For some reason I totally forgot he was only 24. What a signing.

2574~~~
Oh and that wasnt because of de Gea saving our ass? We could concede 5 easily vs Liverpool alone and played with 5 defenders. Not fully Carrick's class that's led to that. 

I know man marking exist, but it would be laughable to judge a player's performance on the player that was opposite to him in the line up, especially vs Arsenal, they olay such interchanginf football that that's just ridiculous.

2575~~~
Just watched the vid, that's exactly what I was talking about, him closing down the areas, making players unavailable and what Fergie mastered, but vs Arsenal, with those super dynamic players it just didnt work. It would need a superhuman to try and stop Arsenal's dynamic and interchangeable midfield. Their midfielders got the ball easily as it was just too much, even City has struggled to do that. Only Barca in recent years has entirely dominated their midfield, and that was by putting enormous pressure on them.

2576~~~
We've been going man for man in every big game this season lmao. Fellaini-Cesc, Rooney-Toure, Carrick-Ramsey. van Gaal did the same in the World Cup, see De Jong-Messi. If you are given a role to nullify the biggest threat of the opposition and you do it successfully, you've had a good game, so long as you haven't done anything ridiculous in possession. I saw another example in the 4141 thread before, Park-Pirlo. Did Park have a good game in your opinion? The only reason they're opposite each other in the team sheet is because they've been placed there for a reason.

2577~~~
At the risk of repeating myself, again, we gave them the ball under pressure which meant we were unorganised defensively. After the first 30 minutes when we weren't under such pressure they didn't really create anything apart from the goal.

2578~~~
Carrick hasn't been brilliant for a long time now. Blind has been one of our best players this season.

2579~~~
Incorrect, he had a poor season last season and has come back strong this one. If you have any replies, you can check any of my posts over the last page or 2 for my response.

2580~~~
Hilarious.

2581~~~
Would you describe him as brilliant since the last time we won the title?

I'm not even sure whether Carrick not being brilliant is supposed to be seen as a dig at him. He's a very good midfielder and has been great for us over the years. But I wouldn't call his peformances for the last season and a half or more brilliant, although he has been unlucky with injuries at times.

2582~~~
He's been alright this season's so far. No offense but I don't care enough to go looking for your previous posts.

2583~~~
None taken, it was more a way of me saying I've exhausted my opinion about Carrick/Blind over the last couple of pages and can't really be arsed to go over it again haha.

2584~~~
Fair enough.

2585~~~
Before I answer your question, I am curious to know if you think Blind (in his current form) is better than Carrick (in his prime).

2586~~~
Nah, Carrick was the best midfielder in England the last time we won the league, which was his best season.

2587~~~
Then fair enough. Perhaps I misinterpreted what you said. While Carrick hasn't been brilliant (by his standards) this season, he has in my opinion, had very good games since his return from injury.(during Blind's absence). 

We must after all remember that Carrick has over the years, always had slow starts to the season. (Remember how Fergie mentioned this during his press conferences).Once he gets into his groove he's excellent. Unfortunately for him, the injuries this season(perhaps owing to his age) are preventing him from having a consistent run in the team. So my argument is that he 'couldn't' be brilliant so far. Last season, was an anomaly. Under Moyes many in the team under performed and I wouldn't hold that against him.

To summarize,my view on Carrick is pretty much the same as yours. (In terms of him being the best in England when we won the league). Over the last few pages, in this thread however, I can see a lot of Carrick bashing and frankly its frustrating.

I like Blind, but I don't rate him as high as I rate Carrick (not at this stage). I would say though that he has been one of the most consistent performers this season.

2588~~~
Blind has to be our best buy in the last 2-3 seasons! Totally worth what we spent on him, our best CM buy since Hargreaves

2589~~~
He was one of our best players against City and Chelsea.

2590~~~
He's had a tough competition tho. This is another reason why he looks so good he's been actually the only CM signing since Hargo

2591~~~
Carrick has been such an integral part of United most successful period, so it is hard to say Blind is already the better player. 

But so far, the sign is encouraging, and I hope he won't be restricted to a mere hardman / Makelele's DM.

2592~~~
Blind can be a monster for us. A really good signing, Louis. Dank je wel.

2593~~~
Herrera, Fellaini and Anderson were bought to play in midfield.. its not that he's been average or that we haven't had any good midfielders in the past to compare his performances against And say he's been a good buy

2594~~~
Anderson was brought at the same time as Hargo, forgot about Fellaini completely.. I wouldn't compare Blind to Herrera yet after his MOTM performance but against the worst opposition in the league. 

Herrera had a couple of great games too and didn't really have a chance to impress. And I rate him higher anyway, even for the money. He will be integral part of our success in the years coming, with Blind I am still not sure even I am starting to like him, I just don't see his ceiling as high as say Herrera's or diMaria's.. I dare to say this in DB thread so I will be smashed I know.

Blind, Herrera and Fellaini doesn't make a big number. Obviously Scholesy and Giggsy prolonged their career etc.. but still I think Fergie should have bought at least replacement for Carrick long time ago..

2595~~~
Stop the bickering guys, play both of them I say.

--Herrera--Carrick--Blind--
-------Rooney--DiMaria---
---------Falcao/RVP------

Id try something like that...

2596~~~
Strange. Hargreaves completely bombed as a CM and had to make do with playing wide. Blind is clearly an infinitely better signing for midfield

2597~~~
You could see Carrick deep, Blind just ahead of him and DiMaria or Herrera in front bursting forward being a good midfield in tough games. 

The most encouraging thing about Blind is that he's probably not done improving as a DM. 2 seasons ago he was at LB and he's only 24. I think many of us assume he's got a low ceiling due to his being used as a utility guy and his lack of pace, but he's smart, pays attention defensively and has the ability to spot creative passes from deep, so who knows.

2598~~~
Maybe we should actually be building our midfield around this guy, rather than looking at Strootman/Vidal and the other big names. Surround him with players that will allow him to play his game at the best of his ability, players who make up for his lack of physical strength and will get forward and give Blind good options for progressive passes.

2599~~~
Smart player, not really physical buth with a very good pass and sound ability to read the game on him. I'd prefer this season's Blind to this season's Carrick. Although Michael at his peak was one of the best midfielders in the league, whereas Daley is yet to reach those heights (but its obvious he has the potential to do so).

2600~~~
Blind and Felliani for the next game against West Ham.. I would line up this way.
---Back 4--
--Felliani--Blind
Demaria  Januzaj
Rooney--RVP/Falcao

2601~~~
I can see the value in your reaction There were rumours in public that Martin Jol (the predecessor of De Boer) was not that impressed of him and that he could leave the club. During this time the infamous ‘fluwelen revolutie’ started, whereby Cruyff and his buddies basically shook the whole club and demanded a new policy based on youth and future investment. His dad Danny blind became the assistent and  its commonly known that if you win the trust of de Boer, you will definitely see a lot of football. He also made his debut against arch rivals Feyenoord. Basically, all the pieces came together for him to flourish under De Boer and eventually becoming what he became today.

He had a slow start, yes i agree with you. There were even times where he got booed by the fans in the Arena. There is a fine line between failure and success and Blind fit thats profile perfectly. For example, in 2012 there was a home match against AZ Alkmaar and they played a piss poor match and when he got substituted the fans massively cheered for it. 2 years later, again a home match between Ajax and Alkmaar the public massively cheered ‘ one more year, one more year’! So, yes, i think he contributed the most during the last 2 seasons.

Regarding Anita, yes he became a stable midfielder under De Boer. His lack of height was/is compensated with his grit and he is not doing that bad at Newcastle, right ? I don't think its a coincidence that Blind had a good WC performance and that he is developing as a United midfielder. Historically, there is a long list of players who transfered to a big club after a World Cup, so i dont think there is anything wrong with that. Van Gaal is well known in possessing 'profiles' of players that suit his system in the most effective manner. Blind was not the only LB that we ( Holland had). In the 5-3-2 system he flourished because of the wide spaces between the wing back. Yes, we dont have an abundance of talented left backs. We had/have players like Emanuelson, Van Aanholt and even Buttner. At one point atleast 5 players were linked with United ( De Vrij, Martins Indi, De Jong, Vlaar and Blind). Conclusion, Blind had his share of luck during his career, but the fact that he overcame that is a big advantage. Football is not only about having your bench or start time, it's also about mental growth and becoming stronger to face the challenges that one will have in his career. I applaud him for that.

2602~~~
Quickly becoming my favorite player. So intelligent on the ball and always seems to be in the right place.

2603~~~
Extremely close second place behind Rojo for me at the moment <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2604~~~
Another very good performance by him, he'll continue to improve. Hope he can maintain this form vs better opponents, starting with coming weekend.

2605~~~
Daley Blind is one of the reasons I love football. His calmness on the ball and reading of the game defensively is just a joy to watch.

2606~~~
He got annoyed with Evans after the 80th minute, anyone else noticed this too? Evans kept on passing to Smalling instead of Blind, good to see Daley shouting at him. Because the lack of the right pass through the centre from defense to midfield has been killing us this season.

2607~~~
Good to see someone shouting to Evans instead of the other way around too.

2608~~~
Yep, good to see that.

2609~~~
Noticed that as well. Great to see.

2610~~~
The new Mr. Reliable and future Captain.

2611~~~
Yeah, it was the obvious pass to get something started, instead Evans just passes it sideways, got me a little bit pissed.

2612~~~
Is that when Blind put his arms out?

2613~~~
Was delighted to see someone give Evans a bollocking. He looked good in preseason and as soon as the league kicked off he went missing. He's petrified when he's got the ball at his feet and constantly looks panicked.,

2614~~~
Has been one of my favourite players since he arrived but he does need to cut out the odd mistake, considering where he plays for us. Hes hardly Evans level but gift a chance like that to an Aguero and we're a goal down.

2615~~~
Class again (ignoring the stumble pass he had in the first minute). Such a calm and intelligent player. I knew he was an intelligent player and neat and tidy, and versatile, but the thing that I didn't expect from him when we signed him was that he is actually quite physical. Like he's quicker then I thought, never seems to get tired, is stronger then he looks and doesn't seem to get beat in the air too often. A steal at 14mil IMO.

2616~~~
I'll add on to that by mentioning that he possesses great ball control, allowing him to maintain possession even if 2-3 opposing players come to win it off of him. In the summer, when I saw that he was signing for us, I was very happy because I knew that we got ourselves sorted for the defensive midfield role with him, and I'm very happy to see him show that.

He's been excellent in his positioning both when we have the ball and when we don't. His reading of the game is very good as well, and he also has the bite to allow him to win the ball in midfield. Plus, going forward, he can get us a goal or two with his long shots, and he's also decent at playing through attacking players.

Against Cambridge, he was the focal point in midfield in terms of starting off attacks for us. He was one of the main reasons for us playing at a faster tempo than we've ever done, recently.

2617~~~
I thought he was just alright - not really his fault as there wasn't really that much for him to do. Still covered a lot of ground and was generally tidy... oh, and that was a cracking through-ball to their striker. 

Goes to show though, if Evans had done that (who had a similarly fine, not amazing) performance, I imagine that's what anyone who ventured into his thread would be talking about...

2618~~~
The problem is the mistake was a result of Di Maria smashing the ball into his feet from a yard away. Not really his fault

2619~~~
Come on, he didn't hit it at him that hard (it wasn't as hard as say, the passes we continually like to smash at Valencia - who in turns smashes it at an opposing player) - the actual problem was that it wasn't very accurate, but Blind should have done better then just prodding it into danger.

2620~~~
It's true, that mistake can't happen against a stronger opposition team, no excuse there for Blind.

2621~~~
Great signing., an intelligent no nonsense midfielder. Who would have thought that him and Rojo (by coincidence both WC semi finalists who played against each other) would be our most important signings of the summer.

2622~~~
I thought he was a bit off the pace for most of the first half. Weirdly reminiscent of the first leg, which was comfortably his worst game for United so far. Cambridge must be his kryptonite.

Did finish strongly though. Was one of our best players in the second half. Hopefully that's exorcised his Cambridge demons.

2623~~~
There was a moment late in the first half where he instigated a slick 1-2 move which ended with RVP (I think) getting a corner out of it. Very classy player, a mobile-Carrick, although I personally don't think he has the same passing range as him.

2624~~~
The next level would be to really impose himself in games and take full control of the midfield and dominate.

2625~~~
Not fishing here, but a serious question:

If we were to sign someone in the ilk of Strootman or Vidal in the summer, what would this mean for Blind? 
Would Blind play a more advanced role with the new arrival dropping back?

2626~~~
No. Vidal and Strootman are both more advanced than Blind.

2627~~~
I see, so making a marquee signing in terms of the above players wouldn't affect our boy Daley too much?

2628~~~
He should have just left it, but I don't really blame him for trying how he did. Also probably a little reprieve for the fact it was in the first minute. It's a common theme in Evans game so I think it's fair to look at those instances in different lights. Against Leicester Rooney and Jones were at fault for similar too.

I've watched most of the game and he was decent I thought, nothing particularly good but I'm not sure he could have been without trying a ton of Hollywood balls and potentially having them come off, and we have enough players trying that.

Against Leicester though he was brilliant.

2629~~~
Obviously it depends on how LVG sets the team up, but so far it looks like we'll always play with one DM, that would mean one of Blind/Carrick will always play, if they're fit of course.

2630~~~
Great player, my main worry is his lack of pace and could struggle with quick nimble players who like to drop deep, Silva, Coutinho etc.

Think we need a dominate physical box to box beast to play alongside him, especially in the tougher games.

2631~~~
Marouane Fellaini, we should get him.

2632~~~
Nah, too clumsy, can't tackle or run.

2633~~~
Totally agree. Looks like one of our best signings, he's the kind of player where you don't really care what position he plays, he just needs to be on the pitch to give us that calm, reassured quality. Hoping to see a lot more of him this season.

2634~~~
Of course he can, and he did this season already. People are just forgetting it, because he played in a more advanced role, as second striker two times now. 
Fellaini is the closest we have to a physically dominant and ball-winning midfielder. I just feel we might have to change our system to play with one striker instead of two to have the right balance in our midfield. Currently we play Blind/Carrick as DM and the midfielders ahead of them (now Mata, Rooney, Di Maria) are all advanced players who like to get forward and into the box to create something, but are restricted to their midfield roles and are therefore uneffective.
Even if we keep the formation to the 4-4-2 diamond, if you add Fellaini instead of Rooney and play Di Maria on the left side instead of Mata and put Mata as AM we will look way more balanced, and did already this season. 
But that's impossible, as the captain always has to play and we have 2 potentially world-class strikers.

2635~~~
I've quite liked him so far, but Was he really that good last night? I mean, it was a third division team, and his most and only notable contribution was passing them through on goal in the first minute...

2636~~~
No, he wasn't that good, but people still see our two-man-midfield of Cleverley and Fellaini away from home against Cardiff City when they think about our midfield. Compared to that a defensive midfielder who shows for the ball and possesses the necessary calmness looks world-class.

2637~~~
This is kind of true, but I still think he needs someone next to him. Or at least someone else somewhere in midfield who isn't a striker/winger/human tree.

2638~~~
Take 'note' of the way he keeps our play fluid, our tempo high, helps the ball out of defence again and again and again, didn't put a pass wrong other than that one early mistake... Arguably contributed more significantly to our win than Di Maria, who was good but really only doing the same things as Mata and Rooney (and therefore we probably would have missed him less than Blind, who was the only one doing his job and who in Carrick's absence has no replacement.)

I'm not that keen on the line the media have settled on for Blind, either - that he's mediocre but 'lets better players do their thing.' He may not be a Di Maria, but he's not a Cleverley either. He's more composed on the ball than any other player in our squad, and he's technically excellent. His passing is accomplished and he's starting to show real range as well, switching play as effortlessly as Rooney and ADM yesterday, and providing that lovely ball-over-the-top assist for RVP against Leicester. His job is a 'humble' one, apparently, because it doesn't involve scoring goals. But it's actually just as important a part of our game plan as RVP's, and Blind is arguably doing his job better than anyone else in the team is doing theirs bar De Gea.

2639~~~
If he keeps our tempo high, why is our tempo always so shockingly slow?

He gives away or gets caught on the ball too often for my liking (it certainly happens a lot more than once a game), but I think it's partly because he never has anyone in midfield with him, so he's often given no out ball. I've been fairly impressed over all, though some of the praise on here is hilariously overboard.

and Di Maria was awful last night, and is generally very unreliable. I think he might actually be an even thicker footballer than Nani.

2640~~~
Yesterday was a crap game to judge Blind as most of his best work is when we're not in possession, so about 20% of the action on view last night.

2641~~~
That sad part is atm we are getting more of the unreliable, inconsistent player Di Maria used to be before last seasons transformation. I hope he does remember what made him great last season and finds some good form very soon. If not we basically bought a very expensive, left footed Nani.

2642~~~
He gave Januzaj it a few times on Saturday too.

2643~~~
Blind for captain. Make it so

2644~~~
The most pleasing thing about this is that it gives us the fans, but more importantly woodward / glaziers confidence in giving LVG cash to spend.  Anybody can pick out a Di Maria, Mata, Falcao or even a Shaw.

But signing Blind and Rojo for a combined £30m is absoutley great business in todays market.  Qaulity players who despite their age and potential to improve are also pretty experianced.

2645~~~
I think even LVG is surprised how good he's been for us. 

I don't think he'd have signed him, if we got whoever else he wanted (Vidal, Strootman,...). We got him on the 31st of August, after LVG kept saying he only needs a day to sign a player if needed. Glad we got him.

2646~~~
Has to be hands down our best summer signing - who would have thought we would be saying that after hearing Di Maria and Falcao had signed

2647~~~
He has definetly surprised me towards how good he has been. Our best player this season, alongside De Gea.

2648~~~
Our best summer signing so far, top player.

2649~~~
He's arguably our most important outfield player now.

2650~~~
Great goal. Not a fantastic game but one of our better players.

2651~~~
Our best signing post-Fergie

2652~~~
Our best player this season after De Gea.

2653~~~
Brilliant strike. Imagine we would have won it had either of our overpaid strikers taken their chances.

2654~~~
Thought he did well as the only defensive midfielder until afro came on.  Tidy player.

2655~~~
Definitely nowhere near his best game today, was largely ineffective... But thats a really good goal. When Strootman does that the transfer forum is full of people saying we should buy him for over £30 million

2656~~~
Our second best player after DDG for the season. How he is left on his own in midfield is crazy to me.

2657~~~
I've got absolutely no doubt he's going to be better than Carrick in no time. Terrific signing.

2658~~~
best money spent since RVP.

2659~~~
Class apart amongst the outfield players today. Even without the goal it was a solid performance in a difficult game.

2660~~~
Twice he has saved us late on in PL games this season. He fights till the end and doesnt hide. We need more players with spirit like that.

2661~~~
He already is.

2662~~~
Good goal. I didn't think he played well though. Him being virtually the solitary midfield player didn't help.

2663~~~
Beside the great goal, I thought he was a bit rubbish the whole game. The amount of free shot West Ham had from his supposedly territory area was worrying.

2664~~~
Most value for money out of all the summer signings.

2665~~~
Wasn't pleased with his performance in possession at all today and we all saw Jones and Rojo really huffing and puffing because no one was helping them to track Sakho and Valencia. But if he wants to score goals like that to stop us from losing, I'll take that.

Showing more leadership than the bigger names playing in front of him though!

2666~~~
Poor and invinsible first half, really stepped up in the 2nd.

2667~~~
Our best player saves the day. I love this guy. He was completely abandoned in midfield today and it showed at times but what a time to pop up and grab a great equaliser.

2668~~~
We had no midfield out there because van Gaal has decided he hates Herrera enough to not even sub him on, Rooney played mostly forward and Di Maria was all over the place which left Blind very exposed so it's hard to assess his all round performance. Wasn't terrible IMO.

2669~~~

2670~~~
Its idiotic when you think him and Herrera worked so well at the start of the season and they rarely play together anymore. 

We go from having one out and out midfielder to 3 yet we still persist with one and sticking Rooney there

2671~~~
He could do with some actual midfielders as partners. Wasn't great but still the only one who seemed like capable of doing his job in midfield and got the equalizer when I almost had given up hope. That's the kind of spirit we need in our players.

2672~~~
Come on, he was crap. 

Delighted that he scored though!

2673~~~
I love him!

He's pretty good at football as well.

2674~~~
Nicely taken goal.

2675~~~
Thought he was poor on the whole today, good goal and been a great signing though.

2676~~~
Its difficult playing in a midfield one. 

Poor bastard. Great goal.

2677~~~
This x1000. It's like poor Carrick for the past 2 seasons. Expected to do it all.

2678~~~
For most of the match he was ignored by our defenders/midfielders. We have to trust in him to be able to get the ball in tight situations and break open their midfield.

Was a generally poor performance from him until right at the end. Struggled with the physicality and pace of song and co.

2679~~~
Poor performance but super strike to score. Needs to compete better in the air and also in the midfield battle; lost too many 50/50s.

As others have mentioned, at this point he looks the pick of our summer signings.

2680~~~
Quoted.for.truth.

2681~~~
Thought he was really poor bar the goal tbh.

2682~~~
He was defending four players worth. His own, and the three ahead of him.

2683~~~
He was literally the only midfielder with any defensive responsibility for the entire game. There were times when he was a bit anonymous but even without his goal he would have been one of our better players but to get an equalizer too means he's my MOTM.

2684~~~
Not his best game but a fantastic strike to get us a point, his mentality is pure Manchester United. Also while he didn't have a great game it doesn't help when he's in midfield on his own, our set up is ludicrous.

2685~~~
I thought he was shit in the first half, but stepped up in the second when he was very good.

2686~~~
If he's a DMC, his main duty is to screen around the center of the box area, as that is the most dangerous area to have a free shot. He's not supposedly drag around trying to close down others, let alone trying to defend four players as you said.

But I acknowledge that it's hard to be the 'sole' CM in midfield.

2687~~~
Largely invisible, certainly in the first half. Improved in the second and great finish. Still one of our better performers, mind.

2688~~~
I think him and Rojo where our 2 best buys in the summer window, funnily enough they were the cheapest as well

2689~~~
Well done for rescuing it for us lad. Personally I think he's been the best signing under the van Gaal reign.

2690~~~
He's basically the player Kleberson was supposed to be, only successful.

2691~~~
Can't believe anyone would think that performances was anywhere close to acceptable. Terrible stuff, we need to sign a starting DM sooner rather than later.

2692~~~
Credit where it's due. You have an absolutely amazing knack of being wrong about almost everything you ever post on. It's quite the skill.

2693~~~
He's the only one I'd fight to keep if it came down to it.

2694~~~
Kleberson wasn't supposed to be successful?

But yeah, Blind's mint.

2695~~~
name a DM that can play by himself. right thought so.

2696~~~
What is he supposed to do in an one man midfield? Poor guy, now he knows how Carrick felt for years carrying our midfield. But back then our manager decided to not buy a midfielder whereas now we do have a good one sitting on the bench but not playing because he brings much needed urgency to our midfield.
Anyway thumbs up for our one man midfield, did as well as could be expected in such a situation.

2697~~~
As soon as the team was announced you could see he was going to have an impossible task today.

But he won the point again with a late winner!

2698~~~
Big goal.

2699~~~
He was actually a bit shit today. Great goal, mind. He's been our best outfield player this season and comfortably so. 

I liked it when he bollocked Jones for not passing it to him in the first half. Positive mind.

2700~~~
Wrong about what? How well he played?(He was rubbish, notice how some are saying they thought he was a bit shit) or wrong about whether he's good enough to be a long term starter for us?

2701~~~
Two of his worst games for Utd were today and West Brom, even when he's not playing that well he's still contributing. I really like him, he's a very good player and he has a great attitude. He's been our best summer signing by miles.

2702~~~
If I had to pick 3 long term starters for the club from today's outfit, it'd be Blind, Shaw and De Gea.

2703~~~
i'd have to agree.

2704~~~
Blind is a very good player and can't do everything himself. I pray we get him a proper midfield partner in the summer, since Van Gaal doesn't seem to rate Herrera.

2705~~~
I think since returning from injury Rojo has proved his ability to play as a CB in a back four in this league. Bigger names have struggled to deal with Valencia and Sakho this season but for the most part he did his job effectively. 

Not much between him and Blind for me in terms of the success of the summer signings.

2706~~~
Rojo's been good lately but to me the 3 I mentioned have been consistent in every chance they were given and no surprise Van Gaal picks them so often. They deliver an 8/10 performance on their worst days and if your bottom level is consistently good, that fosters dependability from the manger.

2707~~~
agree with this. And probably the only 2 players that LVG had any real input in signing.

2708~~~
Reminds me of what Owen Hargeaves could have been.

2709~~~
He's already better on the ball then Hargreaves could have ever dreamed of being.

2710~~~
I'd love to see him not being shackled for defensive duty only. I want him as box to box, and see what he can do. Seems like he has the atributes fir that. Good engine, passing, vision, and finishing.

2711~~~
Absolutely this.

2712~~~
He is a real 'Manchester United' player.

2713~~~
I get why people are criticising him (becasue he didn't play well) but can anyone play well when they are basically holding the entire by them self? He needed Fellaini/Herrera with him. Anyway, his strike for the goal was very good. Am absolutely delighted with his signing.

2714~~~
That's very difficult and even more so at a tough away ground. There is only so much a player can do on his own if his teammates take ages to help him offensively and defensively.

2715~~~
Signing of the season, if not the best signing since RvP.

2716~~~
And he didn't even look like our first choice signing

2717~~~
Agreed.

2718~~~
He was the only midfielder we had there, considering Rooney isn't really a CM. He had to do it all alone in the first half, second half he stepped up - I really wish LVG will try something different, like having two central midfielders on the pitch.

2719~~~
Him and Herrera in midfield with the likes AdM, Mata, Januzaj around them would make one heck of a team, however poor Blind is playing in midfield one...

2720~~~
Our best player this season after De Gea. Yesterday was probably one his worst matches for us so far and still he was one of our best players and scored a very important goal.

2721~~~
What happened to Daley?

2722~~~
Anyone?

2723~~~
Someone said he was concussed after Evans clattered him.

2724~~~
Hopefully not bad. Need him back for the PL fixtures in 10 days time.

2725~~~
Looked like concussion. Next PL game is after 10 days so hopefully he will be OK by then. Carrick can be back by then too just in case.

2726~~~
Hope he's ok, I guess we can, ekhm, rest him against Preston.

2727~~~
He looks like he was just dazed. Im sure he will be ok for Swansea Game.

2728~~~
Thought I saw him say the word "dizzy" when the physio was going over to him. Probably a concussion, hopefully back for the next PL game. Fellaini to fill in against Preston probably. Unless Rooney impressed as the DM...

2729~~~
His worst performance for us so far?

2730~~~
He's still been pretty good, Preston have had nothing centrally, moved the ball quickly and put in some good tackles.

2731~~~
Not the best today. To many misplaced passes.

2732~~~
One to forget for him.

2733~~~
Not his greatest performance, didn't move around as he usually does maybe because of the concussion But one to forget for him.

2734~~~
His passing was all over the place. Couldn't find a forward no matter what he tried.

2735~~~
Been a real fan of his so far but tonight was definitely one to forget for him.

2736~~~
Wasn't terrible, maybe his head thing in the last game effected him

2737~~~
Had many misplaced passes than normally, worst game so far in a United shirt. Maybe something to do with his concussion, expect him to raise his game again.

2738~~~
Got on my nerves tonight, but it was probably just one of those nights, a one off. He's been very good this season.

2739~~~
Yes we missed the calming defensive influence of Carrick tonight. Blind will learn from this.

2740~~~
I may take some flack for this but I think he hasn't been too great in the last few games not just tonight. I'm sure he will regain the excellent form he has showed in the next few weeks though.

2741~~~
Did his job, nothing spectacular like a distance goal or a lob assist but decent performance regardless. 

A Blind - Herrera ** midfield is one for the future.

2742~~~
I thought he was solid and passed it pretty well (cue someone with a graph of his terrible pass stats) but I think he need someone in there beside him.

2743~~~
Did his defensive work almost flawlessly, his passing was a bit off but its way too negative to put another defensive/deep lying player in there.

2744~~~
I still prefer Carrick for doing the same defensive work Blind does, but having a more penetrative passing range.

2745~~~
I don't mean another DM, I just mean a midfield partner who he can play some short passes with, a lot of the time his options all seem too far away from him. I thought his game picked up when Ander moved central and they started playing off each other.

2746~~~
Ah OK, in that case agreed.

2747~~~
Saw the ball a lot tonight. Thought it was just an average performance. Maybe poor, but I personally wouldn't say it. I think our standards of him are a bit high given how tidy he's been for us.

2748~~~
Arguably that's the worst Blind has played for us. Some of his passing and positioning was all over the place. From the time he tripped over himself receiving a simple pass in the first half you could tell he was going to be shaky. Very surprised to see him go to pieces so easily.

2749~~~
they said Pirlo <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he isn't much convincing even at defending, always looks like lacking yard of pace and couple of pounds of wight or muscles. Still prefer him to Carrick. So bringing in a defensive midfielder is pretty much a must

2750~~~
Easily his worst Utd game.

Thought his passing especially was really poor.

2751~~~
Have you been waiting all season to post this?

2752~~~
I've been watching him since u21s so I'm not getting carried away by no means like some people here. Last defensive minded midfielder we bought was in 2007 (Hargo)so I get the buzz around him. He will be another consistent and good player like Carrick for us but we surely need another one or two players for competition which is currently none..

2753~~~
He's having a bit of a blip over the last few games actually. Tonight was part of a recent trend. Been a factor in our recent flat performances too, as he's arguably our most natural CM with Carrick out. When he's off form our whole midfield looks even shiter than normal.

2754~~~
His passing radar was off tonight and he played a lot of aimless balls when there wasn't much on

My biggest problem with him is his lack of height which hinders us when teams play it long against us, he's unable to shield the centre backs and offer protection - he'd be better with Carrick alongside him if we can keep them both fit

2755~~~
Wasn't great tonight. Played it too safe and give away some simple passes.

2756~~~
The disappointment here shows how much hope we've invested in him already. He simply can't afford to have an off-night with our midfield in the flux it is.

2757~~~
His first bad game, cant play well every game.
Would be nice , but we all have off days.

2758~~~
Pretty crap from him today, I'm hoping it's just him feeling the effects of the concussion he had against Burnley.

2759~~~
I really rate and like Blind, but I'm unsure if he's good enough to be the main man in a top sides midfield as part of a two.

He's not physical enough nor does he have enough of a presence that most defensive midfielders have, nor does he have anywhere near the passing range the top holding midfielders have.

Whilst I think he's improved us, and he should be given time to improve and grow into our midfield, I wouldn't be surprised if LvG brings in at least one more starting midfielder in the summer.

2760~~~
He sees the ball more than any other player on the pitch.

2761~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XzIqaHalxUE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Interesting......

2762~~~
many many defenders have done the same thing , did not cost us a goal, don't see why it is interesting ?

2763~~~
Concussion>?

2764~~~
AH I get your point now and quite possible it had a hand in the slip.

2765~~~
Personally dont rate him. Tidy but has no defensive game to speak of and cant pass the ball anywhere with his right foot.

2766~~~
Still my favourite player at the club right now. He had his first below average performance today in 16 appearances, so what?

2767~~~
He's surpassed my expectations of him but I don't agree with the idea that the #6 position is sorted and that's that. He should have competition and I don't mean Carrick, he's been injured best part of the season will be 34 at the start of next season, we surely need a DM that can compete with Blind in the same age range.

2768~~~
His worst game for us, but probably our best outfield player so far this season. 

It's absolutely beyond me how there are still people that don't rate him.

2769~~~
He's decent but he's also a limited player. I start to believe that he's one of the reasons why we are so slow in our build up, he's too casual and takes too long to bring the ball forward.

2770~~~
Shows the standard we already expect of Blind if this performance is criticised, easily our best DM and Carrick should now be playing second fiddle to him.

2771~~~
Not his first. Interestingly enough, his second worst performance was also against lower league opposition in an FA Cup away game. He was terrible against Cambridge too.

Been a bit below par in most of his recent games actually. Which is a problem, as we're hugely reliant on him right now.

2772~~~
Carrick is still a better player. Blinds passing isn't anywhere near as inventive as Carricks.

2773~~~
And yet Blind has already got more assists (and goals) than Carrick has in the last season and a half. Blind is better in the tackle, covers more ground and is more comfortable whist pressed/in tight spaces. Let's not turn this into a vs thread though.

2774~~~
:jol:

2775~~~
I think he's been incredibly solid and consistent since being here, but last night he was uncharacteristically poor. His passing was wild and careless. A lot of effort, which you'll always get from him, but the technical side of his game was poor in the 2nd half especially.

2776~~~
He did his defensive job well, but his passing range was massively off. Every chipped ball seemed to either be way off the mark or well overhit. Oh well 1 bad could be worse.

2777~~~
Definitely his worst performance for us but he has been pretty impressive overall. I think he will be a better player next season, stronger and quicker as still adapting to the pace of our league compared to the Dutch league.
I still want another midfielder signed who can not only play alongside him but also in his position if necessary, Carrick is getting too old and injury prone to be relied upon. Who though I'm not sure, I really like Schneiderlin.

2778~~~
Completely anonymous today. He's  done ok but we really miss Carrick.

Edit - forgot to mention. I don't think it's a coincidence we have won 3 away games all season and Carrick has started all of them.

2779~~~
He's great in possession but Shelvey's goal.. that is where a DM should be no?

2780~~~
Anonymous? He had a solid amount of interceptions and in the 2nd half almost all his passes went forwards to rooney especially,  when he got the ball he immediately passed it forwards. Not anonymous imo.

2781~~~
I thought he had a decent game, would love to see him playing with an actual CM partner, he has to push too far up at times to play the simple passes.

2782~~~
He needs support which means we need to change the shape. We can all see it.

2783~~~
He is the only midfielder who does some decent defensive work which also means he has to be everywhere and that leads to him than sometimes not being in the right spot if necessary. I hope that once Carrick is back with give their partnership in front of our defense another go.

2784~~~
I had a feeling he would have a tough job against them. The way Swansea play, particularly with that impressive midfield, he was being asked to do too much on his own seeing as he is the one with the defensive responsibility in midfield.

2785~~~
He can't be our midfield all on his own.

Taking a damn good crack at it, though!

2786~~~
He doesn't protect the defence enough for my liking. I think Carrick is a better player in all departments currently. Especially in away games where we need a leader.

Agree with posters above who say we need to change shape, he needs help. If we're going to keep this shape he's not going to fulfil the role adequately and Carrick must go straight back in when fit.

2787~~~
He's a tidy player but like I have been saying his performances have been overrated this season. A good signing at 13m no doubt and very versatile but I hope we're looking at someone better. In the meantime Carrrick should start ahead of him.

2788~~~
Matic would have never allowed that goal. 

Reminded me of the Mexico goal from the World cup. At the moment I said, De Jong would have never allowed that.

2789~~~
I think it's a coincidence. 

It's like when Carrick plays bad let's hope Blind will do better, if Blind is playing somewhat bad than let's hope Carrick is back soon and we will be better with him. The fact is that we desperately need another and now rather world class defensive midfielder than okay player. 

None of this duo is bringing our team to another level, not that they are just passengers but they don't raise our game anyhow. They are doing their things just about good but yeah there are definitely better players out there. Blind is profiting from the knowledge and trust he got from Van Gaal as he couched him before, and Carrick from his experience but he will be 34/35 next season and he simply can't be our first option when we want to paly in champions league a beat the top clubs in the world not that we struggle to catch the tempo of Southampton..

2790~~~
He played well and despite what commentator and after commentator keep saying he's one fo the few for us that tries to play it forward through the middle.

2791~~~
A bit off form recently but he's still a class signing. My only thing is while I do think he should be in our best 11 based on both merit and the balance he brings, but I'm not sure what that would be. If we use a flat 4-4-1-1, then Herrera is an automatic starter as he's our best midfielder but I think Carrick is much more suited to a normal central midfield role. In a 4-2-3-1, both him and Carrick could play as a double pivot and we use Herrera as an attacking midfielder, while Mata and Di Maria are on the wings/roaming inside as attacking midfielders. Not sure what would work better.

2792~~~
I am not that mad at Blind with the goal but as you said, could have been different story with de Jong or someone of that mould. 

But that's it Blind is about good tidy player who can pass about good when he doesn't have a day off like against Preston when he was absolutely terrible but he does his job well but he is shaky defensively as he is outmuscled easily and out paced so often. I think it was a good move to acquire Blind. He was decent so far but he is no Pirlo and this is not Eredivise where he could do whatever he wanted in the best team, so much more intensity and power in the league.

We would do better with someone like Wanyama as we have got too many creative players up front ad just need that cover or that anchor man who will clear the balls and win the tackles, helping our far from solid still forming defense... more balance sir

hawg

2793~~~
I agree. I don't mind him either as he is an upgrade on Fletcher, Cleverley and Anderson. 

I think he is an excellent squad player, but never a regular starter for me. We'd need to find a better replacement for Carrick to take on the role on a regular basis. Michael is getting older and injury prone.

2794~~~
He is a bit off form these days but if the truth be told he is no superman so he can't do it all on his own. He needs someone beside him to help with all the defensive work and it's no brainer given that we know his shortcomings.

2795~~~
When he was injured we played 9 in the league won 6 and drew 3. Since his comeback we have played 6 in the league won 3, drew 1, lost 2. For those 6 games we are 7th in the form table with Southampton, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham all above us. 

I feel like he is a wasted spot on the team sheet personally. His passing never has any real effect on our attacking moves, he always has a dodgy pass in him and he is not particularly athletic. I can understand the whole team is in a bad patch of inconsistency but is he really the guy that will inspire us out of this rut and into the top 4?

2796~~~
He did OK but if we set up in a diamond and it's him and him alone, we'll always concede chances. He doesn't have pace or legs to cover a whole pitch and with Jones behind him it was never going to be pretty, as Sir Phil has zero organising skills or anticipation to step out of defence and be a tem DM like say T. Silva could or Carrick.

Being an away game we should have played with 2 DMs and 1 striker vs 1 DM adn 2 strikers...and a striker with pace at that.

2797~~~
He is quickly becoming one of those players, either a great performance or a waste of space. He was fine (yes that sometimes happens and is acceptable), he has been a very good signing too.

2798~~~
A waste of space? Can you elaborate? Or are those other words for saying that he has a poor game.

Think it's funny btw, everytime we lose, close to every player on the pitch isnt good enough for us, whilst the player was decent at least..

2799~~~
Well I only have to go two posts up from mine to see the words, "I feel like he is a wasted spot on the team sheet personally". So you don't have to look far.

I think you may have misinterpreted my post, I am not saying he is one of those, I'm talking about the reaction of most other fans.

2800~~~
Sorry, my bad.

2801~~~
Sigurdsson was pressing him in the first half, not letting de Gea, Rojo and Jones pass it to him. I thought it was a good tactic and perhaps Di Maria and Herrera could've done more to collect the ball and bring it forward from deeper areas. Hence, Blind being anonymous in the first half.

I thought he was decent in the second half when there was more space and we seemingly had more control (until the goal). Overall, an average performance, nothing to 'worry' about.

2802~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/PKfl705l.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/PKfl705l.png"/>

Absolutely comical. Not the first time Blind has had to cover so much space.

2803~~~
I thought he played well. Yesterday's game was one of those performances where very few players actually played poor, but we still managed to lose against the run of play. In my opinion, Van Persie, Rooney, Di Maria and Valencia were poor. The rest of the team were pretty good. I especially liked the combo between Blind and Herrera. Both very tidy players, technically excellent.

2804~~~
Where is Di Maria in this? I don't exactly remember the passage of play. Or was he off at that point?

2805~~~
Shelvey's goal? Does anyone other than Shelvey himself think that was his goal?

And no, that was where the left side of the diamond should be. It's churlish to criticise though because it was a harmless shot that would have been no threat whatsoever without a lucky deflection.

2806~~~
Hope this lad gets back to playing the way he has for most of the season. Yesterday and the Preston game he was poor.

2807~~~
Wrong, he is one of those players who do fantastic performances, never get credited for. And even when he plays normal (nothing special, just doing his job) he gets flamed for being useless. Because all people care about is a guy who dribbles past 10 people or score a hattrick. Just like Busquets, Carrick, Lahm etc

2808~~~
Might as well have been. Utterly lazy and disinterested performance from him yesterday. Never looked like a CM to me and sure as hell didn't look like one yesterday. That wide open space their goal came from was entirely his fault.

2809~~~
I think you may have misinterpreted my post. I'm on his side.

And not being credited? He has been one of our most praised players this season and depending on how De Gea goes for the rest of the season, it wouldn't surprise me if Blind got our player of the season award (not a debate for now).

2810~~~
Are you saying the likes of Busquets, Lahm and Carrick get no credit? fecking hell.

Blind is nowhere near any of them in quality. He's had one game which could be termed as a fantastic performance and that was against QPR.

2811~~~
Given Blind's age, I think he could end up being a better player than Carrick.

2812~~~
I very much doubt it. He's more mobile than Carrick but that's about the only thing he's better at.

2813~~~
One game? What a load of bollocks.

2814~~~
Err..no it's not.

What other fantastic game has he had?

2815~~~
Same here. I think Blind's very good but simply doesnt have Carrick's passing range which will never let him be as good.

2816~~~
Where the hell is di Maria? Or Rooney to cover him?

2817~~~
I have no intention of getting into some retarded debate about how you define "fantastic". Suffice is to say he's put in a lot of very good performances this season, QPR being just one of many.

2818~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck me, your agenda is so transparent it's pitiful.

2819~~~
Well in that case, you shouldn't fecking respond then if you find the whole thing retarded.

2820~~~
When I see an idiotic post implying he's only really played well once this season I feel obliged to respond. If that bothers you, don't make idiotic posts.

2821~~~
If only I said eh? I said that he's only had one game which could be termed as fantastic not that he's only played well once this season. Your comprehension skills are well off I'm afraid. 

I actually think he's a fairly good player and well worth the money we paid for him.

2822~~~
I think he's a technically better player. Carrick is maybe ahead on overall passing, but Blind is also a great passer of the ball. We'll see, I suppose.

2823~~~
It's not down to my agenda this time, but if Di Maria stayed in attack for some reason then left striker should be covering his position there, and that should be Rooney. Of course, that should happen <i>if</i> di Maria had a valid reason to stay in attack, but I am not saying he did. Anyway, it's di Maria's fault in general.

2824~~~
Just watched the situation again, and as I suspected, di Maria was running to the right side of the pitch asking for the ball, and Herrera passed it to Fellaini to the centre who lost it because of their pressing, and di Maria then stayed on that right side covering their fullback or whoever, so I guess our whole shape was bad at that point because of him. Neither of van Persie, Rooney and Fellaini moved from their positions even though our left side was open. You can blame di Maria, but he wasn't lazy, he just stayed on that side because he was opening down that side when we had the ball and then we lost it, he had no time to return to his position. I have no idea who to blame, probably everyone out of those attacking 4 except Blind and Herrera. Maybe Herrera and Fellaini for losing the possession?

2825~~~
In my opinion, Herrera and Fellaini are to blame. Herrera for trying that pass instead of going for the safe option Valencia, Fellaini for standing instead of coming to pick up the ball. He wanted the ball, but just wanted to shield it and put his body in front instead of running towards it. The guy behind him just tackled him and got the ball. Then Fellaini runs back but defends no one. He should be picking up Shelvey. I dont see how Di Maria/Rooney are at fault there.

2826~~~
Blind has been invisible for the last couple of games. Doesn't show his presence when we don't have the ball nor when we go forward. As I said months ago, he needs to impose himself into games

2827~~~
The Leicester match he was very good.

2828~~~
Blind flatters to deceive. The odd moments of flair have been allowed to out shine his poor general play. He has looked badly exposed at times and confused over his position. He doesn't support or make the play from defence that he did for Holland, which tells me he's struggling in the PL. If an opponent sits on him it's noticeable how we slow down in countering. Blind is a serious weak link at times and LVG has not addressed the problem.

2829~~~
The one in which we shipped 5?

2830~~~
But along with Rooney and Rojo, he always starts. That's the "Filosophy"

2831~~~
I think he's been good in pretty much every game.

2832~~~
No, the one we won 3-1.

2833~~~
There's no choice with Carrick out.

2834~~~
People complaining about Blind starting now? Along with Rojo he's been the best outfield player in recent weeks. With Carrick out he is an absolute key man.

2835~~~
Personally not complaining about his starting, but I have questioned his performances which I don't think have been as good as some here believe. I have no axe to grind but his selection has not always worked.

2836~~~
For what it's worth I think he was literally off the pitch at that point.

Edit: Never mind, no he wasn't. God knows where the feck he was. Poor Daley.

2837~~~
People are stupid.

2838~~~
People are just trying to find a scapegoat for our shit performances when it's the team as a whole playing awfully. Like, 'what if the reason for us being shit was Blind all along?!' which just isn't fair.

2839~~~
A lot of Blind's work goes unnoticed. He won the ball 9 times with interceptions on top of 2 tackles.

He wasnt as influencial with his passing as some other games, but Ander was so he didnt really need to be. Blind made 60 passes, Ander at 73

He was decent, not at his best but certainly not invisible like some posters are suggesting. Thats just not appreciating the defensive side of his game, he wins the ball more than Carrick has done in the position in the past

2840~~~
When did he do that? He played mostly as left wing back for Holland, he hardly played in midfield for them.

2841~~~
For my money he's been our 2nd best player this season behind mighty Dave.

2842~~~
He's the kind of player you want in a holding midfilder, reads the game great, solid tackling and keeps it simple perfect in a 4-3-3 hope to see him, Herrera and di Maria in the mid in that formation

2843~~~
Defensively, he's just not up to it. The number of times he gets caught behind the ball is criminal and something Fellaini was torn apart for last season.

2844~~~
I completely disagree. He gets caught behind the ball because he's the one leading the midfield press high into their own half and is generally playing catch-up. It's impossible to press high and always be in the right position to sweep up in front of the defence. Fellaini on the other hand was just slow and unaware of his surroundings. Completely different things.

Our pressing was excellent today and suffocated Sunderland in possession and Blind-Herrera deserve a lot of credit for that. It's a very effective form of defence. When we occasionally get bypassed we are quite open but that's part and parcel of the approach.

2845~~~
I actually thought he was very good today, plenty of forward passes, through balls, something that no other midfielder or striker did today.

2846~~~
I don't think our main DM should get behind the ball as much as he does. Maybe he needs to improve his positioning, I don't know but he's not as solid as I'd like him to be.

2847~~~
Not one of his better games. He gave away a lot of silly fouls.

2848~~~
He is a defensive midfielder. He will give away fouls, sometimes a lot, all DM's do.

What's important is that he was once again very calm and composed with the ball and had a lot of good forward passes. I actually really like the look of the Herrera-Blind midfield.

2849~~~
Breaking play up when they were countering against us, would you rather he just let them go past him?

2850~~~
He is decent for the money paid but I do feel that a player of his quality should be 4th or 5th choice for a club like Manchester United.

2851~~~
Agreed,

2852~~~
Grew into the game. Decent performance overall.

But he needs to stopped trying to give assists to the other team in every single game.

2853~~~
Thought he was one of our worst players today.

2854~~~
Is turned too easily when pressing, but still did well all around. Basically just orchestrated all of the possession in midfield and looked to go forward with his passes as much as he could.

2855~~~
You're massively underrating him. He'd be first or second choice at a lot of top clubs... Also, he's extremely important to the system.

2856~~~
He was fine today. Though I'd prefer it if he played as a proper sitting midfielder. There's moments when he chooses to run around like a mad man towards the ball and gets caught out.

2857~~~
Christ, that's complete nonsense. Similar to the stuff people used to say about Carrick.

2858~~~
He's poor defensively. Its really that simple. He's slow and weak.

2859~~~
He is slow, but he's great defensively.

2860~~~
Which top clubs are you referring to?

2861~~~
Wow. Im not saying he is world class, but i cant remember the last time we had a player of his quality as 4th choice in our midfield. He is certainly very good for us especially in t he role he plays. few out there do what he does better.

2862~~~
Which clubs would pay £30m for him?

The midfield that everyone has derided for the past 7 years or so?

2863~~~
He's not playing as a defensive midfielder though. He's playing more or less as a "box to box" centre mid in essentially exactly the same role as Herrera, in a partnership that's not much different to Keane-Scholes in roles. Keane got caught behind the ball a lot too when he played in that kind of setup because of the nature of it - you can't be everywhere at once, and if you're going to take the positive approach and drive the team up the pitch then you will leave gaps in behind that on occasion you'll be chasing back to cover off. I think you're being very unfair. If he was told to sit and track runners and close off spaces in front of the defence and he wasn't doing it then that'd be a reasonable criticism, but that's clearly not what he's doing and presumably he's not being told to do that otherwise he wouldn't be a mainstay in the team.

I like his approach personally. It's ballsy, it's positive, it's proactive. It's the kind of things many people were looking for when they were complaining about the many, many times when we just sat back and soaked up pressure in our own half.

2864~~~
It's obvious when you watch us play how important he is to the team and the system. I think he's a great player.

2865~~~
And how the feck does it matter as we didn't pay 30 mln quid for him either?

2866~~~
I thought he was fine today. Keeps things simple and moves the ball around.

Anyone who is saying he's 4th choice in midfield need to have their head's checked. He's been our most reliable midfielder all season and is a crucial component for how van Gaal has the team play.

2867~~~
I still think he's been LVG's best signing. Solid without being emphatic, skillful without being world class....a team needs these sorts of players in a squad. Bloody hell, Ferguson signed enough of them...

2868~~~
Lack of pace and strength doesn't necessarily mean he's poor defensively.

2869~~~
The implication is that he is a top player. I just wonder if that view spreads beyond some members on a United forum. We should have top bracket players in every position.

2870~~~
Did he get a card today that I missed? I swear I saw him make so many little fouls the ref had to take his shoes and socks off to explain how many he'd done and he'd only get one more. It was ideal for us, broke their momentum time and time again.

2871~~~
Agreed. He reads the game well, almost always makes the right pass, and is always in a good position to receive the ball. I think he is a great player, too. Great signing by van Gaal.

2872~~~
We should have the right players in each position. Blind is the right player for us right now.

2873~~~
Every team needs it's supporting cast, this much is obvious. Blind's brilliant at what he does, and I'm not sure we'd find many better right now to be honest. He knows the system inside out, which is also very important.

2874~~~
I thought he was very good on the ball today, passing it crisply with either foot, but he's a worry when he gets caught chasing back shoulder to shoulder IMO as he is really slow.

2875~~~
Exactly. Which is why I wouldn't mind seeing a better player bought in for him. He is a good player not a great one. Do we want to win the Champions League again?

OK, it isn't a priority position at the moment but those are my thoughts.

2876~~~
No, we should have players that are working the best in certain positions and Blind is exactly that. We've got top bracket players in ADM and Falcao and it's not working miracles, is it?

2877~~~
When was the last time Manchester United had eleven top bracket players for each position though? When was the last time any club had? It's just not how squad building works, Blind suits the system, which comes first. He's been great this season and I'm sure will continue to impress.

2878~~~
He is a good player, but he is too weak - we will get slaughtered with him in that holding role next season

2879~~~
I'm comparing him in relation to Carrick although maybe that's unfair in itself. Carrick didn't tend to get caught behind the play as much as Blind seems to do and I put that down to Carrick's positioning. I don't think he's playing box to box at all and his role is clearly a lot more restrained that Herrera's.

The more I watch Blind, the more it appears that he's not an actual holding midfielder. He looks like a conventional CM playing out of position.

His passing and general positive play is something I like about him.

2880~~~
Daley Blind is the exact type of player that any top club would want if they were competing for the Champions League. He passes very well and is an intelligent player. Given that he knows van Gaal's system and how well he has performed this season, who would you replace him with? He plays his role fantastically.

2881~~~
Class.

2882~~~
Did well today. Liking his partnership with Herrera, though center mid is obviously a new role for him. He'll get better with time there for sure. Think both of them had around 115 touches of the ball according to whoscored, both so intelligent on and off the ball.

2883~~~
Name me one midfielder that was great defensively who was weak and slow.

2884~~~
Makalele?

2885~~~
Busquets, Carrick... Not weak, Blind isn't weak either, he's just not a "tank" like Matic.

2886~~~
Heh. Well played. 

Neither Blind nor Makalele are particularly weak fwiw.

2887~~~
Bizarre comment agreed. We only paid £7m for Vidic so he wasn't a top player either.

2888~~~
Don't think he was signed by LVG to be a regular starter, he is just a quality bench player who was available at a relatively good price and has some experience with the *cough* PHILOSOPHY <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>.  He is an intelligent player but his lack of athleticism is exposed quite frequently.  You may say that Busquets isn't a lot better physically but he is way more technical than Blind.

2889~~~
Pirlo would be one of them as well. His playing intelligence and great positioning makes up for his lack of physical ability though.

2890~~~
Hes such an intelligent player. Very Scholes like in how he always knows exactly where to direct his first touch. Not his best game but still did his job better than most of the others did theirs.

2891~~~
I love blind but We definitely need a bigger and taller defensive midfielder, blind is weak as a puppy and it shows

2892~~~
Busquets and carrick aren't great defensively. Blind is weak, he offers no physical presence at all, terrible athlete.

2893~~~
You're having a laugh if you think Makalele was weak.

2894~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2895~~~
Well, Blind is taller and weighs more than Makelele. Who can bench press more? Haven't a clue, but Blind isn't weak.

2896~~~
Neither is Blind. I presume what you meant to say was "physically imposing" or something along those lines. Neither Makalele or Blind would put the shits up you in terms of their stature.

2897~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
No wonder you think Blind cant defend then

2898~~~
His performances have been slightly overrated - which comes as no surprise as he is a fan favourite, it seems like some fans are buying into the player rather than his performances, he hasn't been terrible though and its still his first season

2899~~~
Busquets IS great defensively, but I'm not too sure about Carrick.  Carrick is just about decent, not great and not bad.  Before anyone argues just remember a couple of seasons ago how much everyone moaned about using Carrick as a DM.

2900~~~
I don't think there's anything really to support that. If you look at the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/395523/gamecast.html" target="_blank">average position</a> of the two you'll see they're more or less identically placed, and in terms of pressing it was always Blind who was pushing right up to the edge of their box when necessary while Herrera pressed from a deeper position. Blind made plenty of forward runs when we were in possession too. Herrera's the more attacking and creative of the two when in possession but that's about it.

<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Surely the only reason he would be a fan favourite is because his performances have been at a consistently high level?

2901~~~
Let's buy Akinfewa, play him as DM and settle this once for all.

2902~~~
Yea or actually fans are buying into him through his good performances.

Or nah, we all just want to shag him because he's pretty.

2903~~~
What's all this criticism? 

He's not weak. Especially not weak 'as a puppy'.

2904~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah, we bought into him cause he's good looking. I dont care how he plays..

2905~~~
Your words not mine.

He has had some good performances but he has also been shocking in some games - but he didn't get any stick

2906~~~
Can't remember one game where he was <b>shocking</b>. Average? Yes. Bordering bad? Probably, sometimes he just goes with team's performance. Shocking? No.

2907~~~
He was not weak or slow.

2908~~~
Only 5'11, same as Blind. Not having that. Needs to be at least 6'2.

2909~~~
Maybe it was just me but Blind and Ander need to change their game a bit when we have only 2 in midfield,sometimes they pressed in same time leaving a huge hole behind.

2910~~~
Who cares who's bigger, who's got more strength is something else altogether. Its a balance thing when it comes to football, not just size. Sterling despite being tiny is made of some sturdy stuff, in a 50-50 with Gervinho for example the winner wouldn't be the bigger, heavier guy.

2911~~~
I think people expect him to sit deep and defend deep and rely on positioning like Carrick does just because they have similar responsibilities in our build up play.  Blind clearly has been given the freedom to be proactive and press instead of backing off like Carrick does.  We are always going to have those occasional moments where both get caught with a Blind-Herrera midfield because both are proactive with their pressing in the opposition half.  Adding Carrick and going to three in midfield could add a lot of balance to our midfield defensively, because Blind and Herrera could go with their natural instincts and still have cover.  

I think a lot of Blind looking weak is that he tends to go charging in to cover the inordinate amount of space he has to cover with the way we have been set up this season.

2912~~~
Whats the problem with giving away fouls? Whether we like it or not breaking up play like this is a big part of the game and being able to intelligently indentify danger and stopping it through fouling is a big asset.

2913~~~
I think this has less to do with Blind and more to do with how van Gaal wants us to defend. It's not just Blind who's been doing this: everyone's been defending like this.

However, when Blind hasn't been defending aggressively, he's taken up excellent positions and recovered well. On the ball, he's very good at starting off attacks and maintaining possession. I just hope that van Gaal doesn't try to make him an aggressive ball winner as it just isn't his game. He's much better off playing a more disciplined defensive game with a #8 and #10 in the team playing with more aggression, defensively.

2914~~~
Can't believe people say he's poor defensively. Wtf

2915~~~
Only Man. Utd. fans can make such arguments. I think most of them still want a Keane-like midfielder, and seeing midfielders like Matic, Wanyama, Schneiderlin, etc., makes them want these sort of players even more than those who aren't physically strong.

2916~~~
It's almost like reading criticism of Carrick from 5/6 years back. Ridiculous.

2917~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This has to be one of the most bizarre things i've read on here.

1. Busquets and Carrick not great defensively. Really? 
2. Weak? Slow, yes, but he is certainly not weak
3. "Physical presence". By that logic Valencia is our best player by a mile, seeing as he is a physical beast. He is not though is he?

2918~~~
I bet that it'll take some time before they really warm up to Blind. They're ignoring the rest of his defensive game and just focusing on him trying to close down the opposition with aggression and tenacity.

2919~~~
Don't understand this criticism in the slightest.

He's had some great games, and no particularly bad games. He was decent today, nothing special but it was a solid performance.

2920~~~
Makelele was very strong and had very strong acceleration until he was comfortably into his 30's. Weird thing to even have to defend, but he was already 30 when he came to the Prem, so I tihnk people think he was slower than he really was.

2921~~~
Has the odd wayward touch that sends the ball into a dangerous area, every few games or so, but in general he's having a great impact this season. Good at providing outlets for the defence, good at reading dangerous situations and rushing to tackle, to clear or to intercept, and he's good at sensing when he needs to move the ball on quickly. Most of all, he seems to have a really good awareness of what's going on around him, and in turning the right way on the ball to get into space, and he doesn't wig out under pressure.

One of our best signings this season.

2922~~~
Didn't think he was that good to be honest. Gave the ball away a few too many times and picked up a lot of fouls. If Fellaini had committed the same fouls I guarantee he would have been booked and copped it on here. His form has dropped away a bit which is disappointing but it is a new league and all that. Wouldn't mind giving him a spell for Carrick soon just to freshen him up again.

2923~~~
Stopping counter attacks by committing a foul is a smart thing to do. If you're not gonna catch the player you might as well bring him down. If that's what his detractors are arguing about...

2924~~~
I don't think that's what he meant. I think he meant if he was a top player then teams would be willing to pay £30m for him and that that isn't the case.

2925~~~
That argument is still flawed though. Doubt clubs would have paid that for Carrick but he has been massively important for our team. Certain individuals not massively rated externally can still be a lynch pin for a team.

2926~~~
Good squad player but we need better. Slow and lacks toughness but great on the ball and reads the game well. But think we need a step up in quality if we want to be the best.

2927~~~
What about teams that pay 30 mln quid for shit players?

Just because a team is forced/willing to pay certain amount of money for a player it doesn't make him a 'certain-amount-of-money' player.

2928~~~
Exactly right. Technically competent, positionally aware, passes well and tactically astute. My only reservation is his strength and ability to dominate a physical battle against the elite sides.

2929~~~
We need him or Herrera to introduce the scholes type pass into our game. Hopefully they keep on improving.

2930~~~
He's good for the sitting role, I don't really like him as a B2B pressing very high. I think we still need a high enery B2B midfielder in the summer.

2931~~~
I think the chance is zero chance on his own but lets be honest we need a box to box type next to him. I could argue we could do with 2 CMs an if we could get one for the 25m mark aka Gundogan I'd be chuffed with 2 as Carrick is 34 and I see Di Maria playing in the frony 3 next season if he's even still here!

2932~~~
Been given limited support, but still absolutely powerless to stop Newcastle advancing from their own half into United's box every time they're given half a chance. Been left for dead a couple of times. 

You can count interceptions and adore every pass, but the basic job of a defensive midfielder is stopping the opposition getting into the box through the middle. Not happened.

2933~~~
You can't expect one player to prevent every single attack. The vulnerability isn't down to Blind, he puts in a good shift. The problem is that with him on his own there are acres of space to either side that expose the defence. Even if Blind was the fastest, strongest player in the world, he cannot cover the entire width of the pitch alone. IT's a risk you take when you play with only one midfielder given a defensive role.

2934~~~
He has been average for a while now

2935~~~
Carrick is still a far better midfielder. Blind is too easy to get past.

2936~~~
I thought he was decent on the ball again but his lack of pace is still a worry for me in the deepest sitting midfielder.

2937~~~
Actually thought he looked a bit tired today - a little like Carrick got when we were playing him non-stop earlier in the season.

2938~~~
Good on the ball but one of the worst defensive midfielders in the league when he is faced with a pacey breaking team.

2939~~~
His passing more than anyone else's infuriates me. There were times tonight where a simple ball to Rojo was on ahead of him with no one within 20 yards of Rojo, these weren't eye of the needle passes, just simple balls out wide and every time he went back to Evans.

I don't know if it is lack of vision or lack of confidence in playing a simple pass like that, either way is worrying.

2940~~~
Don't get this, played loads of balls forward, has better passing vision than carrick for me.

2941~~~
I should stress that it isn't all the time. But Carrick plays those balls to the left back if they are getting forward, Blind doesn't. It happened a few times against Sunderland as well.

It could be that I am looking for it, I dunno. Just saying that sometimes it gets to me. That and he lets people get past him too easy, half heartedly over commits to a challenge or gets caught too close to someone and is brushed aside.

But as someone else pointed out, he could be knackered.

2942~~~
To be fair, I don't think it's really a style that suits Blind at all. He's not the workhorse defensive midfielder who's going to chase down every ball relentlessly and throw in great tackles. He's better at pushing the ball forward with accurate passes, and at intercepting the ball when it's within his range. Ideally could probably do with someone playing beside him against counter attacking teams.

2943~~~
Better vision than Carrick? I highly doubt it, Carricks passing range and vision on top form is brilliant, Blind is still rather limited in his passing

2944~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2945~~~
Not his best performance. Needs to be given a rest for a week or so I think, get Carrick in.

2946~~~
Yeah hilarious. Carrick's assists over the last 3 seasons is....?

2947~~~
I wonder how many assists a defensive midfielder typically gets and whether it's relevant in anyway, though...

2948~~~
Brilliant is a stretch these days for carrick.....

2949~~~
Some people just look to criticise him, on the break vs Sissoko, few players can stop him, he's so fast, so strong but also has loads of ability, got caught out sometimes, other than that he had plenty of interceptions, good tackles, slidings, duels won, alway available and passed the ball forwards. For a player defending in midfield on his own, he did a good job.

2950~~~
He's gone off the boil a bit in the last few weeks imo. Might need a rest.

2951~~~
Blind is more forceful in his passing when compared to Carrick, who's measured. Carrick's definitely got the better range though, no doubt about it.

2952~~~
He had a fairly good game, defensively. He did a very good job stopping most of Newcastle's attacks. However, I agree with <a class="username" data-user="9858, @Stobzilla" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/9858/">@Stobzilla</a> in that he was, at times, quite slow and safe in his game when he could have upped it. I think that may be down to some fatigue and Blind not willing to take too many risks and potentially face more breaks.

Still, though, he's been very good as a defensive midfielder, and I hope he continues to play. He offers more energy than Carrick at the moment and plays faster than Carrick does as well.

2953~~~
Its relevant when you look at how United played in the last few seasons, a 2 man midfield with the deep lying player needing to be creative suggests quite a lot. Carrick doesn't play killer passes, in fact I'm struggling to remember the last time he opened up a defense. Not only that but Blind tends to dictate from much higher up the pitch, Carrick will often do it from behind the centre backs, your passing is bound to be shorter in that respect.

2954~~~
yeah, if we want good player on the ball there we can play Mata, Blind is the slowest player on the planet maybe and pretty weak in physical duels. 

We certainly need someone pacier and stronger, no need for playmaker, he rather plays the ball sideways or to the center backs anyway. Not that Herrera was anything special today in that matter tho..

2955~~~
Do you watch matches? Just looked it up, 46 of his 67 passes per match are forwards, that's nearly 70 percent.

2956~~~
That is absolutely bullshit he's out of depth in many ways. Certainly his physicality is the biggest concern, he was pushed from the ball too many times today and the season and he has zero pace. ZERO. He was exposed not only in this game. He would be a good player in Italy but certainly wouldn't play for top 10 world clubs, no chance..Premier league is simply different to Eredivise where he played in a team which dominated the league..

He's actually benefiting from Van Gaal's trust and knowledge of his tactics. Other palyers are starting to picking up his tactics, slowly so they will get ahead of him soon.. There are dozen of better and more suitable players to play there for us.. 

He's a good squad option in the future but absolutely no way a starting player for champions league final against the best team in the world. So hilarious<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2957~~~
Reminds me of Bentaleb. Quality passer, tidy, both make masses of tackles and interceptions which look great in the stat column and yet both need their goalkeepers to save them several times virtually every match.

A lot of that's on the balance issue not Blind (Pochettino seems to accept it and try to outscore the opposition, Van Gaal tries to negate it with loads of possession, though Di Maria often makes that come unstuck), but I can't keep giving Blind the 7 or 8 out of 10s I gave him earlier in the season, when it's so easy to penetrate down the centre, even when a team have limited possession.

Sissoko is very good at exploiting it though. Been Newcastle's best player since Cabaye left.

2958~~~
Thought daley had a good game, first half broke up play well in MF worse off as game progressed but put his shift in.

2959~~~
Don't worry I watched it and I actually came here to praise him today over Herrera who seemed to be too tidy today. Blind is a good passer tends to pick simple passes today he looked little bit more positive to be fair to him, that's certain but if we take him as passing sort of DM, he should be doing much better.. 

It's his defensive ability which worries me more. He's actually not great at anything

2960~~~
Stopped reading when I noticed you compared Blind wjth Bentaleb, sorry. If you dont rate them, fine.

2961~~~
You're off your rocker.

2962~~~
Name some better passing DM's? Carrick, Busquets, would like to see your lists on thid one.

2963~~~
No complaints with his game today. He & Ander worked well together, keeping the ball moving and cycling it. Maybe could've been quicker switching the point of attack, but that's what Rooney does. But Rooney was leading the line, not playing the #10 today, so having Fellaini was a bit useless. I figure the concern was maybe having Newcastle trying to bully the midfield, but they were sitting back trying to absorb instead of boss the game. 

It will be interesting to see which of Blind, Herrera or Carrick sit in the next game, although I doubt Carrick is really ready anyway.

2964~~~
This was your praise:

2965~~~
Or if you have a player like Matic you don't need another player alongside him to allow him to work.

2966~~~
I feel he should definitely leave all of the offensive play through the middle to Herrera. On the ball in an advanced position, I feel he slows our play so much that it hurts, whereas Herrera has far more urgency.

Beaten way too easily in midfield too, but this wasn't much of a surprise given his pace.

2967~~~
That's why Mourinho plays Ramires next to him in big matches?

2968~~~
Mourinho likes to stink out the joint in big matches. I don't think that is a reflection on Matic. I just don't think there is any point in bringing another midfielder just to get the best out of Blind, I don't think he is worth it.

2969~~~
A 4-3-3 system in which he would be playing just in front of the centre backs, would suit him nicely.  Then play Herrera/Carrick and di Maria in front, with Januzaj and Young on the wings and Rooney down the middle.  <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2970~~~
Why should I? I just don't think his passing is on the level which would make up for his physical/defensive/movement stats.. He's no Pirlo with his passing but no Matic at all either who is the best defensive minded midfielder in Premier league, apart his defensive skills also very good and imo better passer than Blind but it's mostly overlooked..

And I stated many times that we need different kind of player for the position.. People see someone other than Cleverley there and already think the player's world class. For me I hope Blind will become some good reliable player in the future but for our push for the Premier league titles in the coming seasons and for the encounters with the best world's teams I guess we should aspire higher. And we may not find another Scholes in the future but Blind is certainly not the answer long term.

 We set our standards too low here but I will let you think otherwise..

2971~~~
Because it just looks like another very loose statement from you to me. O well..

2972~~~
Like you really had something to say..

2973~~~
Think he is a very good midfield player, intelligent, good work ethic, good distribution and has scored a couple of important goals for us, he is a yard of pace shy of being a brilliant player but he is still certainly worth the money we paid for him.

2974~~~
You make a statement, I ask you to back it up and you dont want to, probably because it was made out of nothing. I already showed that one of your statements was crap, it just looks like you have an opinion on him, and therefore just blast out anything that comes to mind. Not saying Blind is a world beater, but some of your statements just look like they're based on dross.

2975~~~
I thought he was poor tonight, to soft and can't run. Good squad player but average in my opinion. We need better if we are going to win trophies!

2976~~~
I think Blind is better at passing than Matic, but there you go.

2977~~~
We will sign a top class defensive midfielder in the summer.

2978~~~
I struggle to understand how people don't see he's a good player. He's no world beater, sure, but he's still so very important.

2979~~~
He looked absolutely knackered tonight. I reckon the WC might be catching up on him.

2980~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Nope.

2981~~~
Don't think its the world cup, He hasn't even played many games this season.

2982~~~
Totally agreed.

2983~~~
I understand why some feel theres drawbacks to his game, certainly his strength and mobility in general, but I feel like if we had more players like Blind we'd be better off each week, players who reliably give 7/10 each week despite not being a physical specimen or technical genius, just solid players that you can always rely upon to put in a good shift come hell or high water.

2984~~~
Hes running our midfield on his own which doesnt help. Id be interested to see his distance per game stats. He had a month off injured remember, so cant be the WC.

2985~~~
For a first season in the PL he is doing reasonably well. Of course he needs to adapt to the physical side as both he and Herrera are losing too many 50/50s. My concern is that he has a tendency to press high up the pitch on an individual basis, rather than as part of a clear team strategy. Fortunately for us, this season, opposing teams' have made a total mess of numerous inviting counter-attack positions. We really need to be more aware of the potential danger in various situations, and not leave ourselves quite so vulnerable. Blind needs to position himself so that he can limit the threat from the counter-attack when the likes of Di Maria give the ball away. If we are chasing the game in the last 20 mins then he can take more risks.

2986~~~
I agree, good player but like Rojo I see him more as a strong squad addition than a locked in starting 11 player for a title challenging United side.

2987~~~
Agreed on both, though they're both 24 and in a new league, so I think either or both could end up improving enough to start.

They're both versatile footballers who have good styles to play for a top club with Rojo's pace in defense being a good fit for a team that presses high and forces longer balls and Blind's passing skills being well ahead of most DM's, and many good teams prefer a passer at the base there.

2988~~~
That said, Blind got a bit lost on the Smalling penalty incident. Nothing horrific but bit spacy for a DM.

2989~~~
People talk about Blind like hes an experience premier league defensive midfielder... He's been playing in the dutch league. He's going to take time to come to grips in arguably the most physical position in the game in the fastest league. 

He's done fantastically well considering it's a massive step up from where he's been playing and the other issues of joining a new team with new ideas. He will grow in his role and learn adapt far better in his second season. Wouldn't be surprised to see him buff up a bit over the off season to deal with it. Certainly not a player that you have to worry about losing speed with.

2990~~~
Very true. 

I don't Blind as a squad addition due to his versatility. He is a definite upgrade on the likes of Cleverley, Anderson and Fletcher. 

Rojo, I am not sure about. Doesn't look a very bright footballer to me.

2991~~~
I agree Blind dictates from higher up compared to Carrick but no way is Carrick playing from "behind the central defence". 

And never seen Carrick play a killer pass? I can recall plenty but the debate is pointless if you cannot remember any.

2992~~~
Our best player after Rooney and De Gea

2993~~~
I hope so as Blind is not good enough for a starter week in week out imo.

2994~~~
Clearly I didn't mean he's never played a killer pass but its hardly in his repertoire is it? Carrick often drops behind the back 4 or level with them, he does this when teams press high against him as he needs more space to operate than Blind. Personally, its why I think his best football so far has come from playing in the middle of a back 3, if we were to finish the season playing this formation he'd be an instant starter alongside Smalling for me.

2995~~~
No pace watch the game again for a defensive midfielder off the ball that's a performance we have been used to seeing a ill Fletcher make. On the ball very composed and keeps it ticking over very well. But not enough, we played with 10 men cause of Blind last night. We can't afford that (worrying times)

2996~~~
Its because we are massively open at the moment to the counter, we compress a midfield a little more and that openness goes, the same has happened to Carrick in the past, you leave either player isolated against pace and they're fecked. Its a tactical thing more than anything.

2997~~~
Agree he's done very well in general, though not so much the past month or two, in difficult circumstances (though helped having a manager he knew previously). 

Where I'd disagree is the "far better in his second season" assumption, with regards to any player, not just him. Fans think this of just about every player in their early 20s and very rarely does it turn out the case to any significant degree (certainly not as much as we think it).

Ask Everton fans pre-season and they would have been sure McCarthy, Stones, Barkley and Lukaku would have built off last season. Paulinho and Chiriches were very good their first season (level with Blind and Rojo), but completely fell off the map and were swallowed up by other players emerging.

Bright footballer and team-player, so could probably do with beefing himself up if the pace already isn't there to begin with as you say. Still feel a physically gifted imperfect midfielder would be more likely to improve than Blind. Just not sure he has any higher steps to go to. 

Overall, had an impressive first season given it's a difficult league and the physical qualities lacking aren't his fault. But the manager's forcing too much responsibility on him and he's not come up to it more recently, when teams look to counter attack.

2998~~~
No Blind should be seeing things earlier and he ponders and does a lot of walking. Going through the motions shutting players down, never making his presence felt. He must be a very easy player to play against.

2999~~~
Sorry, each to their own but that's just nonsense, Blind works his arse off for this team.

3000~~~
Was talking about on top form. Yet, Blind's vision doesnt come close to Carrick's, neither his passing range

3001~~~
Was fine, needs to be a little more adventurous though. I mean even Valencia is happy to dink a ball over a defender.

3002~~~
Maybe he needs a bit of rest. I think we should start him and Carrick both in our big games.

3003~~~
I'm not meaning to say he doesn't if that comes across as that I put it wrong. I mean he is a mile of where he should be at times due to his severe lack of a burst of pace.

3004~~~
The same way so many on here do not see value in Carrick.  The same way Real has let both Alonso and Makele go.  The average fan does not undrstand that some of the best defensive DCM are never seen because all their work is done off the ball cutting off angles, and their best offensive work is simple passes that just keep possesion and cycle the ball. 

DCMs do very simple unglamorous and  *critical* work.  Good ones often are overlooked, but bad ones are often on the losing end of games.

3005~~~
Blind is under benzodiazepines

3006~~~
His form has taken a real nosedive over the past month or so

3007~~~
Still a worry against pace and power but seems to have more freedom when on the ball than either Herrera or Fellaini who both seem scared to try anything risky.

3008~~~
He is fantastic in games where we have a lot of possession, but in high intensity games he always struggles.

3009~~~
Been poor for a month. And players running past him too easily for my liking.

3010~~~
Seems to be struggling with high tempo of the game.

3011~~~
Struggling again. His positioning is really really suspect. Bring on Carrick next to him and he'll look a lot better.

3012~~~
Something we've all feared. Arsenal are too fast for him. Fortunately I don't think we will face another team as fast as them this season (Liverpool?).

3013~~~
Shocking today. Panicky and error prone. Between him and Smalling, and to a lesser extent Valencia, they managed to ruin what was by and large a decent team performance by just gifting Arsenal chance after chance.

3014~~~
He dwells on the ball too much for my taste.

3015~~~
He's not a DM. Will look a lot better with Carrick behind him.

Played a couple of fantastic passes today though.

3016~~~
Indeed and even won some headers, it looks a trend to say he's struggling he was fine.

3017~~~
Not good enough on current form and has been playing for too long

3018~~~
How he stayed on ahead of Herrera is mindboggling.

3019~~~
Annoyingly poor today when we needed a good performance. Far too slow on the ball, not good defensively and guilty of some horrendous decision making. Probably needs a rest.

3020~~~
Awful with the ball.

Everything bounced off him. 

Overran easily but I don't blame him. He was left exposed in that sense.

3021~~~
Blind is way more important to us than herrera but I still don't think he's a man utd level player......I would hope he will be an outstanding squad player next year if we can land the likes of Carvalho and Bender come the summer

3022~~~
He isn't made for helter skelter football. Really struggled tonight. The game was far too fast for him.

3023~~~
He's been a good buy but he's limited, largely due to his lack of pace/acceleration. He isnt the long term solution to our midfield base.

3024~~~
His lack of pace and physicality are exposed today

3025~~~
His limited compared to Carrick and tonight I thought his drunk at one point, he was all over the place but the whole team was also...

3026~~~
Not going to go and dig up all my previous posts over the last month, in which iv been saying the same as I will today. His form has been poor for around 5-6 weeks now, and truth be told I'm not sure he is the answer for us at DM.

3027~~~
He is a slower version of Carrick...without the ability to pass forward or more than 5 yards.

Get the impression he is too weak for the epl.

3028~~~
He's too slow, simple as that. We'd be fine with him if everything else was great, like when Carrick was playing with a great team all around him.

3029~~~
This dip of form has become a proper issue.

He's been awful for ages now, but its kind of gone under the radar.

3030~~~
Some of the concerns I had about him are starting to surface, I just think you can see the difference when Carrick came. Blind might be a better fit with a stronger DM behind him.

3031~~~
His lack of pace combined with below average/poor positioning is too easy to exploit.

3032~~~
It's concerning how far his form has dropped. I think that is all it is, a minor blip. Struggles with pace and power though. Am worried about him at Anfield against Coutinho, Sterling, Sturridge etc.

3033~~~
Carrick is a lot more composed under pressure too. When he gets pressed he can feint his way past a man. Blind is really poor when players are on him, he has to get rid.

3034~~~
Pretty plain today.

3035~~~
Keeps the ball well slower than a retired Larry White. We need better if we are going to win anything. Good squad player at best!

3036~~~
£16m player but that's all, might be ok as a utility sub but not title winnng quality.

3037~~~
Nowhere near good enough to be starting for a club our size. Still find it baffling that some were trying to convince me he's a good player defensively, its like putting a cone out there ffs. He's barely better than Anita.

3038~~~
Glenn Whelan with better hair.

3039~~~
Gets absolutely skinned when put up against pace and power, which is exactly what you don't want from a DM. I'm starting to think he really might not be a DM, and that our only true DM is Carrick.

3040~~~
Gone off the boil, lack of pace really showed up against the more quicker and technical midfielders, good to see Carrick back.

3041~~~
He is so easy to get passed
I thought he was a defender for Ajax, i actually thought we signed him to play CB

3042~~~
He's pretty pointless at times. He's fine up against someone shite at home but gets shown up against a midfield who can actually turn with the ball. He's average and I wouldn't want him starting for us next season.

3043~~~
The thing with Blind is - he wins the ball, but a lot of the time it seems to be purely because we're so high up the pitch that there's acres of space for him to mop up the loose ball dropping out of the box. It gives the impression that he's reading the game well, but it's not actually the most difficult job. 

I said yonks ago (I think back when we played QPR) that I wasn't convinced, and a few people are starting to see it now. He's a relatively intelligent player, versatile, a manager's dream squad player. But that's all he is at a top side.

3044~~~
His worst game for us by a long shot in my opinion. Really does get skinned to easily by a bit of pace and power (Alan Hansen's voice is automatically in my head saying that).

3045~~~
Getting 'found out', pressure him a bit and he cracks. He can be a decent squad player(yet another expensive one), similar to O'Shea in that he can plug in the cracks and fill in different positions but long term if LVG thinks he is the long term answer to our holding midfield, then its another in the long line of reasons why LVG shouldn't be Manchester United manager.
Judging by how much he picks him though and never subs him regardless of mediocrity in performance, I fear that is the case.

3046~~~
He's got Mason, Bentaleb and Dembele next. Every single one is bigger and quicker than him. He's visibly getting slower every game. Really struggled with their pace tonight.

Over all this season he's been better than I thought he'd be, but he's still nothing more than a squad player in the long run.

3047~~~
Still wont get dropped, probably first name on the team sheet behind RvP. Annoying

3048~~~
Don't rate him. Far too slow for this league, doesn't possess the top quality to make up for it. Nearly gifts a goal at least once a game with his passing.

3049~~~
Will be interesting to see if he starts against Spurs. Going to be very easily overrun if he does I feel. Carrick should be starting next game.

3050~~~
Not impressed with his half arsed challenges. I liked him at the start of the season when he was tenacious and putting in 100% but right now I get the impression that he feels he's made it and doesn't have to try as hard anymore. Hopefully it is tiredness rather than that but I'm a little concerned. Our defence isn't great and the guy who is meant to be protecting it needs to put in more effort than that.

3051~~~
Yeah, Carrick is lightning.

3052~~~
Even today he showed more mobility than Blind did, and has managed to be the anchor in our team for several years.

3053~~~
No, but he's still quicker, and his positioning is better so that he generally doesn't have to make up as much ground as Blind does.

3054~~~
If you think he is more mobile than Blind, then carry on believing that, and I promise that I won't feed your imaginary giraffe.

3055~~~
Of course he will start, him and RVP are LVG's pets, different rules apply to them.

3056~~~
I don't think he has gotten found out, more like a dip in performance. I didn't think he was that great to begin with and he had done better than he had thought but the entire team has been pretty dreadful of late and his own form isn't masking that.

3057~~~
Jesus! Tonight he looked laboured, but Carrick is not quicker than him.

3058~~~
So has Rojo and today Ander was poor. I think the pace of the league is catching up to the new players.

3059~~~
To be fair, it's a bit like arguing what's faster, a cushion or a desk tidy... regardless, I'd say Carrick is marginally quicker, but that's not the main point - the point is that his positioning is better, thus he has less ground to cover (and so can do it quicker)

3060~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Blind is looking jaded, and that may be affecting your judgement. Carrick does read the game better though.
Why LVG would think Carrick, Fellaini and Blind would be a match for Arsenal's much quicker midfield, I'll never know.
Herrera was poor going forward, but we lost the midfield with that sub.

3061~~~
Hopefully Dembele doesn't start as he'd eat him up, thankfully even if he does start, his decision making in the final third isn't likey to hurt us all that much.

3062~~~
I think I could skip past the lad

3063~~~
Good first half with some nice passing, but he looks more suited to being one of 2 CM's than the lone DM in bigger games.

3064~~~
Just don't think he's particularly suited to the big games really. He's a very smart player, maybe he's just really out of form, but his lack of mobility and size meant they got through him and Herrera pretty easily. I think there's a lot he can learn from Carrick in terms of positioning himself defensively to make us more secure, as we just seem a lot more secure through the middle with Carrick.

3065~~~
I think his mobility causes less problems than we think it should since his positioning is good. But he does have problems with strength at times that you just don't see from top DM's. 

In big games, I could see Blind and another CM in front of the back 4 doing a good job as a double pivot.

3066~~~
Buzzes around all over the place to NOT get stuck in.

Give me Carrick. Sticks to his position and his passing is better.

3067~~~
Carrick reads the game better and his passing is far superior to Blind's.  The only time that I've liked Blind has been when he's been stuck out on the left side.

3068~~~
He's limited, no denying that but he can be a real credit playing in a system that compensates for his limitations.

3069~~~
Getting criticized but darling Herrera gets an easy pass, he had a good first half and made lots of forward and incisive passes, faded in the second half.

3070~~~
Don't be silly, Ander is the best player in the league and Blind gets bodied by OAPs.

3071~~~
You could see how much better Carrick is when he came on. Better passing range, cooler under pressure and stronger on the ball. I don't think Van Gaal will drop Blind though.

There was one point in the first half when Ozil did his best to lose the ball to Blind but he couldn't even take the gift he was so immobile.

3072~~~
That's the problem.  too many players with limitations like wanting to use only one foot.

3073~~~
This level of defensive performance has been the norm for him more often than not this season. But the footballing hipsters tried to pretend he was great defensively and everyone else just couldn't see it. He's not a DM. Full stop.

Should be playing further up the pitch or not at all.

3074~~~
Yip agree with most comments . Blind looks decent with time and space but pressed with pace and power and he folds like a pack of cards.

3075~~~
Story of our midfield for so many seasons now.

3076~~~
Which coincided with us losing grip of the game and losing it too, Carrick might be better, but his introduction yesterday didn't tell us that. He was brought on to give us more control of the game, we lost grip in the second half so I don't understand your logic.

3077~~~
I don't see your logic either pal so I guess we are even on that score.

3078~~~
A new scapegoat.

3079~~~
Nothing to do with being a new scapegoat. Every time he's played against someone with a bit of pace and power they bully him. The Caf is only now seeing that.

3080~~~
This sort of post irritates me. If you're allowed to praise a player after a good performance (and lots have - just look back through this thread) then you can also criticize after a bad performance. Besides that, has anyone directly blamed him for yesterdays result? You need to go to the Valencia thread for that...

3081~~~
so i guess i'm not the only one who has seen that his weaknesses seem to be his lack of speed and power and that he gets bullied in games

3082~~~
Not true at all. We immediately looked a lot more solid at the back in the 2nd half with Carrick in the team. It was only after we conceded that we begun to lose control.

3083~~~
I personally thought we lost the initiative, Arsneal were very sloppy on the ball rather than us being more solid. Also Blind and Smalling were not giving up posession as much as in the first half.

3084~~~
We cant legislate for our players being idiots and Smalling gave up possession in the 2nd half as well. However there was notable difference in the amount of space available to Arsenal. Also, unlike Blind, Carrick doesn't get caught behind the ball which is criminal for a supposed DM.

3085~~~
True on that last point, but I think our pressing first half was causing them problems, we sat back second half clear change in approach and I don't think it did us any favours.

3086~~~
that's because his starting position, you logically have more time when you're dropping deep in between the center backs. Players more advanced like Herrera  needs to be constantly moving and have too little time because the pressing is much more intense. I'd like to see Herrera do more, as he has good turn and nice acceleration to get rid of his marking man and release some good ball. Fellaini is too clumsy he seems to only know how to chest the ball down and cover the ball well at times..

Blind is alright it's his level we can't expect from him that much more, his lack of pace and strength is really worrying when defending

3087~~~
I love how Mata can't get a game because he's considered too weak to be part of our attack but Blind seems to get a free ride from the manager on being a soft sack of panic with no balls.

Blind at holding and Fellaini in number 10 is just not going to cut it for Manchester United, both be great on the bench though.

3088~~~
One poor performance and now Carrick is far better than Blind, despite him having basically the same weakness of being slow and not the most powerful one.I think Carrick is better too but totally disagree with the way people argued it.

You can see a lot of people already wrote him off in this thread.Not good enough to be a regular apparently despite performed better than most of the other "regulars" this season.

3089~~~
People have thought Carrick is better than Blind for a while (Look at the Blind vs. Carrick thread!). 

And Carrick is slow - but his positional sense is far better than Blind's - so he's often in the right place, or near to it... which means he has less ground to cover and thus doesn't have to rely on his speed (or lack of)

3090~~~
I don't think that anyone in history has ever thought that Blind is better than Carrick. There is nothing to base that opinion on.

Blind and Rojo are the only two players in the squad that are 100% Van Gaal's signings. I think those two will get more slack than others.

3091~~~
Good game - very good addition.

Bad game - Squad player at best. 

No middle ground.

3092~~~

3093~~~
No issues with his performance, some good passes. It was strange we partnered him with Carrick in the second half, it was obvious van Gaal wanted a less open game unfortunately, we'd have won had we kept going as we were and we'd be praising Blind.

3094~~~
To be honest I thought he had a shocking first half by the standards he's set this year.  He looked slow, his passing was all over the place, he was missing tackles and I wouldn't have been surprised to see him come off for Carrick at half time.  He improved slightly in the second half, but it says it all really when Wellbeck was constantly tackling both Blind and Carrick in the second half, how deep we our midfielders are.

3095~~~
He is a good player. Not brilliant and not a squad player at best.
We should get a commanding DM with whom Blind would function very good.
He either plays with Herrera who goes forward a lot or with Carrick with whom he makes a slow midfield who sits too deep.

He had some very good games this year which people conviniently forget every time he has a bad game.

3096~~~
I absolutely agree with you, infact i have been saying this since January

3097~~~
It's interesting that Blinds defensive stats are so much better than Carricks this season when Carricks positional sense is apparently so much better.

I disagree, I think they just have very different styles. Carrick is less likely to get overrun because he constantly backs off and defends quite deep. He doesn't take the chances that Blind does in pressing. It's easy to say that Carrick offers less risk as it's rare people are getting past him, but we win the ball back slower when he's there instead of Blind. It's an either or approach rather than one being better than the other, for me.

I know that different style can be used to explain the differences in defensive stats, but Carricks were more similarly comparable to Blind until this season, and it's not like his game has changed much (our game, maybe).

3098~~~
I have some bizarre idea that he cannot tackle for shite, is it just me ?

3099~~~
Well, couldn't that be down to the fact that our best run this season coincided with Carrick coming back into the side - and thus we generally played better in those games, and there was less defending to do? You just have to watch the amount of ground that both players seem to cover (Blind looks like he's forever running around, whilst Carrick is where he needs to be more-often then not... but then Carrick is a much more experienced player than Blind, so it's not a crime for Daley to not have the sense that Carrick has yet).

We may win the ball back slower with Carrick (though not that much for me to be honest) but then when he has it we move out of defense quicker, as he is much more assured in his passing and quicker in his decision making than Blind.

3100~~~
I just cant understand why is always + or - with some posters. I guess forums are like that.

3101~~~
Thats because Blind presses quite a bit, and Carrick doesn't bother. They play the game slightly differently, they both read the game very well. However Carrick prefers to sit of the opposition and let them have the ball, where as Blind along with Herrera and Di Maria like to press the opposition and try and win the ball higher up the pitch. It's more high risk though, as if the opposition break that press then Blind has to run back and try and get back in position.

3102~~~
He needs a yaya toure next to him, a strong combative midfielder.

3103~~~
Fair point - and I think it's a bit daft to have our DM pressing high up the pitch - especially when our defence needs all the help it can get.

Might not be a Blind thing as opposed to a LVG thing though... or maybe I'm just used to seeing (and liking) how Carrick goes about his business.

3104~~~
Come onn.. When we want to criticize that run was our worst run performance wise and when we want to praise it's our best run results wise. The games against Everton, Chelsea, City which were good performances against good teams had Blind without Carrick. Southampton and Arsenal was Carrick without Blind, with results but terrible play. Our only good game in that period was Hull, where Carrick was brilliant - but Blind was similarly brilliant in the games against Leicester and QPR. 

Defensive wise, Blind is more Fletcher than Carrick, which is why he's running around a lot more. There are definitely times when he should probably be more cautious, but as you said that would hopefully come with age. Similarly there are times when Carrick should have the opportunity to step up, be more aggressive and take a risk and he doesn't. 

I don't see the thought process of Carrick being in the team requiring less defensive work. Surely that's only possible if you've forgotten the performances?

3105~~~
Maybe but one worked in the first half, and the other (not pressing) didn't work very well in the second.
I don't like the fact we try to take all the risk out of the game, without risk there is little reward tbh

3106~~~
It didn't really "work" in the first half - as Arsenal still got at us... the main difference in the first half is that we had Herrera providing some legs to get around the defense/midfield and we actually tried to play some football - the second half however we had no legs in midfield (neither Carrick nor Blinds fault) and were trying to be too direct without fully committing to it. Also, everyone's passing went to absolute shit.

There was Newcastle as well. We also completely dominated Palace, had the majority of the game against Stoke and beat Liverpool 3-0 (though Carrick was in defence I think?).

3107~~~
We were shit against Palace who sat back for most of the game. Mata came on to score a late winner, in a game where we created very little.

3108~~~
The point is the amount of defensive work we had to do in that game - which was zero.

3109~~~
You'll conceed chances in games, most of them were due to us giving the ball away needlessly. Arsneal didn't create much first half.
We had the better chances and dominated posession, we got the equaliser and then we were on the accendancy.

3110~~~
Yes because Palace didn't bother attacking... great

3111~~~
Very good buy imo.

3112~~~
The 3-0 against Liverpool would only be another results one though. How much did we get overrun that game? Our midfield was nowhere. The reason I didn't bring it up was because Carrick was in defense as you said.

The Palace, Newcastle and Stoke game - you think they'd have gone differently had we swapped the 2? I don't. The same I'm sure we still would have battered QPR and Leicester with Carrick instead of Blind. Blind was very good in defense against Palace too, and did very well bringing the ball from the back. You could have swapped the two round and that game went exactly the same.

You could then point to awful games like Stoke or Spurs away where we were dire and our midfield got overrun plenty. Carrick being atleast partially at fault for N'Zonzis goal infact.

My point isn't that one is better than the other, I just think they have different styles and are pretty interchangeable. I don't think our results/performances with either in the team have been any better than the other. I definitely feel there's no noticeable difference in the amount of defensive work when ones in the team. That makes 0 sense to me.

3113~~~
Woah, we weren't "dire" against Spurs away... we dominated that game, particularly the first half.

You said about it being interesting that Blinds defensive stats are better than Carricks - I pointed out that Carrick has played more games where we played better and had to do less defending... I'm not talking about his performance in those games being masterful or anything, just that that would be a reason as to why his defensive stats aren't as good - because he had less defending to do.

Exactly the point. See above.

3114~~~
To be fair, you did say Carrick coming back into the side - 'thus' less defending. But even if you're conceding that now/I misunderstood, and that it was simply down to the games played, couldn't you just spin it the other way as 'of course Carrick has looked less suspect and not been overrun so often - he's played in the games against teams who don't attack'.

Considering this is a first season in the premier league, coming from the Dutch league too, compounded by a serious injury, covering multiple roles in multiple systems at a still young age for the type of player he is then Blind has had an excellent season overall so far. His level has dropped in the last month, which I expect is due to tiredness more than anything else. He can have a huge future at United.

That second paragraph isn't aimed at you by the way.

3115~~~
Lock him in the gym all summer.

3116~~~
To be honest, I thought he would be signed as a very good squad player, who can play a few different positions competently but our inability to get other midfield targets together with injuries have meant that he's had to be a regular starter

3117~~~
To a point - the main thing was a reason why Blind would have better defending stats than Carrick, because he's played in games where we've had moer to do - but as an aside, I do think we do play better football with Carrick on the pitch - namely because his passing is the best in our squad, and he doesn't take forever on the ball like everyone seems to do at the moment... but this season "better football" really is like marginal gains... 

I like Blind a lot - I think he's been a good signing and has had a good season - I do however think he needs to offer the defense more protection then he currently gives though - especially in bigger games like yesterday. But then I also think we've overplayed him a bit and now he's a bit knacked - like Carrick was by the end of December.

3118~~~
I actually think that passing is more style than anything else too. Blind plays plenty of fantastic passes, but he seems to have far more focus on playing a quick simple ball and keeping things ticking. I actually think Carrick is a slower passer, which is why his passes are generally a little more rewarding. Carrick will take a few seconds to assess options before playing a pass between the lines to a winger further forward. In that same period Blind will have moved the ball on straight away to the fullback, who may have then played it to the winger.

Blinds definitely more cautious in his passing, but I think it's under instruction and also a result of his bringing through at Ajax. Again I think it's just a different approach that one being better than the other in terms of ability. Of course, you can prefer one approach to another.

The more Blind plays the more he seems to be trying those balls though. Not long ago he played that fantastic through ball to Wilson and the over the top assist to Van Persie.

3119~~~
He has been getting higher up the pitch more and more these last few games though and often goes for a cutting forward ball a lot more often than the other two. I think the main reason is he has no fear of being dropped as he's clearly one of LvG main guys, it's the same way that for quite a large part of this season Januzaj played with fear and restraint when he got the ball.

The thing I find odd is people saying he needs Wanyama or someone next to him, so basically play with two DM's, as this is not a Matic/Fabregas deal as Blind hasn't got anywhere like Fabregas's playmaking abilities. Blind is supposed be the DM we play to allow the creative players to function like Carrick did.

3120~~~
I never really thought he was slow, is that what everyone thinks?

All the comments from yesterday were about his lack of speed. I wonder if it's not just that in contract to Arsenal's midfielders yesterday he was slow.

3121~~~
I think he is carrying a knock. Maybe from the Newcastle game where he was struggling after a challlenge.
He's no Usain Bolt, but he is usually spritelier than he was last night.

3122~~~
He's really really slow.

3123~~~
I think people who mention Wanyama thinks that he should play in place of Blind, that's my personal opinion as well. We would be much more solid and that would allow Herrera to play more expansive game. I agree with the fear of players from being dropped. They are so afraid of making mistakes. Some are backed up by manager but some are benched immidietely unfortunately. Blind is mummy's darling but at least he can do the job unlike Persie. 

I think we should be aspiring higher when searching for the so much needed defensive midfielder in the summer.. It's gonna be problem whoever decides that Carrick and Blind is good enough to challenge for the title in the league or champions league, our weekest part in the team forever it seems..

3124~~~
I would like to see he and Mata in a race. Their lack of pace is such a hindrance in the English game.

3125~~~
Aiming higher than Wanyama should certainly be the goal, I mean if we switched him for Blind we'd create fresh problems, what we gained in speed and power we'd love in passing and technique. Wanyama is a good fit in 4-2-3-1 next to a more proficent passing CM, but in 4-3-3 you need a proper #6. If we buy from Southampton it should be Schneiderlin IMO, he is physically strong, athletic and a good passer.

3126~~~
We lost the initiative in that second half.

3127~~~
We really didn't. We looked a lot more solid and created an excellent chance right before Arsenal scored after some good play by Fellaini.

We lost control after Valencia's back pass when we bizarrely stopped playing and decided to lump the ball up to Fellaini at every opportunity. That had nothing to do with Carrick. We did exactly the same at Swansea as well when Herrera was in the team.

3128~~~
He's playing that left back role so intelligently at the moment, gives huge amounts away in pace but controlling it completely, along with young and fellaini we are dominating that left side.

3129~~~
So much for getting ripped apart for pace. Andros Townsend <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What were people thinking?

3130~~~
Yeah just for the record, he's played over 100 matches at left back. Probably the position he has played most in his career. In Champions league games, eredivisie games, also for Dutch national team, always a very solid option there.

3131~~~
He's been good so far.

3132~~~
To be fair he Townsend barely had the ball.

He's a good LB though with a good cross on him.

3133~~~
I think it's quite amazing how he can look so natural on fullback even though by his abilities you could never imagine him playing there. That's just showing how intelligent he is.

3134~~~
Must say I was worried about him at fullback.

But it turns out he is our best left back. His passing and crossing there is second to none. While Shaw has been good defensively he doesn't contribute as much in the final third.

3135~~~
Made townsend, dembele, chadli and eventually lamella invisible. Top performance from him today. Linked up ever so well with Young.

3136~~~
Brilliant performance. Excellent crossing and pinpoint accuracy with his passing. Looked excellent at left-back.

3137~~~
He's the best crosser at the club, we need to get him in those positions on the wing more often.

3138~~~
Two thumbs up. Really intelligent player and didn't give Townsend a yard of space. Love his overlapping run outside of Young.

3139~~~
I really think he is better option than Shaw at left back at the moment.

3140~~~
He offers a lot more going forward than what Shaw has done so far due to his crossing and passing accuracy.

3141~~~
Used the ball really well and linked up intelligently with Young.

3142~~~
Better than shaw imo 

Blind can cross better, tackle better and just had more positional awareness both in attsck and defence.

3143~~~
It'll be hard to leave Herrera and Carrick out so, maybe he should keep his place. 

Shaw,is so young I'm not worried about him yet. I'm confident he will come good

3144~~~
Such a intelligent player. Always looks to keep the ball and find a teammate, but also has enough about him to pick the right forward ball. Take Fellianis goal, it was made by Carrick but such a smart ball by Blind that found Carrick in space.

Hes been a little hit and miss in the middle of the park but as a LB/LWB i'd say hes been better than Shaw

3145~~~
He linked up well with Young and Fellaini down the left hand side. If he carries on that way then he'll keep Shaw out the team.

3146~~~
Spot on. You make intelligent players play together and the result is always nice.

3147~~~
Great performance. Looked more comfortable/alive than he has in weeks.

3148~~~
Worked tireless and was running up and down. Good performance and showed he can be a valuable option at LB

3149~~~
I still think that he is a 8, he is so good at organizing the offensive circulation and at delivering the last balls, he is clearly not a DM.

3150~~~
It's been said before but if Blind had more pace and power he'd make for a monstrous full back. His crossing, tackling, awareness and link up play is already at an extremely high level.

3151~~~
Which is why there's so often crossover between deep/defensive CMs and FBs these days. With FBs increasingly having to look a bit like old-fashioned wingers (Alaba and his ilk), the less athletic sorts often find a good home in DM, where they can use that tackling, awareness and link-up without needing to be fast, powerful runners.

3152~~~
Yet people say we can't play them both together.

3153~~~
Chadli skinned him a couple of times, didn't lead to anything however. I was very impressed with him, however, not sure I would want him at LB against the likes of Sterling/Coutinho.

3154~~~
Rather have Shaw against Pool. I think Liverpools pace and movement would expose Blind far more than the likes of Townshend, Dembele or Lamela could.

3155~~~
Still think he's our best signing of the summer.

3156~~~
You'll prob agree after next week....

3157~~~
Defended by being on the front foot today, he forced Townsend back all game and he didn't give him any rest. Chadli Faired a little better, but apart from mistiming 1 tackle which let Chadli skip pass him he did very, very well. If Shaw can get to his level of positioning and tackling, while having his pace he will be a monster. Think Blind will be a good option though against teams who want to sit deep against us at old trafford, as his crossing is very good.

3158~~~
I would still say that, in a midfield sense. Too much attacking impudence, physicality and mobility is lost when they are both played in the middle together, that's why Herrera is such a revelation when played with them, he compliments them entirely.

3159~~~
As Brightonian said, JPRouve, Blind is more suited to that defensive midfield, #6 role with his attributes. He demonstrated great positional awareness and a very good reading of the game from there. He also demonstrated a good passing range and was a threat when going forward with his great crosses.

However, we also saw Blind's weaknesses exposed whenever he tried to follow Spurs' right winger to the middle and try to play aggressively. He doesn't have the physical attributes of a ball winner, so why does he continuously try to play with such an aggression? In no way is he suited to play as aggressively as players like Fernandinho, Alaba, Coquelin, and such defensive midfielders and left backs. Watching the match and seeing him try to quickly close down players, I sometimes felt that he should watch more videos of Carrick, Zanetti, Maldini, Redondo, etc., and watch how they defended without such aggression and tenacity in their game. Blind really needs to cut out that aggression and tenacity from his game. Then, he'll become a world class defensive midfielder/left back.

3160~~~
None of what you said show that he should be a 6, I would even argue that you pointed out why he is a 8, positional awareness, very good reading of the game, good passing range, great stamina, constant threat going forwards.
And in mean time he lacks one great quality for a DM organizing the defense, he is not good at doing that.

3161~~~
Whilst I agree that he doesn't have that quality in him, he doesn't need that as a #6. With the aggression that he has, he's quite poor at winning the ball, and one of the biggest qualities of a #8 is the ability to win the ball, which Blind isn't good at. The fact that he's always at his best when reading the game, taking up good positions, and intercepting passes is why I say that he's at his best as a #6.

As a #8, he's a squad player for me purely because he's poor at winning the ball. As a #6, he should be a starter if he plays more like Carrick does rather than like Schneiderlin.

3162~~~
Tempting to say we don't have to sign an LB or DM this summer, let Blind get lots of games covering Shaw and Carrick at those spots and then replace Carrick with a big signing in 2016. Maybe Blind will improve and be worth starting, maybe not.

3163~~~
What are the qualities needed to be a #6, for you ? For me winning the ball and organizing the defense are the two most important.
A #8 is a all rounder, he is good at defending and attacking and he doesn't have to be your best ball winner, just has to be decent at it.

3164~~~
I agree with this.

Blind was very good against Spurs though. He is the best crosser at the club I would think. I was concerned about his playing their before the game but he proved me wrong.

3165~~~
think he is.

3166~~~
He was really good against Tottenham

3167~~~
For me, box-to-box midfielders are the main ball winners because they have the stamina and aggression to do so. Since they can cover lots of ground, I expect them to be able to win the ball quickly with their aggression and strength.

Holding midfielders, on the other hand, are great at plugging in the gaps, cutting off passes, slowing down opposition attacks, forcing them out of dangerous areas, and filling in for defenders who are out of position. Here, I don't expect them to mainly be a ball winner, though being able to win the ball with tenacity and aggression is a great quality to have.

What happens, more often than not, is that box-to-box midfielders who aren't great going forward are then shaped as ball-winning midfielders who don't really get involved going forward. Here, I refer to Wanyama, Fernando Reges, McCarthy, Bentaleb, Matic, Schneiderlin, de Jong, Flamini, etc, today and Lass, Gattuso, van Bommel, etc., back then. Some of these midfielders then develop a few skills that a holding midfielder should have, which goes very well with their stamina, aggression, and tackling.

Blind doesn't have the aggression and strength that most of these ball winners have. There was a reason why he wasn't seen as a great left back at Ajax but a great, promising defensive midfielder there. It's why most posters talk about his lack of pace in midfield and the fact that he's weaker than most holding players. It's why Chadli was also causing him to be easily dragged out of position when he went to the left side. You wouldn't see Carrick, Busquets, or Lahm play like that and perform well.

If I see Blind as a #8, then I wouldn't see him as a great #8 when compared to players like Strootman, Nainggolan, Fernandinho, Khedira, Matuidi, etc. He may be quite good at going forward with the ball, but he's not good at winning the ball like the players I mentioned. However, as a #6, if he plays with more control, he'd be up there with the best defensive midfielders in the world.

3168~~~
Agree with <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> Blind's not a DM. For him to become one, he'll have to change what is essentially a main part of his game i.e his aggressive nature, which seems rather pointless. He's a lot more suited to playing as a #6 where he can utilize his best attributes without having to worry too much about being caught out of put of position defensively.

3169~~~
Does it not depend on the players around him though? If they press with him then that's not a problem, after all that is what LVG wants the team to do? If those around him do not press when he does then he will be badly exploited.

3170~~~
He's so <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

However, if fit I would want Shaw to start at Anfield due to his pace and power.

3171~~~
Here is the thing Pogba, Xavi, Verrati, Rakitic or Modric are also #8, I see that you only have counted the physical ones. Wanyama, schneiderlin or Fernandinho, have played like pure Defensive midfielders.
And I believe that you are confusing the zone where the player plays and role that he plays, for us Blind plays more like Pirlo as a deep lying playmaker , I think that he could play #8 like Tigana did, because his best attributes are crucial in the last tier of the field, he is a better ball winner than Matuidi or Nainggolan(because he is great at anticipating and intercepting the ball) and he isn't a good organizer defensively.

3172~~~
If Blind isn't a #6 then he's not a midfielder. His defensive positioning, his ability to read the game when it is laid out in front of him and his knack for helping CBs like Smalling to play the ball out from the back and quickly get it moving forwards are his key strengths. Meanwhile his biggest weakness is that he's much too conservative in possession to be of much use further up the pitch. A #8 needs to be able to play aggressively and attempt higher-risk passes and runs once they get into the opposition's half, whereas Blind always errs on the side of maintaining possession and avoiding risk. He's a textbook deep-lying/defensive midfielder.

For me there's absolutely no question that in any but the very most difficult games (Chelsea, for example) it's got to be Carrick <i>or</i> Blind, with Herrera a necessity ahead of whichever plays so that the midfield has someone capable of taking risks and creating chances going forwards.

Obviously that doesn't mean Blind can't start along with Carrick, because as we saw yesterday he's a very valid option at LB, and brings that ability to step in and bolster Carrick's defensive efforts in the middle when necessary.

3173~~~
It's a tough one for me because I feel like I agree that Shaw might be the better option at left-back against Liverpool and we need to stick with Herrera and Carrick but at the same time Blind has to be in the team...

3174~~~
This guy is ridiculously intelligent with his movement and passing. I hope someone at the club makes a video tape of his performance vs Tottenham and send it so Shaw, because that was exactly how left back should operate attacking wise, his overlapping runs were excellent. That’s very important in modern football, fullbacks provide another option. Him and Young combined beautifully on the left.

I really hope Shaw develops this part of the game because he is our future left back, but Blind looks very good in that role, if not better.

3175~~~
I wouldn't worry, he's only 19 and he'll get there. Defensively he's already a star.

3176~~~
He's very good. Thought he was brilliant at left-back yesterday.

Personally I'd keep him there because I don't think him <i>and</i> Carrick should both be in the midfield.

3177~~~
He is conservative because of the role he has to play, not because of his ability or mentality during the World cup he was one of the players who created the most opportunities.

I don't know how to post it but: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/daley_blind/126/126/7674/0/p|serie_a/2014/2015/radja_nainggolan/137/137/2500/124/p|ligue_1/2014/2015/blaise_matuidi/118/118/112/0/p#defence_score/tackles_won/tackles_lost/interceptions/key_passes/chances_created/assists#avg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...ptions/key_passes/chances_created/assists#avg</a>

Despite a limited role, he is offensively in the same bracket than players who played #8 all season long while being better defensively.

3178~~~
He created those opportunities as a full-back, not a midfielder. Whole different kettle of fish - he was creating those chances with crosses, which has nothing to do with how he would perform as a #8. We've seen this season that he plays the same conservative possession game no matter how high up the pitch he gets as a midfielder. As perfect as it is in the deep positions, it becomes a problem when he advances, and has caused our much-reported issue with having too much possession and not enough penetration.

As I said, I have no problem with him as a fullback, it obviously works. But <i>as a central midfielder</i>, he can only be a #6. He doesn't have the sort of aggressive, creative passing in his locker that you need in that more all-round role. Him and Carrick together offer too many of the same things and not enough of the creativity, risk-taking and directness that you need from someone like Herrera.

I'm not sure what that stat page is meant to show...? That he's made more interceptions this season than Matuidi and Nainggolan? Surely that just confirms his suitability for the more defensive, deep-lying role.

3179~~~
Hate to say it but that performance was miles better than anything we've seen from Shaw and (especially) Rojo at LB this season. A pity he's not the quickest or he should play there every week. Hopefully Shaw is watching and learning.

3180~~~
He's not as quick as Shaw but he's not crazily slow.

3181~~~
I'm sure he is. He's only 19 after all, so it's to be expected that he still has a lot of watching and learning to do.

3182~~~
He's painfully slow to be a LB full-time. He would have made an excellent LB if he had more pace tthough, he has a mean cross on him.

3183~~~
dare i say- hes the best left back we have at the club.

3184~~~
absolutely, you're 100% spot on.

3185~~~
He is. He's a good footballer with a great footballing brain but he lacks atleticism.

3186~~~
Yeah, agreed. His lack of pace gets over-stated. It's just that LB is a position where he'll often find himself in a lot of footraces with very quick players. And he won't win many of them.

3187~~~

3188~~~
He's played LB in the CL for years and didnt get overly exposed on pace, some really exaggerate how slow he is.

3189~~~
The more I see of him in midfield the less convinced I am of him there. Gives away the ball too easily for someone who always looks for a safe pass, and positionally he isn't good enough. He struggles against any half decent opponent. I think he can play there as the third man in a three, similar to how we used Fletcher...but even then his passing is very limited compared to someone like Fletcher.

I don't mind him so much as a fullback though. He actually looks like he has a clue what he's doing there. He isn't that fast but he does have the stamina for it...and he's generally quick enough to be where he needs to be. Unless the opposition have someone absaolutely lightning quick on that side I don't think it's a problem.

3190~~~
As Gary Neville pointed out during the game, he was exposed a few times by Sprs but Phil Jones bailed him out. Shaw is the better defender but Inferior going forward. The pass that Blind made to Carrick was one that I don't think you would see from Shaw. I think that Shaw should play against Liverpool considering the pace that they have as Blind could really struggle.

3191~~~
His pace is pretty weak but he makes up with his stamina. I don't think he failed to overlap for Young once.

3192~~~
They dont exaggerate they just repeat blindly what they see other people posting , just whatever common generalization is most common at the time.And about his crossing we seen during the world cup, he gave some brilliant crosses from LB

3193~~~
You mention Tigana, but Tigana was world class going forward. Blind is nowhere near at that level, and he's too conservative to play a box-to-box role as Brightonian mentioned. Even Lahm struggled when he played as a box-to-box midfielder for Germany in the first couple of matches in the World Cup! Doing well on the attack as a full back is different from doing well on the attack as a box-to-box midfielder.

I was mainly focusing on his aggression and tenacity because he's mainly a defensive player given that he started off as a central defender in his younger years. Compare that to Pogba, Xavi, and the other attacking #8's you mentioned above who didn't start off as more defensive players in their younger years.

You talk about great anticipation and interceptions, but that's what holding midfielders mainly do, not box-to-box midfielders. Box-to-box midfielders are more reliant on their aggression and ball-winning ability than anticipation, reading of the game, and interceptions (not saying they are pure brutes off the ball, but their main attributes are their stamina, aggression, and strength). That's what Nainngolan and Matuidi do and what players like Vieira and Keane did. I see Blind being closer to Hargreaves than Schweinsteiger in terms of their skill sets.

3194~~~
It's not just the stamina, though. Blind shows excellent anticipation and reading of the game, attributes that were only seen in more classical full backs like Maldini, Zanetti, and Irwin, and less in today's full backs like Alba, Clichy, and Gibbs.

This is why I feel like he can become a world class holding midfielder/left back if he just cuts out his annoying need to be uncontrollably aggressive.

3195~~~
Whatever pidgeon hole you guys want to pit him in, he's definitely got a place in this team, I've little doubt he's one of the first names on the team sheet.

3196~~~
Blind played as a CDM in his youth before he moved to fullback (he even had a short spell at rightback). He played leftback up untill last year when he was moved back to CDM, which is his best position.

He isn't athletic but he makes up for this with defensive intelligence and being tidy and neat in possesion. He isn't spectacular in any role, but he can do whatever the manager asks of him. Because of his skillset and being a real team player he can fill in for CDM, LB, LWB and out of him or Carrick he's more suitable for BTB. CDM and LWB/LB are his best positions though.

We won't see him at BTB next year because he isn't one, but because we haven't got a BTB this season he's competing with Herrera for this spot. LvG confirmed he brought him in to be our CDM, but LvG also likes multifunctional players. This gives him the option to tinker around and Blind always plays a 6/10 where he plays. He knows how LvG likes to play so he's vital in this transition season and can do a job where he's needed, even as a BTB player.

Blind also isn't this aggressive tackler you keep mentioning, he's never had this in his playstyle. He also will not get dropped as LvG has confirmed he's fixed in his starting lineup.

3197~~~
Blinds lack of athletic ability is what holds him back. Spend the summer in the gym working on his strength and pace.

3198~~~
He's a fantastic player to have in the squad, but he is never the solution to the lingering Carrick replacement problem. 

His passing is a level below...still good but just not the sat nav level.

But he covers a few positions, he has popped up with vital contributions and other than a few recent games, has been a solid 7/10 most of the time he's played. Looked good at LB overlapping Young.

3199~~~
Yep, without a doubt. He's going to be one of those rare players whose versatility works for them, not against. That's because of his dependability - I'm not sure he's dropped below a 7/10 once this season, despite all our ups and downs. And he doesn't just play various positions, he really understands how the game works and what LVG needs of him in each match.

A player who can fill three different positions in three consecutive games and still maintain a high standard will always get into the XI one way or another.

3200~~~
I'd be happy to trust his intelligence at left-back against Liverpool... plus with Young in front of him I reckon he'll do just fine.

3201~~~
lol

3202~~~
Was class yesterday. It's something we've lacked since evra left, but actual composure and ability going forward on the ball from left back. Shaw isn't close to him on the ball with his passing, delivery and timing of runs. Pace obviously holds him back, not that he's really slow, he's just not fast. No idea what I'd prefer against liverpool though. Shaw is capable of being a top player, but is way more inconsistent on the ball and picking out the right option. Would probably keep blind at left back so he plays and to keep Carrick and herrera together in midfield.

3203~~~
Yep, him and mata both would be absolutely brilliant if they had more pace/strength. Just with mata he'd be one of the best in the world imo, while Blind would just be an excellent all around player... Still a very good one mind you, just not a key player at United level. More of a first team player, always around the starting lineup without being the very best we have in his position.

3204~~~
I don't care where he plays, as long as he plays. Such an intelligent player who makes us more composed as a team.

3205~~~
That's what I've been pointing out to JPRouve as the reason why he won't ever be a top-level box-to-box midfielder. He can't play like an aggressive tackler as that's not in his skill set, but there are always several moments each match where he tries to play like this, and he's been doing this for much of the second half of the season. I remember how, when Chadli moved over to the left in the first half, he was trying to push up on Chadli like he did on Townsend without even flustering Chadli. Thankfully, Jones did a very good job of mopping up the passes played through the left before Blind adjusted his game and became less aggressive during the second half.

Other than that, I'm glad to see you provide more info on Blind's beginnings. The fact that he played in several roles did contribute to his intelligent view of the game. It reminds me of how the Dutch players of the past were so comfortable in various positions. Still, didn't he have stints as a central defender other than under van Gaal at the World Cup last summer? I'm sure others mentioned this in this forum...

As you said, he'd be a 6-7/10 player just about everywhere, but for me, I'd rather see him bring in 8-9/10 performances as a holding midfielder rather than 6-7/10 performances as a box-to-box midfielder (however, I wouldn't mind seeing him at left back more often; holding midfielders like him are normally great at full back roles).

3206~~~
Ah sorry I missed that! 

I forgot to include LCB to that list yes, although he hasn't played there much. The only time I remember him playing there was this season because of injury. My guess is that we'll see him as a LB/LWB and CDM only next season because he's genuienly good there. For this season he can do a job at BTB though (if LvG wants this), although like you've mentioned he's not great at it. But since Fellaini, Rooney and Mata all failed to claim this role we're now stuck with only Herrera there.

I think the reason he's been a bit more aggressive is because it's instructed. I don't think he's changed his playstyle by himself but was asked to do this by van Gaal as part of the gameplan. I find it a bit odd aswell but I think it's part of the pressing game we now play.

3207~~~
I get that feeling as well. I think van Gaal wants Blind to press the opposition so that we can win the ball and quickly release it forward. Still, though, he often presses at the wrong time and opens up spaces for the opposition to exploit. If he wants to continue playing like this, he'll have to time his presses better and learn when to press and when not to press, just like how Herrera's started pressing. Then, I wouldn't mind him pressing the ball holder.

3208~~~
Got to start for me. He's reads the game beautifully and if we ever need an 8/10 performance, it's against this  next lot at Anfield. Although I really rate Shaw he's out of form and doesn't even look match fit. So, Blind to start at LB and Carrick and Hererra in midfield. Maybe the only change I'd make is Di Maria for Mata due to his pace on the counter attack.

3209~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.gyazo.com/f2c1c77d3856911207fabcbbe7ee53cd.png" src="http://i.gyazo.com/f2c1c77d3856911207fabcbbe7ee53cd.png"/>

3210~~~
He's a calming influence wherever he plays, and in what can be a manic back 4 its a good choice.

Although I do think at LB he will come up against challenges due to lack of pace. So he'll either need to be right on his game, or he may get done a few times, which isnt ideal.

Although for me Carrick in CM has a bit more to his game. Carrick and Blind could work against the teams with better midfields but personally for me Herrera needs to keep his place also.

3211~~~
Mark my words. He will get the winner at Anfield.

3212~~~
How do we do that in the Caf?

3213~~~
Blind, Blind, wherever you may be, you smoke weed in your own country, could be worse, could be Scouse, smoking crack in their council house. 

Heard this today, had me in stitches.

3214~~~

3215~~~
Solid from Blind, very hard game for a player with very little pace to play LB in, but he read things well as usual and did very well to win the penalty, he was exposed a bit by Carrick's mistake for the goal as he didn't have the acceleration to close Sturridge down.

3216~~~
Played well today, some thought he would have a meltdown against Sterling, he kept him quiet. His versatility is fantastic, no matter where you play him, he gets you 7/8 out of 10 performances.

3217~~~
He plays with great intensity! Love him.

3218~~~
Did okay. A bit questionable defensively I thought. Does well going forward, but I'd much prefer Shaw at LB.

3219~~~
I thought he gave Can a lot of problems from LB going forward. He got skinned once or twice by Sterling but offered a lot forward.

3220~~~
I thought he was a bit careless with his passing given his quality on the ball. Did reasonably well defensively, though not sure what he was doing on their goal. Won lots of tackles; that's a good sign. You'd expect Sterling to hurt us more so a decent job from Blind.

3221~~~
Wasnt his best game today but i cant fault him,he gave his best at that position which does not suit him 100%,cant ask more then that.

3222~~~
Not his best performance but he was very solid and proved to be a good outlet down the left hand side.

3223~~~
He was okay. Best moment was making an arse out of Can <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3224~~~
When at fullback he reminds me of a leftsided version of Gary Neville.

Defensively discipline, composed, great deliveries, clever interceptions, not the fastest but intelligent enough to not get in a rat race.

3225~~~
Defensively, not his best performance, but I'm putting that purely down to pace. He just doesn't have it, and he was up against players who have it in spades. He still rarely got done over by it, so no harm. From an attacking perspective, he looked really good. The time when he rinsed Can, and Can just fell sideways, was brilliant. He did well to win the penalty. Looked like he purposely slowed the play down and anticipated the shove in the back. It was a bit of a risk, but he executed it well if that's what he was trying to do. Blind ripped Can apart.

3226~~~
Very intelligent player,makes you realise football is not all about pace.

3227~~~
Did he even had one truly bad performance this season ? His consistency makes him already most trusted player among such names like Di Maria, Mata, Herrera, RVP, Rooney...

Right now probably only agent De Gea has that kind of stable form.

3228~~~
Was poor for the goal and also was the reason for Jones yellow. Maybe I was watching something else but, I found myself yelling at  him (at the TV) a few times today. Still, he did well especially since he was up against the likes of Sterling out there.

3229~~~
Was solid. Unspectacular, but kept Sterling most quiet (well him and Brendan playing him at fullback...). I still prefer him has a DM but Carrick deserves to be playing in that role.

I imagine next season we may see more of Blind in DM and Shaw at LB

3230~~~
Thought he was a bit meh today, but a decent game I suppose. I like him though.

3231~~~
Good game from Blind today considering who he was up against. Needs to spend the summer increasing his speed and strength, then we really would have a player on our hands.

3232~~~
Thought exactly that. Terrific at keeping the ball ticking over accurately.
Not sure him and Carrick as a pair in centre mid is going to work too often, but instead of Carrick or left lack, very much so.

3233~~~
Wasn't really great defensively. And he suffered a bit when Young went off.

3234~~~
I liked how he played against Spurs, but today he was a bit mediocre in my opinion.

3235~~~
Thought he was easily our worst player today. Poor final ball, caught out for the goal we conceded, caused Jones' booking and generally didn't seem composed on the ball like he usually is.

3236~~~

3237~~~
overall he was good, great reading of the game and spirit.. but this unfortunately didn't make up for his lack of pace or strength. The sooner Shaw kicks on the better, we need different kind of player there. I am glad to start Blind over Rojo there though..

3238~~~
His midfield performances have been overrated quite a bit but I thought he was superb in the first half today. Not often a left-back has such an effect on the passing play.

My first-choice LB at the moment.

3239~~~
It was different to Spurs as we were away to Liverpool. His pressing helped that Sterling had a rather quiet game

3240~~~
I thought he did well, much like Evra supporting the front and then this.

3241~~~
Better at left back than centre mid thats for sure and he is not bad at either to be fair. Great squad player to have and we have missed this for a while now. Just short of top class.

3242~~~
Been phenomenal as a left back last 2 games. He's a number of notches below the superb Carrick in centre-midfield.

3243~~~
That was pure class.

3244~~~
Couldnt disagree more, he was half asleep today, extremely sloppy on the ball and has had far more impact in CM on most occasions this season than Carrick had today.

74% pass accuracy from fullback wasnt very helpful

3245~~~
Completely took out Liverpool's and Spurs right side out of the game.

3246~~~
Aside from letting Sterling run in behind him in the first 10 mins?

3247~~~
No, no, no I don't know why but him in midfield just doesn't work for me, if he plays it has to be LB.

3248~~~
I disagree with most it seems. Thought he was really good.

3249~~~
If that's all you could come up with in 90 Minutes I have proved my point.

3250~~~
Thought he was far from poor today, good outlet, won a penalty

3251~~~
Thought he was good.

Can is probably still rolling down Stanley Park like a piece of tumbleweed.

3252~~~
I thought that he was below average today. I don't think that he is that great a player full stop. Hope not to see him back in midfield this season. I much prefer Carrick and Hererra.

3253~~~
Sterling got in during the first 5 mins, Henderson was behind him to pass across to Sturridge for the Lellana chance

He also got caught dawdling on the ball on 55 mins then Jones went in and got himself booked to stop the attack

Then there's the goal where he puts weak pressure on Sturridge and trips over, then Sturridge gets the ball freely and scores

In general he was okay defensively, he made some tackles but he also made mistakes on each of those occasions and they had far more success down that flank than down our other side so its a strange comment to say he took Liverpool's flank out. And on the ball he wasnt very good at finding a teammate

3254~~~
Lost his position in midfield, and I'm not convinced he's much better than Shaw. More composed and better on the ball, but his lack of pace is a worry. He's fine as back up to Carrick/Herrera.

3255~~~
He's not better defensively than Shaw but he's certainly better going forward. He's definitely a better option than Rojo on the left as well.

3256~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Emre Can

3257~~~
emre can't

3258~~~
I thought Blind started poorly but got better as the game went on. Overall it was a pretty solid performance I guess.

3259~~~
He has the potential to be like Denis Irwin. Not much pace but can be solid at both ends and always calm and rarely give the ball away. 

Just now sure if he can keep this position once Shaw is available, though. Even Young may be ahead of him at LB/LWB.

3260~~~
He lacks pace but he compensates by having a footballing brain.  He and Young work well together but i still see him as the potential long term replacement for Carrick.

3261~~~
Me too thought he did pretty well over all

3262~~~
Me too. I think he rarely has an off game in general. 

Though there was a couple of times today where he hesitated making the easy pass and it resulted in some turnovers. Other than that I thought he had a pretty solid game.

3263~~~
It wasn't his best game but honestly it's our toughest fixture every season. He did really well all things considered. What he lacks in pure athleticism he more than makes up for in tenacity and footballing acumen. One thing that had been lacking in previous matches is attacking threats from out fullbacks. He provides that and it aids us a great deal. His working with Young is a good pairing.

3264~~~
What was he doing for their goal ?

Came running in centrally and just collided with Sturridge's back and stumbled over leaving all space in behind.

3265~~~
He was decent. Had some good moments and worked hard but also some poor one's, for example letting Sterling run behind him and loosing the ball toward the end of the game

3266~~~
Carrick admitted in the interview after the game that the goal was his fault as he lost the ball to the two Liverpool players and Coutinho took the ball forward then passed to Sturridge who scored. Blind had come in to assist with the defence and Sturridge had moved across him and Blind bumped into him and prevented it from being a foul. Not much he could have done about the goal and it certainly wasn't his fault. 

The question should be why did Jones allow Sturridge all that space for the goal.

3267~~~
He had an ok game, I would go with a 6.5/10. He had some good moments going forward but didn't look 100% defensively. Still though, considering Sterlings pace, I thought he would have given Blind more problems than he did.

3268~~~
If Blind came central then he needs to track Sturridge's run or just stop him by fouling. Jones was in correct position but Blind coming in and then tumbling over left Sturridge free. 

There's no way he should be letting Sturridge go across him into free space in his position after coming central. Even if Blind stays on his feet he cuts off that ball to Sturridge or the pass has to be finer and nearer to Jones.

3269~~~
He was caught out of position for the goal because Carrick gave the ball away unexpectedly. Can hardly blame him for that because he will have been looking to attack and support the left side.

I thought he was very good yesterday and a very solid left back in general. He defends the space very well and his distribution is always good. Can't understand the criticism.

3270~~~
Not really. Jones was initially marking Sturridge. There's no reason why Blind should start marking him and he clearly came back to assist when Sturridge ran across him. Not much he could do.

Only thing he might have done was to fall back into line to make a back four but I can't fault him.

3271~~~
Shaw needs to replace him at LB for the next match.

He had a good game against Spurs, but looked too slow and sloppy yesterday.

Give Shaw a run of game in the hope he doesn't injure himself.

3272~~~
Problem is Shaw doesn't seem to interact as good as Blind does with say Ashley. The little one two's and the darting forward. He seems more efficient than Shaw, a better footballing head I would say. Shaw is still young though and he should get better. Attacking wise Blind is much better. Defensive wise, Shaw is better. I prefer an attacking LB ala Evra.

3273~~~
So, so intelligent. Shaw should learn from him, watch his runs forward, when to make them and how to overlap.

3274~~~
Me neither. Thought he had  a good game, up against one of the best wingers in the league.

He's such a clever footballer. Neat and tidy and always picks the best pass. Deserves to keep playing at LB and no harm giving Shaw some time out of the spotlight.

3275~~~
Didn't want to see him in center midfield after the Arsenal game, so now if we sign some CBs in the summer, we will have 3 LBs next year - Shaw, Blind and Rojo?

With Blind arguably being the best suited for us...

3276~~~
It was definitely partly his fault because he took himself out of the game with the stumble over Sturridge. If he just stayed with him instead of making contact then he wouldnt have been free to shoot

3277~~~
Shoot me but I feel more save with Blind than Shaw as LB. And also our passing, thus general play, is improved with Blind's playmaking and positioning.

3278~~~
I agree entirely, I imagine a lot of people do.

3279~~~
I love this... the skill involved to opposition player reaction is so out of balance... it's perfect <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3280~~~
I think i'm one of the few that still prefers Blind in midfield to Carrick I think.

3281~~~
Love that gif. Blind looks stumped that he's still ended up with the ball and Can has fallen on his face 5 yards away.

3282~~~
Bang. 

I feel that Shaw is definitely better than Blind at LB. Blind may be a bit better going forward, but Shaw is better defensively.

That said, I adore wee Daley too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3283~~~
He's a major part of our midfield and defense coping against the press by passing the ball out of trouble. I doubt Shaw would get a lot of game time until he proves reliable in that aspect.

3284~~~
I'm not sure. Blind is arguably more comfortable on the ball (very close though), and potentially better for closing a game out since he can be a very composed passer, but I think Carrick's arguably better for forward passing and picking out good balls.

3285~~~
yes, Shaw is definitely better defensively. And it would be great to have more 'Brits' on the first XI. But for now, Blind experience and ability are needed to make the 'system/philosophy' work. I see LB as Blind's temporary spot, anyway. He's better in CM's role.

3286~~~
Aye, definitely agree about that.

3287~~~
And I lost the chance to make a pun about Blind spot.

3288~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3289~~~
Am I the only one that reads his name as Blind, rather then Blinde as it should be pronounced?

3290~~~
Spoke a few words with his father Danny Blind yesterday at the Ajax game, a very proud father.

3291~~~
So people blame him instead of Carrick for the goal, beautiful agenda.

3292~~~
Both.

Carrick lost the ball, we had a chance to defend and that chance went away when Blind fell over

3293~~~
Is that a mistake? Rather unlucky. (How did he fall).

3294~~~
Carrick lost the ball on the half way line. We still had plenty of time/chance to defend properly. I also thought Jones positioning for it wasn't great either.

3295~~~
He ran into him, didnt need to

3296~~~
He didn't run into him, Sturridge ran into him. Jones should have covered Sturridge though, slow reaction from Jones. De Gea should have saved though. He has saved much more difficult shots.

3297~~~
Carrick is very much the darling of RedCafe, if the blame can be shifted then it will.

3298~~~
Goal was obvious Carrick's mistake, no other way around it.

As for Blind, at the moment I'd play him over Shaw at LB. I was worried that he'd struggle pace wise but Jesus, if he didn't struggle against dippers defensively then I see no reason in dropping him. Shaw is getting injured more often than not and has some 'fitness struggles' (whatever that means), Blind played two very important games at LB and has done very well. He makes up for his lack of pace with his great positioning awareness and anticipation, not to mention that he's put in 6 or 7 tackles last game and had 0 fouls iirc. 

Since we've got fit Carrick for the CDM then we're free to use Blind at LB, personally I don't think I'd change anything in the formation we're playing at the moment, guys took their chances right and deserve to play.

3299~~~
Yeah he probably won’t face team as fast as Liverpool (Arsenal maybe), so I would be happy to see him at LB (considering Carrick, Herrera and Fellaini are doing very well in midfield). Him and Young were a good combination and I hope we stick to it, because when Di Maria came there was no connection between him and Blind. Di Maria seems to have no patience and he loses the ball a lot, what means Blind will be exposed a lot. Young on the other hand isn’t that impressive individually but he keeps the ball moving and links better with his teammates.

IMO we should continue with Blind-Young for now, but Di Maria-Shaw is the future.

3300~~~
Aye, a fair assessment.

3301~~~
I would also prefer Blind to Shaw. Blind currently is better on that position.

3302~~~
Yup, and the moments when he didn't look 100% assured defensively were when he pushed up and was aggressive at the ball holder. That one chance that Lallana had in the first half was due to Blind pushing quite high up the pitch, leaving Henderson free up ahead. He does show great intelligence and positioning, but he's poor at timing his aggressive approach to the ball holder. It even happened against Spurs, but Jones was excellent in covering for him like he was once again against Liverpool.

Even so, I can see that, if Blind cuts out that unnecessary aggression from his game, he can definitely become a world class defensive player. His intelligence, positioning, and reading of the game is potentially top class, and if he just controls his aggression more, he can become an even more reliable player.

3303~~~
I have it on very good authority that Blind was headed to Barca after the WC last season, but changed his mind due to LvG.

3304~~~
Going forward he would be great as cover for the main DM (Carrick/successor), a solid partner to the DM when we're playing a negative lineup, an awesome LB vs lesser opponents, especially against narrow teams, and a decent backup LB. Could probably ask him to do a defensive job from the left side of a diamond, and a Park-style man-marking job on the wing/centre. 
And last ditch CB cover if we revert to 352.
If he develops Carrick-style long passing, he would be indispensable.

3305~~~
Did Blind play in Netherlands draw last week? 

If he did play, what position did he play?

3306~~~
He played left back.

3307~~~
Nothing seems to phase Blind, which I like. Reminds me of some of Utd players of the past. Just that inner belief that you will win, or at least perform well overall. You need people like that around. And he seems to have a knack of affecting games at some point wherever he plays.

3308~~~
*Faze? 

Back on point, he's a gem of a player. So like Carrick in that he isn't a flashy player who relies on anticipation and movement and yet so different because of his versatility and advantage in mobility.

3309~~~
Re the goal, my take was that Blind reacts to the loss of possession and identifies Sturridge as the threat. He rapidly closes on the danger. With other defenders reasonably positioned and further back he tries to position himself to deny Sturridge the ball and block the possible pass, allowing his team-mate to follow the run. Unfortunately he makes contact and falls. Slightly startled team-mate is not quite tight enough.

Given strikers can often make space to shoot with a man on them it seems to me the attempt to block the pass was right. Such a shame about the tumble.

3310~~~

3311~~~
The Dutch do like their different type of captains, no? First captain, second captain, third captain, and now captain of midfield!

Anyway glad to read Blind did well against Spain.

3312~~~
To be fair, Blind has got leadership qualities. He was a captain at Ajax too. He might become the new Dutch captain when RvP/Sneijder eventually become too old and get replaced.

3313~~~
Nice to hear that he is getting praised like that.

3314~~~
I thought he played as LB?

3315~~~
He played as the holding midfielder vs Spain and did very well.

3316~~~
Thanks. Was confused with last week game then.

3317~~~
Yes, would have expected him to get the armband after Sneijder was taken off over De Vrij.

3318~~~
Blind's substitution was planned, else he would've got it. Hiddink said this.

3319~~~
Give us this day, our Daley Blind!

3320~~~
Ah, missed that little sidenote. Fair play.

3321~~~
And forgive us our back passes.

3322~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3323~~~
Physically, Blind reminds me of Darren Fletcher before he bulked up around 2008. I could see him having a similar sudden improvement  if he hit the gym harder.

3324~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xat1/v/t1.0-9/11130228_917132624975291_5554711992428381103_n.jpg?oh=b5d5456f9063f1e5d398cc02fd5b696b&amp;oe=55A5A926&amp;__gda__=1438317561_71a56097db5baad4a5dab8cc0f5aeaa2" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xat1/v/t1.0-9/11130228_917132624975291_5554711992428381103_n.jpg?oh=b5d5456f9063f1e5d398cc02fd5b696b&amp;oe=55A5A926&amp;__gda__=1438317561_71a56097db5baad4a5dab8cc0f5aeaa2"/>

3325~~~
Fletcher was always quicker and a better runner.

3326~~~
He doesn't remind me of Darren Fletcher physically at all and I don't remember Fletcher every significantly bulking up either. He was always tall, slim, wiry and used to run about like a mad man chasing down everything and hassling the opposition until we won the ball back and he was very good at it for a couple of years before his illness. Blind is very different, he has an average build, he is shorter, weaker, slower, but a better passer, he doesn't chase down the ball or tackle like fletcher did. He is more of a sitting passing DM rather than a destroyer like a Roy Keane or Fletcher was.

3327~~~
He's not bad at all as a LB.

3328~~~
Brilliant LB imo, so composed..He's like the less physical Alaba.

3329~~~
He's very good at LB too! What a buy!

3330~~~
He will probably be our first choice right back in the last games this season. Great, great buy.

3331~~~
I'm liking him a lot at LB. Really uses his brain in the final third rather than just crossing all the time.

3332~~~
98% passing accuracy so far.

3333~~~
Really good because he helps a lot the midfield, the squad in general.
He covers many roles during the game, thumbs up.

3334~~~
Amazing how Blind doesn't get the recognition that he should. Played brilliantly today, my MotM just ahead of Herrera.

3335~~~
Superb performance. His quality in the final third really stands out compared to Shaw and Rojo. Could be a good option for games in which we dominate possession. Long term I still think he should be our holding midfielder.

3336~~~
I'm really warming up to him in the LB position. Shaw's going to have to fight pretty hard to displace him now.

3337~~~
He's majestic. Him being a CDM playing at LB (or the other way around?) makes him incredibly useful, when he's sometimes caught off guard up the field, he knows how to position himself, when to press alongside his mates and so on to recover the back, easily our best buy of the summer, love the guy.

At the moment he should be our starting LB imo.

3338~~~
His movement and reading of the game is class and his calmness in the final 3rd is a breath of fresh air, he was runner up for MOTM for me.

3339~~~
He's just such an intelligent player. With brilliant technique as well.

3340~~~
Wonderful assist for the first goal showing the benefit of getting your head up and picking a pass rather than just tossing it into the box and hoping for the best. Love him.

3341~~~
Great signing. 10-12 million for a player as intelligent and technically good as him is a complete no brainer.

3342~~~
I love the way he plays LB. Its a style I've noticed with the likes of Lahm and Alaba at times too. Play very much like a CM but just at LB, so smart on the ball.

3343~~~
Just superb.  I still think Shaw is the better defender overall but Blind offers SO much going forward.

3344~~~
Daley Blind's game by numbers: 
100% tackles won 
100% aerial duels won 
96% pass accuracy 
3 chances created 
1 assist

3345~~~
Bargain of the season.

3346~~~
This is the tipping point.

Shaw maybe slightly better defensively but he offers absolutely zero threat going forward.

Evra was for many years integral to the way we attacked and Blind can be too.

3347~~~
Blind is just fantastic. A below the radar steal in the Vidic/Evra mould.

3348~~~
He is quality!

Just gets the effin job done...love the guy

3349~~~
Been impressed with him all season, really believe he's a great signing and I'm glad he's ours.

3350~~~
He has such magnificent hair

...oh and he's a pretty good footballer too <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3351~~~
I remember when Newcastle and Sunderland picked up Cabaye and Schneiderlin for peanuts when our midfield was a shambles. I couldn't believe why we wouldn't be in for more unknown players like that, who were obviously good enough to strengthen our squad.

With Blind it feels like we've finally gotten our unknown/un-rated* bargain signing who also adds a lot to the team. Fantastic buy. Shows you don't need to spend Di Maria money to improve.

*Even off the back of a brilliant World Cup, I remember a lot of people saying Blind wasn't a PL-calibre player when we signed him.

3352~~~
I'd keep him at LB the rest of the season for sure. Much better all round package than we've seen from Shaw so far, and it looks like he can stay fit.

3353~~~
Yeah, a fair amount of people thought it was a pointless signing and didn't think he was good enough for us. After his performances in the World Cup is was clear to me that he'd be a useful player for us and make an impact. Arguably the best buy from the summer.

3354~~~
Must be the 3rd name on the team sheet after DDG and Herrera. He almost never ever wastes a ball and his decision making is top class as well.
Oh and it will be between him and Herrera as our future captain <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3355~~~
There was one time he lost the ball fairly high up the pitch and then was one of the least bothered players on the field to get back to defend the Villa counter-attack. That annoyed me. Otherwise another good game by him.

3356~~~
And to think when he signed some here were calling him another Cleverley!

I'm torn between where i would like him to play and where he should. His games as a LB have been amazing for us, very good footballing brain and reads the game so well. But i really liked him as a DMF because i think he could be a good replacement for Carrick, and would develop into that role. Decisions decisions decisions....

Herreras been great for us the past few months but for me Blind has to be our signing of the season given how hes played virtually every minute of it.

3357~~~
He was injured just before Christmas but yeah I agree, he is certainly my man of the season so far.

3358~~~
Far better at LB than he is at DM. Had a another pretty good game today.

3359~~~
Very good today. When Carrick plays, I prefer Blind at left back over midfield.

3360~~~
Doing a great job on the left.

3361~~~
Blind is one of the most intelligent footballers I've seen in a long time. He's not quick or physical but looks very accomplished in both LB or DM due to his awareness/technical ability and general footballing IQ. One aspect of his game which I've noticed and really stands out to me is how often he wins the 2nd ball. I've lost count of how many times we have the opposition under pressure they clear it and he's always in the right areas and winning the ball back then launching another attack. He rarely makes big mistakes and commits fouls to let the opposition out easyily, he just presses intelligently/nicks the ball and uses it well. Very similar to Busquets at Barca.

Complete bargain at £12m he's worth at least double.

3362~~~
Just a shame he isn't physically better, because if he was hed be one of the best full backs around.

3363~~~
Completely agree. 5 years from now he will be considered the gem, much like the likes of Evra and Vidic have been for us.

3364~~~
Not even his nominal role. What adaptation skills... Too easy on the eye. Way too feckin easy.

Shaw, learn from this man. Seriously.

3365~~~
I am old school so this is off the charts for me.  The best thing I like about Blind is that I feel so secure.  Serious question, for the last 3 EPL games what opportunities has Spurs, Pool, or Villa gotten down his flank?

Get in mate, well done.

3366~~~
I remember one against Spurs vaguely. And I think Sterling got past him early on against Liverpool. Apart from that though I can't think of many.

3367~~~
I listed a bunch in here after the Pool game. No problems yesterday

3368~~~
Fair enough... I am sure it happened.  

We just feel so much more stable in the back when he plays and then look at all he adds offensively... at least that's the way i see it.

3369~~~
He got done a few times against Spurs too and Jones bailed him out. Hard to really judge the defenders on yesterday's outing as Villa didn't put up much of a fight. It would have been a travesty if they had taken anything from it.

3370~~~
Haven't found individual highlights for him against Aston Villa but found this against Everton.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFgB4dvXoSI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3371~~~
His lack of pace is probably his only weakness, but he has managed to hold his own so far against quick wingers..

3372~~~
You do get the feeling that Shaw was a waste of £30m with this guy in the side. 

Money aside though competition can't be bad so all good.

A fan too

3374~~~

3375~~~
So pleased we signed him - he's very composed and one of those players that somehow helps those around him play better.

3376~~~
Has to stay in the startling eleven, be it at LB or in CM. We talk about purchasing a replacement for Carrick, but I'm sure this guy is it anyway.

I have no idea what to do with Shaw though. It's a good thing he's injured at the moment, but when he comes back - he may be relegated to the bench for a few games. Blind is just too good.

If only it was possible to have two left backs rather than one right back and one left back <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3377~~~
Just goes to show what an intelligent player he is.

3378~~~
I remember when we signed Blind, LVG explained that he knows when to press and when not to. 

I also remember a post or two on here criticizing him for some of his pressing. Turns out he knows what he's doing

3379~~~
Yep and that's one thing Herrera did not per LvG which was LvG's main problem with Herrera during the earlier part of the season.

3380~~~
Very impressive.

3381~~~
Would be stupid to replace him. He's never going to be the best player in a top team in Europe but he can do a massive job for the team as the statistics shows. He has the second highest amount of interceptions in the league playing for a team who plays possession football which is very impressive. 

He averages the same amount of interception/tackles as Schneiderlin and slightly more than Matic. Only Coquilin has more combined tackles/interceptions per game than him of the top clubs players. 

Schneiderlin/Matic/Blind has nearly identical statistics in terms of passing accuracy, headers won per game, assists/goals per game. Blind gets less yellows, and Matic picks up the most with 9 in this season alone. Matic loses the balls more than Schneiderlin and Blind who have similar stats again. Schneiderlin and Blind have more accurate long balls than Matic.

3382~~~
How much did we buy him for again?

3383~~~
13.8 mill pounds.

3384~~~
Not sure if this bit has been posted here before.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2367302/lionel-messi-and-wayne-rooney-show-us-that-football-is-a-thinking-game-simon-kuper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-...-that-football-is-a-thinking-game-simon-kuper</a>

3385~~~
That's class Tbf.

3386~~~
He reads the game really well, he knows where to position himself in the sense that he doesn't get too tight. He stays a few feet away and almost entices them to pass into the player, then springs his trap and nicks the ball away.

It's a really clever way of playing, and intercepting in this day and age is so important now that hard tackling has been basically ruled out.

He also rarely dives into tackles, only tries to win it when he's very sure. I must admit I was sceptical about him being at LB but he has impressed me
So far.

3387~~~
I honestly believe that Shaw is an excellent buy , he has class and he will be a major player for us. Blind ..... i just love the guy , he will only get better.

3388~~~
Blind's great reading of the game, anticipation, intelligence, and defensive nous is really helping him out in performing well at left back. After Lahm, I feel like Blind's the only other full back/defensive midfielder who doesn't use a more physical approach when defending. He's such an enjoyable player to watch, and I just hope that he never gets dropped.

He's quite an obvious replacement to Carrick, and I hope that he establishes himself as our main defensive midfielder for many years to come.

3389~~~
Potential caftard/lurker?

3390~~~
Really! I hope not, he is a great squad player and a fantastic signing in terms of this but his lack of pace is so apparent.

3391~~~
Remains to be seen. He still lacks some things that would make the difference between being a good or a great footballer

3392~~~
Is Carrick pacey then? Or Busquets? What's the delusion with pace anyway, it isnt as if players can just hoof the ball from miles away and then suddenly pass him, he compensates his lack of pace with intelligence and positioning. Such a non-argument imo. Or is Pirlo pacey, Alonso.

3393~~~
I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see him do very well at right back too.

3394~~~
There is a big difference in terms of quality from Pirlo Alonso and Carrick to the likes of Blind. In my opinion Blind has been a fantastic signing but he's not a first choice midfielder if you are to win things. He's a level below top class that is needed.

3395~~~
And there's no possibility that he'll grow into that level? He's been here for under a year, and he has done really really well in a struggling part for the biggest part of the season, why cant he grow into the role, the pace of the league? He was barely good enough for Groningen for a time, and was arguablu the best left back at the WC last summer? Why cant he progress further and become a good player for us, because he hasnt got pace?

3396~~~
The best defensive or deep lying midfielders of the past 10-15 years were rarely pacey. The likes of Keane, Vieira, Alonso, Pirlo, Makelele, Busquets, Mascherano, Carrick, Lahm (at times), Martinez have/had little to no pace, yet their train of thought was probably quicker than any other player on the pitch. They almost knew what was going to happen before the opposition players made a move. The above mentioned players were intelligent, quick thinkers, great readers and never did their lack of pace affect their game. Blind is very similar in the sense that he shares many attirbutes with the best defensive midfielders of the past, and he's merely 24 and in his first season with the club; one can only imagine how good the young man will turn out to be. In my opinion, he's one of the best purchases we've made in a while.

3397~~~
Is he significantly worse than Matic, Mikel and Ferndandinho?

3398~~~
It is certainly not Shaw who was bought for competition to Blind, rather other way around, it's only since the match with Tottenham we decided to play like a team and every player's performance went up at least a level, Shaw didn't have really a good season but he was injured a lot new to the club, not that Blind is not new to the club but is experienced and fully backed by manager who bought him, not Shaw who was bought by whoever made that transfer.. but the kid is young and suffered from confidence especially often palyed out of position as wingback and fullback with no winger in front of him. Right now I guess Shaw wouldn't play that bad with Young or whoever in front of him and with all team working the best we've seen through the season. 

Blind will be a good back up in the future but he pleasantly surprised me with his efforts I am glad for him..

3399~~~
No Mata has no pace either but is loaded with quality but the way Blind plays (and I've been impressed with him as a signing) he needs to be exceptional at something else and he's not. He's very tidy on the ball but his off the ball is lacking and he hasn't got it to be top class from what I've seen. Although a very good squad signing.

3400~~~
Think the only two on that list that lack pace are Carrick and Pirlo and they have that extra quality Blind hasn't got.

3401~~~
Blind is 24 and still developing, there's no reason as to why he can't get even better.

3402~~~
I think he'll only get better and will become a very good first team player in time. He hasn't even been in the Premier League a full season yet. Carrick was basically "good, not great" and got a bit of stick for not being the next Roy Keane on here initially. Right now Blind is not on Carricks level, but it took Carrick quite some time to become influential and not just take the easy path of passing it sideways to Scholes.

I think Blind also has a better range of passing than we've seen because of playing it safe and the role he is being asked to play. Personally I think he's got what it takes to "replace" Carrick. He's not very strong or quick, but he makes up for it by being a very smart player with good technique.

3403~~~
this guy is the tits...what an awesome buy, and so cheap as well (seeing as prices have skyrocketed). definitely the best buy of the summer in terms of what he brings to the table and how much it cost to get him in.

3404~~~
His off the ball is lacking? Look how he positions himself, always available for the pass and when the opposition has the bal, he reads the game so quick in order to intercept, he has the most interceptions in per game in the league. Could be 2nd or something like that. He can even offer offensively, dont know what you expect more from a CDM.

3405~~~
I agree but how much better given he is 24?

3406~~~
He struggles to shut people down and players drift by him to easily imo. A good player but far from top class needed.

3407~~~
Carrick's best season was 12/13 when he was 31 years old. Pirlo, Alonso, Makelele were definitely not young yet still regarded as the best around. 

Blind has plenty of time to develop and improve his skill set. Another year, maybe 2 or 3 more... Players generally peak at the ages of 26, 27 or 28.

3408~~~
Best crosser at the club

3409~~~
I'm still a bit amazed at how Blind can be so underrated even after playing 30 odd games for the club and being good in virtually all but few. It almost appears like he cannot be top class for some because he's come from Eredivisie and not Premier League.

3410~~~
If he can play through the lines like Carrick developed for us, he'll be an astonishing player. His defensive work doesn't go unnoticed, however when Carrick isn't there we lack a penetrative passer. He tries and there are examples of when he's set up attacks from midfield, but he hasn't got that forward pass instinct Carrick has just yet. I imagine he'll pick that up if he plays centrally more often. 

It's excellent having that player again though, the one who can cover a variety of positions and do the job well wherever. He'll always hit 30 games a season, but I don't believe he'll hold down a position unless we really feck up and don't bring in that big time CM to phase Carrick out as he enters his twilight years.

3411~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://eplindex.com/66833/daley-blind-total-footballer.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Is Daley Blind the 'Total Footballer'?</a>
Nice piece, agree with a lot of it.

It annoys me people undervalue Blind, I honestly see him as the heir to Carrick's throne.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mid.png" src="http://eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mid.png"/>

3412~~~
He'll never be really rated, in Holland the general consensus still is that the likes of Clasie or Guardado are miles better, or that Willems is a better option for the LB. You see some here going on and on about pace, as if we play a fifa 15 comp every week..

3413~~~
I rate him high. He has been key these past few games and during the season he has done well in whatever position he has played in.

3414~~~
To be fair to Carrick, that stat needs more info.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/daley_blind/126/126/7674/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/michael_carrick/126/126/575/0/p#pass_completion/key_passes/defence_score/tackles_won/tackles_lost/successful_take_ons_%/possession_score/total_forward_passes/chances_created/total_duels_%/interceptions/blocks/defensive_errors/red_cards/yellow_cards#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...ks/defensive_errors/red_cards/yellow_cards#90</a>

3415~~~
He's a better LB than midfielder imo.

3416~~~
But he doesn't have that special 'something' that no one seems to know what it is or wants to define it. He just doesn't have it. Maybe it's spraying around 30-40 yard pointless crossfield passes.

3417~~~
And people say Shaw is a better LB.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/daley_blind/126/126/7674/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/luke_shaw/126/126/747/38/p#pass_completion/key_passes/defence_score/tackles_won/tackles_lost/successful_take_ons_%/possession_score/total_forward_passes/chances_created/total_duels_%/interceptions/blocks/defensive_errors/red_cards/yellow_cards#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...ks/defensive_errors/red_cards/yellow_cards#90</a>

3418~~~
I feel like the main problem with people underrating Blind comes down to the fact that he isn't necessarily a flashy player and he isn't English. Most of what he does really well goes unnoticed to people who only watch the game in a dumbed down perspective - i.e. you're only good if you score goals, are flashy, and have great technical ability. Blind is a fantastic reader of the game. His pressing is amazing, his interception rate is very high, and he consistently makes the right pass nearly every time. He does the simple things of football incredibly well, and he doesn't need to have that special something or be flashy to do it.

And for anyone who claims that him lacking pace hinders him as a player is simply not true. You can be one of the slowest players on the pitch, but if you read the game in real-time faster than most other players on the pitch then you don't need to have a whole lot of pace. Blind is a player that isn't that fast physically, but is incredibly quick mentally. There's a reason that his interception rate in higher than any other player in Europe.

If Blind was English, German, or Spanish then people would absolutely be raving about him.

3419~~~
Shaw is the long-term LB for the club. We didn't buy Blind to be our new LB, we bought him to be an anchor in midfield. The fact that he's played well at LB just goes to his testament as a very good player, and shouldn't take away from Shaw's ability and future potential.

3420~~~
Most people thought Carrick wasn't good enough until Neville told them otherwise. Until someone like Neville jams it down peoples throats they just won't get Daley's ability.

3421~~~
Usually deep lying playmakers develop their passing through-out their career, and Blind has already showed signs of having a great range of passing. It is clearly not at the level of Carrick/Pirlo/Alonso and so forth, but Carrick at the age of Blind didn't have that kind of passing range either and neither did Scholes.

Blind has an excellent defensive midfield game with a fairly strong passing. There hasn't been many deep lying playmakers who managed to combine a world class defense with the passing range and playmaking that defines the role. 

I think we will just stare ourselves blind if we want to compare him to Carrick all the time, if he doesn't develop the passing range of a DLP then that is fine anyhow. There is nothing wrong if he goes the other way and develops his defensive side even further while remaining more of a metronome player on the ball. 

He's already world class on the ball for a defensive midfielder, only the few deep lying playmakers are a fair bit better on the ball than him. Busquets, Verratti, Carrick, Pirlo, Alonso etc.

3422~~~
Yup.

But I don't think that'll happen anytime soon. He's a similar player to Carrick but at the same time he's very different. Carrick relies more on his physicality and stature (whilst not massive, he very much uses it to his advantage) whilst Blind has superior stamina and as a result presses more frequently and at the right moment. It's why he has such a higher interception rate. He'll need to grow into his ability with vertical long passes, as Carrick curb stomps him in that position. That side, his cross field/crossing in general is excellent.

3423~~~
I agree. Blind indeed has got a great long pass in him, he just doesn't dare to use it as often. This benefits the team defensively, but going forwards he can still pick his moments a bit better. There's nothing to suggest he can't reach the level of Carrick, we'll have to give him a bit longer. It's only his first season.

First part is true, he isn't rated highly in Holland (although that's changing for the better every year). Willems is only 20 and an exceptional talent though: he's got 11 assists this year in the league, and 2 goals. He's got a perfect cross with both feet but is suspect defensively. I rate Blind, but I prefer Willems at LB aswell (so Blind can play in midfield).

3424~~~
This.

3425~~~
You're looking at him as if he's an aggressive ball winner. Not all defensive midfielders are pure ball winners. Not every #6 is required to be and is like Makelele. Blind doesn't need to be physical and aggressive to have the team regain possession. His intelligence off the ball is very useful in intercepting passes and stopping the opposition from quickly advancing. You won't see him win the ball like Schneiderlin, Wanyama, or Matic, but he'll be great at shielding the defence by being at the right place at the right time, just like Carrick, Busquets, or Alonso.

The only times I've seen Blind not perform so well is when he charges up to players and plays like a ball-winning midfielder. That's not his game, and he was better when he plays less aggressively like he is right now and like he was at the beginning of the season.

He may not have the long-range passing of Carrick, but he's still a very good passer, and we didn't buy Blind to be a deep-lying playmaker. I remember at the beginning of the season how people were talking about how Blind was playing the ball forward quicker than Carrick did and how he kept up our pace and tempo.

3426~~~
I like Blind but his physical limitations might hinder him becoming a great player

3427~~~
He has been an amazing signing to be fair. For the price, the under the rader value and his consistent performances this year - it's probably been 1 of the best first season's of a new signings I can think of in recent years. 

Considering how a lot of people were underwhelmed, dreaming of Vidal etc, he has definitely won many people over.

3428~~~
I don't think that Iniesta or Xavi have great physical abilities... I'm not comparing Blind to them, but depending the type of game we play, the philosophy, I think that he's very well suited to that. He still has to improve if he wants to compete with Carrick in midfield, but he's very very clever. 

I really think that when we impose our game, our tempo, then he's really suited to the game, and he will be very important also in Europe when the tactical and technical side will be more improtant

3429~~~
I don't think so, a lot of players have gone on to do great things despite being limited physically.

3430~~~
Yeah but Xavi and Iniesta were both exceptionally fast and pacey.

Or not.

I really don't get it with Blind. Consistently putting 7s & 8s performances this season but some people just won't ever believe he could be good enough. Physical limitation, came from Eredivisie, positionally poor, there's always something wrong even though there clearly... isn't.

3431~~~
I guess these stats only show that Carrick makes less tackles and less interceptions, but is better at rotating the ball and keeping possession (while being aggressive).  I love Carrick, but I can see Blind holding down that CDM position for a few years.  He needs to stop 'switching off' at times (i.e. when suddenly players start running past him), but I don't think its a pace issue.  He does make up for that with his positioning.

3432~~~
I think the main thing that Carrick has over Blind is his quickness of thought in playing the pass (and then executing the pass - not that Blind isn't a very good passer, just not quite as good as Carrick, though that's hardly a criticism). Carrick seems to be more aware of where everyone is and what his options are quicker than Blind, and so we move the ball with more purpose when he's on the field. He is also more positionally(?) aware when it comes to taking up defensive positions in midfield (as that's his game, breaking down attacks through taking up intelligent positions, where Blind looks to go win the ball).

No reason why Blind can't at least match those attributes though, time is on his side.

3433~~~
Which is why I expanded on the stats compared to the other which was blatantly made to make Blind better. 

Also seems people forget that Blind was player of the year in the Eredivisie before he joined us.

3434~~~
I agree with that. I think for the position which might be suited best for him he is already quite great for his age and will become better within the next years.

3435~~~
Was his playing time mostly at LB or CM? Or was it 50:50?

3436~~~
Well he played CM for quite a bit as Carrick was injured and then even with Carrick when Carrick returned. I can't remember him playing much LB other than the last three games. There might have been one other game in September or October.

3437~~~
I meant for Ajax last season?

3438~~~
Don’t know. I think I read LB but maybe that was for the WC.

3439~~~
He was a CM at Ajax last season.

3440~~~
The best player in the league too.

3441~~~
11 out of 29 games as a LB, the rest CM. Although even when playing CM he was sometimes shifted to LB later on in the game. Frank de Boer much preferred him at CM, it was his ideal position, but due to Boilesen's injury proneness he still played LB now and then.

3442~~~
Interesting, clearly the claims that Clasie and Guardado are considered better in the Netherlands are bollocks then, seeing as he won POTY?

Was he played at the base of a midfield 3?

3443~~~
Blind our best signing of last summer?  Although, Herrera could have been had LVG shown more faith earlier.

3444~~~
It depends who you ask. Feyenoord supporters will probably say Clasie is better. PSV supporters might say Guardado is better, although that seems a stretch. Ajax supporters will say Blind though, even if he is underrated. It's because he had a really bad start in the eredivisie, was basically written off already by Ajax supporters when he started turning things around. Bit of a cult figure because of it. It's like people are still meassuring his current performance to how he played when he started out, like they're still surprised how far he has come.

Ajax played with a 3 midfield, similar to that of Barcelona, with Blind in the Busquets role, and 2 other more attacking midfielders.

3445~~~
I guess people ignoring Blind's Eredivisie performance is fair. The league there is not as fast paced as the PL and his biggest criticism is that he is slow.  I do however think that he is playing well in the LB position because he thinks like a midfielder, sees the play developing in the midfield and makes runs accordingly.  Carrick and him would - in most cases - make the same pass, so he is mostly in the right place to get it.  
This also shows the other way around sometimes, for e.g. the pass he made to Carrick for the first goal in the Tottenham game. I think there is no way Shaw would make that same pass - given his instinct would be to get hold of it and run towards the flank (or pass it back to the free CB).

3446~~~
Whilst being midfield players? I saw him getting dominated physically this season and it's definitely a weakness for me. Maybe he just needs some time to adjust to the EPL

3447~~~
You can't compare them to Blind as they play a complete different role

3448~~~
I actually agree with you, without a defensive partner/cover he is so easy to get past, he is a really good offensive player though.

The good thing about LVG is that he tries to incorporate a system that caters to everyone's strength even if it means keeping a player on the bench for a while, he did it with Herrera and Mata and I imagine he is doing the same thing with Luke Shaw.

3449~~~
Not the greatest attribute for a centre mid!

3450~~~
From my experience the guys who cross well usually also pass well.

3451~~~
I wouldn't bet my mortgage on it happening... but I wouldn't bet my mortgage on it not happening either...

3452~~~
IIRC

We haven't played with him in midfield since the first half of the Arsenal FA Cup tie. Since the second half of that game we have stopped getting over run by the opposition and have hit our best form.

I like him as a squad player but I don't fancy him as a starter long term.

3453~~~
Then why not say his passing?

3454~~~
This myth that you need to be built like a brick outhouse to play in the Premier League is half the reason our teams are getting overrun in Europe lately. Blind has all the basics to do well here and with a bit of polishing i think will go on to be a long term starter for us.

3455~~~
To be fair you kind of need a physical player in your midfield in the EPL,not so much in the CL though.

3456~~~
Honestly for his first season in the league he has done quite well. Maybe he can really replace Carrick in the long run albeit I feel our defense is more stable when Carrick plays the number 6 and not Blind. He doesn't fully convince me as a full back though.

3457~~~
Modric.

3458~~~
He should be taking all indirect free kicks. Probably corners too. He isn't much of a threat in the box but his crossing is top notch.

3459~~~
Must start at LB for these big games coming.  He's been really good back there.

3460~~~
I remember Carrick never had a stellar first season either. I remember because a Spurs fan I know would let me know constantly throughout the season how glad he was that Spurs sold us a dud and that Carrick would amount to nothing. Even beginning of the second season, Carrick wasn't stellar.

Blind has definitely done better than Carrick in my opinion with regards to this being his first season.

I wish Squawka had stats going to when Carrick started, but they don't.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2012/2013/michael_carrick/126/2/575/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/michael_carrick/126/126/575/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/daley_blind/126/126/7674/0/p#defence_score/total_forward_passes/total_backward_passes/total_passes/successful_passes/pass_completion/key_passes/avg_pass_length/tackles_won/tackles_lost/successful_take_ons_%/aerial_duels_won_%/interceptions/blocks/clearances/defensive_errors/errors_leading_to_goal/total_duels_%#total" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...rs/errors_leading_to_goal/total_duels_%#total</a>

Note however that the stats won't show things like formation played, position played etc. A lot of these things need to be taken into account hence why most regard Carrick as a better DM than Blind, and I agree.

However Blind will grow into whatever position he is chosen for whether it's DM, LB or even CB. He's 25 and Carrick is 33, almost 34.

3461~~~
We won the League in 06/07 after 3 seasons in hiatus, where Carrick was our only signing, and RvN left the club. He was a very important signing.

3462~~~
Carrick was fantastic in his first season and undeniably had a huge impact on our midfield. That Roma performance<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3463~~~
He always seemed to have top games against the Italian sides, I know they rate him massively over in Italy... He even continued that run last week for England at Italy

3464~~~

3465~~~
Aragorn of Ye Old Trafford!

Got blitzed for pace a couple of times in the first ten minutes but then normal service resumed, his composure when it comes time to deliver the key pass in the final 3rd is as good as any fullback in the game right now IMO.

3466~~~
intelligent player if he was faster he could be a really good left back. I like him combining with Young who himself is smart player full of tricks.. Now Blind will run the show in the middle of the park and Rojo as LB? I don't think he got a proper chance there as we really kicked on after Spurs game, so I believe some people might be surprised once he does a as good job as what Carrick did for several weeks now.. 

Not afraid a bit

3467~~~
I'd keep him at left back. Why fix what's not broken ? We are steamrollering some of the strongest teams in the PL. Right now neighing needs changing, least of all Blind who I think gas been fantastic. Real composure on the ball and a great work rate. Top player.

3468~~~

3469~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's brilliant. I'm going to think of this now every time I'm at mass.

3470~~~
Absolutely love having a left back whose first thought isn't to just cross the ball without looking, makes our attacking play so much better.

3471~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3472~~~
So fecking sexy.

3473~~~
Kept Sterling and Navas in his pocket. Can't argue against that.

3474~~~
I fancy him.

3475~~~
Navas destroyed him in the first 20 minutes or so, but Blind grew into the game (like the rest of the defence) and did well. The trios of Young-Blind-Fellaini and Mata-Herrera-Valencia work so well.

3476~~~
Apart from that 1 over the top ball where I thought he was going to be in for a long evening; he did really well.

3477~~~
Was a bit sloppy at times today during the first half and his lack of paced showed at times. Grew into the game though.

3478~~~
I thought he started relatively poor but in fairness, our defence looked like they were auditioning for clown college in the first ten minutes. He grew into the game after that and played a part in Fellaini's goal. He is a great talent and I'm delighted that we signed him.

3479~~~
Started a bit poorly but tbf Navas is really really quick. Apart from the first few minutes he was as classy as always.

3480~~~
Navas got the better of him once.

Stand in line. Its probably as long as the great wall of china.

3481~~~
Think the first half was his worst half in a United shirt, to be fair we didn't have much of the ball but from a defensive perspective he was caught out by Navas and a bit sloppy on the ball.

Having said that, thought he had a solid second half and we didn't hear from Navas at all. It shows great character to grow into the role like that and it shows the difference in his play when we have more of the ball, he's better when we have more possession as we did in the second half where as not controlling the game, thought although having  a bad first half he was key to the build up of that demolition on the left flank.

3482~~~
Navas would have scored if he wasn't such a pointless footballer who isn't good at anything, and it would have been Blind's fault. Thankfully, Navas is a pointless footballer who isn't good at anything, least of all finishing.

We were really shit in those first 15 minutes or so. He grew into the game, as the whole team did. Some iffy ball control at times, but still decent. Big fan of him.

3483~~~
This guy will go down as a legend.

3484~~~
He's like a left back playmaker.

3485~~~
Attacking and linking up was brilliant, got caught out a few times at the back, apart from that it was a 7/10 performance for me!!

3486~~~
One of the best signings in the league. Absolute bargain. Struggled for the first 15 minutes or so but got the pace of the game and was brilliant from then on. He is so good on the ball and his passing is outstanding. Guaranteed at least a 7/10 every week. Wasn't sure when we signed him but he's been a fantastic acquisition.

3487~~~
I love how he get in a tangle with the opposition but against the odds, comes out the other side with the ball.

3488~~~
What a player. Struggled a bit with Navas and Zabaleta pace wise but was still solid, making up for it with intelligence. Great performance considering he's primarily a DM.

3489~~~
So far I have been extremely underwhelmed with Shaw tbh, I still think we were ripped of by alot for 30mill

I dont see in current form, how Shaw will get his place back from Blind

3490~~~
I like how emotional he is like the most of our players. I'd like to think of this as a closely knit group where each individual complements each other well and by the looks of it, it is! Blind and Young constantly talk to each other on the wings and those two make a great pair on the left. The cohesion in this team is extremely high at this moment and LvG deserves massive credit for that.

3491~~~
Extremely impressed with how he learned quickly he hadnt got the pace for Navas and adapted his game accordingly. Yes it should have cost us a goal, but most other defenders would have continued getting caught out all game.

3492~~~
Not the best positionally, today. You can tell he's still learning how to play an offside trap properly. But I think you can forgive him that given that left back isn't his regular position.

3493~~~
He's still very very young and, defensively, there are few better LBs out there. He'll come good, though at the minute Blind should be first choice.

3494~~~
Don't think he was very good actually. Got caught out of position more than a few times and wasn't his usual self going forward.

I'd like to see him cross the ball a lot more though. Probably the best in the league at it.

3495~~~
I didn't see the 1st 30 mins, but he was absolutely excellent from what I did see. Didn't put a foot wrong. His penetrative passing from LB is like having another mini-Carrick to break up the opposition's defensive lines. And he stays in position to defend also, unlike his counterpart on the opposite wing.

3496~~~
You need to watch the whole game before you make a comment like that.

3497~~~
Great signing. Shaw still the long term option but on this form, he may have to wait.....I must say though, the lack of Blinds pace does find him out at times

3498~~~
Long term I think he's going to be a midfielder, but it's great he's such quality cover at LB.

3499~~~
From what I've read both Blind and Valencia were poor in the 1st 30 mins, with Valencia caught out by good movement for the goal. After that I saw Valencia commit more positional errors (Milner's chance; twice he slid on Silva in their half, got nothing, and exposed his flank; debatable positioning for the Aguero chance from where he recovered beautifully; counter at the end of the 1st half; when Herrera lost the ball in the 2nd half Valencia wasn't in the box when the shot was blocked even though Herrera was...) 
But I thought Blind was flawless.

3500~~~
Love the guy, future captain

3501~~~
That's a ridiculously biased post. Should I remind you that City's second goal came from getting to the byline down our left flank? No doubt, you'd have a long list of reasons why Valencia was to blame if it had been Clichy, instead of Zabaleta, who assisted that goal.

Makes me think that even watching the first 30 minutes wouldn't have changed your opinion...

3502~~~
Valencia <i>was</i> caught out of position a few times, though, you can't deny that, can you? I did think that overall he had a good game though. I mean he's not a right back so I wouldn't exactly expect his positional sense to be flawless anyway. His recovery to get at Aguero was also brilliant.

3503~~~
Fullbacks are always going to get caught out of position, from time to time. That's the nature of their role and one of the main reason teams play with holding midfielders. To plug those inevitable gaps.

I don't think Valencia was exposed more frequently or more dramatically than any other fullback on the pitch yesterday. It just seems to be the latest stick to beat him with, now he's doing all the more obvious stuff so well.

This is the Blind thread, though. I thought he was very good fwiw. Even though he did get, shock horror, occasionally caught out of position.

3504~~~
Thought he was tentative after the play where Navas flew past him early in the game. You could see that it had affected him when some of the one-two's with Young weren't going right, it was playing on his mind. His lack of pace as LB is a concern against opponents who play with width and have pacey players operating there.

3505~~~
Another phenomenal performance from him. My man of the match, amongst a few options. The amount of headers he won was ridiculous. He sets up attacks supports positionally is so sound. Its just great to watch him. He makes Young and Fellaini look good (both playing v. well too) but he compliments them, as I believe he would with any player as he is so tactically aware. 

Offers a great option going forward too. Top player, another great performance.

3506~~~
I think van Gaal himself talked about the confusion that happened when Carrick came off and no adjustments were made. Still, yes, Blind could've done better. And, yes, Valencia wouldve been to blame, but equally slightly, if that had happened on his side. I also don't see how the post is biased.

3507~~~
Valencia had a stormer of a game. Was very solid defensively. He's keeping Rafael out of the team on merit.

3508~~~
I was concerned coming into this season with a lack of cover for Shaw, but Blind has proven himself to be highly competent at LB. I dont think it is or will be his primary position (he will start taking over from Carrick I imagine, and Shaw will start taking over at LB).

I do think the caf is as usual exaggerating things, people calling him our outfield player of the season so far is just ridiculous, but he is an excellent player to have in the squad.

3509~~~
I honestly think that's to do with going so fecking long without a proper midfield, anyone who comes in and does well is gonna be an instant hero. I do think Carrick has shown who's the boss, for the time being anyway.

3510~~~
Blind, during our tough time in the first half, struggled a bit with his aggressive approach causing him to get out of position too often and breaking down our defensive shape. However, once he controlled his aggression, he became much better and tougher to beat, defensively. Still, he needs to control that tendency to charge into players too soon as he doesn't really have the pace to recover his position in time. Once he did that against Navas, Navas was almost ineffective, and our left side became stronger.

3511~~~
I wouldnt be too sure about shaw coming back in to the team, he has alot of work to do before hes a regular here

3512~~~
It isn't a stretch to argue that he's been our most consistent. He's started every single league game when fit and has delivered consistent 7/10 performances, even when we have struggled throughout matches and other players have struggled for form. He's also scored two hugely important last minute equalisers.

I'm struggling to pick an outfield player of the season, primarily because so few of the team has played week in, week out. Herrera and Carrick have been excellent, for me, but the former was out of the picture for a few months and the latter has struggled for fitness. I'd probably give the nod to Rooney but Blind isn't far behind at all.

3513~~~
He is still young. I for one didnt expect him to be an automatic first choice this season - too many folk have just looked at the price tag and assumed he will be starting every week and playing flawlessly.

Shaw is still the long term option there - but LVG has been smart enough to not just throw him in at the deep end, but rather let him develop. Having adequate cover is very important to be able to do this.

3514~~~
You are right that Blind has been pretty consistent. However he has had bad patches, and has looked uncomfortable at times both in CM and at LB.
This isnt to say he hasnt done well for his debut season with us, but I think any of these players would be ahead of him as my player of the season;
Rooney
Fellaini
Smalling
Young
Herrera


I do agree that there isnt really a single standout candidate who is head and shoulders above the others. Personally I think Smalling and Fellaini have been probably the two I would pick out of the above.

3515~~~
yeah, him and Mata coming infield is a major part of us creating overloads and dominating the middle. Who'd have thought we'd be dominating midfield battles in the big games this season with essentially the same squad Moyes left + Blind?

3516~~~
I think you just somehow managed to forgot Ander Herrera.

3517~~~
How come his average rating on here is 6.5?  Feels like he has been better than that over the course of the season.

3518~~~
For me De Gea is player of the season again.

3519~~~
Something like this for me, in order:
DDG. (over the course of the season it must be him)
Herrera.
Carrick.
Fellaini.
Young.
Blind.
Smalling.
Rooney.
the rest either had bad patches or suffered injuries.

3520~~~
He played a lot of games in midfield when we were getting over run and he looked out of his depth defensively when the opposition were on the break. The fact of the matter is that our upturn in fortunes has coincided with him not playing in midfield anymore.

3521~~~
Our back line has sorted itself out now and we are playing far more compressed than when Blind was in midfield. With the lack of space now afforded to the opppsition in central areas I can't see his lack of pace being as much of a concern when he eventually returns to DM.

3522~~~
And he passed sideways so much neville dedicated MNF to him as the reason we were so slow and pedestrian. No way will will beat Chelsea away with him repeating that.

3523~~~
He's like a maximum luxury version of O'Shea with his versatility. Excellent player.

3524~~~
That's actually a good rating over the season. I think only De Gea, Carrick and Herrera are higher than that and even De Gea is below 7.0

3525~~~
Hes not a player that will ever stand out and win you a game on his own with an 8 or a 9. Hes the sort who keeps things ticking over and goes largely unnoticed by most fans.

Hes also unlikely to do a Jonny Evans and lose you a game with a 3.

3526~~~
At the time we were a one man midfield, he was absolutely alone in the middle. Our upturn coincided with Fellaini playing deeper and Herrera understanding his new role and playing like an actual #6/#8 instead of the #10/#8 that he was at the start of the season.
We are also a lot tighter, at the start of the season we were to much spread.

3527~~~
Yeah that statement now doesn't look all too right, when you consider replacing Cleverley with Herrera.

3528~~~

3529~~~
I expect he got his medal in the mail?

It is also a good example of how you can't just look at stats to judge a players defensive contribution. There is a lot more to defending than just interceptions and tackles that aren't picked up by stats, like tracking a runner to cut off a 1-2 or positioning yourself to cut off passing alleys.

3530~~~
This. Something Carrick and he are extremely talented at. But most people think they don't do enough because they aren't charging down opponents or running full steam to close down an opponent.

3531~~~
Indeed. That video of exemplary defending the Germans got so excited about won't earn him a single point in "Stat Wars".

3532~~~
I think he's great. One of our best players this season me. Extremely consistent and has performed bith roles of central midfielder and left back very well.

Very interesting video there <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> highlights how important little things that one wouldn't normally notice or applaud, are. As good as a proper heroic full blooded last ditch tackle. Also highlights the importance of analysis.

3533~~~

3534~~~
Hopefully he's fit for Sunday as it seems Carrick is unlikely to be.

3535~~~
Well done. Let's all celebrate a tweet about the artwork Blind received for his birthday.

3536~~~
He hasn't played in midfield for us since we switched to a 433 so hopefully he's fit to start against Everton and will be interesting to see how he does in a proper midfield.

3537~~~
Just noticed on his instagram he had his bike send over from Amsterdam haha, such a down to earth guy!

Hope to see him back playing again soon.

3538~~~
Didn't he get in trouble for that? Something with English laws prohibiting his bike because it has a certain type of brake?

3539~~~
I'm happy for him. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3540~~~
Doubt it, just looked it up, it's just media trying to cause shit, saying how unsafe it is and that Van Gaal will punish him for it. Backpedal breaks are very safe, it's why half of the Dutch people have them on their bikes. We know our bikes. And if anything, Van Gaal will applaud him for it.

3541~~~
Yeah I know, I'm Dutch as well. Thought it was the press trying to stir shit, but it was still funny.

3542~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3543~~~
Diappointed with fellaini. Why didn't he celebrate better? And he said he loves it here...

3544~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3545~~~
Needs a big performance vs Everton, assuming Carrick is still out.

Shaw showed against Chelsea he's a much better left back, and Carrick is the best #6 in the league.

Interesting to see what will happen when the squad is fully fit. I think he'd do well if we lined up something like this


Harsh on Fellaini but Blind is a better footballer. Would help with Di Maria's lack of discipline to have Blind there.

I do wonder how he'd get on with a bit more attacking freedom. His passing is very good, but he's not had a chance to show too much creativity so far, I wonder if he has it in him? <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> might be able to give some insight, but I fear he might have a breakdown if he see's that I've tagged him another post <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3547~~~
I don't think he's suited to that role. Blind is a jack of all trades, good at everything but a master of nothing. He's smart defensively, has good passing and has vision. He's not a good tackler, nor does he have the physicality or speed to play box-to-box like others. I think he can do a job there if needed but his position really is 6 and not 8. Van Gaal used him there before this season so it is an option though.

His lack of pace isn't a problem at 6, he has the vision and brain to be at the right place to intercept the ball/push opponent out wide. This becomes worse when he has a bigger area of the pitch to cover like he would at 8, his physical side isn't good enough for this. He's got an amazing cross but rather plays it safe, if he develops this further he would be the perfect replacement of Carrick in a few years time. I think he will rotate with Carrick mostly.

His best positions:
CDM
LB / LWB

He could potentially play, when needed:
LCB (in a 3 & 4)
Box-to-box

3548~~~
I think he's more than capable of doing a good job in Carrick's absence.

3549~~~
He is back in training
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDXT1hSWIAAu6Ne.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDXT1hSWIAAu6Ne.jpg"/>

3550~~~
We need blind for Everton I really hope he makes it.

3551~~~
Cheers for that mate.

3552~~~
He's lost an arm?

Seriously wtf is Jones doing in training?!

3553~~~
He's still got his beard though. Thats really all that matters. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3554~~~
Anyone know the last time he played at the base of midfield? It'll be the first real chance to see whether Blind can be a proper Carrick replacement I think. Now the team's in form and know their roles it's just a question of whether Blind can exert the same kind of influence.

3555~~~
The arsenal game I think though it was only for a half.

3556~~~
First half against Arsenal, the last time that we were overrun in midfield. I am interested to see today if we look vulnerable there again with him back in that position or if it just coincidence and other factors.

3557~~~
The first half against Arsenal appeared more like a generally bad game (one of those days) as opposed to any kind of long-term confirmation that Blind isn't up to the role. 

There's a risk of forgetting his good performances in there at the beginning of the season. He was a constant positive in the midst of much negativity and did well considering that he was, at times, the only real midfielder on the park. The Rooney, Van Persie, Falcao vanity project was still very much in force.

I agree, though, that today will give a better indication as to where he's at. I think he'll do well.

3558~~~
The Arsenal game was all about Valencia, Di Maria and LVG's lack of action to fix it

3559~~~
Blind getting over run in midfield has been something that has been mentioned all season in fairness.

3560~~~
He has played that role throughout the whole season when Carrick has been injured. Moreover, I believe he plays that role for Holland aswell. Hence, already showing he is a capable replacement for Carrick.

3561~~~
Incorrectly. It only happened when Di Maria was in CM, because he doesnt defend. Carrick hasnt had to deal with that. Blind wins the ball more, plays more passes and more accurately than Carrick has done.

3562~~~
This.. Rooney had more presence last week. Blind just looks intimidated.

3563~~~
His lack of pace is a huge liability, nowhere near as good as carrick.

3564~~~
Gets skinned too easily, which you can't say about Carrick.

3565~~~
Been saying it for ages. He's a good player but a DM he's not.

3566~~~
I've said it for ages, he's a great versatility player but he is a squad player NOT a guaranteed starter.

3567~~~
Garbage. Positionally all over the place and getting the ball taken of him.

Carrick is so important to this team it's unreal.

3568~~~
Bench player, not good enough to play such a vital role.

3569~~~
Daley Blind is a good player but Carrick he isn't.

3570~~~
He's done alright.

3571~~~
He runs forward far too much for a CDM. It's great once in a while, but not every time.

Players run past him with ease. Agree about the squad player bit. Need a true replacement for Carrick.

3572~~~
A wrote loss, when I've seen the line up with him as a DM

3573~~~
you watching the same game?  he is overwhelmed in the middle of the park. I think we now understand why he played at lb in the world cup. He has no physical presence; they just go around him or through him like he is not even there.

3574~~~
I just don't see what he brings to the team.

3575~~~
He plays like a blind person. Positionally awful.

3576~~~
Poor today. Passing range is severely limited and seems to contribute to us getting caught on the counter a lot. Much better at fullback. Positionally very weak as a holding midfielder.

Given time he might get better, but Carrick is easily the first choice.

3577~~~
Yeah, one of our best players this season is garbage after one poor half where everyone was poor, and not to mention that he is just back from injury. Great stuff.

3578~~~
He is too slow to play DM. Shows how much we really do miss Carrick when he isn't playing.

3579~~~
Is he fully fit?

3580~~~
Better off putting Hererra in there.

3581~~~
He's struggled badly with the pace and pressure Everton's midfield are placing on him and isn't doing enough on the ball.

3582~~~
He is a good squad player as cover for left back and DM but that's it, that's not based purely on today but it's pretty clear we need an upgrade in the summer because we can't expect carrick to play all the time and the drop in quality between carrick and blind is too vast.

3583~~~
McCarthy and Barkley are nightmare opponents for him. Both are fast and strong.

3584~~~
He seems to drift out of his position quite often

3585~~~
His lack of pace really does hold him back as a central player, he simply has to play from a deeper position or he will get mugged if we lose the ball on the counter.

3586~~~
Yes, up against the two attributes he lacks.

3587~~~
Its funny people bring this up again. He's the <b>first</b> player of ours back on that break away for their first goal when he had to cover more distance than half of the team. He's the one who gets back into CB position and can turn and face up play.

He could definitely have done a bit better, but that's 95% McNair's ball to win as McCarthy runs it straight at him

Overall he hasnt been at his best but he's largely been let down by his teammates.

3588~~~

3589~~~
It's not his pace or his height or anything like that which worries me, it's the fact his passing just isn't particularly adventurous, and he has a habit of leaving the back two exposed. And that's not just today, our record with him in the holding role is not brilliant.

But, the rest of them are failing to step up too, so it's harsh to pinpoint it on him today. He's not forcing Young to cut in and pass back. He's not forcing Fellaini to be an idiot or not hit the target when clean through.

3590~~~
Just back in the team after injury, only real DM as everybody heads forward again, they counter us and he's shit again. Yes he's been poor today but some of you need to get a grip, if you judge by those standards even ddg is shit, rooney too. Who has been good today anyway? Carrick couldnt have done much more for the first goal, too many player went forwards, mcNair should have cleared that ball.

3591~~~
I'm not saying he hasn't been let down by others as he definitely has, but it seems the slightest bit of pace and the opponent is away from him.

3592~~~
His lack of pace won't be an issue if he positioned himself better. He needs to be more conservative and stop charging towards the ball.

3593~~~
His pace or lack of it is not an issue. Nor is his passing a problem. His main issue is that he gets caught behind the ball wayyyyy too often. I can only assume this is down to poor positioning.

3594~~~
Same with Carrick. 

Again, he's back there faster than his teammates. Carrick wouldnt be

3595~~~
One bad game/half and people throwing him under the bus .... and after coming back from an injury.

3596~~~
I'm not sure why you are defending him when clearly everyone else thinks he has been rubbish at DM today.

3597~~~
Might be a good CM in the Dutch league but this is completely different world..

3598~~~
Blind isn't half the player Carrick is. When he gets pressured by physical players he whimpers. 

The first goal, he was absolutely pathetic not even trying to make the tackle. Compare that to other defensive midfielders in the league. Do you think McCarthy would skip through Wanyama?

Blind is average.

3599~~~
Because he's talking about myths. Might as well be telling stories about unicorns.

3600~~~
He wasn't noticeably worse then anyone else in the first half. Maybe some heard Neville immediately blame Blind for the first goal when it was McNair that McCarthy bundled through. 

Neville has been unfairly criticising Blind all season, aka the De Gea treatment.

3601~~~
Thought he was rushed back into the lineup and was a bit lethargic because of it.

3602~~~
Thought so too, was very sluggish too

3603~~~
Nah he was really, very poor - his overall awareness and positioning were really poor. Plus, he just looked off the pace.

3604~~~
He skips through McNair having run the ball straight at him. The only way Blind gets that is if he takes both players out in the process

Which by the way isn't wrong.  He could well have cleared them both out being extra cautious and risking injuring his own player, but its perfectly reasonable to think that if your CB is being run straight at then he's not going to put in a weak challenge and let the opponent by like he did do.

Smashing through players certainly isnt something we've seen Carrick do.

3605~~~
Every 50/50 he seems to lose.

3606~~~
you must be in love with Blind to defend that performance. He is shocking as a defensive midfielder, no commitments, no urgency and no edge to his play at all. He just jogs along with the play.

3607~~~
He was poor today. He didn't take enough responsibility upon receiving the ball.

3608~~~
Clearly not good enough to be a top central midfielder and people were saying he could be a Carrick replacement at the start of the season. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3609~~~
Terrible today. Always behind play.

3610~~~
He puts in a lazy leg rather than commit to a challenge. Would be better if he just conceded the ball and start from there.

3611~~~
You're right about the first goal. Blind stood his ground and didn't dive in. He had more than enough reason to believe that his covering centre half would do his job properly.

3612~~~
This isn't the first time I have seen him struggle as DM, I was shocked people were talking about Blind as our (outfield) player of the year.

3613~~~
Very slow. And weak for that matter. Has been really poor. Hopefully he can get better next season.

3614~~~
He is a good player but today was as bad as I've seen him play.

3615~~~
He's going to be a decent squad player I think. Or a starting player against poor sides at home. I think as the season has gone on though we have realised that he doesn't have the quality or ability to be a starting player.

3616~~~
People can talk about him perhaps not being fully fit and pull up their squawka charts with stat comparisons etc....the fact is he looks too slow and weak to play this role in the PL and on top of that he doesn't have enough in his forward passing game to keep our tempo up, Herrera was better in the role last week than he was today.

3617~~~
Blind in midfield away from home - P7, W1, D2, L4, GF8, GA14
Without Blind in midfield away from home - P10, W4, D5, L1, GF11, GA7

We're awful away from home but starting him in midfield makes things 10x worse. We concede so many goals with him in midfield, which is no surprise as we get overrun far too easily. Even last week Chelsea struggled to get through and only managed it thanks to a refereeing error. I'm confident that had Blind played we'd have lost far more comfortably.

3618~~~
Looked nowhere near 100%. Very poor regardless. His passing is on point, but his positional discipline was off. He was never there when the centre backs needed an option. Played more as a box to box player today, and it allowed Everton to counter quite easily.

3619~~~
For all his intelligence he's nowhere near Carrick level.

Should compete for LB spot while LVG must find new player as Carrick replacement/competitor.

3620~~~
Don't rate him in midfield whatsoever. He's far too weak to make a good defensive midfielder and gets bullied often. He's fine when you're playing some relegation fodder at home who aren't counter attacking but he's useless in games like today.

3621~~~
He is not the answer to the DCM problem. We need someone else in the summer.

3622~~~
The best bit about this thread is that people are seriously complaining about Blind not making a tackle on the first goal, when it wasn't his to make and then saying Carrick is miles better. 

And yet Carrick has averaged less than <b>1 and a half tackles an entire game this season</b>.

Its possible Blind could have made a tackle to stop that attack, absolutely. Would Michael Carrick have? You've got to be kidding

3623~~~
Not a good performance at all.

I think he played left back for 150 matches out of the 200 he's played in his career, so it will be interesting to see how much he can improve in playing the CM position.

3624~~~
What a stupid thing to say.

3625~~~
Carrick's positioning means he doesn't have to tackle.

3626~~~
Carrick is the most important player in the side. Blind isn't good enough positionally to be a long term replacement both in and out of possession, and he doesn't have the range of passing whether that be long or between the lines.

3627~~~
Brilliant. So by having a great position like Blind picked up in that move, he wouldnt have needed to tackle McCarthy such is his power

3628~~~
I wasn't referring specifically to the goal. Just in a broad sense as to why Carrick probably has less tackles than Blind.

3629~~~
He was obviously poor, but let's not forget he was returning from injury and he was hardly the only player off the pace. It's never going to be as easy returning from injury in a team that's struggling.

3630~~~
Carrick positions himself better hence why he doesn't make more tackles. Blind goes charging up leaving our centre backs exposed and loses most 50/50.

3631~~~
He wasnt much worse than he was at left back and yet people praised his performances there. Because we won those games.

3632~~~
Okay fair enough, but I'm clearly talking about what I specifically pointed out. That people are pointing fingers at Blind for the first goal, saying he should have made a tackle that was on McNair and then saying Carrick is miles better, when Carrick barely makes a tackle this season.

It doesn't make any sense. There are games where Carrick makes 1 tackle and yet people believe that 1 tackle would have come in that exact moment that Blind didnt make one?

As for your point its partly true, but more importantly its Ander and Fellaini doing a good job pressing and winning the ball in front of him that means we can get away with a deeper CM not winning the ball often. 

Fellaini and Ander both made 1 tackle today, a lot less than normal partly due to how Everton played and that meant there was more work for Blind and the rest to do.

3633~~~
Our whole team lost most 50/50s, Blind wins more than Carrick has done this season. Hence he doesn't win the ball often

3634~~~
He's not a defensive midfielder. Play him at LB or play him in front of Carrick.

3635~~~
you send 25m for Schneiderlin and he will win you 5+ tackles per game, all 50/50 challenges, provide great cover for defenders and do a similar job with his passing as Blind. He was overrated since his arrival, he's squad player maximum in our future premier league winning team. 

He's almost like McNair in midfield when he doesn't need to defend he's okay passing around the ball, occasionally coming up with good interception or cross, he suffers from his lack of pace and strength. We will simply not dominate the games in premier league like Ajax in their competition..

3636~~~
I'd have to see it again but I thought it was his positioning in the early part of the move for the first goal that let him down a bit... as I say, would have to see it again though.

3637~~~
Okay so lets say Blind lacks pace and strength. 

Michael Carrick also lacks pace and strength. Its amazing we've put up with him isnt it?

3638~~~
He's on the halfway line when we lose the ball and he sprints back at a pace none of the rest of our players do, not because he's the fastest but because he's responsibile and gave 110% effort. He got back into a brilliant position.

3639~~~
I disagree. He played very well at left back, although it's kind of difficult to compare the 2 roles as they're so different.

3640~~~
If you can't see that Carrick is a much better player then I don't even know what to say.

3641~~~
Please dont say anything.

3642~~~
He was poor today but no worse than anyone else. This is a tough game to return from injury, talk about going in at the deep end. Funny thing is, all the things he's being criticised for Carrick has been guilty of loads this season, yet the people criticising are saying Carrick is better. Michael Carrick is not better, if anyone should be a squad player it's him. And comments like "we need a proper replacement for Carrick" are implying that Carrick is/was some kind of god. He was good under Fergie but this year and last he hasn't been. He's on a huge decline atm whereas Blind is exciting to watch and fresh. Strangely, the treatment Blind has been getting is similar to the treatment that Carrick was getting when he came. In a few years we'll no doubt having Blind fanboys crying themselves to sleep when he doesn't play, blaming everything that goes wrong on his replacement whilst casually ignoring the fact that the whole team was poor.

3643~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is mentally brilliant.

3644~~~
That's laughable. Carrick is quite strong on the ball and hardly ever gets shrugged off the ball.
Carrick also makes himself available when our CB's have the ball, but how many times did we see Blind run forward away from his defence? Carrick brings more than just positional play and interceptions, he also brings composure which we saw nothing of from Blind. I don't think it was entirely his fault for the 1st goal, but he didn't commit to the tackle when the attack actually started in their half, hence he was the only player close toe enough to try and tackle them.

3645~~~
Carrick is a great players though. Blind is a young lad in his first season in a top league and has generally been impressive in midfield, its not fair to say he's not good enough cos he's not as good as Carrick, let's give him time.

3646~~~
Solid squad player, nothing to shout about. Could've played better but he's no Carrick.

3647~~~
Exactly the sort of thing one could've said about Carrick when he first arrived.

3648~~~
Carrick might lack pace but he is faster than Blind and MUCH stronger, he is quite a big lad and is rarely bullied.

Blind is just too small and too slow to be a long term replacement for Carrick.

3649~~~
do you believe we would done better last week if Carrick was fit or even today? Not all Blind's fault but he was a pedestrian today.

3650~~~
Very poor today, and highlights how much we need someone to really take over from Carrick. Still think Blind will be a good player for us, he's still only 25 and I think he'll still improve quite a bit. At the very least he'll be a good squad player.

3651~~~
Today was Blind's only real high-profile mistake, and even then it was more McNair's fault. Carrick has almost cost us a lot of goals this season, including almost causing a huge collapse in the City game. At the very least he stopped us from getting another. Blind is slow? Carrick's slower.
Get over the nostalgia and you'll probably come round to the fact that Blind is our future. I like Carrick, I'm a big fan, but he has been so overrated this year it is quite nauseating. Like I said, Carrick received a lot of negativity for his first couple of years here, almost all undeserved. Blind is just going through the "Carrick treatment".

3652~~~
Prove it. You have Everton's first goal to show that Blind is fast enough to keep up with Everton's break and gets back faster than his teammates

Where's Carrick doing the same?

Neither have pace, plenty of DMs who have done well have done without it

3653~~~
That didn't happen. Stop inventing nonsense.

Look at our win percentange with Carrick in the side, and look at it when he's not in the side. To say that he is on the decline, or been poor is, frankly, ridiculous.

3654~~~
Last week we would have won the game with either Blind or Carrick. I have no doubt in my mind about that. Today, Carrick would not have made a difference at all in my opinion. Not a swipe at him, but I struggle to see what he would have done to prevent us from losing.

3655~~~
Bollocks.

3656~~~
Everything said in here today about Blind has been said about Carrick loads of times.

3657~~~
He would have moved the ball quicker and been more insicive with his passing imo

3658~~~
It's really obvious that he isn't as good as he was a couple of years ago. By definition, he is on decline. How is that even disputable? Also, do you genuinely believe that we would have conceded City's second goal with Carrick on the pitch? He messed up our structure. City scored and played a lot better, had we not been so comfortable beforehand there is every chance that City would have equalised. It's definitely not completely unrealistic.

3659~~~
Ok, in terms of pace I would say that there is no big difference between them, the big difference is height, physical presence and ability to shield the ball.

You can also check out the number of points we collect w/wo Carrick, he is instrumental to us.

If we go for Hummels in the summer I sure hope that we can find a DM who is rapid.

3660~~~
I guess you werent reading the caf at the time. Carrick's first season he just did a job while Scholes was the mastermind.

3661~~~
I don't think that he would have made a shred of difference. We're talking about Carrick here, people, not Lionel fecking Messi.

3662~~~
What are you on about? So we should blame Carrick for getting injured in a game that we were winning 4-1 and going off the pitch?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3663~~~
If he is that important to us it is purely psychological. If future selection processes go by form and ability rather than name then Carrick will be phased out and Blind will ease into the gap left by him. He is already proving to be the perfect replacement for him, and at that price we can't complain.

3664~~~
No, but maybe for not alerting anyone about it and completely throwing us off focus. He could have at least told someone what he was going to do. It alludes to complacency, and that is a theme that has often been present in his game this season.

3665~~~
And I would just about agree with you. The funny thing is that Blind wins a decent amount of headers so height isnt an issue. In fact he wins more than any of the players we've used in midfield this season bar Fellaini. Carrick is slightly better at shielding the ball


Confirmation bias. We also got plenty of points with Valencia in the team, it doesn't make him a good right back. You also need to look at whats happening around the players and the team.

Blind had to play in CM with Di Maria who does no defending. Carrick gets to play with everyone fit and Ander and Fellaini winning the ball a lot in front of him.

Why? Who are these rapid DMs who've been top class?

All of the good ones have lacked for pace and made up for it in other areas.

3666~~~
Wait... Do you seriously think Carrick just walked off the pitch without telling anyone?! 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3667~~~
This place is nuts, 95% of people here are unable to form an opinion of a player based on anything other than the last 2 games.

3668~~~
He hardly made it obvious, didn't you see the reaction?

3669~~~
Not really. 

The one glaring weakness Blind has him constantly getting caught behind the ball. That is inexcusable for a DM. And it's been obvious throughout the season not just this game.

3670~~~
Time will tell. I'm not convinced at all, but Blind is having a good first season with us and he is a steal at 15m and a good left back.

FYI. I was also proven wrong on Carrick, I never thought he would turn out to be a great player for us.

3671~~~
Some people here are just insane,cant wait to throw players under the bus after game or two,then after one of those players has a great game next week,they lick his hole between cheeks by saying things how they want his babies,or how his hair is great etc. Just make your freaking mind are they shit or what!

3672~~~
Yep, I saw Rooney go deeper and us got to 4-4-1. We all applauded the feckin' bloke off the pitch. Do you seriously think that our players didn't realise he went off?!

What do you want him to do? Get the ref to stop the play, get on the tannoy and make a public service announcement!?

Also, it didn't even remotely lead to any form of collapse.

3673~~~
Because he presses high for a dm? Particularly in comparison to Carrick. Sure the ball gets overturned sometimes but it's  the reason he intercepts/tackles almost double the amount and has more interceptions in the oppositions half  than any other player in Europes top 5 leagues. It's put us on the front foot plenty this season and helped us keep possession high up the pitch.

3674~~~
Trust me, Blind is Carrick Mk. 2. He will go through a period of people highlighting his every mistake because he isn't someone else. Carrick wasn't Scholes, Blind isn't Carrick. Then he'll really come into his stride and people will continue to under appreciate him, until the penny finally drops. If course, that'll be too late and by the time people actually come round to the idea that he is a good player he'll have peaked and will probably get worse. Unfortunately, Blind's replacement will probably go through the same.

3675~~~
I didn't say it lead to a collapse. I said it could have done. Maybe it was a problem with our overall communication, but like it or not we played worse when he went off. I've also seen players play on with worse, and this is the guy who is being made out to be the world's strongest player.

3676~~~
Carrick can put us on the front foot as well without compromising the defensive side of things. If Blind's reckless pressing leads to us getting caught out defensively (and it's happened a number of times this season) then it needs to be cut out. I

3677~~~
are you talking about Blind, because I didn't see any of that today. if you weren't then apologies.

like someone else said, if he does so well up the pitch, but we look in shambles on the counter, then maybe he should rethink that approach. It's not helping.

3678~~~
This is mind boggling dumb, I don't even know where to start...  we were 4-1 up, with 5 minutes to go. That's about as secure as you're gonna get. A collapse was not on the cards, at all... be reasonable for feck sake.

We played worse without him on the pitch because you know... we had 10 men... and he's one of our best players (but then you're saying he isn't?) but it was for 5 sodding minutes, he was fine to go off the pitch. Also, he picked up a serious knock, a knock that has kept him out for two weeks...  so safe to say he was injured and I'm glad, in a game that we had wrapped up, he came off the pitch... to insinuate that he shouldn't have come off the pitch, or that he was selfish for doing so, or to criticise him for it in anyway, is both insulting, and one of the stupidest things I've seen on this forum for quite sometime.

3679~~~
Herrerra adjusted just fine, and Carrick was not the next Scholes but the next Keane..but I get what you are saying.

I bet Blind doesn't get played in CDM again this season?

3680~~~
That's a natural risk of pressing it doesnt make it reckless. It's always about risk vs reward. The reward has been generally very positive for us with a handful of exceptions.

Already admitted to not having seen  the game today so making no points about specific situations or defending his performance. I'm just commenting on what he's done over the season and pointing out that Carrick has had tons of performances over the years which has produced similar criticisms.

3681~~~
I think he wanted Carrick to sprint and chase down the ball, stop the play, signal to the bench that his injured and ask for instructions about formation should he leave.

3682~~~
The City game wasn't really the main point of my argument anyway. I'm not sure why the focus has changed to that. Basically, I am 100% invested in the idea that Blind is a lot better than Carrick, and I'm definitely much happier with him on the pitch. I think in the long run people will conform to this, in the same way that they have done to Carrick.

3683~~~
His problem is that he doesnn't "sit", if that makes any sense. If he sits more, the midfield would be more secure, he has this habit of getting sucked in, eager to press and put in a challenge and when he doesn't win it, we're exposed. He's going to get better, and stop this silly comparism, Carrick was not as good as he is now when he first came to United, you develop certain aspects of your game through experience. Patience.

3684~~~
It is reckless when you constantly get caught out though. He's supposed to be shielding the defense not getting lost behind the ball. The negatives easily outweigh the few positives. We look far better with Carrick in the team and that's not a coincidence imo.

3685~~~
Blind needs a second sitting midfielder to get the best out of him as a midfielder, so that he's free to push forward and not be entirely responsible for shielding the back line.

The more intersting question is whether Blind is better as a left back or in midfield.

3686~~~
My vote is left back although I would like to see him pushed forward where Fellaini plays.  Try a mini Barca-like line-up.  Would be interesting to see many smart technically gifted players sharing the ball.

3687~~~
Left back for me. 

Though I wonder how he'd do if he played instead of Fellaini.

3688~~~
Agreed. He can play in a 4-2-3-1 sort of system next to another deep lying player (like Carrick) but at the moment he lacks the discipline to be THE holding player in a 4-3-3.

Still maybe it is something he will develop over time. As things stand though, I feel that finding a suitable Carrick replacement is a priority, which would relegate Blind to a backup LB/CM

3689~~~
We look better with Carrick but I think there's  a fair few factors involved which shouldn't  be insurmountable to Blind. And with Carricks age and injury issues to disregard Blind would be silly, especially since he has done well as an understudy on the whole. He's still young, in a new team, in a new league, hit with injuries, playing multiple roles in multiple systems and is definitely looking tired which seems to have taken some toll. Why does this apply to Sanchez, Di Maria, Fabregas but not Blind? Remember, he played a lot in an incredibly demanding role at the WC equalling that of finalists.

He doesn't have the authority or presense of Carrick, he doesn't receive the same level of trust from team mates or respect from opposition. That's something that can come though, no one starts with it. Hell, Carrick lacked those just last season!

He's playing a high press game in a system with no cover for when they overrun. Sitting back, waiting and covering those channels is less risk averse, which is why Carrick has looked more comfortable and less dangerous. He just needs to pick his moments, or more, choose his teams better. He's got more interceptions in the oppositions half than any other player in Europe's top 5 league - that should tell you how good he is at it, along with his high tackling rate. It's just a case of finding the balance in our system (so there's a little more cover for it, else we just accept the natural risk) and doing it against the right opposition.

His more disciplined and cautious passing is far more a demonstration of his Ajax training than a question of quality. He's played some magnificent balls but looks to far less often. He chooses to rotate quickly through one touch passing because that's how it's always been for him, and likely what Van Gaal wants from him (he can ask Blind for different things than Carrick, despite playing the same position). Similarly on the high pressing - it's his natural habit to do so, there's no reason to think he couldn't sit a bit deeper and cover channels when required.

His footballing intelligence is massive. The German team who won last years World Cup used him as a case study for their defending through the knockout stages and into the final. A handful of poor games aside he has been one of a very few constants in a United team struggling for any semblance of long term consistency - and he's done it against the odds (new team, league, systems etc. mentioned earlier). His capacity to learn seems huge when you consider it all. Take away that new league naivety, give him a proper rest and with time I expect to see more freedom of expression in his passing and a more pragmatic approach in his defending choices (high press/deep sit).

No, he's not Carrick. But 24 year old Carrick is a far different animal to the beast we have seen lately. All the same stuff was thrown at Carrick before.. infact, Carrick was essentially the Tom Cleverley before Tom Cleverley in that regard. He was the personification that United fans had for 'not good enough' and 'passenger'. 

Footballs a thinking mans game. Don't discount Blind. He could be absolutely massive for us yet.

3690~~~
He's definitely better at left back.

3691~~~
His roles for next season should be a fight with Shaw for the left-back spot and 3rd choice as defensive midfielder.

3692~~~
He presses much more than Carrick which leaves us light at times, he was poor today, still prefer him at LB to Shaw mind.

3693~~~
Still think he's a great signing. Personally I don't think he was fully fit today and was also out of 'match rhythm' for want of a better phrase. He's bloody useful and people in the match thread before the game started where whooping he was back. Didn't play well...but then again a number of our players didn't. But with Blind, I never think it's lack of motivation.

3694~~~
Agree with you here. People are writing him off way too early. He has had a couple poor games in midfield but he has also had some great ones. Sure Carrick has had some poor games himself.

3695~~~
Despite everything you say he's been pretty poor in a lot of our away games this season and it would be a big risk to go into next season with Carrick and Blind as the only two defensive midfielders. Our season should depend on whether Carrick will get injured or not. 

Also I'm not sure about that Carrick thing. I've read the Cafe since around the time he was signed and I remember the initial disappointment over how Chelsea got Ballack and we got some random player for Spurs but it didn't take him long to become a well respected player among the fans. The abuse only really started when he had that massive drop in form one year (not sure when...2011 or 2012?). Plus his struggles against Barcelona in the two finals but that was just frustration from getting outclassed.

I don't ever remember him being 'the personification that United fans had for 'not good enough' and 'passenger' apart from maybe a couple of idiots. He was never the Tom Cleverly, that guy inspired an astounding amount of hatred.

3696~~~
Agreed. He had some very good games in midfield earlier in the season, up until he got slotted in at LB.

Poor today, but on here as of late, it seems to be that a player is only as good as his most recent performance. Unfortunately, that means our entire squad is shit, De Gea included. Doomed.

3697~~~
I never disagreed. I'm absolutely expecting us to get another midfielder in, one who can play a deeper role. 

Well, I wasn't particularly referencing the Cafe but that was the general take on it I always had. It wasn't just the fans either, our 'no midfield' line was peddled around for a good few years and it was always seen as a weakness. That wasn't a 'excluding Carrick' thing either, but 'including' for sure. He just wasn't rated anywhere near as highly as now, and it never felt like he had many backers. 

I'll openly admit to thinking he wasn't quite 'enough' and that we could do better, and I use to think of myself as somewhat of a Carrick fan in comparison to most. I think it's fair he wasn't either, I still don't think it was till Scholes left that he really started to show what he could do. Not that he didn't have some good spells alongside Scholes/Fletcher but not what we've come to expect now.

3698~~~
Most of the people in real life who didn't rate Carrick when we were winning the league every year were mostly opposition fans who never even watched us that much. The ones who now call Smalling a clumsy shit defender. 

The no midfield thing was more down to the fact that we had the likes of Carrick (with his one poor year around that time), Cleverly, Anderson, diseased fletcher, a brought back from retirement scholes and all sorts of nonsense for years as our midfield options. Carrick was our only real midfield option for a few years and I don't really think people really had Carrick as the biggest problem that needed to be addressed in that area of the team. 

Carrick was well good in his first two years at United from what I remember. Although I think you are correct in how his passing wasn't appreciated as much until Scholes had gone. He was probably playing it more safe in the early years I guess.

3699~~~
He most definitely was. His passing was far more cautious, and getting overrun and looking somewhat passive became a trait of his. He wasn't having anywhere near the influence on the team, he was leaving all that up to Scholes. And when Scholes wasn't around - we noticed. Look at the difference that was made when Scholes came back out of retirement for that push for the title (that City won I know)? The difference was huge and the thought process was similar to now 'Carrick clearly isn't the man to replace Scholes' etc.

And no, you're right, I'm not saying he was our biggest problem, but he was seen as replaceable and dispensable for the most part and there were definitely plenty of groans about him. I'm not sure even his biggest fans were convinced he could be nearly as integral as he has become to us.

3700~~~
The one big difference between Carrick and Blind is I think Carrick used to demonstrate his excellent passing range quite a lot at Tottenham. I'm sure I read somewhere that Blind wasn't that kind of player at Ajax and was more a pass and move kind of guy. I will be very surprised if he becomes a regular first team player at United. I see him more of a very good utility man right now.

3701~~~
Who was it that said Blind would get into most teams? He wouldn't even get into Evertons if he's used as a midfielder, nowhere near good enough to replace Carrick which is why we need 2 midfielders in the summer because Carricks injury problems are concerning.

He's a really good left back and that is where he should be used. He can probably play midfield if Carrick is next to him but not on his own.

3702~~~
Looks a better lb than dm, passes the ball sideways too much and doesn't have carrick's range of passing and has a negative impact on the whole team, it's not his fault he just isn't quite good enough to be a regular. He will be a very good squad player for us though and no shame in that.

3703~~~
To be honest, I think he was brought in as a reliable squad player, someone LVG knew and trusted to do certain things. And mainly he has delivered. He's not what we want as a regular, but he's bloody useful, rather like Butt was, or Phil Neville. Neither were the tops, but they were the foundation of a great team when it came to relying on someone asked to do a job they were told to.

3704~~~
Can't say i disagree with any of this. I'd pick Shaw ahead of Blind at left back. As a midfielder, he doesn't have Carrick's range of passing; doesn't hold up play well enough; and doesn't have the pace to compensate for the other deficiencies

3705~~~
Against decent/half decent opposition him DM just worries the hell out of me, I would have rather LvG dropped Herrera back into that position , and put Di Maria in Herrera's position, I know if we'd have lost he would have been slated for it but it would have been a better bet.

I can only hope and pray that Carrick is back for the West Brom game, because if I see Blind as the DM I'd be concerned.

To come off the bench in that position fine, LB fine, but beyond that no.

3706~~~
Nowhere near good enough to be a DM for this club. He should be a squad player and back up for the LB position and nothing more.

3707~~~
Midfield easily for me

3708~~~
Blind plus another sitting midfielder, I couldn't think of anything worse.

3709~~~
Some very obvious weaknesses in us game (physicality etc), however, what was worrying today was he was badly out of position repeatedly - which is meant to be his strength. 

Far too deep when the centre backs had the ball and far too high up the pitch when we lost the ball. Extremely poor today.

3710~~~
Why do people jump on his so hard every time he has a poor game?

3711~~~
He's had a fine season and simply needs to work on his positional sense. Hopefully he works with carrick on that and improves in this aspect.

3712~~~
Yes, Carrick can lack pace and strength at times. Those, along with the occasional lack of balls, are pretty much his only weaknesses.

So the fact that Blind is actually weaker than Carrick in Carrick's two biggest weaknesses, while not being as good as Carrick at pretty much anything else, is not a good sign.

I do like Blind and he did surprise me with just how well he did at leftback. But I really can't see him ever being more than a squad player for us.

3713~~~
His lack of mobility and physically was sorely exposed today. 

He's fantastic in home games, with plenty of time and space to dictate play, but in these kind of hustle and bustle away games, he's got a lot to learn.

3714~~~
I don't think I would be opposed to him playing where Fellaini does on occasion, feel he might be better suited there.

3715~~~
My word this thread is som
They are jealous of his looks. 
Agree
Agree

3716~~~
The knees, they are a jerkin'.

3717~~~
I agree with Herrera, he's simply more talented and better almost in every aspect of the game, he could be playing that really good if we asked him to do, problem is whether there is a player who could replace him as no8. Di Maria in poor form could imbalance midfield as no one, I'd want Blind in midfield next week again to prove himself (we have no other option imo) if Carrick's out. He also might not have been 100% fit. Long term he's squad player, that was sure from the day one but just because we didn't have a competent midfielder for years everyone thought he's Pirlo/Modric. And I think he as a squad player would still be better as DLP than LB, He just had a good run of games there as he had in midfield before.

BTW I love this place how people change opinions, when Carrick played shit for some time it was all, Carrick for squad played and Blind for the starter, now it's opposite and it will change again I guess until we buy world class DM who will kick their ass, For me personally it was never between the two, both players capable of good performances, Carrick's been little better this season as he used his intelligence and experience but none of them should be a starting option as no6 next season.

We are defensively exposed with Carrick as well, he's just a little better passer than Blind. I not being really fan of Blind still think he could emulate Carrick to some extent to be a kind of consistent squad player who can do the job if we need this player in the future. But we should really aim higher

3718~~~
Great player who had a bad game today. He isn't a quick player, of course. Nevertheless, he's quite skilled and I think he should be important for us in the years to come.

3719~~~
Watch the same people praising him when he has a good game and calling him our best signing. I've stopped paying attention to a lot of things on this place.

3720~~~
I thought he was just OK today. Doesn't help when the players in front of you are garbage on the ball and aren't making your job any easier. He was under a lot of pressure today.

3721~~~
Have like him this season - but was an absolute disaster today.

3722~~~
This. Way too much overreaction in here.

3723~~~
Back up for LB. I don't think so mate, just because Shaw has bit of pace doesn't make him a better player in that position. Blind is much more at home with that role and anticipates danger far more quicker than Shaw ever does. If it wasn't for the injuries, he would still be playing at LB.

3724~~~
Well if he played crap then people are going to come in here and say he played crap, just like when he plays well then people will praise him for playing well.

3725~~~
I love how people are suggesting this is some new phenomenon, many of us have been saying for ages that he's a good squad player to have but not Carrick's successor, today just highlighted the points many have made for some time now.

3726~~~
He'd have looked better if he had Jones or Rojo behind him. He cannot shepherd an out of his depth McNair in defense.

3727~~~
He's not good enough, sometimes its that simple. These long drawn out arguments sometimes aren't needed. The guy can't defend in midfield, he's weak and slow, has average reading of the game, is even worse positionally and his right foot is a standing leg. Carrick basically has him beat in every category and he's no sensation himself.

3728~~~
I wasn't criticising Blinds performances at left back. I actually think he and Shaw are pretty evenly matched in that position in terms of how good they are despite them being very different players. The point I was really trying to make was that I don't think he should be playing in midfield and he should be a squad player rather than first choice most of the time. He is a decent LB and he is a less than decent DM IMO.

3729~~~
Nonsensical post.

3730~~~
I would say harsh, don't think it was nonsensical. Blind is a good back-up player, but don't think he is a starter for a side aiming for top honors. He doesn't have any exceptional attributes, and is basically good to decent in everything he does.

3731~~~
There's simply no way he's "not good enough". He comfortably good enough. The likes of oshea did a great job for us for years. Blind is miles better than him. Heck, Valencia and Young have spent years at this club.  Just goes to show how fickle people are when a month or so back he was being called one of our players of the season by many here.

As for the nothing exceptional part, I'm not sure how many players we have that are truly exceptional at one thing. Jones, for example, is hailed as some next great or something, but he has no single exceptional attribute right now other than I guess, bravery. He's good at defending and pretty good at other things. Fellaini has chest control but that's it. Valencia and Young are exceptional at nothing. Rojo hasn't shown what he's exceptional at.

Blind is a good footballer, that much is obvious. And those tend to be good enough, at least talent wise for most clubs. After its up to him to perform week in week out. He's got very good technique, he is intelligent and has a good pass on him. Needs to work on some areas to be the kind of starter everyone wants in our midfield. But saying he's simply not good enough is a bit rubbish really.

3732~~~
He is good enough for the squad I believe but not as a Carrick replacement at least not at the moment. He has a good passing range/accuracy, good tackling and not so good pace but I think he can vastly improve if he tweaks a couple of things. His passing is too conservative going forward needs to work on that as well as his positioning off the ball. I think he can tackle quite decently as is but again just needs to pick his moments more intelligently.

3733~~~
Fair enough. We signed him for some 12 million or so as a versatile player who can play a number of roles, each well. I don't disagree that he doesn't look like  that top midfielder we all want running the show, but I don't think anyone even expected it? He was always someone who was brought it to bring versatility, a good all round game, and the ability to play different roles well. So far he's done just that. Whether he can reach another level and be that midfielder I mentioned above is doubtful but not an issue.

3734~~~
Totally agree with you on everything I wasnt expecting Blind to come in and be a maestro in midfield especially after seeing him at the world cup. I do think he can really step up though hes 25 with time to improve.

3735~~~
It showed that he's not the replacement for Carrick. Probably a better LB than midfielder

3736~~~
He is blaming him because he thinks we wouldn't conceede if he stayed on. Great stuff.  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3737~~~
Agree with that. Blind is yong and lernin and doing really well for his first season. But his defensive positioning and anticipation isn't a patch on Carrick's. 

He chases the ball too much. Good for his defensive stats but ruins our shape and often leaves him stranded upfield. A problem that's compounded when he's partnered with a similarly over-eager player like Hererra. Against really crap opposition it can be overwhelming but any quality side will absorb the pressure and pick us off, as we've seen plenty of times this season. The wide open spaces in our midfield yesterday were shocking to see. 

Seems a smart player, though, so I'm sure he'll get the hang of it eventually.

3738~~~
DM is a hard position to play, and chucking him in there when he's returning from injury, against what turned out to be quite a dynamic midfield (McCarthy and Barkley), was suicide in hindsight. Positionally he was really bad, but even on the ball he was very weak, he made very few incisive passes and didn't always make himself available to receive the ball when teammates had it (especially when coming out of defence, which Carrick always does). It was a very poor performance by him, but he can be much better in that position when he has a bit of continuity of games and has found his bearings. Still, even at his best not a patch on Carrick, the game yesterday once again reflecting how dependent we are on Carrick in midfield to get everything ticking.

3739~~~
I noticed this too, at first I thought it was possible due to Barkley man marking him, but then he never really had to move much to evade him and get some space, so not sure what it was. He certainly was looking for the ball a lot less than usual yesterday at any rate.

3740~~~
Yep there were a couple of instances where Barkley wasn't even sitting on him but just cutting off the supply line where Blind didn't make any effort to get himself into a receiving position. This wasn't the case in that run of games he played in the position a few months back, he seemed like he was shying away from the game or was just not fit to do those repeated efforts (cos that position requires huge stamina to always be moving).

3741~~~
And that's why as one of the 4 biggest clubs in world football, somehow we have spent a season without CL football. This whole settling for mediocrity needs to come to an end. You don't justify mediocrity by listing other mediocrity and then say see, he's not that bad, look at how they are/were.

I'd honestly prefer if we spent no money on squad players. Get them from the academy. Why sign blind when we have pearson coming through? Why keep him? He'll never be starter material. 

Good technique and intelligence isn't enough for a united midfielder. That's why we ought not to have the likes of guthrie and vernon anita here, they also have good technique and intelligence. He has to be much much more or he's going to hurt the team.

3742~~~
On another note McCarthy I thought had another promising display. Reminds me so much of Fletcher.

3743~~~
What I'm saying is that you know how to judge a footballer and don't even know what mediocrity means.

You also seem to not understand how a squad works either.

Madrid have illaramendi and young Lucas silva among their central midfielders, Arbaloa as a fulback, and Hernandez who we didn't want among their strikers. Not to mention contrao as a fullback who is nothing great either.

Barcelona have Matheu in defence, pedro as a forward and many other players who aren't exceptional.

I'd like to know which team around has no players of Daley blinds ability.

3744~~~
Like wise tho they have 5-6 world class players starting everygame thats even with injuries. We have 5-6 squad players finding themselves in the starting 11 every week!

3745~~~
Yes, which means we have to add more top notch players and not get rid of the ones that can play an effective role in the future without being among the very best. We're very very light in midfield. We need to add a couple rather than replace players.

3746~~~
Best CM on the pitch, by a margin. No surprise that Everton's season has coincided with his return to match fitness. I would be very happy if he came to United.

3747~~~
Me to. He can play 6 or 8 I imagine as well? Thats the type of man who would benefit from afew years learning from Carrick the other side of the game. He would not come cheap but he has more energy in his game over Schneiderlin he's a real box to box man.

3748~~~
People saying he's not good enough for the squad are forgetting just how bad our midfield choices have been for a few seasons now. We've essentially replaced Cleverley and Fletcher (the post-illness one, he was excellent before) with Herrera and Blind, and our options are much better for it. 

Yes, we're still light in both bodies and first choice quality in CM; we need a bona fide starter with some degree of physicality that can play #6 and #8. Once we get this player, our midfield options will look nicely balanced, especially if we can either bring through one of the youngsters or integrate Di Maria as an advanced CM. 

As for Blind himself, my reaction in the matchday thread was that he lacks the physicality to play the DM role in these tough away matches, especially when we're playing an inexperienced CB and Valencia at RB. But he's more than good enough to play there in easier matches against less physical midfield opposition; he's also a very good option at LB and he has the ability to play as a more balanced CM too, in my opinion.

3749~~~
He'll go down as one of the best utility players we've ever bought its just a bad day at the office for the entire team and someone has to take the blame.

3750~~~
I thought he looked like a player who'd just come back from injury. That said, our key midfield pairing Blind/Herrera reminded me of how awkward they looked together earlier in the season and that bothers me, because I'm having a hard time remembering them playing the 6/8 roles well together.

Of course the missing element in all of this is that we don't know what happens away from the 90 minutes. What instructions does Blind get when he partners Herrera? If it's "play like Carrick" then he's no good at it, but maybe those aren't the LvG rules.

Also we've heard that LvG thought that the team were off, even during the warm-up. Again we don't know why. We jump to explanations about over-confidence, but for all we know it could have been anything from food poisoning to the team bus running over Valencia's dog. Anyway, Blind, not his best game yesterday, but that was true for the whole team.

3751~~~
Mediocre means average, please don't insult my english like that. 

We don't have the luxury of having such players cause what we do have all round isn't all that great. Blind probably has more than quadruple the amounts of minutes than either of those madrid players listed. Matheu and Pedro are of a higher standard than Blind. 

We, given the limited strength of our squad have no business investing money in the likes of blind. He's a midtable player.

3752~~~
Massive overreaction to a poor game. Carrick's had his share of nightmare games for us as well, most players have. Blind is a good player.

3753~~~
Hes been one of our better players this season, had a poor game but seems everyone has gone totally bonkers

3754~~~
Yes, I find that people are very bipolar regarding Blind here. Either they like him and defend him a lot or find him completely inadequate and slate him at every given opportunity because he cannot possibly be good enough for United because 1) he came from Eredivisie, 2) he's not PL proven, 3) he just can't. I'm probably in the former camp, I just like him a lot and think he's a good player on so many levels, not top class quality but easily good enough to be kept for a good amount of time and prove himself a useful member of the team.

3755~~~
Haven't been a fan all season so its incorrect to say its a massive overreaction to yesterdays game, just yesterday highlighted his deficiencies even more.

3756~~~
Even when he was consistently one of the best players on the pitch for us? He's really not done much wrong this season to be dismissed even as a squad player. I understand how people might not see a first team regular in him but to reject any possibility of him being a good squad player for us is ludicrous, he's been in top 3 performers for us in plenty games this season.

3757~~~
He was being raved about as one of our best signings of the season before Christmas, playing at the base of the diamond and playing well. Enormously positive response in the matchday thread when it was confirmed he was starting in midfield. One poor game, where just about everyone bar Smalling was pretty awful, and Blind's now shit and should never play in midfield.

Reputations are constantly on a knife's edge around here. Lets hope he doesn't have two poor games in a row, or he'll be getting bullets in the post.

3758~~~
One of our best performers this season (his first season in English football no less). Has a poor match on his return from injury and suddenly he's a midtable player. Unbelievable Jeff.

3759~~~
If he doesn't score against West Brom I hope he ends up in League One, the absolutely despiseful cnut of a footballer.

3760~~~
Some poster had an opinion of him when he came and wont change it, every time he has a bad game they think they're right.
He's a good player to have and to say - he's a midtable player- like it was said above is.. well overreaction as Sarni said, to say the least. 

One poor game and all hell breaks loose - and we have posts like - he's not at a level United should aspire to and similar shit.

3761~~~
Exactly, it's often like that particularly with players who come from weak leagues. It's like they can never become any good. Hell, even if he had a shocker of a season I don't see how anyone could possibly write him off already, he's been here 8 months and was generally one of the best and most intelligent players in the league during his Ajax days which shows his potential. As things stand he's had a very good first season with a few bad performances, promise is certainly high.

3762~~~
Just realised I qouted you and wrote - as Sarni said. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3763~~~
It's better for the English to be bad than the opinion.

Completely off the mark with the bolted bit. We have to have such players so you might as well get used to it, whether it is blind or someone else. We've had them when we were winning trebles and we've had them during the droughts.

3764~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> He's becoming the fall guy who can't replace Carrick just as Carrick used to be the fall guy who can't replace Keane, then Scholes. In truth, they are 4 players with different individual qualities.

3765~~~
I don't think he's been too good as a DM throughout, not just this game. Of course, dismissing him a squad player is bit OTT but I don't think he's been anywhere near as impressive in the middle as has been made out. The problems exhibited in this game have been apparent in other games as well albeit it probably hasn't cost us too much courtesy De Gea.

Very good at LB though.

3766~~~
Blind has had some very good games in central midfield, along with some poor ones. As with all new signings, people cut him slack in his first few games so some not so good displays were glossed over. Of course, now he's had some duff games in that position the opposite is happening. People are ignoring the good performances from earlier in the season.

At the end of the day, central midfield is probably the position that takes the most adjusting to. You need to be constantly able to predict where every one of your team-mates will move next and that takes time to learn. So it stands to reason that he'll adapt quicker at LB than he will at CM. He has had some poor games at LB too, by the way. Especially in the FA Cup.

3767~~~
Most of his good games were against poor sides who let us dominate them. He never stood out and controlled a game in midfield. Games where teams have came at us and tried to dominate play in the midfield, he's struggled in that #6 role.

He's a neat and tidy player, but I really don't see being good enough to be a top class #6. I actually think he'd be far better as one of the #8s.

3768~~~
Agree. He suits that role hell of a lot more although Herrera is the better player.

3769~~~
He's definitely been a lot better in CM than Carrick was in his first season. He's had a few games where he didnt quite do the business, but has clearly been among our best midfielders this season.

One game and the knee jerkers cant remember all the matches where he outperformed almost all his teammates, or the games where he gained us points with a couple of late goals

3770~~~
Well that is not even remotely true.

3771~~~
Yes of course, someone has to pretend he was Messi when really he Cleverley'd that season

3772~~~
What?

Carrick only had a few awful games that season the stand out being the 3-0 loss to Milan at the San Siro. He was pulling strings in a team that won the league playing some great football.

3773~~~
It was a bad time for him to come back from injury just as the whole team seems to be a little bit physically and mentally jaded after being at a high level for the last 6 weeks or so (and big pressure and injury the whole season too) It was possibly a slight complacent comedown after the big Chelsea game and in Blinds defence he has said how hard and tiring he has found his first season in the Prem, then he gets this jaded game as his return. I think this loss will show the manager that it was a fatigue issue for the team and Blind will improve as he gets fully fit again. I honestly think we will see the best of Blind next season as he fully adjusts to the premier league fitness demands and naturally improves as he is only 25.

Blind will be okay, it's Carrick and a similar replacement that's looking as important if not more so than even keeping Dave the Gea

3774~~~
Yeah I can see you werent watching or reading this place at the time.

Carrick was Scholes' sidekick, he did a decent job defensively and sideways passed to Scholes for him to "pull the strings" all game. You're thinking of last season where Carrick showed character and was the main man. Not his first season where he was the 11th man.

3775~~~
He's struggled away from home all season in midfield. It seems like he needs the space that most games at Old Trafford usually provides and struggles when opposition is in his face.

3776~~~
So exactly what Blind has been doing all season? Passing it sideways and being called "Intelligent".

3777~~~
Certainly has more claim to "intelligent" than you, if you havent seen his passes into the players between the opposition's defence and midfield.

He's had a couple of performances where his passing has been a bit off unfortunately, but no more than others. Also funnily enough he has played more passes that led to shots from the receiving player than Carrick has. Carrick has played by far the least of those passes than any of our other players used in midfield this season

3778~~~
I agree. I said it yesterday on the thread about replacing Carrick, it's not about finding another player with the same qualities because that is next to impossible to do. It's about evolving the team and finding players that can work in the absence of a Carrick type player.

3779~~~
Well we have won 70% of our matches with Carrick that is the biggest and most important statistic at the end of the day. Blind's best performances in midfield have come against relegation fodder at Old Trafford.

3780~~~
3 months ago in this thread there were posters praising Blind (rightly so) whilst at the same time bashing Carrick.

3781~~~
You're talking nonsense. Carrick was far and away better than Blind has been this season back is '06/07.

Also, the key passes stat is irrelevant. That's the stat you were using to point out how Baines was the most creative player in the league not long back. And Blind has had games at LB which helps and Carrick has had more games as a CB as well.

3782~~~
Carrick was poor under Moyes. In Fergie's final season he was majestic.

3783~~~
Weird isn't it. How opinions can swing so widely after one game. Anyway good thing the manager is more objective ey

3784~~~
And now the same posters are bashing Blind and praising Carrick?

3785~~~
This isn't true.

3786~~~
Yes my bad, the 20% stat is wrong.

3787~~~
Exactly. I can believe the 70% but the other stat has to be in 40% - 50%.

3788~~~
Think we've won 7 games without him and we've played 34 - so it is 20.5% of games won when Carrick doesn't play.

EDIT - My bad, it's 8, so it's 23.5% - actually I'm doing the wrong math... it's 8 games from 20 he hasn't played, so like, 40%

3789~~~
Yes but there hasn't been 34 games played without him, so the maths is wrong a little. You have to only count the games he hasn't played.

3790~~~
Yeah I just realised that now, and edited accordingly. It is 40%.

3791~~~
And we've won a lot more matches with Valencia in the team than without him. He's still a poor starting right back

Give Blind all the exact same lineups as Carrick and then the win percentages might mean something

Carrick was missing when we had lots of new players trying to settle in a new club and played a different formation and lineup each week. He was missing when we were playing Di Maria in CM (who doesnt defend at all) and Rooney in CM with Falcao up front

Carrick was back for when we had our lineup mostly sorted out and new players had months to settle.

3792~~~
That fits for now, but doesn't explain the period before Christmas where Carrick was back and we won a load on the bounce. Also, Blind had more or less the exact same lineup as Carrick had yesterday...

3793~~~
You mean that period we were playing dogshite football whilst getting lucky wins (Arsenal Southampton etc), that was also the period we changed our style of play and reverted to 3-5-2 so those run of results were not specifically down to Carrick being in the team (although he did have a positive impact on the team)

3794~~~
Exactly - but at what point does it just become lucky circumstance and, actually because Carrick is really good at football? Of course they weren't specifically down to Carrick - but his presence in our side clearly matters.

3795~~~
There is no reason that Daley Blind still can't develop into a really useful player at United but in recent weeks I have started to worry about him slightly. The more I watch him the more I wonder about exactly what his stand out qualities are. He is comfortable on the ball without being able to make the kind of quick, incisive passes Herrera/Mata can. He has a reasonable range of passing but can't spray it 40-50 yards like a Carrick/Rooney/Scholes. He has managed a couple of goals and they have generally been match-saving goals, but he isn't a Lampard/Gerrard 20 goal a season man from midfield. He is tenacious and will fight to win the ball back but seems to lack a bit of size, strength and speed to be a top quality ball-winning midfielder in a physical league like the Premier League.

He certainly isn't a bad player and his versatility will help, but I feel he has to find his niche and really specialise in something to become a regular. I do remember when Carrick joined it took him a good two seasons too look convincing on a regular basis so I'm not writing him off just yet!

3796~~~
It's still his first season here if some of you have forgotten that. I still stand by my belief that he's a real gem of a player. Has similarities to Carrick and if we just sign the right midfielder we can find a great balance in the middle of the park with him and Herrera pulling the creative strings when Carrick's retired / aged too much / injured. Shaw can have the left back spot; he looks like he's the real deal though he's still raw. 

What we missed yesterday in midfield was someone as a stable platform from which to work from, and someone who deprives the opposition of passing lanes through intelligent positioning rather than headless chicken closing down tactics.  Carrick does those things brilliantly. Blind, IMHO, could be great as the platform, but we might need a box-to-boxer in the mould of Khedira who will add dynamism to the middle.

3797~~~
and four different levels.-)

3798~~~
Blind is a quality back up not a starting 11 player week in week out. Great attributes and clever but his lack of pace and at times caused by his reading/position gets exposed to much imo. Great addition squad wise but not a starter.

3799~~~
If the only change was Carrick being in the team then it would support your point more. The things was though that we also changed formation and approach completely. Saying that Carrick did have a positve influence, but his influence during that period was a little overplayed IMO. He had a few pretty poor games himself in that run.

3800~~~
For 1 game where Ander and Fellaini didnt play well, yes.

I'm just saying there are a lot of fortunate circumstances for Carrick's games compared to Blind or others filling in for him. They had to do so when we had a huge amount of injuries and chopping and changing. Carrick been selected when everyone is available and the team is settled

Thats why its a bit weird to be so hung up on win percentages. How can you compare the situations? Yes Carrick has been playing when we've played well and won points, but Blind hasn't had the same oppertunity to play in the same circumstances. His games came when nothing was sorted out and we had to pick the 11 players that were available. In those circumstances he barely ever let us down and was definitely among our best players

A single match and its forgotten

3801~~~
The run into the box and shot was quality, certainly not something you'd see Carrick doing. He could do more of that if we had better defensive stability behind him.

3802~~~
Also I guarantee that the people who keep posting Carrick's win percentages are the same people who were saying LVG shouldnt be judged too harshly during the first half of the season when we had terrible injuries and we were well off of where we should be given our investment in the summer.

Poor selections, formations, tactics and the rest were apparently unfair to count against LVG because he didnt have everyone fit and available, but Blind and whoever else not getting as many points as Carrick when they were playing during this time, thats their fault. Right?

3803~~~
So Carrick's only been playing when we don't have an injury crisis, yet Blind has only been playing when we do?

You're just making shit up now. Unless you mean that Carrick's never had to play when Carrick's been out injured? Because that's certainly true and there's very clear evidence that this particular injury crisis does have a significant negative effect on the team. So in a way he's lucky, right?

3804~~~
Carrick returned when most of the team returned. What a surprise that we win more often

3805~~~
I like him, very intelligent player. Yes he has struggled several times this season just like the team in general. It's still his first season and hopefully he'll improve even more. After Herrera, our best summer signing for me.

3806~~~
I also think he's had a pretty decent first season overall - the criticism of Blind after one bad game seems to have gone a bit OTT really. 
He's already proven to be a vital squad player and done well in several positions, whether he can push on to be a regular first XI pick remains to be seen but he has had several decent performances for us this season, including at DM.

3807~~~
That's the most measured conclusion I've seen in this thread so far. I'd go a bit further and say he's had several excellent performances. Hasn't cemented himself as a definite in the starting XI, but he's offered plenty of room for optimism that he's capable of doing so. First season in a much tougher league, in a transitioning team, and he's been one of our more consistent performers. Very well-rounded technically and tactically very good as well. I rate him very highly.

3808~~~
He's been very good - a few bad games and he's still lacking physically and pace-wise but for his first season he's done very, very well, especially for someone that nobody expected us to get before the world cup.

3809~~~
One of our best players this year. Any criticism wont be tolerated by me, unless you're interested in a barage of personal and OTT insults.

3810~~~
I think he's average. Come at me.

3811~~~
He's better than Arteta or Wilshere as DM......come at me.

3812~~~
People are definitely going over the top with criticism for him. He is just back from injury and he definitely looked like that, not that he was just poor, but he was very unlike himself too. Even when he is poor he shows quality pieces of play, and against Everton he showed nothing. And it's not like he never did good in Carrick's abscence, in one of his first games for us, against Chelsea at Old Trafford, he was probably one of our best players, if not the best, playing that same position. 

Those saying we can't win anything with players like him are overreacting, our team would be great if Blind was our biggest problem. Carrick is better player but people are making it out like he rarely has a bad game, and that's far from truth, he was very inconsistent this season for his standards too.

3813~~~

3814~~~
I don't see Blind future in our team as DM for me he is a much better LB. Along with Shaw I think we have 2 very good options in this position. One has good pace and the other reads the game exceptionally well and delivers 9 times out of 10 in the final 3rd.

3815~~~
More useful as LB, not good enough as DM for many reasons

He can play as DM only in a dutch league

3816~~~
Fabulous footballer, andheld the team together in the early part of the season, but has come in for some maybe harsh criticism given his overall contribution to the team. Technically one of the best in the team but his lack of pace and power count against him for him to be nailed on first choice in any position ( atm) He may become the ultimate squad player. Invaluable asset for sure.

3817~~~
he needs to work on his power and pace over the summer and he would make it as a box to box midfielder for us or as backup left back, because he has a good football brain and can pass, and puts in a tackle.  I just don't see him as the dm with a midfield of Herrera, Mata, Fellaini and Young. The position requires allot more than Blind has.

3818~~~
Most unfair criticism I've seen this season, the agenda's really are clear to be seen. I dont know why people forget that it's his first season generally has been good, is 25 and still has enough room to improve. When you play that stupid 4141, your DM will get caught out at times, another very naive line up imo. Everton's first goal, that was just very poor defending from the others too, dont know why he gets picked out. Has been fine all season during Carrick's absence, one bad game and he isnt good enough. If that's the way we judge players, only Carrick is good enough, as he is the only one who hasnt really had a bad game.

3819~~~
Still think he's a DM long term. He's had a couple of poor games but equally had long periods of looking brilliant. I really like him.

3820~~~
Blind played as DM in his youth before he broke trough as a leftback (and a very short spell at rightback). He's versatile in that he can cover for 4 positions: leftback (or wingback), DM, BTB and even CB - he's not the best at the latter 2 though because of his lack of physical traits. I believe he was vital for this season because he already knew van Gaal's style while the rest of the team was still learning, he was always available for a safe pass.

He's not as good as Carrick at dictating the play yet, but he's got all the traits to become as good. I think it's premature to write him off for DM, he's done pretty well considering it's only his first season. He's got a great long pass, although he doesn't use it as often yet. He's smart enough to read the game and position himself defensively - this way he makes up for his physicality. He's great for a possesion based team and he can put pressure on the opponent high up the pitch.

I think he will rotate with Carrick next season mostly, van Gaal said he bought him for midfield and that he's a fixed starter. I think it's better to buy a backup to Herrera who could play CDM when both Blind and Carrick are unavailable than buying a 3rd CDM. He can still be used elsewhere if it's needed.

3821~~~
What do you think of the Gundogan rumours Max? If we get him do you reckon that;ll be that, or do you think LVG will buy Gundogan + another defensive minded midfielder, for the 'balance'.

3822~~~
But he was doing it very well earlier in the season, and that was in a midfield with Di Maria, who does little to no defending. He's had one poor game as a DM, and the whole team was pretty shit against Everton to be fair to Blind, bar Smalling.

Having a quick scan at the threadmarks for games before Christmas, and he was being called "our best new signing" whilst playing at the base of the diamond and got a good run of games there. I have plenty of faith he has enough about him to make it there. He's most definitely had more good performances than bad, IMO.

3823~~~
I find it quite funny how he started off the season well and large amounts of people were saying he was better than Carrick and he can't play LB because he is too slow and weak. Plays a few good matches at LB and a couple poor ones in midfield and now he is a great LB and isn't good enough to even be Carrick's backup because he is too slow and weak. Some people just completely change opinions on players based on one game.

3824~~~
Gundogan is a typical van Gaal player, I wouldn't be surprised at all if he gets him. I don't know that much about him but he would probably be backup to Herrera at 8 (we've got none bar Rooney) - maybe he's suited for 6 or 10 but I wouldn't know, from what I've seen he's not a 6. I also think Herrera now is deemed good enough as defensive player.

For his defensive balance, it will depend on lots of things: does he want Mata in midfield? Does he fancy a CDM youngster? Are Carrick and Blind, with the occasional Herrera (Gundogan?) good enough for him at 6? What will happen to Januzaj/Pereira (midfield or wing)? Does he want Rooney at 10?

If Gundogan can indeed play at 6 for van Gaal and bring balance, he'd be a perfect buy in my eyes and probably the only one. If not, and he doesn't fancy a youngster/Rooney in midfield either, or wants Mata in there he'd probably bring in another one. He likes smaller squads though, and with Gundogan we'd have 5 midfielders + Mata, Rooney, Pereira and maybe even Januzaj already.

I think van Gaal currently sees Blind as succesor to Carrick, so buying a big name replacement for Carrick whilst Blind has done relatively well and is still here probably isn't going to happen. He's currently a fixed starter so to relegate him to 3rd- CDM / 2nd- LB / 6th- CB / 3rd choice BTB player after a season he's done well in seems unlogical to me. It makes more sense in my eyes to buy a 2nd BTB who's 3rd choice CDM, if this is Gundogan then why not?

3825~~~
yeah funny isn't it?

I don't personally rate him highly since day one, I actually rate him higher then before he came here as I'd seen him on numerous occasion for national team and I thought he's completely average but now I believe he can be decent back-up option in the future for us judging by his performances in his first season. He had a BIG advantage by knowing manager and his philosophy so it will be interesting to see if he can push on and get better..

I hope he can somehow emulate Carrick in the future, at the same time I think we should definitely buy a player of higher calibre to the team covering no6 and no8 position being a starter ahead of him or at least making a good competiton with him and ageing carrick..

And I am definitely for him to start next game as CDM, I think he will do better as the whole team which under performed, it was coming anyway and Carrick wouldn't probably do much better IMHO.

3826~~~
I like him, I think he uses the ball intelligently and reads the game well. He has a great range of passing too. But I definitely feel his best position is left back or on the left of a midfield 3. I don't have any faith in him starting at the base of midfield. One of his best assets is his diagonal ball, and crosses.

3827~~~
I'm surprised at the criticism of Blind. He's clearly good enough for us but has a few issues. Physically he isn't strong enough for the PL. Too often he loses a 50/50 or gets pushed around. When he is at left back you can see his intelligence & clever play but he isn't strong enough to have the same impact in midfield yet with only Herrera supporting him. 

I don't think Fellaini helps him either. Fellaini has been good as a long ball option but he doesn't contribute all that much with possession in midfield. Next season he'll be stronger & hopefully will have Gündoğan & Herrera beside him which should help him. Plus he is an excellent player to have as backup to Shaw. He was a very good signing imo.

3828~~~
If I'm honest, if we go into next season with a midfield of Carrick/Blind/Herrera/Gundogan as our core midfielders (obviously with the option of playing Rooney/Fellaini/Mata etc there too) we will still have a problem. Carrick has become rather injury prone as he gets older, Gundagon is just not a CDM, especially since the injury, and neither is Herrera, while Blind looks incredibly light weight in the tough PL away games. While I don't want to see any of Rooney/Mata/Fellaini in a traditional midfield role anytime soon. For me, we need a proper 'hardman' in midfield. Someone who can get their foot in. I'd go for Carrick/Blind/Herrera/Gundagon + 1 more....Rooney to only play upfront, Mata only to play in an attacking role, and Fellaini to be used as he has this season, but never as a deeper, more traditional, midfielder. 

Without sounding too OTT, I think we are at risk of turning into Arsenal. All a bit to tippy tappy. Play great possession football, but have no 'steal' in the team.

3829~~~
I agree to an extent but it's not necessarily a hard man we lack in my mind, it's an athletic ball winner, the type that can drive us out of midfield when we are pressed, a player like Matuidi or Vidal at his best.

3830~~~
Yeah, that'd do it. 'Hard man' is probably the wrong phrase to use. A Vidal/Strootman kind of player is exactly what we need.

That bloody injury to Strootman <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3831~~~
I fully agree with you and <a class="username" data-user="48107, @Devil may care" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48107/">@Devil may care</a>, van Gaal has already said he underestimated the physicality of the PL. The only 'hard' midfielders we have are Rooney (I'd keep him as striker every match, but I don't think van Gaal will) and Fellaini, and those 2 are best at 10. That's why I personally think he wants a stronger alternative to Herrera, and not a like-for-like replacement in Gundogan. I just wrote how Gundogan could potentially work - there's too many things I don't know though and he might bring in a 2nd midfielder with him (or we won't get Gundogan?).

I still think Strootman would've solved all our midfield issues if he was fit (as PSV fan I've followed him for years) - primarily an 8, but can play at 6. Alternatives to him are rare: Verrati & Koke aren't leaving, Matuidi is the only French player at PSG, Vidal isn't getting younger, Pogba isn't ideal. After that the quality drops off a bit: Xhaka, Schneiderlin, Kondogbia, Nainggolan?

It's a tough discussion because it isn't just about the midfield but also the attack: we won't know what he's going to do with Rooney, Mata and the younger players like Januzaj and Pereira.

3832~~~
I completely agree on Strootman. I think he was as dead certain a transfer as you could imagine, before his injury. He would have been perfect for us. I wonder if LVG might still see him as a target for next Summer as a 'Carrick replacement'? Gives him a year to see if he can get back to fitness, and LVG will just hold off on buying a midfielder for that role until then. Would be a right risk strategy, mind.

Personally, I'd go all out for Schniderlin, but we don't appear to have any interest at all.

3833~~~
Maybe he's not fully fit because he looked labored today.

3834~~~
He's a bit too rash in defence for me. Including today, he's committed to a few unnecessary challenges on the edge of the box and not got the ball, when it would have been better to hold back.

3835~~~
Had another bad game today, needs another dressing down from van Gaal.

3836~~~
Hope LVG rips into him over the freekick.

I just think he'd end up being a utility player here, I hope. Not good enough to be a starter.

3837~~~
He was abysmal today

3838~~~
Tidy in possession, but has the heart of a mouse.

Pure cowardice in the wall today.

3839~~~
I'd give him a -10 for that. He did nothing right all game long. I don't think he's a midfielder.

3840~~~
Struggles against pace and physicality. Hope he improves.

3841~~~
He was under par again, lack of aggression today and his passing was average. His midfield partners didnt play well either same as last time

3842~~~
#NotaDM.

3843~~~
How's Schneiderlin been doing lately?

3844~~~
Definitely can't cut it at defensive midfield for us... Basically sits as a center back and doesn't try anything. He was better then this earlier on in the season, but the question was still out then. His best performances have definitely been at left back IMO.

3845~~~
if he was instructed not to jump then my criticism isn't justified.

3846~~~
I like him but he was very poor today. What the feck is he doing so deep so many times? I am not sure if van Gaal said that to him but he shouldn't be doing that so many times, it just allows them to press our other players, and his long passing isn't that great to pick up players hogher up the pitch from those positions.

3847~~~
I don't understand why he goes behind Smalling and Evans and starts the attack everytime the play starts from our end. So bizarre.

3848~~~
Was shit today, also did a Nasri for their goal.

3849~~~
jump!!!

3850~~~
He's a good standard utility player but we desperately need someone else to play "Carrick" role for us.

3851~~~
Don't want to throw him under a bus because his early season form suggests he is definitely a decent player, but that was very bad. He set the tone for us with his inability to dictate the game under pressure. The defence behind him, fellaini's lack of effectiveness outside of the two boxes and Herrera at times certainly didn't help, but cowardly passing and that moment in the wall don't look good.

Another reminder that we need a proper midfielder to come in ASAP.

3852~~~
Dutch Joe Allen.

3853~~~
He's a good LB back-up, isn't good enough on the ball or physically to be a DM in the PL in my view.

3854~~~
For the wall he should be fined a weeks wages. I cannot stand that.

He's been poor since he stopped playing LB.

3855~~~
Well they saw on sky he was telling the wall not to jump. So must have been instructed by LVG.

3856~~~
He's really slow isn't he? Terrible today.

3857~~~
Feel that some of the criticism toward Blind is harsh, given that Fellaini and Herrera were nowhere to be found at times. It felt like at times it was just Blind in midfield on his own, similar to what we have been used to in past seasons.

Having said that, he should've done a lot better for the free kick they scored. That was poor.

3858~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3859~~~
Every coach I've ever played with has always said not to jump so he could easily have been instructed not to jump.

3860~~~
Slow and weak. Soon as Pardew let his team off the leash he was drowning in deep waters. I am in a metaphorical mood at the moment.

3861~~~
I don't know whether to laugh or cry

3862~~~
Worst game I've seen from him, almost cost us the game.

3863~~~
Dutch Joe Allen.

why not?

I think we're better with Herrera holding and Rooney in midfield then Blind doing the holding role, to be honest. He's just so slow, laboured and weak and never tries anything progressive.

3866~~~
What?

3867~~~
Whether he was instructed to jump or not, I doubt he was instructed to cover his face with his arm (could have cost a penalty)
Had he not done that, he'd have seen that a tiny jump was required.

3868~~~
There's not jumping, then there's not watching the ball. If he's watching the ball  and not covering his face like a fanny, he could probably have headed the ball properly.

3869~~~
He is as average as he was advertized on the ajax forums and the Nation's opinion here on him.
We are baffled the English rated him so highly for a while.

Just as they said. Too weak and too slow, athletically challenged. technically fine but not great enough in that department to make up for his negatives either.

3870~~~
Looked like a headless chicken chasing the ball at points, bang average game overall.

Disappointed in the wall, but if he was told not to jump, what can you do? Unlucky deflection again.

3871~~~
So the keeper can see better?

3872~~~
People got carried away with this guy,.

3873~~~
Cowardly on the free kick.

Generally, he has to do a lot better to play in midfield for us.

3874~~~
Why do you think he's covering his eyes? To try and see the ball

3875~~~
Said it last week and will say it again. Not good enough to command that midfield and he is slow as an old bus. I'm just not convinced ATM.

3876~~~
but then the way it went it did not really make sense

3877~~~
I can't understand such an instruction as yet

3878~~~
I said it before the game in the match day thread and got criticised for daring to say Blind is usually average at best. He is not good enough to play DM and never will be, even against the smaller sides. Use him as back up for LB and nothing else.

3879~~~
One of the few players that could actually pass and didnt give away the ball

3880~~~
Doesn't have the legs to effectively shield a defence. He is an intelligent and versatile player though and well worth a squad role. With a summer revamp it will hopefully be the case that we get a proper first team worthy Carrick replacement and Blind will take up a John O'shea type role, available to cover injuries at left back and centre back and midfield if we really need to.

3881~~~
The wall's not jumping so he can't slide it under the wall ala Walker for Tottenham last season

3882~~~
Oh come on...So everyone else in the wall couldn't see the ball because they weren't covering their faces? It's stupid... Can easily give away a penalty doing shit like that

3883~~~
His passing was atrocious today.

3884~~~
Not a best game but still he will be more then useful in the future,he has more football intelligence then most of our players,dont think he will regress in incoming seasons.He cant change much about his pace but if he gets stronger then he should be ok for us.

3885~~~
This. But it is what he has been doing already. Just that between them Shaw and Carrick have been injured nearly all season!

3886~~~
Whats your rocket scientist theory on why he's covering above his eyes then?

Does he have weak eyebrows that he wanted to protect or something?

3887~~~
Very much agree on the lack of legs. Doesn't cover the ground well at all. Spots the danger but can't react. Needs to bulk up to compensate IMO.

3888~~~
Looks like they were worried the freekick would be played under the wall so no one jumped, if it was tactical we can't blame him, and the sun looked to be in his eyes.

3889~~~
I don't think he was that bad. Out of him, Herrera and Fellaini he was the one who stood up at times and did something with the ball.

3890~~~
Why is no one else in the wall doing it?

3891~~~
Agree. Out of form at the moment but will be a useful player for us again next season with more matches to play, if not an automatic choice.

3892~~~
I just thought it was a poor match by an otherwise good player.
Its been a long season for him and he looks a bit knackered to me.
Overall a good season but it is starting to peter out a bit for him.

3893~~~
They have a different angle?

3894~~~
So do you actually believe me that he's slightly better than average and no Pirlo? or is too soon to say the truth. He was the last ditch transfer to cover.. I don't believe Cleverley is any worse, it's just the knowledge and confidence from manager's support which gave him advantage in the first half of the seaseon ahead of some players.. he's bang squad player

3895~~~
I still think he's the Dutch Gareth Barry. Capable in multiple positions, uses the ball relatively well, very slow, very safe passer, needs a dominant midfield partner alongside him, not good enough to start for a top team.

3896~~~
Barry was better

3897~~~
He is having very poor last few months but people are forgetting that he was actually very good in first half of the season. 

Can we at least consider that the tiredness and lack of form are getting to him like they do with pretty much every player in their first season in Premierleague, even players coming from top teams and not someone who is coming from way weaker league, who had a busy summer being involved in the World Cup, and who had very bad injury during the season and was actually rushed back after it? It's obvious that he is struggling at the moment and that he probably shouldn't be starting in midfield but before we conclude he is never gonna make it here let's see how he performs next season after deserved rest.

3898~~~
Tend to agree. A good option to have but I don't think he has it in him to be a starter

3899~~~
True, although I think there are specific examples of him playing great passes that Barry isnt capable of. However, very few of them have been at United where he's kept it safe.

3900~~~
I don't his legs are an issue or his passing. I've seen play some lovely passes this season. 

His positioning and reading the of game is lacking for him to play the DM role as anything more than a back up. Put in front of Carrick and he'll probably look a lot better,

3901~~~
He should stick to Carrick all next season in training, try and get some of that immense positioning and intercepting skills to rub off on him, make up for his lacklustre pace. 

Had a great early season, but off the boil now, as is most of the team to be fair.

3902~~~
He is a decent squad player to have. But he is no where close to carrick as a CM.

And if we are talking about trying to win the league and progress far in the CL next season  then we need to sign another top class CM.

Not saying herrera and blind have been bad buys, both have been good, but it is scary to think that we've spent 170 million pound for mata, fellaini, herrera, di maria and blind and our midfield issue is yet to be completely solved.

3903~~~
I think he's good defensively but his positioning is bad Imo. He's either too deep or gets caught too far Up the pitch.

3904~~~
I really like him but he's just not suited to be a defensive midfielder. Maybe the reason why we had those long winning runs wasn't because of Carrick, but because Blind wasn't there in the defensive midfield position. Serious need of a DM in the window, which LVG addressed. 

Had a decent season overall, but he should stick to being back up.

3905~~~
Some think it's his mobility/pace/flat-footedness that's his issue. 
Some think it's his positioning.

It's both. He's just not an exceptional player. Good for the squad, and Intelligent enough, but he just hasn't got 'it.

3906~~~
If Carrick was available it would be an opportunity to take him out of the firing line. His confidence is low at the moment. His passing was poor today.

3907~~~
... That must be some weird sun coming down then. 

Bottom line, you don't put your hand by your face when you're in a wall... Whatever the weather.

3908~~~
I'm seriously fed up with that excuse. Feck me... and we used to say that the Italian league required a lot of fitness back in the days.

What I didn't like on the goal we conceded is that he stood there like a damn orange construction cone when all he had to do was jump to block the shot. Take one for the team, man.

3909~~~
People get away with that plenty saying they are protecting their face. Its only when your hands are away from your face that theres an issue

3910~~~
Disappointed with him today - we know he's slow and weak but he's usually a smarter player. Didn't play smartly today at alla nd punted several balls in a hit & hope fashion.

3911~~~
school boy error. Some of the first things coaches tell you when defending freekicks is to look at the ball. covering your face for whatever reason is just weak.

squad player at best.

3912~~~
Really don't get what people see in him. Back up left back at best. Probably too slow or that position too.

3913~~~
No he didn't even have to jump, it was low enough just to put his head there.

3914~~~
I thought he did well today. I don't get the negative comments. His only mistake was he closed his eyes from the sun and could have easily stopped the shot had he jumped.

3915~~~
And now they're getting carried away in the other direction. He's a good player, better than he showed today

3916~~~
My gosh what a horror show of a performance.
Sometimes he can get away with having the acceleration of a ferry or the cutting edge of a beach ball (that one that scored against Liverpool aside of course) when others around him are playing well, but when we're struggling like today he really gets shown up.
From his performances this season he is effectively our 2015 version of Quinton Fortune. Decent squad player but should never be first choice if we want to be challenging for titles.

3917~~~
Yeah this. Decent utility players can be hard to get hold of and I think Blind and Valencia are great squad players. Blind in particular this season with Shaw and Carrick's injuries. Agree about the intelligence though, he has clear flaws that have been exposed in the PL but intelligence certainly isn't something he lacks.

3918~~~
I think you need to watch the entire game again. See how many times he was stranded on the wrong side of the player he is trying to tackle, how many times he just jogged along with the play and a few times he just didn't get stuck in to win the ball.
I'm sorry but with what we served up today I'm convinced he will not be  mainstay in our midfield and squad player at best. Good cover for leftback.

3919~~~
that's harsh on Quinton Fortune..

3920~~~
Poor performance by him but he's probably running on empty. He started the season well but since December has been in and out of the team through injury. Given other factors like a World Cup and introduction to a new league, it's not surprising he's running out of legs

3921~~~
I will never forgive him for the free kick, that was worse than Nasri.

3922~~~
It was a close free kick so could easily be hammered low, you can't jump or you'll allow it to go underneath and it'll be an automatic goal. There is no way for everyone to jump perfectly together and jumping inevitably leads to gaps opening up between players. It can also mess with the keepers projection of the flight of the ball. You stand tall and together and no one moves.

3923~~~
He couldn't look at the ball because he couldn't see it with the sun. He had to try block the sun or he wouldn't have been able to see the ball.

3924~~~
hmm so what else could have been done better then?

3925~~~
at least he managed to block the sun because he blocked nothing else today.

sorry that is a weak excuse. The sun is not that low that he still cannot see the ball.

3926~~~
Well he did duck his head a bit. You can slightly go up on your toes if its coming at you but you just have to accept that the wall can only do so much and sometimes people are going to score. If you stand tall and solid there is nothing else the wall can do.

3927~~~
Steady squad player great bench player but not good enough for best 11 if we are to dominate titles again.

3928~~~
So the sun doesn't block peoples vision? I'm not even sure if you are serious.

3929~~~
Pretty boy worried about taking one in the face.

3930~~~
Bottled it, just jump up and that goal would never have happened, just stood there, absolutely spineless. His unwillingness to make a tackle also led to that Everton first goal. We have too many players like this, nice guys whom you'll like to have as in laws, we need to sign a fews bastards.

3931~~~
Agree he can't be criticised for not jumping. He can, however, be criticised for ducking. I don't care how beautiful he is...

3932~~~
so wait... sun is blocking your vision so best thing is to just put your arm in front of your eyes so that you can't see the ball?

I'm not sure you're serious. You can shield your eyes from the sun at such an angle and still keep your eye on the ball even just partially. That was just piss poor from Blind.

3933~~~
And that without mentioning the fact that his vision was good enough to duck his head when the ball arrived.

3934~~~
He's much better at LB right now. Don't think he's a defensive midfielder though, we tend to get overrun when he plays there, just too weak and way too slow for that role. Still young though and he makes a very good squad player.

3935~~~
He didn't put his arm in front of eyes, he did put it at such an angle so he could see the ball.

3936~~~
and then ducked.

3937~~~
Tbf, if I had his face I'd do whatever I could to preserve it - including ducking freekicks. Would never forgive Fellaini or Jones for it though. They've got nothing to lose.

3938~~~
He's struggling at the moment after a very solid three quarters of the campaign. Bit of a shame but I'm sure he'll pick himself up.

3939~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3940~~~
Which has nothing to do with putting his arm up to block the sun which is what you are mouthing about.

3941~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  so you rate Rooney

3942~~~
they specifically targeted the outside left?

3943~~~
Another reason for Van Gaal to go on a midfield hunt this summer however he'll be very useful in building steady and successful future for this club.

Too much roles and too many system changes this season caused him a bit of a mind feck. No big worries when we'll kick future league campaign with wider squad armed with solid quality.

It was good idea that we signed the fecker, no doubts about that. He just needs a stable role next season where he can directly focus on it but there's more and more signs that he'll be used almost everywhere.

LVG's John O'Shea perhaps ? He got potential to be way better than that though...

3944~~~
oh dear..What we saw today was Blind blocking his eyes with his arm just before the ball was struck, and probably just saw enough to see the ball heading his way, and then decided to duck instead of letting it hit his face. That's the point. That's what I'm mouthing about.

3945~~~
to be a starter for a title-winning team?

3946~~~
Not sure about that, especially in perspective of signing players of Pogba's and Gundogan's ability but we know we may get hit by injury plagues even with bigger squad... He'll definitely find a way to show his value sooner or later. Saw a lot goods from him this season to think he'll be useful.

3947~~~
Yep. No-one in the wall jumped so presumably that is something that was either asked for by De Gea, worked on in training or agreed upon at the last minute by those in the wall. Most likely a combination of the first two. It's a perfectly understandable decision. Blocking your face and ducking is something else entirely. It defeats the point of being a part of the wall. It genuinely would've been more beneficial if we had no-one in the wall instead of Blind, because at least De Gea would've had a better view of the shot. 

He's directly at fault for the goal. A little unlucky, sure, but if he'd done his job properly that wouldn't have happened.

3948~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3949~~~
His performances over the first half of the season, particuarly at home were encouraging, his form lately has been far less so, I'm hoping hard that his form will pickup again after a long summer off, as someone else mentioned above, he could do with working on his physicality (or lack there of.) as well.

3950~~~
In the offseason he needs to add on as much muscle as possible without impairing his movement.  He might get away with his physique in a league that would call more fouls, but right now he is just bouncing off of players too often.

3951~~~
Stan Collymore on Talksport earlier made a very good point about Blind. He said that he'd be far better suited to a midfield role a bit further up the pitch.

He could be a good option as a box to box player and he seemingly has the ability to hit a good long shot.

I just don't think that he has the discipline or positional awareness to play as a DM.

3952~~~
I said a while ago he'd be better as a #8 than a #6. Gets lost in that deeper role. Perhaps he will grow into it, but he's not even close to good enough for it.

3953~~~
He looks like he's running on fumes. I reckon this seasons taken a lot out of him.

3954~~~
I stopped reading at "Stan Collymore" He loves the sound of his own voice and is generally a twat.

3955~~~
The same Stan Collymore that calls Michael Carrick "marmite"...

Seriously, he has no physicality and speed for such a pressing midfielder who runs from box to box

3956~~~
Why was no one else effected by the sun? Smalling was stood right by him and didn't flinch. He has good moments and he has bad moments. If you are in a wall, you jump. To a man you jump. What do these players do all day? They make so many stupid mistakes. Anyone that raises their hands to protect their face had better remember - if you do that, you leave the crown jewels vulnerable...

3957~~~
He's learning. He should be proud of this season, one of a few who can be. Playing as a DM in the formation we play is hard enough, doing so in you first season in the EPL is even harder. At 24, he's still very, very young and will only get better.

3958~~~
Hahaha very true mate!

3959~~~
Some good points there mate. Hopefully we buy really well this summer and then use him only as a squad player.

3960~~~
Major difference between the two in terms of power and usage of mass though. Once Barry gets near an opponent, or into a full-on physical tussle, he's a handful and cynical and strong enough to either stop the ball or his man whereas Blind looks meek and frail in the same kind of scenarios.

I don't think you can afford to be slow and weak in the Premier League. One or the other, sure, but both, like Blind, and it's a serious problem.

3961~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

Thought he was pretty average. Maybe the season has started taking its toll on him though. Has shown more as a LB IMO.

3962~~~
I've said it already a few weeks ago but i've no problem to say it again.....his roles for next season should be a fight with Shaw for the left-back spot and 3rd choice as defensive midfielder.

3963~~~
Has really tailed off as the season progressed and looked terrible yesterday. I'm not prepared to right him off just yet though. 

At worst he is a useful squad option. But he is nowhere near the ceiling of his ability yet. Will reserve judgement till this time next year

3964~~~
we could have done better with giving chance to Reece James who can cover both positions as well, not even mentioning Ben Pearson who certainly has a higher ceiling than Blind who could be a good squad player but I think our goal should be targeting only the best players. I understand that it was difficult for Van Gaal to come to the new team without bringing one of his versatile players who gets his philosophy though. Midfielder was needed before the season so it was no surprise we brought someone like Blind. It would be a risk to trust too many young players in club like this which demands success every season.

The reason he was why he was so good in the first part of the season is so obvious, He was Van Gaal player who knew his philosophy through and through unlike other players who were slowly getting to know it

3965~~~
Don't really care how close the freekick was. Statistically you probably see more being hit over the wall then under it. It's not just blind but the whole wall deserve being fined. If a player smacks it under a wall and it's a good hit? Fair enough. Sometimes you can't stop the shot. If you're in a wall. Jump. Make it big. It's unlucky that it flicked off him the way it did and into the goal but that's the way our lucks been. WBA's goal wasn't much different. It's better to do the simple things right then to ask for trouble. In that position, jump. Don't raise your hand above your head. If it's in the area and it don't go in, you know what Palace would call for? A penalty. It's these simple things that some players need to remember. No one would be critical if the guy had have scored hitting it under the players. No way.

3966~~~
Of course they would have, because you don't jump.

3967~~~
Got a hell of a shot on him from distance though huh.

3968~~~
I have seen him blast a few into Row Z this season.

3969~~~
<a class="username" data-user="12228, @Striker10" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/12228/">@Striker10</a> You don't think he was under instruction from De Gea? He was turned round talking to him, then turned back and gave the instruction to the wall not to jump.

3970~~~
I thought he was excellent during the first half of the season and he's been ok at LB when he had to cover for Shaw, but in CM in the second half of the season he's looked completely overwhelmed. Dunno if it's a physical thing (after all he had a long WC) but I'm hoping we can see the Blind of 2014 a bit more next season.

3971~~~
The thing is why did he have his arm up covering his face? If the ball hits then it's a penalty it's pussy stuff for me.

3972~~~
The sun was in his eyes. Don't ask me why he was the only one in the wall who felt the need to raise his arm to block the sun though.

3973~~~
So you have no idea either lol

3974~~~
The highlights on MOTD showed him chatting with de Gea and it was obvious from the hand signals that he was saying the sun was in his eyes and it glanced off his head. But no, I have no idea why he was the only one!

3975~~~
Maybe he was the only one bothered by it

3976~~~
He'll get plenty of games next season as well either in midfield or LB and it's not like Shaw can be relied on even to stay on the pitch a bit longer than Rafael.
Blind has had a good first 7-8 months for us, is adapting to a new league and has had a long season prior to that with the world cup. I am not worried at all about him.

3977~~~
Really accomplished half, a lot more like the Blind of the start of the season, has done a really good job of starving Giroud of ball and have worked the ball out of defense nicely, shame Smalling blocked his shot.

3978~~~
Shut me right up. Good half.

3979~~~
Yep, back in the groove. Played very well so far. 88% pass accuracy from 36 passes (2nd to Ander) and 4 tackles in that 45 mins

3980~~~
He was really good in that half. Very good at winning us the ball back and stopping any Arsenal momentum with his pressuring and positioning.

3981~~~
Excellent performance so far. At the right places and the right time. Much more disciplined.

3982~~~
Seems much more comfortable playing at home. Less pressure from the opponent and more time on the ball for him.

3983~~~
I disagree, he played well but I don't think I've ever seen a midfielder lose so many 50/50s.

3984~~~
He is much better than recently, but he can be even better than this(he was in first half of the season), that's why I think people are writing him off too early.

3985~~~
Much better from him, he has been poor recently. Looks more kike the Blind of the first half of the season. Unlucky not to score.

3986~~~
yup.

3987~~~
Even when Arsenal won the first ball against him he was putting them under sufficient pressure to make it awkward for them and often after winning the first ball they gave away the 2nd.

3988~~~
I don't think he has been playing fantastically well, he takes a few too many risks and isn't disciplined enough in the holding role at present.

He bombs forward into 50/50s and doesn't win them, too often.

I'm not worried as he is an intelligent player and I expect he will improve substantially at the club under LVG.

3989~~~
He hasn't been great. very early on in the game was a deja vu of previous games. Went in hard to win a ball, lost it and then inevitably got caught behind the ball. Happened once more in the half.

3990~~~
Maybe its his Ajax background but he is quite focused at following the principle of winning the ball back within the first 5 seconds. When it works, it gives us a great position to counter-counter attack but when it fails we get quite exposed.

3991~~~
Solid but doesn't have the passing range of Carrick and hence can be perceived as quite negative in his approach.

I think he performs better at left back. Surely would be a better option there than Rojo or Blackett.

3992~~~
I'm surprised LvG hasn't put more correction to him

3993~~~
But he is too slow to play left back. In a back five, then yes he can play left full back. But not in a back four. He is far too exposed.

3994~~~
He was ok today, just don't see him there long term.

3995~~~
Totally anonymous once Arsenal cranked up the pressure, it is a theme with him.

3996~~~
Just like vs Spurs or Liverpool? When he was vs Sterling and Townsend?

3997~~~
Such a shame his shot was blocked, 2-0 would've been the end of Arsenal.

3998~~~
Actually I suspect that LvG supports Blind doing that and may even me instructing him to do that. Quite certain that winning the ball back within the first few seconds is part of his philosophy.

3999~~~
but then if there's only Blind who does that, the movement is not in sync with others like Herrera not being able to cover the vacant space Blind has left to press. That can lead to counter-attacks as anyone has clearly seen. Pressing should come as teamwork, why only leave for a single one to do that?

4000~~~
The players around the ball are quite quick to press as soon as we lose the ball especially in the opposition's half. In these scenarios though Blind is usually the only midfielder behind the ball so if he gets beaten the the rest of our defence is exposed.

4001~~~
But he is supposed to hold back and let the advanced guys press?

4002~~~
Best game for us in a while, but not good enough when under pressure.

4003~~~
Absolutely. We need to press as a team, otherwise Blind's usually left on his own. Once we sign another top class midfielder, Daley will shine.

4004~~~
he's pretty good at football, sort of, but watching him is like doing a replay on FIFA and putting it to 0.5x speed, except everyone else is still at normal speed other than him.

4005~~~
Performed as expected this season IMO. Nice back up player to have and infinitely better than cleverley/Anderson.

4006~~~

4007~~~
Played well - unlucky with the shot that hit smalling. I think that was curling in. Typical of our luck at the minute.

4008~~~
i wish he was just that bit quicker and stronger.

4009~~~
I think it was definitely going in. For a player that is supposed to be primarily defensive he's a great nack of picking out the corner of the goal from range.

4010~~~
had a good season , second best signing of the year.

4011~~~
Solid enough today, seemed to heed the need to stay deeper in the #6 role.

4012~~~
I just think he plays too casual. He just doesn't show decisiveness in his running, passing or marking

4013~~~
Will get better as he acclimates to the Premier League. Already feels like he has taken Darren Fletchers role as the whipping boy of the team. Well I guess he will take the official mantel if Jonny Evans leaves this summer.

4014~~~
Needs a rest. Overall a very good first season for him.

4015~~~
I was quite impressed with him at the start of the season. But he seems to have got worse. He's certainly not able to be the only CM. Also the way LvG uses him, as almost a third CB to bring the ball out of defense doesn't suit him either but might me necessary as our defenders can't control a football to save their life let alone actually passing the ball to a teammate.

4016~~~
Blind admitted that he's struggled at the end of the season and he did look tired in some games. It can be understood he had all that responsibility at the world cup after a great season with Ajax and then he hits the ground running as soon as he gets here in a new league which is much more physical than the Dutch league.

I think he's our 2nd best signing after Herrera.

4017~~~
Judging from this alone season his best position is Left back. United had a pretty disappointing record when he's replaced Carrick.

Ideal player to have in the squad.

7/10

Thought he was probably our best player today although that doesn't account for a whole lot. Really solid signing, there's a possibility he can make the step up in the next few seasons but if he doesnt he'll still be a brilliant squad player. I think once the team perfects its pressing game it'll help him greatly, less space between the defense and midfield for his lack of pace to be exposed.

Is Blind really going for the Ibra look? I thought that was just for the awards. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4020~~~
I dont think Blind will become a squad player, he might never be good enough to replace Carrick, but from what I've observed from him, he breathes football. Eventually he'd go to a lesser club, just to play.

4021~~~
He's the best and I love him.

4022~~~
Feel like he's been retrospectively downgraded by a lot of people. I thought he was generally excellent in both positions, and was just unfortunate enough to have a couple of his poorest performances in a couple of high-expectation, high profile games. He's no long-term Carrick replacement but I have no problem with him playing there.

4023~~~
I thought he started well, which was a bit of a surprise given he had a long world cup. But faded after Feb. He was almost reinvigorated by moving to LB but i still thought that burst of energy he had at the start had faded.

I put it down to injury and a long world cup. My hopes are, with a summer off, he comes back even better.

4024~~~
People's opinions of him have been swung massively by the last few months. At one point didn't he win a poll for our outfield player of the season so far? Every game people would come into the thread to commend him as a 7/10 player every game and say how intelligent he is.

When players of a higher calibre taking steps down from Barcelona/Real Madrid struggled towards the end of the Premier League season (Sanchez, Fabregas, Di Maria, even Costa to some extent) it's crazy how much people have let these last few months influence their ultimate opinion of Blind. He's only recently 25, young for his position, and has come from the Dutch league. Not forgetting that he's had a few injuries, been moved around a ton (all demanding positions too) and was 9th for distance covered at last years World Cup - something we've seen catch up with plenty of other players.

This is a player who the world cup winning German team used as a case study in defending through the knockout stages to the final. For a first season, considering the circumstances, he's been great for us. And as much as people want to doubt him, he's always played when available. Van Gaal clearly has huge trust in him, he's never been left on the bench when even half-fit.

4025~~~
He's had way more good games than bad games, but those bad games came mostly towards the end of the season, so are fresh in the memory. Going back through this thread, everyone was gushing over his performances for most of the season. After he returned from injury, lots here were saying how he was better than Carrick (I don't agree with that, but he was definitely playing well). Then at the end of the season he played 3 or 4 poor games, and now some are saying he should never ever play in midfield. It's bonkers.

4026~~~
Good, solid first season at the club.

4027~~~
Good squad player - very good one in fact. And I think thats what we bought him as. Injuries have meant that he has started more games than expected but I don't see how he can be a first choice starter. That said with our injury record he will still start a lot of games

4028~~~
People's opinions only seem to have swung massively because many were so blinded (no pun intended) by the sheer fact we had a semi-competent midfielder playing. It was a sin to criticize him early on. People were being told they weren't intelligent enough to spot his quality.
The same things that some pointed out are now being acknowledged more widely, that's all.

Nobody's said anything too out there, really. He's ideally a squad player (a term which seems to have a negative connotation, but shouldn't) and he'll probably rack up a good 30 games next season, even if he's relegated to squad player. His biggest flaw, in my opinion (flat-footed <i>and </i>slow* without the passing range/speed to compensate) will restrict him from being a starting midfielder in a top European side. Perhaps there will be success, if he's partnered in such a way to reduce the impact of his flaws, but there will always be a number of better alternatives to Blind.

It's a shame, because he's been taught well, he's probably got a better understanding of most roles than most players out there, and he's a secure passer. He'll get games in midfield next season (probably a good number of games), and I don't think anyone is against that. but I don't think he's a long term first choice midfielder here at United.

*For reference, I'd say that while Carrick is seen as slow, he's not flat-footed. He can still move and turn relatively well, whereas Blind is slow <i>and </i>heavy-footed. Plus Carrick's passing range, passing speed, and one-touch play compensates, which isn't the case for Blind, who's even more physically limited.

4029~~~
will be a good player to stick into a better United side when we have a few injuries or players need rested......with new signings and a better starting 11 he will be a good squad player to use on occasion

think about Phil Neville back in the day partnering Scholes with talent like Vidic/Rio behind him and good imaginative exciting attackers in front

his best games were those ones vrs Spurs/Liverpool where he deputised for Shaw though...definitely a more natural position for him

4030~~~
Good post.

4031~~~
Blind is the type of player that is important to the team and the manager. Plays multiple positions and does a good job in those positions! These types arent always appreciated by fans

4032~~~
A potential Carrick 2.0 when it comes to underestimated players in a few years time.

4033~~~
Disagree. There's been a noticeable drop off in his performance level as the season progressed. As <a class="username" data-user="63211, @ALock1" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/63211/">@ALock1</a> pointed out, this is something that's happened with a lot of WC players (including our own Wayne Rooney)

4034~~~
Maybe, maybe not. So far, he isnt even close and wouldnt start in midfield if it wasnt for injuries. Right now, he's a much better LB

4035~~~
Funny fact is that a lot of the critics Blind gets have been used for Carrick in the beginning as well. Carrick has massively improved his passing game during the last years.
If we can get someone like Gündogan I might agree to use Blind as a squad player. Otherwise he should be played as DM on a regular basis.

I am not really a fan of him playing as LB.

4036~~~
He's had a good first season, adapted well to the PL and was very useful for us. Let's see how he does in the second before declaring what his future here will be. Currently he's a massive part of the team, for me, and there's no reason to believe he will have any less importance next season. We'll see though.

4037~~~
His performance levels dropped, but I think that just exposed the weaknesses. Obviously opinions will change along with his performances. 
My point was regarding the degree of the change of opinion. I think he was being praised for basic intelligence and skill. Maybe he's being harshly criticized now though, and the truth sits somewhere in the middle. 

I guess we'll see what he produces next season.

4038~~~
I don't see him as similar to Carrick in many ways, to be honest. Carrick never had Blind's biggest weakness, and his passing game was better from day one, from what I remember (though I was young).

I agree that he should be playing if we don't sign someone better. Nobody's suggesting he drops to bottom of the pecking order. He's not a bad player. Being a squad player isn't a bad thing anyway. He'll still play 30 games anyway. But the player you'd put in your best XI in a top tie, with everyone fit?

Funnily enough, Strootman was being compared to Gareth Barry. I'd actually say that Blind is much closer to Gareth Barry, style-wise (the City/Everton version of Barry). And I'd say Blind's peak level will be about Barry's peak level, if I had to predict.

4039~~~
His early season praise was severely over the top probably because people got excited. Aside from the QPR game, we were overrun in several of the early games and he was often found chasing back towards his own goal because he had been caught out of position. Even in the City game where we only lost 1-0, for 70 minutes City played us off the park (even before the red before someone brings that up). Once he came back from injury he looked even worse. It was only after we moved him to LB that he started looking good and that's where should play if Shaw is injured.

He's shown nothing as a DM to suggest he should even be a back up there let alone start games. Needs to tone down his aggressiveness and use his brains more often when he plays there.

4040~~~
Yes, I have been saying this for a while so it's nice to see someone else with the same opinion.

4041~~~
Agree completely

4042~~~
Out of interest, what is Blind's "biggest weakness"? His strength (lack of such)? He can be muscled off the ball, but Carrick isn't exactly the incredible hulk either.

4043~~~
He's very flat-footed as well as slow.
Thus his turning circle is poor, he can barely dribble past anyone or dribble his way out of serious pressure, he gets dribbled past, and is slow from a stand-still.

Even some of the slower midfielder out there, like Carrick, aren't also flat-footed. Plus someone like Carrick has the passing game to compensate.

Edit: forgot to mention his reach, which is also lacking. He needs to steady himself quite bit, because once the ball travels slightly beyond his reach, he seems to struggle to get it. Partly because he's flat footed.

You could say the same for Gareth Barry as you do for Blind (in terms of the slow and flat-footedness), but Barry had/has the added strength to him to at least slightly compensate. As you said, Blind's also not the strongest.

4044~~~
I'm pretty sure Carrick isn't quicker than Blind. A midfielder in that position doesn't pace, he needs to have very good anticipation skills which is what Carrick has a lot of.

4045~~~
i have thought that from day one.  However, i have come to the conclusion he looks a little lathargic / non decisive in his running, passing and marking because he's just that slow and not because he's half arsed / casual.

He is very slow / un athletic for a modern premiership player.

He really is very similar to sheasy

4046~~~
A bit smarter I think.  He reads the game well and uses posession better than Sheasy.  Gets forward from full back better too - and is one of the best crossers the team has.  Apart from that I get what you mean - just not a natural athlete which for a modern day professional footballer (especially in the Premier League!) is a bit strange to see.

4047~~~
I agree but he has the potential to become as influential as Carrick. He is a smart player and smart players are often overlooked by viewers since they "avoid" situations with good movements and positioning

4048~~~
I'm not doubting his attitude or work ethic, it's just his style and with that it will be hard to impose himself in the team

4049~~~
i agree

4050~~~
His positioning is dreadful in midfield and has been since he came here. Charges forward far too much when it's much better to hold position and regain shape. I first thought it might've been a LvG requirement asking his DM to charge and press like a lunatic, but as Carrick is still first choice it seems not.

That and his lack of composure is my biggest problems with him. Your DM needs to have excellent composure, but whenever we're under pressure he seems to be one of the players who panics most. It's the situation where a defensive midfielder earns his money.

4051~~~
Yeah hard to disagree with this.

4052~~~
We'll value him just like we did with Park and the berties with Milner. A good player to have around.

I was happy with him at LB. He's the best crosser of a ball at the club.

4053~~~
Now he's Barry level? Wtf?

4054~~~
This 
forum never cease to amaze me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4055~~~
Blind is nothing like Gareth Barry.

Hes unfortunate that the games where we played especially badly also happened to be games where he played in midfield. It doesnt matter that everyone played badly, or that he was also playing in midfield in games where we dominated, or that he actually played ok in those games.

He will be a starter next year too im pretty sure of that.

4056~~~
Yes. Not the current Barry, but Barry circa 2011. 
Or at least much closer to Barry's level than Carrick's. Or Lahm's, or Busquets', and whoever else he was being compared to before. Closer to Barry's style than Carrick's too.

I think some are too desperate for a Carrick replacement, to be honest.

4057~~~
Would you say that Blind is like Carrick, out of interest?

4058~~~
As I said, he might never be good enough to replace Carrick, but Barry please no, just not close to true imo. And Carrick isnt on Busquets/Lahm's level. Busquets is the best #6 in a possession based team of the past 10 years easily. One of the key players in a team which has had the likes of Puyol, Pique, Iniesta, Xavi, Messi in their prime.

4059~~~
Put Blind in Barry's position in City's 2011/12 team, and he performs almost an identical role, to a similar standard, and with similar limitations. I don't see how this is ridiculous or inaccurate. Now put Blind in Carrick's 2012/13 role* and he's nothing close to Carrick style-wise or impact-wise.

*Perhaps a harsh example.

There are differences between Barry and Blind obviously, like with every two players: Blind's passing is marginally better, Barry's better defensively and has more capability going forward (and more than he was allowed to show at City). But Blind's closer to that mould than Carrick's mould.

4060~~~
I would say he is, the fact that he is the one consistent point in a damn midfield but still able to help the team challenge should get more respect for him

4061~~~
Yeah compare Blind's first season in a new league after a long season to Carricks best ever season in his career. Seems reasonable.

Im not saying Blind is better than Barry was, but they play differently, Blind's biggest asset is bringing the ball out of the back, helping our defenders to build up the play. They're both slow, I give you that. But Blind has better technique and is more attacking minded when we attack, further more the pressing LVG has required from him at Holland and United is very different from Barry's style. Barry has more like Carrick's style of defending, while Blind drives forward to go and take the ball, if it works it's perfect, if it doesnt, ' your positional sense is awful'. Only thing is that, Blind mostly is the only midfielder when he plays, especially since we play 4141, while Barry mostly played in a 4231 with Toure next to him? Who was less attacking minded than he is now.

4062~~~
It's a good achievement, and he's a brilliant player. But there's very little he can that Busquets can't, especially Busquets under Guardiola. Only his 2012/13 season was on that level.

4063~~~
the only time the world actually noticed his name. and actually this season Busquets has dropped quite some levels, let's see if this is temporary or he may not actually return

4064~~~
Might be a reason for that. He established himself as the / one of the best of his position at that specific moment.

4065~~~
Fair enough. There are obviously <i>some </i>differences, but I think they're similar. Put them in the same team and they do a similar thing with/without the ball, take up similar positions etc. In my opinion, anyway.

This could <i>easily </i>be Blind (perhaps on a day where he gets forward more than usual, as they mention Barry is doing):
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/alkBD9HmNbI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

And this could easily be a Barry highlight video, if you dropped him into our team:
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV3Yt-asDNw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

It would never be a Carrick highlight video, yet people have been claiming they have similar styles.

4066~~~
agree to disagree here

4067~~~
If we want to return back among the footballing elite then blind won't be in the starting 11. I like blind but It's really hard to see where he would fit in going forward into next season. 

He is a good versatile player to have around the place though, I expect the vast majority of his minutes next season coming from the bench. I'd be very suprised if he continued to be a starter for us.

4068~~~
What's the meaning of this? It's a brilliant goal by him, but it's meaningless highlights vs lower table dross, Blind has actually been solid in matches like City away, Chelsea home, vs Spain this season, Barcelona at home at Ajax last year, vs City in the CL.

4069~~~
Obviously we'll have to agree to disagree, because we're going in circles.
Basically the clips of Blind could easily be Barry (in my opinion), and visa versa. But neither set of clips resemble a Carrick game. And the highlights in a Carrick game could never be mistaken for Barry or Blind.

Just backing up my opinion that Blind is similar to Barry (not identical, obviously) and not particularly similar to Carrick, which some have claimed.
For one, Blind barely plays the ball between the lines (which is obviously a regular pass for Carrick, and has been for as long as I can remember) and when he attempts it it's often <i>then </i>that he gives it away. He also can't get the the ball out of his feet nearly as well as Carrick, meaning his one and two-touch play is significantly more laboured.
He struggles with the ball being played at him with zip, and prefers to have passes rolled into his path, and positions himself accordingly. His turning is not nearly as good as Carrick's. His passing is generally not half as progressive as Carrick's.
Unfortunately for him, a lot of this comes down to his physique and lack of speed. 

It's not even an issue if he's like Carrick, but these are just weaknesses in general. 
His defensive game isn't anything special either. I'm at a loss as to what he provides that can't be provided with a number of added benefits by someone else in that midfield role.

4070~~~
I don't think it's as simple as that, Louis van Gaal always puts the team above the individual, he also seems to do things with more precision and planning than most managers. This is wonderful when it comes off but when it doesn't then it looks like ineffective pointless zombie football, an intelligent team player like Blind <i>could</i> establish himself in Louis van Gaal's first 11 if he carries out his instructions to the letter, that's how the manager likes it, and the planning of the manager will maximise Blind's strengths while limiting his weaknesses.

The manager will have a selection at the start of next season and he will look for the most effective team from that selection, influencing that will be the chemistry between certain players, every player in the squad has the potential to establish themselves in the manager's plans providing they do as he says and ultimately the manager won't mind them not being the best players in our squad or good enough for the first 11 of our rivals as it is always the case with him that the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts.

It is exciting in that sense, anybody could establish themselves, Nani could return and do that if he listens to the manager and does as he wants. According to Herrera he was dropped because he didn't wait for the ball as asked by the manager but most on here would preferred the manager to have played Herrera still instead of Rooney as the 8, contrary to the opinion on here the manager thought Valencia was the best player in the cup against Arsenal, he doesn't see what the normal person sees, he judges in relation to his instructions. It's exciting because anything is possible next season ranging from great success to epic failure, most other managers would just play their best 11 but Louis van Gaal in his pursuit of a highly effective cohesive unit will look to field his best combination.

4071~~~
I don't see him ever being someone who starts every game because he just isn't good enough but he will get plenty of games and will be an important part of the squad because he is versatile and will be trusted to plug gaps. His lack of mobility really holds him back and his passing isn't good enough to be a top cm.

4072~~~
Barry had a defensive game, Blind has none. You can't compare the two on that standpoint, total polar opposites. Third choice defensive mid, and second choice Left back is the only way we can accommodate him in the team. Anything else, we're gonna find ourselves in some trouble.

4073~~~
No. 

We have to stop looking for the carbon copy replacement. We did it with Keane and Scholes and were disappointed, and we will be with Carrick. Blind has some of the qualities needed, we now need to find a midfield partner with the missing bits.

Barry is nowhere near as good as either of them.

4074~~~
Agreed that he's nothing like Carrick. Disagree that Barry was <i>"nowhere near as good"</i> as Blind.

Blind does nothing that Barry couldn't do. Absolutely nothing. He sits in the hole, collecting the ball and plays the most basic, unadventurous passes all game. Unlike Carrick (for whom some people foolishly claimed the same) he doesn't play it through the lines, he can't control a ball well unless it's rolled into his path, he can't turn, his one-touch game is non-existent (and his two-touch game lacks any zip or speed).
And then his defensive game, beyond the basics of 'if you're stood there, you're bound to make a challenge or clearance occasionally' is poor.

I genuinely wonder if I'm watching the same Daley Blind as everyone else.
Seeing as it's just me, clearly I am.

4075~~~
This idea that because he doesn't give the ball away, he's doing a great job is surely at the root of the Blind praise. I can't think of anything else.

Fair play to him for always making himself available (which I guess is an upgrade on some of our recent midfielders), and rarely giving the ball away (there are players who would somehow give it away, even if they had the space he usually does) but the difference between him and the midfielder regulars in top sides is that they play the ball as securely while actually moving it in dangerous areas and affecting the tempo of the game.

Alonso and Carrick are two grand examples, their movement (especially Carrick's) wasn't always zippy, but their passes were.
If your passing isn't going to be zippy or go between lines regularly, then at least having a solid defensive game <i>or </i>the ability to carry the ball into a dangerous area (Vidal, Toure) and break the lines.

Blind lacks all of that.

4076~~~
If you cant think of any reason other than keeping the ball, then thats a problem on your end

More often than not Blind did a good job winning the ball and made more passes than Carrick. There are some things he definitely needs to improve on but theres no reason to just lie and pretend he doesn't do the things he does well already. He has some things he brings to the team already, now he just needs to add to them by being slightly more adventurous with his passing (because hes already shown, particularly for the Netherlands, that he can play some fantastic attacking passes), improve his organizing influence (2nd season, perfectly natural for him to feel more at home, authoritative and know his teammates better)

4077~~~
Give me those reasons then?
"pretend he doesn't do the things he does well already" - What <i>are </i>these things? The basics? I've already said that it's fair enough that he's always willing to make himself available, and doesn't give it away. Credit to him for that. It's an upgrade on some of the midfielders we've had lately.

What are these things he does, though? It's not a Carrick case, we're he's genuinely doing a quietly effective defensive job, or his one/two-touch passing is brilliant, or his passing is setting the tempo or moving the team forward.
One Carrick pass is often worth more than three Blind passes, in my opinion. Carrick can pass from better areas, because he's better at controlling a range of passes. His default is a forward-thinking pass. Blind has to position himself in areas where he's under no pressure to receive the ball, and then his default is a basic pass, which does nothing to change/increase the tempo or break lines. 

I've given my reasons why he's under par:
<i>He sits in the hole, collecting the ball and plays the most basic, unadventurous passes all game. Unlike Carrick (for whom some people foolishly claimed the same) he doesn't play it through the lines, he can't control a ball well unless it's rolled into his path, he can't turn, his one-touch game is non-existent (and his two-touch game lacks any zip or speed).
And then his defensive game, beyond the basics of 'if you're stood there, you're bound to make a challenge or clearance occasionally' is poor.</i>

And I don't see much of that (mostly down to his mobility) improving enough. So what actually is it that he does so well? Don't just say <i>"If you can't see it...."</i>

4078~~~
Please dont reply to a post you havent read

4079~~~
So there's nothing other than "he makes more passes than Carrick"....
Great.

4080~~~
If that was all then thats all I would have written. It isn't. Why do you have a problem with telling the truth?

4081~~~
I'm struggling to see actual traits. You say he did a good job winning the ball, which I wouldn't agree with. I'd say that he's not particularly skilled at winning the ball and often resorts to professional fouls as people break past him. He's bound to make <i>some </i>tackles and clearances, due to simply being in a holding role, but he's not skilled at it.

You say he makes more passes than Carrick, which frankly doesn't tell much. Carrick's average pass does more for the team. He passes into better areas, and can pass from a better range of areas. Blind's passing (both where he passes to and from) slows the team down. Credit to him for not giving it away much, though.

You then go on to state: "theres no reason to just lie and pretend he doesn't do the things he does well already. He has some things he brings to the team already" without actually saying what these other things are. You mention that he can play a good long ball over the top occasionally, but his actual passing through the lines is non-existant. As is his one-touch play. His two-touch play is slow.

I'm asking what they are. I've given a number of reasons why he's under par. I'm asking for what he does well as a midfielder.

4082~~~
I think you must be.

I see a player who never gives the ball away, is brilliant at positioning himself to receive the ball where he wants it, has a great touch and one touch passing ability, and was under clear instructions when playing defensively that it was not his job to attempt incisive passes.

The main downside is his lack of physical presence, but early in the season he played too smartly for it to matter. It only started to matter when he tired towards the end. My assumption is that with a proper rest/pre season and a years PL experience he will address that next season.

4083~~~
Never giving it away is barely a significant trait when you're as unadventurous and deep as he is. There was a time when Cleverley's stats. were also high in this area. The real deal is never giving it away, while actually using it well. Actually moving the ball into advantageous areas, while keeping your completion rates high.

He's 'brilliant at positioning himself' in the sense that he's pretty much always so deep that nobody on the opposition's team can get to him. If you're constantly in areas where the opposition allow you to have it - it's probably not such a great position after all.
Give him the ball under pressure and he looks rushed and susceptible to losing it. He lacks the ability to turn well with the ball, or dribble. 
It's night and day between him and serious deep lying midfielders. They can receive the ball in a wider range of areas. Always finding space is hardly praiseworthy when you're constantly dropping as deep as he does and then look dodgy in tighter areas. It slows the team down, especially when he then proceeds to pass without any zip.

His one-touch game isn't great. I'd say standards would have had to drop, but he barely plays one-touch anyway. His two-touch game is slow.

Carrick makes passes through the lines when in the exact same role. I've seen Smalling make a number of them. Blind simply doesn't have it in his locker to do it regularly or effectively. This would all be fine if he could actually defend really well to compensate, but he can't.

4084~~~
The underrating of Barry is hilarious. Comparing Blind to him is not an insult, it's about the level Blind is at. They are both left footed versatile defensive minded midfielders who aren't the quickest. If anything, the comparison is harsh on Barry who's done it at a higher level in the league.

4085~~~
Statistically he defends better than Carrick.

Tackles won: Blind 43, Carrick 19
Interceptions: Blind 81, Carrick 31
Clearances: Blind 69, Carrick 37.

Blind has played a few more games, but even at average per game, Blind still comes out on top.

Blind has also created more chances, delivered more 'key passes' and dispatched significantly more forward passes this season than Carrick. Carrick has the highest average pass length in the squad, with 20m. Blind is 2nd with 18.5m. But Blind has no passing range, right?

Blind also has more goals and assists. Not bad for a player who is "unadventurous".

4086~~~
Right...

So on one hand, people go on about Carrick's undervalued ability to defend quietly, and without tackling, by using positioning and closing off lanes... yet here Carrick having fewer tackles etc. is proof that he's weaker defensively? I haven't seen Carrick need to professional foul like Blind does, and I haven't seen Carrick get rinsed on the break like I have Blind. Blind is busier, but Carrick does a better defensive job.

Created more chances when? Per game? Over the season? He played left back, Carrick played fewer games, and a higher percentage of them were 'big' games. Average pass length means little. A pass to the left back isn't the same as a pass between the lines (a Carrick pass to Rooney is a common one), even if they travel the same length.

Blind played more basic forward passes than Carrick. He's played more passes, period. As I've said, he drops extremely deep and plays extremely safe passes. Blind has one goal more, and has more assists, because he played more.

They aren't even in the same league. Carrick's one-touch, two-touch, passing through the lines is much better. Thus his passing is zippier and allows him to increase/reduce the tempo more effectively.
Carrick can receive a wider range of passes in a wider range of areas (an example being his common chest control, followed by a pass, whereas Blind only wants the ball rolled into his path, and positions himself accordingly). He's rarely rushed in possession under pressure (not the case for Blind), he can turn much better on the ball and turn out of danger, and he defends better. I do not see one area where Blind is level, let alone better. And his limitations make it unlikely for him to reach Carrick's level.

4087~~~
If Carrick was defending purely with his positioning, then he would naturally win more interceptions if he's closing off lanes rather than making tackles. He only played 7 games fewer than Blind, yet has 40 fewer interceptions. Blind has done better in that regard.

It's not really an issue where Blind has played on the pitch to achieve the stats he has. You're criticising his range of passing and his overall passing ability. If anything, his ball retention at left back should go in his favour and not against him, as he was constantly seeing the ball under more pressure out on the left than deep in midfield, and has done very well in both situations. So I'm not sure how that can be used against him.

I'm not even disputing who the better player is here. I still think it's Carrick, but the disregard of Blind's ability is just false. Statistically, his ball playing is very good, his defending is very good, the overall opinion of him after most of the games he has played this season has been very good, but that's been written off purely as "over-praise".

So, the stats are meaningless and the plentiful positive reactions are over exaggerated, so I guess the guy just can't win no matter what he does.

4088~~~
Closing off passing lanes would mean the pass isn't attempted, and the opposition pass to a less dangerous area instead. His interceptions wouldn't be higher in this case.

Left/right backs aren't under pressure much more than an extremely deep lying midfielder for most of the time they have possession. The default pass for any left back is the deep midfielder or the centre back. They then play the risky pass if they manage to regain the ball deep in the oppositions half. Four out of five passes (random estimate) wouldn't be pressured/difficult passes. I do think he's better at left back, though.

He's not a bad player, and he has general football intelligence, but I'm simply asking what Blind actually does that can't be provided (with benefits) by somebody else. Stats. truly don't really say much, but when you watch him, it's clear that he isn't comfortable with the ball in more congested areas (which limits his movement), he doesn't pass between the lines, he can't turn well, he doesn't play one-touch, and he plays the rest of it in such a way that slows things down, but never speeds it up (which is crucial). On top of that he just isn't great defensively - he's bound to make tackles etc. but he isn't skilled defensively.

All I'm seeing is a guy who has a nice, simple first touch, provides a very deep outlet, and plays mostly simple passes at the same speed. Defensively, he has basic nous, but is turned quite easily, dribbled past pretty easily on the break, and can't jump.

For a guy who people have claimed can reach Carrick's level, I'm asking for non-statistical (because they're pretty dodgy) reasons behind this.
In one of the other threads, people were claiming that he speeds play up better than Carrick, is better at quick passing, and links up better with the higher midfielders, which is, frankly, the complete opposite of reality. Things like this lead me to believe he's being praised for things he simply doesn't do.

4089~~~
The stats aren't meaningless, but they are rudimentary and you're reading far too much into them. Making more tackles and interceptions ≠ better defending, hence why Sir Alex and Maldini said this:

4090~~~
This alone makes me wonder how much you actually watched him this season? He is one of the best in the team for receiving the ball under pressure and moving it into space.

4091~~~
We'll have to disagree.

He puts himself in a deep position, almost between the centre backs, in order to receive the ball. In some cases (West Brom) he'll have the whole of the opposition team ahead of him. In other cases (Everton at home) the strikers will be semi-close to him, and in some cases (City away) they'll squeeze, and he'll struggle.

From that position he may burst into the more congested area to go for a loose ball or a tackle, but he doesn't like the ball given to him in that area, hence he'll move deeper. The problem with this is that it moves the ball back out of the more dangerous areas, and then when he has it, he rarely plays it back into those areas or between the lines. He rarely increases the tempo or initiates an attack. 

I've literally just been watching four or five "every touch" videos to make sure I wasn't seeing things. The West Brom away, Leicester home, City away, Everton home. I just didn't want to post them and annoy everyone even more.

4092~~~
I'm looking forward to see what will happen with Blind next season. LvG confirmed he was a fixed starter this season and that he bought him for midfield. He's not fully compareable to Carrick, so I'm not going to compare them. Carrick obviously was a better holding mid last season.

People say he's a utility player but except from holding mid or leftback he's not got any other positions he's good at. He's no centreback or box-to-box midfielder and will never be one, he can only do a job there in a severe injury crisis. Many people here write him off for the midfield completely, but I don't think that'll be the case. I think he has the potential to become a vital cog, he has only played 1,5 years of his professional carreer as midfielder and is only 24.

Blind has specific strenghts: a good short passing game, he's got a great long ball too but doesn't use it as often yet. He's an intelligent player and not a real agressive ball-winner which many seem to think. He's never been one at Ajax, he was part of their midfield who put high pressure on opponents though. In van Gaal possesion based football Blind can certainly do the same, the whole team needs to do this effectively though otherwise it backfires. 

His biggest weakness is that he's no athlete. He's got a great engine but isn't very quick, tall, agile or strong. With exception of the latter those things won't change and he's had that his whole carreer against him, but he still managed to earn a transfer to Ajax and Manchester United. This is because of his leadership on the pitch and his intelligent movement, shielding of passing lanes and ability to put opponents under pressure. With his brain he makes up for his lack of physical traits. His multifunctionality also helps and he seems like a really down to earth lad aswell.

He's a great leftback to have and I have no doubt he'll get his games there aswell. I doubt he'll ever become first choice leftback though.

I think Blind can prove the doubters wrong like he also did at Ajax, but at the worst he'll be a great backup leftback/holding mid.

4093~~~
If we take into consideration that it was his first season in a foreign country and at the highest level, his overall contribution was good. Nobody expected of him to have the same impact he had in the second half of of the 2013/14 season when his utilization in the midfield literally changed Ajax's fortune for the better. On the other hand, it's clear that he still has some distance to travel in order to reach Carrick's level. But with Carrick at 34 and with many doubts about his fitness levels, maybe looking for a ready-made solution in that neuralgic holding midfielder position is the right thing to do. The difference between having and not having Carrick on the pitch, especially in the big games and away from home, was chaotic.

But, given the fact that we'll have European games next season and that we'll probably aim to win a domestic cup, i'm sure he'll get a lot of playing time. I won't be surprised if he eventually makes it as a midfielder here, he won't be either the first or the last player LvG has improved in his managerial career. I wouldn't dismiss the idea of him being used as a LB though, especially if we sign a creative player like Alves to play at RB. In that case Alves (or whoever) would operate more or less as a wing back while Blind, on the left side, would play deeper and closer to the CBs. We could potentially have a second player, besides Carrick, to provide the first pass out of the back and LvG could still have the four men he wants to defend (two CBs, Blind and Carrick). Not the most "symmetric' tactic but then again, this has never troubled van Gaal in the past.

4094~~~
Speak is going so OTT, ofcourse stats dont say everything but he is really acting as if does nothing during the entire match and just only plays it DDG, just not true.

4095~~~
We've seen this very well from Blind in the first half of the season where he was almost a wall in midfield with the opposition rarely getting past him. It was only when he got injured and recovered that we saw him somehow change his game and rely more on his weak athletic skills to defend during the second half of the season. Plus, he fatigued much more easily in the second half of matches during the second half of the season, so it is quite obvious that he still has to adjust to this league.

However, given his high intelligence levels and great reading of the game, I do think that he'll defend less aggressively and physically and more like Carrick, Alonso, and Busquets do in the second season. After having experienced what the Premier League is like during the first season, I'm sure he'll adjust his game like several foreigners did who relatively struggled during their first seasons. There was a reason people wanted him over Carrick during the first half of the season.

4096~~~
He was absolutely knackered after a long world cup (again, only 8 players covered more distance than him in the WC) and a new year stepping up majorly from the Dutch league to the Premier League. Injuries and playing some very demanding roles (he was a solo midfielder for a huge chunk of the season) meant he resorted to default and went on auto-pilot. His natural game is to press so that's what he'd do constantly, sometimes naively and recklessly. He showed a capability to hold and cover positions and not follow the ball plenty in the first half of the season. It seems silly to me that people think he can't rediscover that after some time off.

4097~~~
he's 25 , new club , new league , played on a team that was far from settled , played at lb , played in the WC. fecker did well.

4098~~~
At the very least, Blind will be a fantastic squad player to have, who can play two positions. But, if he develops as much as we hope he can, he could become a very important player for us, and a regular first XI player. 

Either way, I'd be surprised if he doesn't spend the bulk of his career at United.

4099~~~
Indeed. He does not strike me as a moving man, think he'll be a fine addition to the squad for quite a few years.

4100~~~
If you think Blind can become a vital clog for United in midfield...then I think its time I write off everything you said about Depay!

So he was so knackered after the world cup that he went to auto pilot...That is some fantastic bs.

4101~~~
Why did you delete your post <a class="username" data-user="76034, @Attila" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/76034/">@Attila</a> ?

And why does it have to be bullshit? An extremely heavy world cup load, a lack of pre-season and then a fast start jumping from the Dutch league to the Premier League and from Ajax to Manchester United is massive. Then, he's had absolutely no rest, even post injury, with him being one of a few players that Van Gaal insisted on rushing back in to the first team whenever possible (other injuries always helped demand this). 

He started to look tired physically, and I expect mentally too. Often tired and fatigued players start to lack concentration and focus, so instead start resorting to whatever they do best. Anyone who thinks that he spent the first half of the season pressing needlessly or recklessly are demonstrating revisionism because he didn't. He rarely got overturned, and would press at good moments with high success rates. Towards the end of the season, it seemed like pressing was his only option and teams were constantly able to get behind him.

4102~~~
I deleted the post so I could put both quotes into one (like above)

Edit - You must've read my other post so you should've know that it was only deleted to condense the point into one post? Not sure why you had to point that out

4103~~~
Out of curiosity, how much have you actually seen of Blind at Ajax? He's never been spectacular at things but he's got a footballing brain and a great pass in him. I certainly think he has potential to become a starter at 6 with his strong attributes, do I think he will? Not sure yet, but he has surprised me in the past so I'm willing to give a him a chance, especially after he's done well in his first year.

I don't rate him as highly as Memphis though. Him I can see reach a much higher peak and expect much more of, although that may take a while since he's younger.

4104~~~
When I started my response it wasn't there, just your reply to NL Max. You edited my bit in 5 minutes after the post was made. 

Anyway, why would you only reply to that bit and not the rest. Atleast give me some points on why it's bs?

4105~~~
I've seen nothing of Blind at Ajax. I would much prefer you <span style="font-size: 10px">to be right and me wrong about him but right now he doesn't look anything like a starting midfielder for United. He looks so weak and slow and I just </span>don't think he will be anything more than a squad player.  
<span style="font-size: 10px">
(I </span><span style="font-size: 9px">don't</span><span style="font-size: 10px"> know why the text has went so small....sorry)  </span>

4106~~~
Sorry mate in that case! 

I just don't think he is at the required quality for a United starter. He looks slow and very weak to me. First time I noticed it was the 5-3 defeat to Leicester and he hasn't filled me with confidence since then. Every time Carrick is injured I'm hoping that we have good luck because I know Blind won't be able to cover Carrick at all. Your argument about how he is tired from the world cup doesn't carry much weight for me because we have only had the league to compete in. If he can't handle that schedule then he will be hopeless when we are competing in Europe. 

Also I did think he pressed needlessly at times so I guess my memory is a bit shit <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

4107~~~
A lot of midfielders have lacked physical attributes and have made for it in other areas. His tackling and interception numbers show he has good technique in doing it so that's not an issue, and we know he's tidy with the ball at his feet. The one thing people almost always attributed to him in his first half of the season was his intelligence - and that's massive, and can more than make up for physical deficiencies. For his tackling and interceptions to be at the number they are, surely he has to either position himself well most of the time, or be nippy? In which case, his speed and strength shouldn't be much of an issue if he can learn to not stray too far.

As for him replacing Carrick, are you one of the 10 people who always rated Carrick at the level you do right now? I've always been a fan, but there's no way I saw him having the influence and importance he had this season. People have levelled so many criticisms at Carrick over the years, many not too dissimilar to Blind, and they were often justified too. Put it this way, even with Blind's poor end to the season, Carrick's had worse for United. He spent years in the shadow of Scholes, with people saying he wasn't a worthy replacement and didn't look United quality.

4108~~~
I don't know about Blind's stats...all I can say is he was bullied again Leicester and Everton in a way that shouldn't be acceptable at United right now. The man has no future as a first team player and will be a squad player for sure imo. 

Also about Carrick...yes I was gutted when we signed him instead of Ballack (I mean come on...Ballack vs Carrick in 2006!) but I was quickly won over by Carrick after his good and consistent performances for United. I can't say the same about Blind. I honestly don't think Blind will come close to Carrick in his career and he should consider himself very lucky to be at United.

4109~~~
Jesus many people are critical of Blind in here. I think he's a fantastic footballer and had a decent season. He was clearly suffering from fatigue in the second part of the season, played alot of games including a World Cup campaign. He reads the game really well, I was impressed seeing him live at Old Trafford. His positional awareness was something else. He's more than a utility player and deserves more credit. He will only get better and I can see him being an important player at the club in the next few years. The comparisons to John O Shea are absurd, Blind is a superior player. I like big John by the way but Blind has more to his game. He was threw in the deep end this year, how many positions did he have to play throughout the season? Technically excellent on the ball and reads the game as good as anyone. He was one of our better performers this season for sure. I wonder how many people in here actually watch the games at times.

4110~~~
yeah, like when Fergie himself. every offered another three-year extension, which led to some reaction on fanzines such as "Capable hands signing incapable feet" or the likes. every time he is praised, that is overpraising and overrating

4111~~~
This shows delusion, it's a very bizarre statement. Rooney couldnt make a fist vs league two sides in the FA Cup, therefore he should be only a squad player. If we follow you're reasoning..

4112~~~
Everyone played badly v Everton and im not sure how you can single Blind out against Leicester. 

Goal 1 was down to the Evans getting beaten in the air.
Goal 2 was the worst bit of refereeing youll see in years, and nowhere near Blind.
Goal 3 Cambiasso, nothing to do with Blind.
Goal 4 was Mata getting caught on the ball.
Goal 5 foul on Blackett not given and penalty.

4113~~~

This was Michael Carrick before he joined United. Blind is simply not capable of much of this. The zippy passing, the ability to move out of danger, the default setting to pass forward. He even had the ability to drive past a player with the ball, which just highlights his natural comfort on the ball.

The frustration with Carrick was, in part, because he was so capable and wasn't showing it.
Blind's just not nearly as capable.

Carrick didn't magically develop the ability to pass between the lines, or the ability to get the ball out of his feet, or turn on the ball, or to pass with zip. It was already there. He developed his spacial awareness and reading of the game, but the tools were there. Bar a few runs that he wouldn't attempt any more, this isn't far off a Carrick performance of today.

The criticism of Blind isn't the same. Nice high diagonal pass over the top, and a nice cross on him. 7/10 left back. Better left back than midfielder.

4114~~~
overall I don't think blind is first team quality. Those two games were just the first examples that came into my mind where he lost his positional sense and would get dragged out of position. 

I don't think he is anywhere near carricks level ability right now or when we signed Carrick from Spurs. He just seems like a good utility man

4115~~~
I meant more about how carrick brings a calmness to the side and brings structure. I thought Blind started to run around too much in those games instead of doing what I expect from a carrick replacement and steadying the ship

4116~~~
Its still a ridiculous statement, that you dont rate him is fine, but to write a player off on 2 games is ridiculous. If you maintain that criteria, nobody bar Carrick should play for United. Even DDG has had poor matches.

4117~~~
I don't mean he was only poor in those games. I've thought he's been pretty average in most of the away games (not when playing at left back where he's been good)

4118~~~
Its true that he's been far less good in away matches, but our whole squad is tbf, the likes of Mata have the same too. Our only away beasts have been ddg, smalling, young, they've been good away consistently. Rooney for example has only scored like twice in away games since March 2014.

4119~~~
wasn't carrick bullied a lot , just last yr v relegation fodder fulham he ducked out of a challenge and fulham equalised. didn't carrick lose an aerial duel v BM for the goal just before the half. he did continue to play for the sid didn't he? IMO carrick is not the hardest man ever to play in our midf.

4120~~~
Still, If Blind is our second DM after Carrick for next season...I will be so disappointed. He's just so average at DM but is a great second LB.

His passing his so cautious and sideways most of the time. Nothing like Carrick really

4121~~~
Statistics show that he actually passes forwards quite a lot and he has more assists and key passes than Carrick, Stats arent 100% exact but it seems you're quite wrong.

And Blind not even good enough at 2nd CVM, name a team in the BPL who'se 2nd DM was better than Blind this season, you"re going a bit over the top. Besides that, Blind has actually been better than Shaw at LB, who has had like 3 matches where he actually contributed something offensively

4122~~~
Man I don't care what the stats are...I'm just judging by what I've watched and he's a very conservative passer. Always looking for the safe option.

4123~~~
The stats are facts, I think you're basing something on your own fantasy, perception, which would make it unreliable. It's just like saying I dont think Neymar is a goalthreat, even though he's scored 38 this season.

4124~~~
So according to the stats Blind has more 'key passes' than Carrick...but I know for certain that Carrick is a better and more adventurous passer of the ball.

4125~~~
A few of us went through this earlier. Blind's default pass is the simple pass. Often when passing forward, it's to somebody dropping towards him, or unmarked. Carrick's passing goes into the more dangerous areas. He has the pass through the lines (often to Rooney) in his locker, that Blind simply can't/doesn't do. Carrick's default pass is forward. Just watching Carrick as he receives the ball - he's looking forward, and the sideways/backwards pass is a last resort. The simple pass is Blind's default.

His one/two-touch is zippy, whereas Blind's one-touch is largely non-existent, and his two-touch is slow. Carrick has the ability to increase the tempo, whereas Blind doesn't.
He makes more passes, period. But Carrick's passes do more. One Carrick pass will often do more than two Blind passes.

There are also stats. (tackles made, interceptions etc.) to <i>suggest</i> that Blind defends better, which is completely untrue.

There is no way on earth that Michael Carrick uses the ball like <i>this</i>, given the same amount of ball-time and space:<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV3Yt-asDNw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4126~~~
Blind is the best crosser in the team and he's provided some excellent passes from the left. Carrick is a better passer but he's rarely in the position to make great through balls in the current system.

4127~~~
Not saying it isnt, but you and speak act as if all Blind does is pass to Shaw,Valencia, and De Gea, which isnt true at all.

4128~~~
Dont agree, I dont think Carrick is actually that much better on the ball technically. Blind though can control the ball quick, and pass it fast. 

Carrick is another type of defender, but for the system we play in, Blind is a more pro active defender, who presses more. While Carrick shields the space more and blocks spaces where the ball could be passed.

Remember, Im not saying Blind is of Carrick's level, but you act like he's been Cleverley all season.

4129~~~
Yes I think he is a good Left back and appreciate his crossing. It's his passing as a DM that I find very sideways

4130~~~
Blind will look for the sideways pass more often compared to someone like Carrick. Honestly Carrick is leagues ahead of Blind and I've seen very little to suggest that he will be able to adequately replace him despite what the stats say

Edit - I think <a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> has explained my point better than I have so far

4131~~~
Blind is good at controlling the ball and passing it short. Very consistent with it. No doubt about that. He's also got a good long ball over the top, and a good cross on him. His connection with the ball is consistently clean. However, he largely does this controlling and passing in (and into) safe areas. That's not the true measure of a player's technique.

Carrick can control the ball in tighter areas (how many times have we seen Carrick control on his chest and volley/half-volley it off) he turns better on the ball, he dribbles better out of danger, his one-touch is better, his two-touch is faster, he has the trademark pass through the lines.
Carrick does it in (and into) dangerous and congested areas. It's not comparable.

Carrick doesn't need to position himself in certain areas in order to receive the ball. People give him all sorts of dodgy passes, and he controls it. Blind has to find himself more space in order to control the ball, because he isn't able to turn on the ball well, and doesn't have the quick feet for one-touch. I completely disagree that Blind passes it quickly. He has his moments, but his passing is mostly very one-paced.

4132~~~
Not true, maybe Blind passes sideways more but he doesnt look to do it more, Carrick is the better passer and can execute the most difficult of passes better. But everytime Blind gets the ball he looks forward, and he keeps the ball a bit too look if he can pass forwards, if he cant, yes he passes sideways. But with our lack of dynamism this season, thats happened more than we'd like. I remember this season having an arguement with someone, and 70% percent of Blind's passes were forward at that point of the season, so to act as if Blind just passes to Shaw, and Valencia, and Smalling is just untrue imo. Its fine if you think Carrick is better, cause he is, but those statements are just untrue imo.

4133~~~
I agree with your second part that Carrick does that better, but I dont agree if you say that Blind is non-existent in those area's, and further more. Blind primary plays really in front of the CBS's, picking the ball from there when we're in possession, helping defenders to distribute the ball, I think Carrick plays a bit more forwards and one of his more primary attacks is to also set up our attacks, as he has a better range of passing. It's slightly different roles. Blind also plays this role at Netherlands, whereas Clasie is more higher on the pitch, setting attacks up more.

4134~~~
Well I'm not sure it matters if he doesn't look to do it more because in the end he ends up passing it sideways. I think Carrick is better defensively and offensively compared to Blind as a DM. So if he ends up being the Carrick replacement it will be a step backwards for our first team 

You are right about Blind being more proactive and being a better presser but I feel he does it at the wrong time sometimes. Carrick seems to be much more aware about how the game is going and what to do next to control the game

4135~~~
The issue with this is that he rarely ever has an effect on the tempo. Not only does he never increase the tempo with his passing, but he sometimes slows it down, because he stations himself deep, has the ball rolled to him, takes a touch and then plays a pass to somebody who's barely more advanced than him.

You'll get situations where the main ball-player is requiring players dropping towards him too much, and this just slows things down again. Not giving the ball away is an achievement (of sorts) but that can't be where it ends. I don't think it's something Blind can just pick up, either. It's not something that Carrick just picked up (there's a video of him playing for Tottenham up there, pretty much playing the same way he does now).

It's not about being like Carrick, because Carrick isn't the be-all and end-all of midfielders. But it's a common skill that deep midfielders have/have had. Carrick is just a good reference for where Blind is lacking for this role.

That video above (versus West Brom) shows loads of 'forward' passes, but very few passes that get the team going, or pass the midfield lines. Most of those passes are the exact same pace, and go to one of the defenders or a midfielder dropping towards him.

4136~~~
Well but dont forget, this is his first season in the PL, a league at much higher pace, in a struggling side and after a long season and world cup, it was primary the 2nd half of the season where he's been below par imo, but I thought he was quite good in the 1st half, I think its silly to write him off after this already.

The proactive pressing is something that the whole team should do in order for it to be fully succesfull, look at Barcelona or Bayern, everybody presses, from Boateng to Lewa and from Mascherano to Suarez, at times we've done it to, and it has been brilliant. Blind has been doing this at Ajax and Holland very good (German national players even spoke about this), here at United. At times he's the only one doing it, and ofcourse he'll get caught out sometimes yeah.. but it's worked often too, that's why he has so many interceptions, blocks and clearances. It something which should improve in time, as its something that LVG usually implements in his team. If we had Strootman for example, we'd see it more.

4137~~~
Struggling out there a little now.

Tired legs + Slow Player + Yedlin = Tied in knots.

4138~~~
He is not a left back.

4139~~~
I think its primary the 2nd part of the season that he faced this problem, but especially in the start, I have seen him influencing our tempo with passing forwards, dribbles forwards, passes to the side. Especially in the later part of the season, he's been more of a third CB, than a #6 as Carrick is. But I even wouldnt be surprised if this is what LVG wants him to do, Blind spoke recently that LVG wants him to be tidy in possession, distribute the ball and wait for openings, furthermore he's more of a helper of our defence in possession than Carrick is.

He's 25 and its his first season in a new, far thougher league, he started good (people even opting for him as one of our best outfield players), ended far less, looked fatigued, but all in all, I think its a bit silly to completely write him off, and not even want him as a 2nd DM. Especially him, as I've seen him go from barely good enough for Groningen to being arguably one of the best LB's at the WC, he surprises quite a lot.

4140~~~
He'll be better next season, I don't doubt that. I just don't see the actual footballing skills required to do the role really well.
I struggle to think of a deep midfielder who didn't demonstrate these skills by 25, but maybe he'd be the first.

4141~~~
He might be one of the slowest players I have ever witnessed. No way in hell is he a leftback. Don't even want to see him as a back-up in that position for us. He is a decent midfielder. That's about it.

4142~~~
How was he vs USA? Heard he had a bad game.

4143~~~
Missed him vs Liverpool and Tottenham for example I suppose? Or at the WC, I really get tired of these statements..he's generally been good for us as LB, one poor match atmittedly, and he shouldnt be backup.

4144~~~
He was bad. Just send him on vacation, looks like he could use the rest. He looks even slower than normal

4145~~~
I also said Im not sure he'll can replace Carrick one day in this thread a few times, but he has the basic imo, and he compensates a lot with his intelligence. If he further adapts to the league, I think then the judgement should be make if he has what it takes too replace Carrick eventually.

4146~~~
Stupid post. He might not be a great left back, but he's shown (especially in big games vs Spurs and Liverpool) that he can capably fill in.

4147~~~
Yeah, he was crap. No doubt his critics will read far too much into one crap performance. S'all in the caf, yo.

4148~~~
He's a better left back than midfielder

4149~~~
No.

4150~~~
Yessss

Edit: best performances for us and Dutch there

4151~~~
His best bet is to focus hugely on improving his defensive game. As in, <i>huge</i> improvements.
An Alonso-Mascherano type combination, where he's the Mascherano. Passing with purpose just isn't his game, so he'd need somebody next to him doing the passing.

Again, I struggle to think of a top defensive-midfield-destroyer who didn't show the skills by 25, but maybe he'll be the first.

4152~~~
Imo rather not, I think with LVG further putting the team to his hands, Blinds style of defending would rather flourish. His style of defending, is something that suits the possession based teams when it's been done collectively.

My major improvememt for him is to be more decisive in his game, increase his passing game and read better when to go forward and when not to. We'll see, if he goes on like he did 2nd part of the season, LVG will buy a new DM, but I think he showed some real potential in the first half of the season. And he'll never be a destroyer, he doesnt have the physique for it.

4153~~~
To be fair. I dont think he should start for United, he is a usefull rotation player but Shaw and Carrick/ new player should be ahead of him in the picking order.

For our national team he could become a starter or even our captain in the future. Jetro Willems was a sensation a LB in the Eredivisie this season and also van Aanholt (Sunderland) is an option to play at LB. In midfield his main competitor is Clasie who isnt that good.

4154~~~
Yeah, I don't mean Mascherano's style of defending, but his level. If he becomes <i>that</i> good defensively, and has an Alonso next to him, he can pass simple as much as he wants. If he gets to that level, but does it with pressing, then that's great.

His passing just isn't going to improve significantly any more, so he's not going to become a dictator at any point.
To actually be great in this role, he's needs to either do a truly cracking defensive job or set the tempo with his passing. Right now he doesn't show the skills required for either job, but I'd say the defensive side is his best bet.

4155~~~
Oh okay, well lets hope. I doubt it, cause Mascherano is so good defensively that he even makes a top class CB. I dont think an Alonso type of player would ever play next to him, more a pressing box to bix with much physique and dynamism like Strootman, or Marchisio.

4156~~~
Has to be said, he got feck all help from Depay. Something the MUTV pundits made a big deal about. Would be a bit worried about playing them on the same wing together against really quality opposition.

4157~~~
I don't think most of us even expect him to be a dictator from midfield. This "dictator from midfield" issue has only arisen because we don't really have a chance creator through the middle whenever Fellaini has played as well as a midfielder with a good passing range.

Blind's passing range isn't that great, and I don't expect it to be as he's not a dictator for me. However, what he is is a defensive midfielder with great intelligence who can be an outlet for the other players to start off attacks and make spaces for the dictators/creators. In the first half of the season, everyone, not just those in here who admired Blind, talked about Blind being key to our possession play and attacks and how teams had to focus on closing him down to stop our attacks. He wasn't like Cleverley, Makelele, or Mascherano in that he'd not seek the ball and would quickly release it to the closest teammate. In a pass-and-move, fluid setup, Blind is very good and can also become a key player. Defensively, he's excellent and showed that he can screen the defence with his intelligence, positioning, and reading of the game. Offensively, he can up our tempo by moving forward with the ball or supplying the more creative players with quick passes. Again, he's not some schmuck footballer who runs around like a headless chicken.

His problems arise when there's no one else in the team with a good passing range or when he gets tired. We've seen it all too often that he's very easy to get past when he gets tired, and his involvement goes down to zero when he's tired. I just hope that he can adjust to the league's physical standards and not get tired to quickly as he's done in the second half of the season. Also, to make him our main dictator in midfield will cause us to be slow and sluggish in midfield as we've seen this season as he doesn't have the passing range or vision in midfield for such a responsibility. He's often been at his best alongside midfielders who seek to create chances and/or have a good passing range.

4158~~~
Criticism at Depay for not tracking back (enough) is quite harsh, but I guess they had to say something. I think at one point I even saw Memphis make a very nice defensive sliding near Holland's penalty area. And he was already the most dangerous attacking player, everything nice went via him in the first half and he looked very lively. I think it's a bit much to expect him to track back like a maniac too in that case. Especially considering it was literally the hottest day of the year and the whole team looked knackered after 60 minutes.

Blind wasn't playing a blinder, he was particularly weak at defending today and LCB BMI was dreadful, I'd say that was the reason Holland's left side looked vulnerable. Not because Memphis was so weak at tracking back.

4159~~~
I actually agree with him, he's either back-up LB or back-up CM for us but never a starter. He's intelligent and have a good cross in him but he really struggles with speed, that's why Young was there to help him with that. He had good games you mentioned but it was games we completely dominated, the opponents hardly have a chance to test him and I remember at least two situations when he was over sprinted with ease. It's a concern against more capable and smarter players than Andros Townsend. He's quite useful in combination when going forward but lacks that yard or rather three yards of pace to take on players, like Shaw does.. 

fullbacks in modern football definitely need to by pacey especially when playing with inverted wingers, they need to be ready up and down the wing which Blind simply can't provide due to his extreme slowness.. he's useful squad player though

How did he play today btw?

4160~~~
He wasnt signed to replace Carrick.

4161~~~
Firstly, I don't think he's great defensively. This is probably where our disagreement will centre. Aside from being very susceptible on the break, his reach, agility, and acceleration are poor. His positioning isn't yet great (while it improves, I think it's largely cemented by 25), and the fact that he has to make many more challenges than Carrick is a negative for me, rather than a positive - at least in his case. Just by watching Blind, I'm left with the impression that he's busy, but not a great defensive player.

I don't think his passing is quick at all, and I don't think he ups the tempo at all. In fact, I think that these are key issues for him, though his passing is secure and accurate.

If he's in the team to shield the defence and keep possession, then there are players who'll do a better defensive job and can make the same (mostly simple) passes that he makes. Schneiderlin would be an immediate upgrade, for example. He can even carry the ball and ride a challenge.

The thing is, he's not great at defending and he's not actually doing much with the ball. The standards have really dropped, if being available (really deep) and making a simple pass is worthy of praise. Carrick did/does this while doing more with the ball. Alonso did/does this while doing more with the ball. Verratti does this while doing more with the ball. Thiago...
It's merging the high passing percentage with purpose that's praise-worthy.

Right now, he's doing both jobs kind of well. But I don't see the tools there for a deep-lying playmaker who impacts game after game.

Edit: last line should say: "deep-lying <i>midfielder</i>", not "playmaker"

4162~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> maybe that's where you go wrong, he is no deep lying playmaker, he's a controlling/defensive midfielder. Who often have players besides them to make the play, create space and chances. 

In recent years we've had poor midfielders so Carricks has been that all for us, but if we have lets say a midfield containing Blind, Strootman and Herrera, it isnt neccesary for Blind to be our play maker, to get us in dangerous possession. It rather would be for him to link defence with attack and shield the defence for us. Only the best of the best can do that all, the likes of Busquets and Carrick 2012/2013, it would be great if we could get that, but that specific controlling role, could be a 'legit' role / part in a three mans midfield.

4163~~~
In that case, there are better players for that role. I still don't believe that a player more capable with the ball can't be implemented.
When Carrick plays the role, and injects speed and purpose in our play, we certainly don't look worse for it. That's what takes a team up a level. 

Even if it we break his role down to simply breaking up play and passing short. Even if that's literally all the role requires, and if all the bits that Carrick adds aren't necessary - Blind can be improved upon.

4164~~~
Lots of poorly thought-out revisionism in this thread of late. He's had a poor finish to the season but his contribution this season has been sizable.

Consistent, reliable and (twice) a match-saver. He played well during a time in which the rest of the squad was still coming to terms with the demands of the manager and I think he deserves credit for that kind of resilience.

He has his flaws, but he's a proper footballer that has had a good season, and anything to the contrary would be undermining.

4165~~~
He was up against a great team, sometimes you turn in a subpar performance.

4166~~~
Blind is our most overrated player right now. 

Anyone who thinks that he will be a starter next season is in for a shock imo

4167~~~
He shouldnt be more than a last ditch solution in the left back position. I really like him as a midfielder alongside someone like Carrick. But he really is way too slow to play on the sides. He had some good performances for us there but generally I've never been too impressed with him as a left back.

4168~~~
<a class="username" data-user="79807, @Sammyjunn" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79807/">@Sammyjunn</a>, I realised I said "deep-lying playmaker" in that  other post. Meant "deep-lying midfielder".

4169~~~
Give examples, who are attainable for us. If we were to play that role, Blind is one of the better options for us. Ideally we'd go for the likes of Busquets, Veratti, Martinez, Schweini but there's no way that there coming our way. We need a DM who has the intelligence to play in a dominant possession based team, has good passing, reads the game well, and can link up defence and midfield. The name I hear the most is Schneiderlin, but the likes of Matuidi, Kondogbia etc are different tyoes. But this is, if LVG would want to make us play that brand of football, not that Blind and LVG are buddies, and that's why he's here, but I think only LVG would buy Blind, because he fits in his 'philosophy'.

4170~~~
Aaah, quite a difference.

4171~~~
Right now? Ensure we secure Schneiderlin or Schweinsteiger alongside a more advanced midifelder. 
If they don't materialise? Get in that advanced midfielder, pray that Carrick's fit for most of the year, and hopefully that player is available next summer. 

I don't think Blind is (or will be) good enough, but I won't keel over if he has to play. I think it needs sorting out soon though, because Carrick's not around for much longer.

4172~~~
Think only Schneiderlin is a possibility, but even him, he's doing good at a midtable team, no idea how the step up will be for him. Just like until now, also due to injuries, Lambert, Shaw, Lallana, Lovren all havent been able to continue their form at Soton at a bigger club. 

We'll see, LVG will adress the situation, just like he's sorted our wing out by buying, hasnt signed Falcao. He knows our squad now, and will know he's coming in and going out.

4173~~~
Carrick made a lot of mistakes that led to goals when he first joined, which is partly why he took a lot of stick at the time. I think theyre fairly equal at the same age, with different strengths and weaknesses.

4174~~~
wow, just wow

4175~~~
Carrick was repeatedly dropped in the 2010 season. Hes not always been our best midfielder and its stupid to overlook that when comparing new joiners like Blind. Compare them at similar stages in their careers.

We did the same thing comparing Carrick to Scholes/Keane when he joined, whilst forgetting there was a time SAF didnt know what to do with Scholes and Keane was on the decline from his injuries.

4176~~~
Since he was a fixed starter this season and van Gaal mentioned he's after a right-sided midfielder, you might be the one in for a shock..

4177~~~
Don't bother mate, hes clearly one of the many that have mastered the art of revisionism. Two good games in a row and he'll be the tits again.

4178~~~
Even Blind's good games aren't that good.

4179~~~
always this, we had quite a functioning midfield back then, Fletcher was a regular at the time, and that gave conditions for Fergie's rotation. The time I would say Carrick was extendedly dropped for stupid performances was after that match against LvG's Bayern, which was a comprehensible thing to do. Otherwise I don't see the difference in his contribution to the team, remember at the beginning of his time here Carrick was given license to roam back and forth a bit, but later he had to hold back and all the "crab" stuff appeared

4180~~~
This.

4181~~~
i think if we went back to the carrick thread when he was bought right through his first season you'd see the same shit only different said about his game v keane. "he passes well but he's soft" "scholes is the heartbeat of midf." etc. same here different players doing the job. blind is slow but smart and should be better his second season. when i think over rated on this side i look at ADM , Falcao and shaw. all did less for the team and cost loads more.

4182~~~
You wot m8? Overrated? Have you read the comments on here lately? It seems that most think he's pretty shit these days. The positive comments regarding Blind are definitely in the minority. He was maybe overrated at one point, but that was a long time ago now. He's a decent squad player, the majority would agree on that. Some of the criticisms is OTT and laughable, though.

4183~~~
Blind is doing as expected. Solid, clever, puts in a shift and is versatile and pretty consistent. I can't see how he is overrated. Shaw, Falcao (wages) and ADM cost so much more and have flopped massively so far whereas Blind has been one of our more shrewd signings. No nonsense, gets on with the job and is doing pretty good considering he is also learning the league along with players who people use that excuse for constantly. I could only imagine he will get even better next season.

4184~~~
Pretty much this, bought for relatively low fee, first season in the league, scored two goals (both of which ended with draws), been thrown around left-back, defensive midfielder and even a central defender when we've played this 352 abomination. Done good job, looked shaky/shitty at the end of the season, probably due to WC fatigue or whatever, can't see how he's overrated.

4185~~~
And you think Blind hasnt been told to hold back? Watch him for NL or Ajax.

It wasnt rotation in 2010. Fletcher was playing better and Carrick had the run around a few times.

4186~~~
30 league games 22 starts, 8 European games 6 starts, hardly being repeatedly dropped until after that Bayern game.

okay, even to recognize his "poor form" in 2010, every player would experience a low period during a long career, a very normal fact for every professional sportsman. and Carrick's career at United was as consistent as it gets, a period of drop for around generously speaking half a year.

4187~~~
He's not overrated. He's not a great player, and has been (in my opinion) credited with attributes that he doesn't have, but most seem to accept he's a stop-gap, and ultimately a squad player/back up for midfield. There was a time when people seemed to get carried away, and forgot just what Carrick brings to the side, but that didn't last long.

4188~~~
You've mainly focused on the physical attributes and passing range/vision when talking about Blind. All you've focused on are his weaknesses and ignored his strengths that contributed to his excellent performances during the first half of the season.

You talk about getting Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger for the defensive midfield role, but both don't suit the role in our setup. Schneiderlin is best suited to a team that sits deep with a compact defence (quite a hypocritical choice as well*), and Schweini is a box-to-box midfielder and in no way is a deep-lying midfielder. What you seem to want is either a physical destroyer or a deep-lying playmaker; basically, you want the flashier sort of deep-lying midfielders.

This is 2009/10 Carrick all over again...

*

4189~~~
Schneiderlin is more than capable of doing the job in a forward-thinking side. Southampton often played on the front foot under Pochettino.
It's not hypocritical. I never said Schneiderlin was better than Carrick defensively. But, using my eyes, the times I've watched him, he's been extremely hard to break past, his standing tackle is level with Matic (if not better) as best in the league, and his positioning is sound.

Blind has no <i>real</i> strengths, other than being available (albeit almost always very deep) and ball retention. And even his passing is slow, basic, and never sets the tempo, rarely breaches the midfield lines, and is rarely rarely one-touch.

I'm yet to see a genuine strength. Carrick may have been criticised, but he had the genuine strengths, with his much superior passing, much sounder defensive game, tidier feet, and he even had the ability to carry the ball a bit back then. If he was being criticised, it was a case of getting him to use those tools.

I've focused on his physical attributes and passing range, because these are at the root of him being under par.

Edit: Also, how is a deep-lying playmaker 'flashy'? Carrick wasn't flashy. People used to say he didn't get credit because he <i>wasn't </i>flashy. Some can be flashy, but being flashy isn't a requirement. Someone like Schneiderlin isn't flashy either.

4190~~~
The hypocrisy was related to you criticising Blind for being busier due to his higher numbers yet mentioning Morgan who has definitely been busier than Blind has been this season from midfield. Also, under Poch, Morgan based his game on his aggression and energy levels. Even under Adkins, he was all over the place and closing down tons of spaces. Matic and Schneiderlin are very similar defensively, and I'm not saying that he's positionally poor, but his game is more about his aggression and energy levels than sound positioning and reading of the game.
You're ignoring Blind's strengths that made him a key deep-lying midfielder for Ajax and for us during the first half of the season. You completely disregard his intelligence on the pitch, his decision-making, and his reading of the game. When we had Fellaini and Mata in midfield in our 4-3-3 during the first half of the season, Blind was a key player in closing down the passing lanes, reading opposition attacks, and giving us a more solid defensive shape. It's only since his injuries that he's started playing completely differently.
Ever since Xavi and Pirlo rose to prominence, deep-lying playmakers have come under the lens. Coincidentally, Carrick also rose in importance during this time, and we saw this epitomised in 2011.

4191~~~
Water Carrier? Even they have their function. I think that's a tad harsh tbh, his strength is a very good football brain - being tactically aware and being able to execute the correct pass most of the time.

4192~~~
I pointed out that Blind having more tackles didn't make him a better defensive player than Carrick, which was being implied.
I didn't say that having better numbers makes you worse. I also didn't compare Schneiderlin to Carrick at all.
Schneiderlin could make more tackles, interceptions, clearances... than Blind and it wouldn't change my opinion that he's superior defensively. He oculd make fewer, and I'd still think the same. I couldn't even tell you how many tackles, clearances, interceptions they actually make, but when I watch them, I can see who's better defensively.

I've never said that being an aggressive defensive player is a negative. I'm not criticizing Blind for being busy (there's more than one way to be effective in the role, and Carrick's way isn't the blueprint) but in Blind's case, I think he's busy without being <i>that </i>good. You may argue that Schneiderlin is just as 'busy' as Blind, but he's better while doing it.

This is my point. I don't think he <i>does </i>close down passing lanes particularly well. He's intelligent, and you can tell he has a good understanding of the game, but beyond the basics of sitting really deep, having a good (not great) understanding, and being there, I don't see a particularly skilled breaker-up of play. On top of that, he's iffy on the break. Maybe it's what he does best, but he's not great at it.

Maybe I'll have to go and re-watch some early games, but if it's the games like QPR (which I suspect had a big impact on everyone's memory of the early part of the season in general) then I don't take much from it.

I actually wouldn't dispute this. I'd agree totally, and I've argued that Xavi's impact has even made Scholes go up in value. But these players are important, whether they're fashionable right now or not. The best teams around have somebody doing something, to some degree, like those guys.

4193~~~
See, if that's the best that can be suggested then it says it all, really.

A very good football brain is a minimum requirement for this role. It's a base-level skill.
And then his passing. You say "correct" pass. I can agree that he's a very tidy and consistent short passer, and gets brilliant weight on these short passes.

But if that's pretty much where his strengths begin and end, well that's not much is it? The top midfielders wouldn't even consider these amongst their real strengths. These are their base-level skills.

The problem is that this is pretty much where the skill-set ends for Blind.

4194~~~
Pretty much sums it up perfectly. Not really sure why a lot of people seem so keen to downplay him when he's had a really positive contribution to the team. 

Blind won the Eredivisie player of the year award last season playing as a defensive midfielder, and that was after being converted to the position a year or two beforehand. He's faced much harder opposition at United, and he's done well. Having had a year of Premier League experience and more time in the midfield role, I expect him to have an even better season this time around.

4195~~~
I agree.

4196~~~
Well that's not true. You've watched Gerrard play football, right?

4197~~~
The epitome of a nothing player. Except when left back where he's decent imo.

4198~~~
The football brain is the most important requirement. It's the skill which separates at the highest level. Intelligence can compensate for other factors but other factors can't compensate for a lack of intelligence. This is a defining trait in the players demanded by philosophies such as LvG's.

4199~~~
A very useful and reliable player who can be utilized in multiple positions and is reliable when called upon. Not a starter when we are at full strength but a very important squad player non the less.

4200~~~
Sorry, I meant deep midfielders.
I'm not deny that. I'm saying that it's a given. Having the brains is crucial, but you wont be good just because you have it.

4201~~~
What about Makalele then? What other exeptional qualities did he have?

4202~~~
How is he overrated? The way people have talked about him lately you'd think he'd struggle to play in League One!

4203~~~
His defending. He was a much better defender, in just about every way.
Maybe Blind will get there in that regard, but his lack of acceleration, pace, agility, reach is against him, even if he takes his reading of the game up a level.

4204~~~
carrick like in those areas , carrick passes better , blind tackles better.

4205~~~
Carrick's turning isn't great, but still trumps Blind's.
Blind tackles better/more, but Carrick defends better.
Their passing abilities are miles apart.

4206~~~
blind is carrick's age when he arrived at united. carrick was hardly the player what he was two yrs ago. and who did blind partner with? yep not scholesy , who was the one who dictated the tempo. blind was surrounded by FNG's not a settled team. he'll be fine because he's smart. i would still get in another midf like fergie did with the broken down canadian only don't buy a broken down canadian.

4207~~~
People still expecting Blind to be an identical replacement for Carrick.

4208~~~
No, Carrick is just a good reference point for where Blind is lacking.

4209~~~
again like we looked at carrick v keano. and still do.

4210~~~
But Carrick had his obvious qualities. Whether they were the same qualities as Keane's isn't important. 
Blind doesn't actually have obvious qualities.

4211~~~
lol - your opinion mean nothing to me after this statement.

4212~~~
What are they? I'd love to know.

4213~~~
Are those qualities you associate with Makalele?

4214~~~
It is possible that Carrick defends better in a team that sits deep where positioning is the primary attribute you need. But in a team that uses a pressing defense Carrick isn't very great at all while Blind is perfectly suited to it and at his best in such a system.

4215~~~
To a greater extent than Blind. Makelele was shorter, with a lower centre of gravity and was more agile. He had good reach and was athletic. You'd back him to get a toe to the ball before most of his opposition. While he wasn't quick, he wasn't slow. Blind is actually slow.

Even looking back at old videos of Makelele at his old clubs (albeit a tiny sample), he was showing agility with the ball, higher up the pitch.

4216~~~
and doesn't he also have the same problem when pressured? to play the great passes carrick needs more time. when other teams press us carrick is not at his best.

4217~~~
He does indeed. But I have a hard time holding it against Carrick considering that Blind hasn't really been tested against the teams who deploy pressing tactics to the greatest levels. Against Chelsea Oscar was put on a man marking role against Blind and LVG/Blind managed to turn that in to a tactical advantage for us by having Blind pulling Oscar around as we wanted to. 

I'd say they still took Blind out of the game a fair bit, it is just that he doesn't carry as much weight on his shoulders for our offensive game as Carrick. Carrick would probably also be able to repeat that type of intelligent and unselfish performance though.

4218~~~
Reads the game defensively well - he makes up for his physical traits by being at the right place at the right time to intercept a ball. He's also a great midfielder in a possesion based team since he can put high pressure on opponents - once the whole team does this we'll dominate even more possesion. That's exactly what van Gaal wants and I don't think Carrick is as good as Blind at this.

He's been an outlet for a defence who's struggled to adapt to van Gaal. He's always available for a pass and keeps the game ticking.

Tidy technique, his short passing is excellent. He can certainly give long passes but he didn't do it as often in his first season here, likewise at Ajax. He definately has potential to be a deep lying playmaker though since he has a great pass in him.

Versatile, he can play leftback and 6 well. He can do a job at box-to-box and centreback, but those will never be his position.

4219~~~
Speak why do you act as if Carrick is fast, agile, and has acceleration? I think Blind has these attributes more than Carrick.

4220~~~
This is fair enough. I don't agree totally. I think Carrick looked fine there this season, and his positioning was still an asset. 
And I don't think Blind's <i>perfectly </i>suited to it (especially as the last line ahead of the centre backs).

4221~~~
I think the bigger issue is that we play one of our central midfielders inside the opponents box. So when we lose the ball we're not playing Blind behind two central midfielders but rather Blind as a defensive midfielder with only Herrera to help him out. Herrera himself also likes pushing forward so very often we have Blind more or less alone as a central midfielder while Herrera works his magic with Mata and Fellaini is inside the box.

Ideally when Blind starts the press, the other two central midfielders covers the inevitable runs from the opponents to cut off the passing options. 

Blind has done his job of aggressively intercepting to initiate pressure really well and he had the most interceptions on the opponents half I believe in the top leagues which shows that.

The problem is that there is no way Fellaini will track his man on the counter in case the initial pressure isn't working. The central midfield hasn't been working too great, that is a fact. But I would like to see Blind playing with a defensively better central midfield before making a call on if he can do it at the desired level or not.

I do agree that it has been pretty ugly at times seeing Blind aggressively trying to intercept a ball when Fellaini is inside the box and Herrera is close to it or out wide right. When it doesn't work it means there is going to be a good chance for the opponents and trying to play passively is probably a better idea. But like I said, the problem doesn't start there as hardly any defensive midfielder would look great when they are as exposed as ours has been due to that midfield composition.

Busquets looked terrible in the same situation for Barcelona earlier this season when their team wasn't clicking too well.

4222~~~
Left back for next season then with secondary options to cover midfield spots?

4223~~~
the most sensible possibility

4224~~~
Considering Darmian can play both flanks and Rojo was excellent at LB in the Copa, I wouldn't say that backup LB role is guaranteed.

Though knowing our injury fetish, he should still get plenty of minutes in both midfield and defense.

4225~~~
Having someone like Blind as a 3rd option at the CM position and a 2nd at the LB position shows intent.

4226~~~
He's our utility player.

Do not think he's a great cdm at this present time because he runs off too forward and leaves our CBs exposed.

4227~~~
He's just about not good enough to start for us, but with his versatility he's an excellent utility player.

Hopefully he stays for a few years before he gets tired of it.

4228~~~
He can play three positions (positions we had plenty of injuries in last year) so he'll get lots of games. I imagine even if Shaw is fit we wouldn't play him every week anyway because of his age and risk of overplaying him so Blind will probably start half our games as LB.

4229~~~
The Dutch O'Shea, and there's nothing wrong with that.

4230~~~
Can see LvG showing favouritism towards him at the start of the season and starting him ahead of Shaw at left back. Occasionally playing at #6, but even with Carrick and Schweinsteigers injury issues, as well as squad rotation, I still can't see him featuring there heavily.

4231~~~
Think a lot of people will be surprised by how often we play him in midfield next season. He was good their last season and with a proper pre-season at the club and a year in the league under his belt I hope he can step up another level.

4232~~~
level of Carrick, Schweinsteiger? hardly, so unless they are injured/used differently, no

4233~~~
That seems likely. I got the impression that LVG rates him and perhaps more importantly, considers him to be someone who understands the philosophy, so I suspect he'll find a way to include him in the starting 11 a lot of the time. I wouldn't be surprised if Blind gets about 25 PL starts in various positions while Shaw gets a similar number of PL starts to his 15 in 2014/5.

4234~~~
When we play 3-5-2 (which we inevitably will at some point) Blind will probably be the first choice LWB.

              Memphis (or whoever we sign) Rooney
Blind  Schweinsteiger Schneiderlin Herrera Darmian 
    Rojo (or whoever we sign) Carrick  Smalling
                                     GK

He will mostly be back up next season though if we play 4-3-3, but will get quite a few appearances in midfield, I reckon

4235~~~
I hope he can become a similar player to what Carrick has been for us over the years. Last season he was good, our fifth best player according to the match day ratings. That was with a new team, in a new league, with no pre-season with us, after a long world cup, and where he had to cover left back on numerous occasions. It seems to me he has every chance of going up a level this season.

4236~~~
Think he will start as first choice left back next season. I think LVG will ease Shaw in as the season progresses.

4237~~~
After the transfer window closed last year no one would have predicted Fellaini would play as many games as he did and be as important as he was so I think anyone writing Blind off (who had a very good debut season) because of the new signings is being a bit premature.

4238~~~
Carrick is only behind Keane and Scholes in terms of contribution for PL era United in central midfield. if he can pull off that will be amazing, but that is really not an easy ride at all

4239~~~
I think we will see a lot more of him in CM than some people expect this season. He will be part of the defensively minded group of midfielders containing Schweinsteiger, Carrick and him (and maybe Schneiderlin). We will want two of the group on the pitch in most games, and the other two are not going to playing every game for us.

4240~~~
I certainly won't want Blind and Carrick in midfield in a game

4241~~~
Unless we sign someone else his chances to play are great. Alonso and Schweinsteiger wasn't working out great for Bayern so it won't be a surprise if Carrick and Schweinsteiger has the same issues. I think it depends less on Blind and more on exactly who takes their chances and works well next to Schweinsteiger out of Mata, Herrera, Carrick and Di Maria. 

If the third midfielder is Mata or Di Maria I can see Blind in the double pivot next to Schweinsteiger. Ideally of course Carrick and Schweinsteiger plays there and form a great pairing but it seems more of a dream than realistic, at least for the biggest games. I can only see them either being incredible together with the passing range they have, or not a good enough fit.

4242~~~
Last season I liked that he found a way to use his own attributes to be effective at left back rather than trying to play the same way as Shaw, which he would've failed at. He's an intelligent player. Hopefully he learns something from Carrick and Schweinsteiger and can improve in midfield.

4243~~~
For sure those are high expectations, maybe I am overestimating him. He did tail off towards the end of last season but I put that down to fatigue. He had a big season with Ajax when he won Dutch footballer of the year, then a long WC (few players played more minutes than him) and then he was stepping up to a more physically demanding league and playing his first ever season without a winter break. That's a tough two years.

I don't see Schweinsteiger and Carrick playing as a partnership much next season. They are similar players nowadays as well as being our oldest midfielders and the most injury prone. I agree with you that it would basically be like trying to replicate the Alonso and Schweinsteiger partnership which didn't click at Bayern.

At the moment it's really hard to tell what Van Gaal has planned but imo a double pivot midfield seems the most likely and Blind would surely get his share of games alongside one of Carrick/Schweinsteiger. I thought it was very telling when Van Gaal announced he wanted a midfielder that he specifically stated he wanted a right sided one. That sounded to me like he wanted someone who could compliment Blind, not replace him.
