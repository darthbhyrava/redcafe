1~~~
I really hope he can pick up where he is left off from last season. He was scoring in almost every game towards the end and just settling in. Hopefully a full pre-season with the team will work wonders for him. He is our best #10. And a brilliant take from him for his goal against AS Roma today.

2~~~
Positive for me is he looks like our first choice no.10 don't want him shoehorned out wide.

3~~~
Like I said in the Rooney thread, I think both him and Rooney playing in their best positions will both have brilliant seasons. Hopefully Van Persie can stay fit as well because fit and on form there aren't many better world wide. That attacking trio, if they stay fit, can potentially be up there with the best attacks in the world. On paper it already is, but they just have to show it on the pitch.

4~~~
He's going to exceed the heights of 2012/13 when at Chelsea. Goals from midfield is something we have lacked for a while and he gives it.

5~~~
I am not sure that the 3 are the ideal combo in this formation as in player types. But we'll see..immense quality there.

6~~~
I don't know, people on here are a little too concerned about pace sometimes I think. While it is a huge advantage to be really fast, it's not the be all and end all. There's pace elsewhere and Rooney is no slouch, just not lighting quick. Quick play and quick and intelligent thinking has a much bigger impact for the speed the play, rather then a players actual pace. The 3 of them have brilliant movement and are such smart players, that even though there isn't somebody there who has blistering pace, I think they could still tear teams apart through their movement, skill, and just generally being so clinical.

7~~~
You always want the threat of pace behind the defence or they'll push up and squeeze. Don't doubt that they'd be able to carve teams open, but it would be a lot easier with a bit of real pace to keep the defence honest.

8~~~

9~~~
If we could get a holding midfielder to sit deeper so that Herrera can go forward and help attacks, then Mata will have a brilliant year.

10~~~
Can't believe the crap written by Ian Ladyman in the daily mail today about Juan Mata.

11~~~
what did he say?

12~~~
According to ladyman, Mata didn't play well, described his impact as negligible. Said he failed so much that Giggs played him off the bench in his fist game in temporary charge. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2707618/Louis-van-Gaals-arrival-Manchester-United-presents-huge-opportunity-Juan-Mata.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ited-presents-huge-opportunity-Juan-Mata.html</a>

13~~~
to be fair he also said he wasn helped by the fact that Moyes didn seem to know how to use him but yeah, he could have worded things better

14~~~
I must admit I thought he was one of the plus points of the second half of the season.

15~~~
I thought he played well given the disjointed first half of the season he had.

16~~~
The 'Mata was poor' narrative is one of those baffling situations whereby journalists openly pursue agendas even though the evidence all points to the contrary. Mata was probably our best player from February onwards. It's not saying much, I know, but he demonstrated a lot of quality come the end. 

Best player at the club for my money.

17~~~
Mata need's to have bodies around him to play properly, he isn't an athetic player who is going to dribble passed 2 players, but give him a player to bounce the ball off or play a neat pass into and he will excel. As LVG stated he plays with his brain and not his legs, that run for the Roma goal was perfect with a great finish.

18~~~

19~~~
Such a loveable bloke that Juan Mata.

20~~~
If we continue to play him in the No10 role with Two strikers ahead of him, especially Rooney and RVP. The football at times is going to be breathtaking.

21~~~

22~~~
He looks weird without it.

23~~~
He looks fecking dreamy.

24~~~
Ergh

25~~~
Beard or no beard, he is one handsome fecker.

26~~~
I know he's new, but damn it, give him the fecking armband! I can feel it he'll be our modern Le King.

27~~~
Cute version of Rooney.

28~~~
I am expecting a real big season from him.

People forgetting how good he was for Chelsea under Benitez the season before last. Carried them at times into 4th.

29~~~
As the days go by, he looks more and more like the Rumpelstilskin from Shrek. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131024064020/poohadventures/images/3/3b/Rumpelstiltskin-voice-by-Walt-Dohrn-13-960x1987.jpg" src="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131024064020/poohadventures/images/3/3b/Rumpelstiltskin-voice-by-Walt-Dohrn-13-960x1987.jpg"/>

Edit: Sorry for the big image.

30~~~
He still looks a yard off the pace at the moment, but is still producing some quality moments. Vital we surround him with pace, so he doesn't have to be relied upon to beat players.

38~~~
Mata is way too classy for Chelsea.

Thanks Mourinho!

39~~~
Mata, De Gea and Herrera have their United jackets on, Chicha doesn't.

40~~~
He is probably the most likeable player in the Premier League. Even at Chelsea when he routinely destroyed us I couldn't hate him.

41~~~
Mata is a classy handsome bastard.

42~~~
Hands off!

43~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I doubt he will be coming back, he already has Real Madrid out of his system.

44~~~
Chicha seems like just had boobs job.

45~~~
Yeah, why does he have a low-hanging fluorescent man boob? Is this the new fashion for the summer?

46~~~
He needs to be taking nearly all of our set pieces. We've had a preference for swinging them in for the last few seasons but he's excellent at them on either side and more consistent than anyone else. Plus we could do with having Rooney in the box.

47~~~
See all that he is capable of this season, he sounds very happy at United. Looking forward to watching him. Hopefully with the change in style it will really help him to shine. Class act too, his likeability factor is through the roof.

48~~~
he will thrive with lots of energy around him, so the signing of Herrera and possibly another midfielder who could dominate will bring out the best in him.
I don't think Carrick and a lone striker really suited him too much.

but like most here, I like him and I hope he shows his worth this season.

49~~~
Corners definitely.  For free kicks and penalties, Rooney and RVP might have something to say, particularly if they become captain and vice captain.

50~~~
He'd get it.

51~~~
So when he walks in with Rooney, people can say," here comes Chicha with a tit". 

<span style="color: #ffffff">boo..!</span>

52~~~
His eyes...

53~~~
Calm down and go a put on a clean pair of panties! 

Didn't he shave his beard like 2 days ago? The guy's fecking Chewbacca! 

Looking forward to seeing him play this evening hopefully, he'll be fired up against his former club!

54~~~
Rooney has his moments with the crossing free-kicks (as he does when he shoots), but he is far too inconsistent despite his great improvement. Van Persie has not actually scored many free-kicks over his career despite him taking them for Arsenal & us - he's much better with a moving ball. Mata is better at both crossing and bending them over the wall, for me. I still imagine Rooney taking plenty, though. Penalties should be RVP then Rooney, I feel, though i'd trust Mata if neither of them were on the pitch. Chicharito can take one too.

Agreed about corners. Rooney shouldn't be anywhere near those & RVP is not consistent enough with his delivery. They are both useful in the box & Mata (who is not) is better at corners anyway.

55~~~
Utterly anonymous tonight, wasn't he? Thought he wasn't great against Liverpool either. Slightly worrying with the season about to start.

56~~~
Kagawa too tbf. Almost nothing went through the middle tonight. It was almost a reversion to Moyes/latter Fergie tactics after what we'd seen on tour. Of the 3 midfield creatives, Januzaj was probably the best in his short spell.

57~~~
I thought Januzaj was terrific. Definitely playing as one of our two strikers though, with Kagawa at 10. Despite this, he pulled the strings in front of their defence superbly. Picking a team purely on today's game you'd stick him behind a couple of strikers and drop both Mata and Kagawa.

58~~~
Indeed. He created more than anyone had in the preceeding 75 minutes almost effortlessly. My biggest worry about LVGs tremendously exciting shake up is that I don't know where we're going to play him this season. Because I really, really want him to play.

59~~~
People need to stop putting him in midfield in 4-3-3. He's one of those AM's who are not suited to playing in midfield. It's always 4-2-3-1 when we play him with two proper midfielders.

60~~~
Yeah, he was invisible, I would like to see how many times he touched the ball. I think playing with Hernandez upfront instead of Welbeck is quite visible even looking just at Mata's game. Wouldn't worry too much though, I thought he was excellent in all games except this one in preseason.

61~~~
Yup. I'm a bit worried about how he's played the number 10 role in this pre season. To get the best out of Herrera and fletcher as a midfield two we need the number 10 getting far more involved than mata has. Issue with mata is that although he's exceptional in the final third and very classy on the ball, I would argue that he doesn't play make nearly enough. He's very much a player who likes to impact scorelines, and more of an attacker than a number 10.

62~~~
If we're gonna play a formation so we get the best out of Juan Mata, it might be a good idea to pass to him once in a while.

We seem to have some kind of residual tick where when he doubt, everyone just reverts to bypassing the midfield.

63~~~
The stench of Moyes is still around.

64~~~
It doesn't help that Fletcher has been shite, so the link's breaking down, but whenever there's a pass on through the middle, the defence just instinctively plays it out to the right anyway.

I don't blame Mata at all, what's he supposed to do? Tackle his own players for the ball? His set peices have been largely good, regardless of what Michael own says.

65~~~
Impressive. He's been quite everywhere trying to get things happen. 

ONE MORE lesson the need for proper CM's. Is anyone from United watching?

66~~~
He's not been involved as much as you'd like, but our moves tend to break down in midfield with Fletch/Herrera or up top with Rooney. We are really really forcing the issue it seems with a fair few long balls which are quite speculative

67~~~
He is so slow, didn't have any impact. Is it just a fitness issue?

68~~~
What impact is he supposed to have in an area of the pitch all our players seem mentally programmed to ignore?

69~~~
That he is ignored is one, but when he gets the ball, he always plays it backwards, quite frustrating, doesnt look for options forward.

70~~~
He can't do anything because Swansea have very good defensive shape, at least 5 men behind the ball when we get into the attacking third. If we had a striker like Welbeck/Aguero we'd be able to break them down with clever movement but atm everyone is static so the ball gets shifted about until it ends up out wide.

71~~~
He's had more touches than anyone besides the back three and done the square root of feck all when he's got it. Looked unusually clumsy and cumbersome and his set pieces have been wank.

72~~~
His team mates aren't getting him involved  enough, same with Kagawa in his early days.

73~~~
Because he has to come back into his own half to get it. Your expectation of set peices must be different to mine. They've all been put into good areas. It's up to people to attack them.*

He's never got the ball in a position he's able to do anything with it. No one has. That's the way I've seen it at any rate. We're all still scared to play it forward.

* like that!

74~~~
He's been piss poor, but we need to get him in the game more if we will continue with this system. Because it looks like it's still i our blood to get teh ball of the right side every time.

75~~~
I thought he could do more in terms of carrying the ball but in terms of passing there's only so much he can do. You need multiple runners going from different angles. We don't have that. No one is dragging players out of position to open things or creating space for others and without that it's v.hard for a passer to put someone in. That's the problem with the 352 and our current players, it's too dependent on the passing being quality all round the team and we're a long way from having top passers in their position across the team.

76~~~
He's very similar to Kagawa. Very commited to the team game and passing and moving that he just looks shit when others in the team are not doing their jobs. Players like Januzaj, Rooney and Nani will try to do things themselves but I get the feeling Mata and Kagawa are too disciplined to do that sometimes.

77~~~
Very isolated in both formations. The movement and weighting of passing to him was bad and when he did get the ball he either went backwards or lacked options. 

He needs players who are on the move around him, as any player of his kind does. No excuses he was definitely poor but it wasn't all his own doing.

78~~~
Anonymous today, not good enough.

79~~~
It wasn't until Gerrard gave him a head start and caught in that game in the US that I realized how slow Mata is, and in this system the game is just passing him by way too often, he can't seem to make any space for himself.

80~~~
I missed it, but my friend said that it was Mata that was chasing Ki for the first goal and then just stopped. Poor if true - was below par today.

81~~~
Poor display from Mata. Really needs to offer a lot more than he did. Noticeable how little effort he puts in off the ball compared to the others.

82~~~
Time will tell if Mourinho was right to sell him

83~~~
Would've liked to see him involved a lot more today, even if that meant dropping deep and trying to dictate play.

84~~~
Just my own opinion and nothing more. But I haven't seen any game from Mata in a Manchester United shirt yet to even come close to justifying his £38 million pound transfer fee. Disappointing again today.

85~~~
Totally invisible today. His free kicks were wank as well. Has to do better, it's not enough to write fancy things in your blog.

86~~~
He won't get stick though, because he's justified it in the past, but fact is, he's with us now and like you said, needs to be showing a lot more.

87~~~
That was my argument in favour of silva in the silva vs mata debate some time back. Mata is essentially more of a second striker than a playmaker. His build up play is particularly average.

88~~~
All the technical ability in the world but a great athlete he is not. He'd be an extraordinary player in someone else's body. Still going to be very good for us in the long term though. He's too good technically, too intelligent and too mature not to be I would think.

89~~~
Yeah - Why wasn't he dropping in and exchanging passes with Herrara and linking play with Rooney?

This is what that roles needs but for some reason he seemed well of the pace today.

This position does not require blistering pace so he only weakness should not be an issue.  He simply did not dictate play and link with the midfielders and forwards like he should.

90~~~
Agree completely.

91~~~
Mata is definitely a second striker for me whereas silva is a playmaker.

92~~~
He goes down the Kagawa route.
Not much he can do when the movement around him just isnt right and he doesnt get any balls.

93~~~
Was poor today but has shown his class in the past. Of all the worries we might have, Mata is way down the list.

94~~~
The jury is still very much out as to whether he is a Man Utd player. He was awful today..absolutely no influence apart from a few nice set piece deliveries......He has absolutely no pace or strength and in tough games he goes missing.
So Moyes spent 65 million on Fellaini and Mata and renewed Nani's contract where were we desperate for 2 central midfielders last summer. He's left the squad in a right mess and probably was responsible for Vidic leaving also and it's going to take Van Gaal spending another 150 million before it can be fixed

95~~~
Might as well play Rooney there then, with Van Persie and Welbeck up top.

96~~~
Oddly, out of all our number 10s, Kagawa is probably the closest to a proper number 10. 

Mata needs to get more involved. In this system we play, you can't have a number 10, who waits for the game to come to him as much as he does.

97~~~
He is playing like if he is injured

98~~~
he should have played more centrally, him and Herrera couldnt get enough on the ball. Hernandez and Rooney shocking ball technique didnt help them to do so. we desperately need Welbeck who is intelligent one-two team player who can light up play around him.

99~~~
id say Januzaj is the only proper playmaker in the team. Kagawa has the tools, but ive never seen him apply them in that way.

100~~~
He looked decent at the start of the second half. But agreed he needs to get on the ball more often. However, I think the speed of our build up play was very slow and we wasn't able to stretch the opposition, mata would thrive in this number 10 role if we played with a much higher tempo.

101~~~
Was the logical choice to go off when Fellaini came on. Not even his set pieces were good today. Very disappointing.

102~~~
Januzaj's directness, ball-carrying ability and speed is more suited to the number 10 role in this system. You'd still expect a lot more from Mata though.

103~~~
Good player but a player we didn't need, not convinced that mata/Rooney/RVP will work all together and it means we can't play our next best attacking player januzaj. Think LVG is going to have to have to abandon playing these 3 altogether because of the lack of pace, mata in particular needs movement and pace around him to be effective and we don't really have any in our midfield or attack. Would make more sense to sign a quality winger, play januzaj and leave one of mata/Rooney/RVP on the bench.

104~~~
He aint leaving Rooney on the bench. He is the team's captain.

105~~~
He's had a poor last two games but he's the least of our problems. Sort out what's behind him and he will automatically play better.

106~~~
This. Mata needs to pay with a strong backbone rather than part of that backbone.

107~~~
Not his best game for Mata today, but United failed to play like a "team" so Mata/Herrera look lost or anonymous. 

Whereas Rooney can be having an awful game but still manage to produce something from nowhere, because that is what makes Rooney special.

108~~~
I think his displays for United echo pretty much the half season he had with Jose, they have been rather lacklustre with people desperately trying to make out everything he does is wondrous or somehow justified.

I love the guy, and I love his personality, but I think his time with us was slightly overhyped. He  was our best player, but during a seasons in which we performed fairly poorly.

I dont think he is playing in the incorrect position or reeks of the stench of Moyes, I think this is what you get, a talented, presentable and lovely player but one that has flaws in his game.

Today he was one of the poorest on the pitch  for you guys.

109~~~
Yes Mata, RvP and Rooney are our best players but as individuals whilst to win consistently we need to play the best team not necessarily the best players. I my book none of them should be guaranteed a starting spot but should fight for their place like everyone else.
 Right now we need to sign a DM, a CB and possibly a winger. If we get those signings done we should play 4-3-3 and damn whoever can not get in.

110~~~
Mata was perfectly willing to drop and make himself involved under Moyes. He would constantly come back to move the ball on but has seemingly done that less and less with each passing game under Van Gaal.

Are we sure that these aren't instructions? If he's got a 'free' role now, maybe we don't want him to be tracking runs or contributing defensively; it's possible that Van Gaal wants to keep him further up the pitch ready to receive it. 

This isn't to excuse his performance today, because he was poor. Just as to whether or not he needs to purposely get involved, are we sure that wouldn't simply be for the sake of getting him on the ball - even though in those players there is very little he can do with it except move it on.

111~~~
DDG is better than all three, in fact I actually think hes your best player, Closely followed by RVP.

112~~~
Still the point stands we need to play the most balanced team that has both guile and mobility. Passing the ball side ways whilst both are standing still is easy to defend against.

113~~~
Anonymous today, he needs to be a talisman for the team; create chances, encourage a faster tempo and pass more accurately.  I hope he doesn't turn out to be one of those luxury players.  I can see Kagawa starting the next match.

114~~~
Them problem isn't mata ( we know he's a great player) or Kagawa or Rooney (when he plays deeper) it's the players around them. United don't have the players to compliment creative players. Until we change the players who give them the ball and who expect to receive it playermakers and creative players will continue to be underwhelming at united.

115~~~
Is he? A good player who shone two seasons ago. He needs to repay the big fee pretty soon. I think he's a quality player but he's not looked right since signing for United.

116~~~
This is the problem though. Some people do not want to blame the players at all. Mata  had a poor game, not because of the players around him, not because of his position but because he isnt playing at the level he can play at. Its so easy to look at players on paper and assume any player labelled 'great' can only not be great if its someone elses fault.

117~~~
I wonder if a case can be made for Mata to be part of the front two rather than the number 10. He doesn't get involved nearly as much as you'd want your number 10 to, but he's brilliant in advanced positions.

118~~~
I think time (and Mourinho) has already told.

Mata was the first pick in my FF team as he will get me decent points in both assists and more importantly goals. But if they are started awarding (or dropping) points for off the ball work he'd be the first one out of my team. He was the same last season, but his stats would cover a multitude of sins.

119~~~
To get the best out of Mata you play him in the number 10 role, and free him of any defensive responsibilities. This is the same player who not so long ago scored 20 goals and 30+ assists for us in 2012/13.

As a creative midfielder he's sublime, great passing range, good finisher, technically brilliant (best first touch in the league) and dangerous from set pieces, but he just doesn't have the pace, strength, stamina or work rate to be running up and down the pitch to cover the deficiencies in the rest of the midfield.

Mourinho let him go for that alone. Oscar offers more off the ball, though he's not quite replicating his Brazil form for us as an attacking force, and unfortunately Mata was the most expendable of our attacking trio.

Letting him go to Utd is still questionable, he'd be pulling all the strings had he moved to Utd with Ferguson in charge. Probably best to give Van Gaal a bit of time to start getting the best out of Mata, i'm sure he'll be beefing up the midfield/defence after todays performance.

120~~~
For a Mourinho team, yes. He simply doesn't run around enough for his teams. But for other teams, depending on how he is used, Mata can be devastatingly good.

121~~~
We are not able to get him involved as much as I would like. He always looks dangerous and looks to make things happen when he has the ball, but he is just not getting on the ball enough. He started the pre-season brightly, but his involvement in games has decreased on almost game by game basis.

122~~~
If used correctly, but the premiership has been changing over the last two seasons. Liverpool epitomises these changes coming...off the ball work and pace. Mata has neither.

Great player still, obviously would take him if offered. But to 'use' him correctly you need 9 other players to work around him. Mourinho couldn't be arsed and you don't have 9 players that can do this job.

Edit, obviously you have 2 or 3 but not 9.

123~~~
However it might sound, that's my thoughts exactly. It's like a slight pressure makes us go back to simple option- get it wide to safe area.
Anyway, he should be worried about Januzaj taking his place.

124~~~
Januzaj is our future no.10, thats all I'm going to say.

125~~~
I'm a fan of Mata's but today he was awful.  When the ball goes to the number 10 it needs to stick, he was too easily brushed off the ball.  I've seen other teams exploit this in the past.

126~~~
The future might be closer than I thought.

127~~~
His play hasnt been very good tbh, since his arrival he hasnt created an awful lot of chances, or playing a big role in attacks, its good that he has scored a few, but I expect a lot more of him.

128~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Obviously. 

How do we not have 9 hard working players btw? Rooney and Welbeck as forwards are as hardworking as it gets. Herrera seems a proper fighter. Valencia at LWB has always been super hard working. The rest (mostly defence) will obviously work hard. It's not ideal for him to be poor defensively, but it's not like we can't make it work.

129~~~
He's actually a decent image of what's wrong with us in an attacking sense.

We lack quality players WITH pace.

We've got quality players, and pacy players, but barely any quality players WITH pace. It's why Januzaj stands out so much in our team when he plays.

130~~~
To be honest, while Mata's radar was off today, playing with a pure number 10 that can happen.

The thing is though, if the opposition are marking the number 10 out of the game, it should create space for others to play in. However today it either didn't or we didnt use the space properly.

131~~~
Yeah very true. I dont think that's lost on LVG. Thats why we're in a 3-5-2. We can't drop Rooney/RVP/Mata because they're our best players. But you cant play them up front in a 4-3-3 because they'd be too narrow and slow to work.

132~~~
Indeed. I think even Van Gaal said something along the lines of "people panicked and picked the wrong passes"....we need to overcome this mental crutch and trust our passing. Id rather lose trying something bold...As blasphemous as it is to say,  at least some of the blame lies with Fergie for this instinctive back up plan

133~~~
He was too close to the strikers today. Needs to be operating right in front of Herrera and fletcher as he'll see more of the ball

134~~~
There is a reason why most No.10s are usually played on the left, that is where having passengers won't hurt the team. He has played wide before at Valencia and Chelsea so why can't he do it here where ne will always have the license to drift ? There is clearly something structurally wrong with our team the way we always play it wide but today we had Herrera and Mata as two thirds of our midfield yet they couldn't influence play in central areas, the tight areas we know they are comfortable in. Why ?

135~~~
This, I remember us failing to get it off Silva as he tore us to shreds in that 6-1 debacle.

136~~~
Welbeck and Rooney are ideal for him. But you need a few more as most have identified. That forces the team to be built around him which cuts down on flexibility of a team. Probably why Jose wasnt interested. Anyway I think we both are kind of agreeing minus the Jose bit.

137~~~
I agree with that and it's exactly why mourinho got rid of him, he is a classy player but he lacks pace and strength, so he needs players with those attributes around him, we don't have them. Moyes seemed to sign him without any idea where to play him, maybe he was looking to sell RVP and kagawa. 

For me januzaj is the future star of this team, I would play him over Mata or look to bring in another winger and leave out one of Rooney and RVP.

138~~~
I wouldn't say so. Rooney likes to drop deep and be more involved, leaves his position and ends up taking up Mata's. Van Persie suits him more. Bit bizarre they made Rooney captain too, won't be long before the knives are out after his stupidity gets him sent off when they're under pressure. Utd should be lining up something like:

They need to improve out wide (Nani's never kicked on since Ronaldo left and Januzaj's nothing more than a good young prospect at the moment) and the defence needs a hell of a lot of work too. Providing they're willing to spend the dosh, they should be going all out for Reus and Di Maria, and word is they're already signing Benatia. Lot of money to spend, but today should have been a big warning to them.

139~~~
Agree with that. Its bizarre that the two players chosen to be leaders should have been on the bubble from the team.

140~~~
I think this a lot of the time when Mata plays in the number 10 role. It's not so bad when we play him behind one striker but when we play him behind two, him playing so high is problematic because we effectively have three players up top and it leaves us short elsewhere (particularly in midfield). I think he is our best number 10 but I think Rooney and Kagawa drop and link with the midfield better.

141~~~
Agreed, noticed this particularly in the 1st half attacking my side. It was almost like a front 3, Rooney and Hernandez seemed to be wide forwards as Mata was that far forward at times.

142~~~
He has lost form last 3 games now.

Needs to figure out how deep he needs to play. Guess, having Cheech instead of Welbeck is not helping him either.

143~~~
I'm beginning to think the Kagawa fits the 3-5-2 better. Sure it puts Mata in his best position and I'm not saying he plays poorly in it, just Kagawa gets more involved. Maybe it's just a bit of poor form, but even during the pre season I think Kagawa could put an argument that he did more then Mata did despite playing with the second team usually. Mata will always get more goals and assists though, but for games like today I think Kagawa could have made a difference if he came on.

144~~~
The first goal we conceded was his fault as he was marking Ki throughout the early stages of the move, then bizarrely wandered off while Ki was deep in our half. Totally unacceptable.

145~~~
I think if Moyes had stayed then RvP would have been off this summer and the plan was to play Mata behind Rooney, of course that didn't happen and now you have to question the logic of letting Moyes spend £37M on putting part of a plan into action when the board must have known there was a good chance he wouldn't be here to complete the transition.

146~~~
Tough game for Mata, couldn't get going in any way. Shit happens, he will still be great for us.

147~~~
If moyes stayed I think the plan was to use mata on the wing and Rooney behind Cavani. Don't think he ever intended on using mata as a #10 long term.

148~~~
You might need to change the right back option. Rafael is probably going to missed a lot of matches.

149~~~
He likes to drop deep. But that doesn't mean he can't play a world class as a number 9. Look at 2009/2010. Not often saw Rooney drop deeper in that season. You play him as a number 9, he will do the job. Rooney and Welbeck have a very good link up play, Whoever they play with, as long as they play teamwork play and quick tempo, I'm sure it will be great.

150~~~
He's having the same problems as kagawa. There are no off the ball runners for him to find. Our team is just too static.

151~~~
The Dutch didn't get Sneijder on the ball much either. It's weird, you'd think the 10 would get some freedom from having 2 strikers demanding attention in front of him, but midfields seem able to clog up the middle and keep the 10 in the 3-5-2 from getting on the ball.

152~~~
I think this is a good summary of the issue as well. RVP and Rooney are both far from world-class in terms of being great at off the ball runs and their limited dribbling means our only way to break down defenses centrally will be through beautiful link-up play. 

We look like Arsenal when they lost Ramsey and Walcott to injuries. Too many great intricate passers and not enough players who just offers runs so there are good passing options and space for the "playmakers". 

Considering we have skipped wingers completely all creativity, dribbling and off the ball runs has to come centrally from RVP, Rooney and Mata. I think we are playing away from Rooney and RVP's strengths which is as a pure number 9 with great link-up play and overall abilities and instead we are using them like a Sturridge/Suarez-Robben/RVP-Ronaldo/Rivaldo partnership. 

We are basically putting them in a situation where we need individual brilliance from them repeatedly through-out the game and that has always been the opposite of their game. Hopefully I am wrong and Mata, Rooney and RVP passes their way through every defense in the world but it seems really farfetched.

153~~~
The major problem with Mata is that we don't have the surrounding personnel to get the best from him. At the moment, he looks like a complete vanity purchase. We're no better off with him at the club, but we're £38m lighter; our transfer business last season was absolutely terrible. We need a pacey wide player and I'd say Welbeck needs to be playing up front too. We need to stretch games far more, give Mata some space to operate in and get players making runs that he can aim for.

Being honest though, we could have bought a much more suitable player.

154~~~
Starting to worry about this signing.

155~~~
I said it when we bought him that we never needed him. He was the 2nd panic buy under Moyes. He's a fantastic player but when we already had Rooney, Januzaj and Kagawa what was the need for Mata? We have been in desperate need for CM's for years and are still yet to address the problem. It's truly pathetic.

156~~~
He can't play with Rooney.  I think we can only carry one of these slow ball players really. We need a Reus/Di Maria or even Welbeck for now in the team WITH Januzaj I think. 

However, it seems we will play the name game, and the biggest names will be forced to get it right. 

I like Mata, but don't see the point in him and Rooney in an attacking trio. Rooney drops deep and doesn't stretch teams, so him and Mata together is blunt.

157~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a> I think we need to stop blaming other players when the likes of Mata or Kagawa fail to perform. Rooney wasn´t dropping deep yesterday until the second half was well underway. In the first half, both Rooney and Hernandez were tactically disciplined and stayed high up the pitch to give Mata space. If you want to be kind to Mata the ball was not worked into his feet very quickly and so Rooney and Hernandez´s attempts to stretch the play didn´t go anywhere. However, Mata´s movement was also way off. He was drifting about but he wasn´t really turning up in the channel or finding pockets of space where he could play through balls. It was simply the case that Mata had a bad game. We´ve seen him do a lot better in a red shirt and no doubt he will again but yesterday was a poor showing.

158~~~
Poor game yesterday. I think he has a good case of being our best outfield player since his arrival so I'm not too worried. He's a brilliant player and will definitely improve.

159~~~
In a few weeks I imagine he'll have scored a few goals, set up a few and everyone will have forgotten about this. Similar to when he had a little dry run under Moyes and then bang he turns up against Newcastle away and spearheads the most aesthetically pleasing performance of the season.

Personnel in general is an issue. LVG is clearly trying to build the team around him but as others say, with Rooney in the side - a player who wants to dictate from the front rather than being the focal point, it becomes a bit of an issue. Mata was definitely a luxury purchase that wasn't entirely necessary but if the other deficiencies are fixed in time he'll do well and people will say the people in power were right to buy him when they did.

He was individually fantastic in a pretty average Chelsea side. Playing behind the likes of Torres and Ba, in front of a declining Lampard, a shit Mikel and Ramires who can be hot and cold. Poor yesterday but I don't think it warrants a "£37m down the drain".

160~~~
Have said this so often, it has to do with the fact that so many players are suited in the middle right now, thats just damn easy to defend. The players can only pass to the wingbacks, but they are so easily put under pressure, for this system you need the right players, if we had kroos, modric, iniesta, alaba, lahm, Mata would have happy days but since we dont, its just not the right thing to do. Same with Holland, Holland did got far but their play was far from good, you need the right players for this system.

161~~~
He played poorly yesterday, but regardless, I do not think the trio works. Even in the long run, it isn't ideal.

162~~~
Can anyone pinpoint the differences between Mata and Silva? I don't believe Silva is any quicker than Mata, he is a little classier on the ball and I reckon his vision is a little better but the main reason for my query is why Silva manages to play wide but Mata can't

163~~~
For me it's the system and the players around him. Silva benefits from having dynamic pacey players around him that are constantly providing options and a solid midfield (and Zabaleta) behind him and supporting him whereas Mata doesn't have that pace around him and has to put in a shift defensively when he's out wide.

164~~~
Silva is more of a dribbler and can drift past players with ease, mata isn't really like that. Mata is more about always providing the final ball and has excellent movement, set pieces and is a good finisher. He's a really productive player, but not so much of an individual while silva can create something on his own a lot more often. You need to have that bit of individualism to play out wide.

165~~~
Mata was very disappointing yesterday. Nowhere near the level he's shown at the end of last season or near the level he's shown at Chelsea in the 2 seasons before Mourinho happened. Mata made things happen at Chelsea and I know he's capable of doing that here as well like he did during the latter end of last season. I think this tour has taken too much out of our players, having to play against good opposition 2 times a week at such an early stage in your preparation.

166~~~
Mata much like any number 10, is best playing off the striker in a 4231 system,  442 does not work for mata, no does 433 unless its seen has a 4231. 352 can work, but not when our forwards and midfield are pretty much slow and lacking creativity. We have a problem with Rooney/RVP axis that is colliding with fitting mata into the team, and all 3 are not the most mobile of players, so our strongest point of our squad does not dove tail because of the lack of pace in the forward line. That means you need speed and creativity from your wide players, and mobility from your CM. You basically have to build a system around mata, and 352/442/433 does not work, especially if mata is used has one of the front 3. 4231 is the only way to get the best out of mata

Take our system, it does not work with mata, why? because of certain pieces/players in our system that makes mata ineffective. Hernandez is very ridged, he stays up top, rooney is not very quick, and we have no wide players playing, and our midfield is not very good, herrera can be, but fletcher is a squad player at best. So you bring all these factors to the table, no wonder mata is struggling. The simple fact is we need another wide player, we need another CM player and a defender to play 4 at the back, and 2 natural wide players who can bring mata into play, and help the front man

If LVG can sign a wide player CM and a defender, we can play 4231 with
------DDG--------
?? smalling jones shaw
herrera ??
?? mata janazaj
rooney/RVP

So for mata to work, it has to be 4231, not 352. The worry we are sticking to 352 when our forwards have no pace. which is the same problem has last season

167~~~
Should have gone off with Kagawa coming on

168~~~
Interesting that didn't happen, I guess we wanted to add a bit of pace with Nani though.. maybe..

169~~~
Probably but it didn't make sense to me either - he hardly played during pre-season

170~~~
I thought Nani was a decent sub and he played well, but Kagawa should have came on for Mata instead of Fellaini for Herrera.

171~~~
Silva never actually plays as a winger, but just starts from wide and drifts in - for me he has better movement, and therefore finds himself in space at all times which makes it easier for him (just watching Silva drift around finding space without the ball highlights exactly why Spain produce better footballers than England IMO). He's probably a better dribbler too which will help.

172~~~
His lack of pace is really a bit of a headache.

173~~~
The fact he plays with little pace in front of him makes it worse.

174~~~
This 3-5-2 formation is basically set up so we can play Mata. A player of his quality has to play along with Rooney and RvP. It's not good putting him on the wing as we seen last season. Only problem is I think we will struggle playing that formation, we were always terrific at OT because the pitch is so big and we used to utilise that with our pacy wingers who could actually beat a man and get a good ball in, or alternatively cut in and cause some damage.

With Mata in the team, everything is based on going through the centre and we don't seem to create any clear cut chances. Obviously it's only been one game but there was signs of it last season. It's basically the same with Kagawa, SAF wanted to play him but knew he had to play Rooney and RvP, Kagawa started featuring on the wing but it wasn't right and he couldn't show his true ability. Our team has always been based on pace, we were regarded as one of the best counter attacking teams in Europe but that's no longer the case, we are too slow on the break and have no unpredictability apart from Januzaj.

175~~~
No doubt. Which makes a proper singing in that area even more important to get the best out of him.

176~~~
I think signing Di Maria would help, although I feel like we have a major issue with the lack of pace amongst our Strikers (barring Wellbeck)

177~~~
He is hardly closing players down. Another weakness why Mourinho didn't prefer him.

178~~~
Silva is more dynamic and can't get marked out of a game, he is usually ever-present. He can run with the ball and beat players. Mata has better finishing and times his runs better into the box.. useful for a team which dominates the game, sadly we don't.

I think this is a make or break season for Mata, if he doesn't fit in with LVG's system..he's gone.

179~~~
Silva is a proper playmaker. He makes City play better football.

Mata is more of a final 3rd player. He's a brilliant but not the knd of player we needed.

180~~~
He looked good with Welbeck and Rooney as strikers, he just needs a little more movement and pace around him, that won't happen with Rooney & Hernandez as strikers and I doubt it will with RVP & Rooney as strikers given our current 'non-specialist wing-backs'. Ideally we play Welbeck/Januzaj & RVP/Rooney as strikers with Mata in behind or we have to switch to 4-2-3-1 with Mata as #10.

181~~~
Was not good against Swansea, wasn't against Valencia and I thought he was also down against Looserfool 

Pace in front of him is key, and he's useless when there is no movement on the wings for him 

Soon I expect a big debate on him and his positioning on the team 

How can we adapt him Roo and RVP in a 3-5-2 with Young and Valencia on the wing with no protection from behind....

182~~~
If we lack pace and work-rate around him we are better of with Kagawa who is much better defensively than Mata. Mata has really got off to a bad start in terms of his defensive work-rate which I think has deteriorated from under Moyes. 

Hopefully he is asked to play the role like that, which would explain a lot.

183~~~
His latest blog post:

184~~~
I'd say the following reasons:

1. Silva is quicker than mata. He's not very quick but unlike mata it's enough to take on defenders.

2. He's also got far better ball control. I don't think there's another player in this league who keeps the ball glued so close to his foot. Ozil is similar but not at Silva's level. The consistency with which he's in completely control is brilliant.

3. He's a proper playmaker whereas Mata is more an attacker who likes to score and create goals in the final rid of the pitch. Silva is not as likely to score as mata, but because he gets others involved and pulls the strings, his starting position is less relevant than mata, who needs to be in specific areas to be effective.

185~~~
I agree. Would love to see more from Danny this season, but the fecker cannot stay fit.

186~~~
This is why I'm not convinced the choice between mata and Kagawa is as straightforward as many here think. Mata is no doubt more likely to decide games, but if you're struggling to get your passing rhythm going, Kagawa is more likely to help with that as he works harder and is better at dropping deep to link up.

187~~~
If he can improve his finishing and a little bit his passing he would be a terrific player.  He's got pace, he can get around players but he isn't deadly in front of goal.  I would definitely like to see him start alongside Rooney or RVP.

188~~~
So how long until Mata's credits that he got at Chelsea run out and he starts being judged as a failure? Because IMO he has been a huge disappointment.

189~~~
He's not really been particularly poor, it just looks like square peg round hole so far.

We sorely lack pace in the team. Mata sorely lacks pace around him to be effective.

190~~~
He's been poor in a few games. He was just as bad as others in some of our bad matches last season. He had some decent games (against average opposition). Anyway, the point is he hasn't been anywhere near his standard though, especially now that the team is basically built so we can play him in this 3-5-2. He should be doing more. He looks better when Welbeck plays so I am willing to wait and see how he goes with him back in the side but if he still underperforms then it will be a big issue.

191~~~
He never had any defensive work rate at Chelsea either

He is a luxury player who will look great in a winning team

I was never overly up for his transfer, he wasn't a player we were crying out for and to smash our transfer record for him was a real sign of desperation.

It's also an unusual situation that we signed a player from a club who were in a far better situation than utd at that time. Chances are he would much prefer to have stayed where he was if he could have gotten games.

192~~~
I think that is pretty harsh even if I agree that I thought he'd be a bit of a luxury player defensively. Under Moyes he played extremely well in the defense though, better than ever in his career and I was hoping he would continue with it. 

Extremely well compared to previous in his career that is.

193~~~
He has been poor by his standards (more hot and cold I guess, as we have seen flashes of brilliance in his short time here), but with the team so lacking in quality i'd much rather try and shoehorn him into the team out of position than rely and dross like Cleverley, Fellaini, Fletcher (<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>), Anderson, Nani, Valencia and Young. Then we have the likes of Welbeck, Hernandez and Kagawa, who although are better than the first bunch of players (some will claim this is debate-able), still have a lot to prove. Again, Mata has hardly set the world alight but he is proven quality that still only has half a season in a complete shambles of a team under his belt.

It's a little depressing every time you think about the state of our team (and that's without considering the mess that is our defence!). It's even worse when you realise that in two weeks time we are stuck with it!

194~~~
He was slammed a bit by Eurosport today, not sure I agree with it all though.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/mediocre-mata-nowhere-hide-season-121235933.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blog...iocre-mata-nowhere-hide-season-121235933.html</a>

195~~~
He seems such a nice guy, really needs to pick up a couple of yards though.

196~~~
He's lacking movement in front of him. It's the same issue when kagawa plays. Everyone wants to come short for a pass to feet, no one wants to make a run. It's basically as simple as that.

197~~~
The main difference? Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko. You put Mata in that City team which makes runs for fun, and he'll look as good as Silva.

198~~~
FFS, the overreaction by a few here is amusing.  This is the same player many of you were jizzing over throughout our preseason tour in the States.  There's nothing wrong with Mata or for that matter, Kagawa.  They are technically brilliant footballers that most sides would love to have.  We just need to eradicate the caveman football mentality that's prevalent in most of our players.  I have complete faith in LVG bringing modern, attractive football to United, but Rome wasn't built in a day.

199~~~
It will always be like that with these kind of players. If Silva was playing for us ppl would still moan that he doesn't get as many goals and assists like Mata.

Once Mata gets his regular assists ppl will praise him non-stop again. Then when he has a game like yesterday's all will be bad again.

Difference between Silva and Mata?

Well Silva is the better player.

As others have also pointed out they are a bit different.

However, Silva has a miles better midfield next to him to cover him as well as better wingers/strikers with allround skills and movement. With a striker like Chicarito and wingers/wingbacks like the ones we started against Swansea any No 10 will struggle. Which doesn't mean Mata didn't have a poor game, but you can't compare Mata and Silva without also comparing the players around them.

200~~~
I don't think that's all of it. Silva is more agile and seems to be able to get on the ball more, whatever the formation, when playing out wide. His first touch might be a bit better, too. Basically, he's better at receiving the ball and facing goal. 

As a 10, Silva sometimes struggles I think, but as a narrow wide player, he's better than Mata is in any position.

201~~~
The story of his Man Utd career so far has been a defiant tweet 2 days before a match to say that the team is now ready to start destroying other teams followed by a groveling apology on twitter the day after the match for yet another woeful performance

202~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Controversial opinion but I think we'd be better if we play Herrera in a more advanced role with 2 proper CMs behind him in a 4-3-3.

203~~~
feck my life, is hererra better as a no.10? why do we keep buying players in that position instead of actual fecking Central midfielders.

204~~~
He played one game as a #10, although it was against Galaxy and looked majestic in that role. The more I watch him the more I think he is suited better to that position, he seems caught between wanting to join the attack and collecting the ball from defense to drive forward that he is almost in two minds. The other game he played really well was when Fletcher had a brilliant game as well distributing the ball like he hasn't done before and likely won't repeat again.

He's been making a conscious effort to play as a #8 but he is at his best behind the strikers, has a lot more defensive awareness than Mata and sustains his game against a bit of physicality without surrendering possession. There's a reason Mourinho shifted Mata out as soon as he could.

205~~~
It's a curse. We need to pour the blood of an decent midfielder over the ground to rid the curse.

206~~~
Does the midfielder have to be decent?

207~~~
He needs to man up and play better. Maybe lift some weights too. Was underwhelming last season besides some tap ins, long balls and free kicks.

208~~~
glad to hear he has the self respect to be disgusted with that performance.

209~~~
I agree.

210~~~
A lot of the criticisms in here were unjustly levelled at Ozil last season, and the same reasons to justify it - needing pace/runners is what us Arsenal supporters were stating too.

211~~~
He is, yeah. One good season at Athletic Club under Bielsa as a central midfielder and another poor one, otherwise he's spent his entire career in the number 10 position.

212~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Soon our craziest fans will say he should close this blog of his and focus on his match

213~~~
I was particularly disappointed at his lack of positional awareness for Swansea's first goal. He's average defensively, and at Chelsea no one really brought up his defensive contribution - until Mourinho arrived last season - because his output was excellent. Fortunately, his pressing has improved thanks to Mourinho, but he needs to take more responsibility and realise that the team is going to rely on him way more in a 3-5-2 than any other system. Regarding his attacking, he'll benefit off players actually making runs. Welbeck will definitely help in this aspect. He's much, much better than what he's shown for us thus far, however.

214~~~
Amazing how people are starting to turn on him after the first game of the season. 

I still love you Juan. Hugs.

215~~~
Am I missing something?

Who has turned on him?

216~~~
Turned might not have been the right term but so many now coming out and saying what a poor signing it was and that he is hurting the way we line up. I know it's just out of frustration but he has copped a lot of blame for the Swansea loss.

217~~~
Not a poor signing by any means but he has yet to replicate his Chelsea form which is frustrating for some but im backing him to find his form this season.

218~~~
He could <i>potentially</i> be a poor signing. He is frustrating at the moment. For me the frustration is compounded by the fact that a lot of other players cop a large amount for their performances but Mata seems to escape it.

219~~~
I am a massive fan of Juan Mata but we signed him when we really didn't need him. We had Kagawa, Rooney and Januzaj to play where he plays.

220~~~
Talk his cheap.And he does his fair share of that.

221~~~
He played with better players at Chelsea. I really don't think that should be overlooked. Take him right now and drop him in the City team and he'll look like a superstar again. This is one of the poorest United teams I've ever seen. I've been saying that since SAF was still in charge.

You can't just expect guys like Mata to turn up and be the player he was in a different system with better players around him.

That's in no way to excuse some of his performances which have of course been below par but it does go some way to explaining why he's not even looked close to being the same player he was.

222~~~
The team is completely lacking cohesion and balance alongside quality, but he's still not been anywhere near what we expected. He's been mediocre at best.

He suits a more open and direct style, which is exactly what we're looking to move away from. 
He's closer to Kagawa than Silva in terms of style, and he isn't as impressive when the team attempts to slow things down and suffocate the opposition,  because he hasn't Silva's ability to keep the ball glued to his feet under extreme pressure or go past a man with ease without space ahead of him. Silva can hold the ball under pressure while waiting for the pass, whereas Mata's technique and shielding of the ball isn't as good, so he needs to release it earlier or lose it.

He's lovable and all that, but just like anyone else, he shouldn't be given a free ride. Assuming we're going to look to control in their half and not to play on the counter, I'd try Herrera in the advanced role against Sunderland, with Fletcher and Cleverley behind and see what happens, because, like with Kagawa, this hasn't really been working.

223~~~
He needs to up his game and do it fast because very soon the heat will turn up and he will be cast into the ''waste of money'' bracket. We know he is better than anything he has shown in a United shirt but the excuses an only hold for so long.

224~~~
Probably because he's actually been quite good. Our best player from February onwards, certainly. One bad game doesn't negate that. Mata is the best player at the club, only Van Persie, Bale and Suarez have arguably bettered or come close to replicating his individual output and technical brilliance over the past few seasons. Yaya Toure, too, perhaps. He was that good at Chelsea and was slowly beginning to find some form in a team bereft of any idea under Captain Calamity.

225~~~
It's really unfair how people completely ignore that. Neither of our best players(Rooney and van Persie mainly) were even close to Mata in 2014, but he had poor game against Swansea(where half of our players looked even worse) and some people decided isn't good enough for this team.
Good thing that van Gaal seems to like him and hopefully might get the best out of him proving doubters wrong.

226~~~
Not really. Kagawa after 2 years is still being praised for the brilliant player he was at Dortmund and its our fault for not getting the best out of him......

227~~~
He was still poor compared to his form for us. Maybe it is to do with the players around him a bit, but he doesnt seem as deadly as he was for us.

228~~~
He had some decent games at the end of last season but who were the opposition? He played well against Newcastle who had completely stopped at that stage. It isn't one bad game either. He's had a few bad games, this shouldn't be denied because it is obvious. I know he was good at Chelsea and I accept that, but how much longer can people defend him by saying how good he was two years ago? I don't care about two years. He isn't reaching anywhere NEAR that level now, and if that Chelsea form is his level then I wouldn't say he has been "quite good" at all.

229~~~
You can say the same of almost all our players nowadays too. Just finished reading the Rafael thread and someone made the same comment. I don't mind the comparisons though, we know the guys can reach those levels. They just need to start believing again.

230~~~
Cleverley is average defensively (at best). Mata is really poor defensively, it's completely unexisting part of his game. But we knew that when we were chasing him. He is closer to a second striker than playmaker aka Silva in City IMO.
Kagawa offers better defensive contribution (he has good positioning and stamina), Januzaj is much better at running with the ball at pace. Clearly he's better player than both of them because of his productivity, but I have a feeling he won't be first choice at the end of the season.

Also, very good post about Mata from another thread:

231~~~
One bad game, he scored 6 goals in his last 6 games for us last season together with a few assists. He's our best player. He was also Chelsea's best and most consistent player for 2 seasons running.

232~~~
As far as i'm concerned, until the midfield is sorted the defence and attack cannot be judged fairly.

But, i'm not worried about Mata, Rooney or RVP

They are the best players in the squad!

233~~~
If you confuse creativity behind the striker with creativity from midfield, you should lose your job for life

234~~~
All true, Mata is a top player he proved it at Chelsea, it is up to us to get him settled, and comfortable in the team so he can reach that level again, the guy is class.

235~~~
How long does this go on for, really? Player after player is doubted here, their recent form picked to pieces. Players that have excelled for teams all across Europe. People are often sceptical of Kagawa and his previous form, and I can get that. It's understandable. Rafael has been doubted again. Ok, I'll accept that. Smalling and Jones? I can see the reasoning. 

But there comes a time when you have to recognise the systematic failures within our entire set up over a period of time that just isn't allowing these players to perform. Because when players like Van Persie and Mata aren't playing well enough, as you put it, there's something more to the problem. Mata is legitimately part of the elite across Europe. He's that good a player. If he isn't firing, then something is very, very wrong with this team and its set up.

236~~~
Last season Rooney was our main play maker and the onus had to fall to him to create. There's no excuses when you're the main playmaker for man united.

This season it will clearly be Mata. He's such a massive upgrade on sneider in the WC team, but clearly he doesn't have someone at Robben's level in front. It will be interesting to see how LVG gets the most out of him but still, if he isn't performing after 4 games he should be dropped for Kagawa for a spell and let them battle it out properly for #10

237~~~
He's obviously a world class player and will probably have a very productive season, but a thing about him is he's not a flashy player, he's not particularly quick and doesn't make the crowd really excited when he gets the ball. He can pick a pass out and is a good finisher and has great movement, but when he has a poor game, you just don't notice him. He's not quick, not a great dribbler and can't really go past players. Players like Januzaj will still get on the ball a lot and dribble past players, still being a threat and exciting, but when they have a poor day, their final ball is off.

As great as it was to sign a player like him, he was completely unnecessary at the time for plenty of reasons and basically forces us to either sell one of our star players, bench them, or play them out of position (or play the 3-5-2 like we will for now).

238~~~
Moyes clearly thought he was a winger when he bought him as he had played out on the wing at times for Chelsea. I honestly think Moyes just thought to himself that Mata would become for us what David Silva is for Man City without really giving too much thought about the whole thing. It was another panic buy from Moyes who was desperately trying to save his job by spending mega cash on whoever he could even if it was in a position we didn't really need strengthening in. The elite managers don't operate like that. LVG most certainly will give it his best shot at turning Mata into the player we all know he is....I have no doubt Mata will have a decent season but for me there are still huge question marks as to whether he is quick enough and imposing enough to be a Man Utd player

239~~~
I am sorry but I don't agree with that. He had a bad game but you have to analyze the game against Swansea to really find the reasons for his anonymous performance where he only created one game from open play the entire game. I will just quote the post I made in another thread recently.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://fat.gfycat.com/LividAccomplishedIvorybackedwoodswallow.gif" src="http://fat.gfycat.com/LividAccomplishedIvorybackedwoodswallow.gif"/>

Truly exquisite the way he glided with one foot in the air and brilliant ball control as well.

Mata is easily one our best players and he is the best No 10 we have in the team. Unless we want to play a 4-4-2 with 2 strikers or a 4-3-3 with 2 wide forwards and a striker, he should be one of the first names on the teamsheet. He is probably the only player we have who is outrageously creative whilst being extremely productive in the final third as well. He is more of an attacking direct player rather than a pure playmaker like Silva or Ozil who are content with lying deeper, finding pockets of space and linking up play till they get the opportunity to play a deadly final ball. Mata looks to be more directly involved and is more adventurous than a typical playmaker.

However, he needs players to be stretching defences and making good runs for him to fully utilize his creative/link-up talents. He is not quick off the mark or a good dribbler like Iniesta or Silva, his gameplay drastically differs from them.

There have been quite a number of posts criticising his Swansea game. He had a bad game no doubt, but if you truly analyse the game, you will find the reasons for the anonymous game that he was having. Rooney and Hernandez esp had poor games against Swansea which naturally impacted Mata's game negatively. However, the prime reason for Mata's poor game was the lack of service from the deep.

Our centre backs/full backs weren't great in possession and were mostly conservative with the ball other than Blackett to a certain extent.


This is where we could have largely benefited from a defender who is comfortable in carrying the ball out of the defence and also capable of playing good incisive passes to our forwards in good positions. Hopefully, Rojo is that guy and Evans returning will help in this regard. The return of Rafael and Shaw would hugely benefit the team with the injection of pace and adventure that they provide with the ability to link up with the forward players as well. Shaw has been rather tentative in pre-season but he has the pace and ability to carry the ball and link up with players. With time he will settle in and help the team offensively.

<span style="font-size: 12px">Our midfield duo didn't have the best of games as well. 
</span>

Which all ultimately leads to this

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755307/player-stats/43670/1_PASS_07#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...yer-stats/43670/1_PASS_07#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

NOTE: This is Mata's receiving position for passes, not the passes he made.

He barely received the ball in the danger areas you would want you primary creative force to receive the ball in. He had to drop deep more often than not and he hardly made an impact in the final third as a result. Remember like I've stated earlier he is not a player who is great at dribbling or carrying the ball forward, he is great at linking up and providing killer balls when he receives the ball in dangerous areas.

Heck I would go as far as to say even David Silva would be struggling to exert an influence on a game if those were the positions he was receiving the ball in. Mata is an extremely intelligent player and always looks to find pockets of spaces like every other No 10, when he doesn't get the ball in these positions he naturally has to drop deep to get into the game. In doing so it severely impacts his game and results in him only playing up to 60-70% of his full capability. If you have a genuine top notch player like Mata and you don't provide him with the service from deep or provide him with pacy forwards/wide players making intelligent runs, you can't quite expect him to have a brilliant game.

I can see him thriving sooner or later with Evans returning, Rojo joining, hopefully Carrick returning soon with the likes of Januzaj/Welbeck providing pacy stretching runs for him to capitalize on and linking up with RVP and Rooney to good effect in the final third.

240~~~
That's a problem in my opinion among English fans, in my opinion, it's players like Mata that get you excited when they are on the ball, players like him are so clever and technical that they can produce special moments at any given time.

The stereotypical English fan wants a fast players who is direct but they need to start appreciating the talents that these type of players have.

I understand and agree with the excitment when a flying winger gets the ball but these technical players are just as exciting in my opinion.

241~~~
I know what you mean, and I mean, Mata is a great player to watch. But what I meant in that post was more like, if you're facing a team who is parking the bus, and Mata gets the ball 30 yards out, you don't really expect him to do anything other then lay the ball off to somebody else, or potentially play a ball over the top for somebody (hasn't really happened here yet so far though). That's what I mean by he won't get the fans out of their seats. Give it to Ronaldo, Bale, Di maria, and even Januzaj is developing the trait, but you give it to them and they have the ability to dribble past 3-4 players and have a shot at goal with range.

242~~~
Yeh, I understood your point and somewhat agree, my point was just a general view regarding that type of issue.

243~~~
Found myself watching this. Really does showcase his good finishing.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-jjx4LuOwo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

How do we get him in the box more to get into these positions? If we had a DM, I suppose Herrera could push up and allow Mata to be in the box, with the extra CB covering for Herrera? Shaw has already shown he can find that cut back pass which ends up in Mata's zone a couple times in pre season and I think we need Shaw and the RWB to really stretch and pull opposing defensive lines to get Mata that space to finish.

244~~~
I can't get why the opinion on Mata has changed so much since last season. People were practically drooling over how good he was during those last 6 games he played as a number 10 last season. Can't believe how many people are leaving him out of their lineup or playing him out wide so Rooney can slot in as a number 10. Rooney is the better number 9 but as a number 10 he doesn't come close to being as good as Mata. Sometimes playing all of your best players isn't the best option for the team and I think we must play only one of Rooney or RVP should we switch to a 1 striker system and I'm sure van Gaal will think the same, remember his quote saying that if he plays 4-3-3 he will have to bench 3 out of his 4 strikers? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

245~~~
Di Maria pace is only going to benefit Mata if it happens. No danger Juan loses his place in the team. LvG is all about intelligence and Mata is probably our most intelligent player alongside RvP.

246~~~
A lot of people have changed their opinion based on parts of pre season and the Swansea match. For some reason they didn't pay attention to Rooney's link up play during the Swansea match. That is not what you want out of a #10. The former and the fact that he's captain means he will never be dropped in the eyes of a lot of people.

I also think Mata is a better #10 because not only does he bring end product, but his touch is consistent, and looks to create from the hole more than Rooney does. It's all up to how LVG sees Rooney though. Despite Mata being a better #10 in the eyes of ourselves, he might fit LVG's philosophy better and start over him.

Up to this point, he hasn't had to consider Rooney as a #10 due to having no world class wingers and he hasn't had a chance to really assess who is the better #9 due to RVP's injury. In the 352 he could pick two strikers and thus RVP and Rooney didn't clash. In a 352 Mata and Rooney weren't competitors for the 10 spot. These are things that will be debated inside LVG's head now that there are more players available to him and a possible new formation. It's too early to conclude anything at this stage.

247~~~
The good thing is this move surely adds pressure on him. Now he needs to find his best form otherwise either Rooney (with RVP on top) or Kagawa will take over

248~~~
I think we can easily have the diamond formation with Rooney and RvP up front or have a 4-2-3-1 with Di Maria/Mata/Rooney as the 3 behind RvP. All three can be given the license to roam and make sure we have a fluid attacking line up. That is something I miss the most from the Rooney/Ronaldo/Tevez partnership. The fluidity and interchanging was orgasmic at times. The three would interchange so much that defenders had a hard time defending and marking them. That is what made us a lethal attacking team that time IMO.

249~~~
You're sort of assuming that Rooney's touch is consistent and he performs at his best every match when saying that a Rooney, Mata, Di Maria partnership would be the best setup. On a good day Rooney has the best touch in the world but he also has many games were his touch is so bad it almost looks like he kicks the ball away from himself. Swansea last week was one of those games. He would have gotten a free shot on goal at least 3 times had he controlled those through balls from Mata and Januzaj during that Swansea game.

250~~~
If his touch lets him down then he will be poor no matter where we play him. In that case we have Januzaj waiting for his chance. Point is I am talking about 3 world class players there and hoping (assuming) that they will be on form and injury free. Obviously that won't be the case all the time and that is when other squad members come in the picture.

251~~~
I'm happy in that if we do get DM that gives us an attack of RVP, Rooney, Di Maria, Hernandez, Wilson/Welbeck, Mata, Kagawa, and Januzaj to fill the front 4 positions. That's an attack that can equal anyones and gives us a wealth of options to choose from depending on form and opposition. Everyone should get game time even if it means being left out of big games, a welcome headache.

252~~~
I think if we sign Di Maria it's just the sort of player Mata needs. I think Mata with Di Maria and Januzaj either side with Rooney/RVP up top would be very good. The problem we've had for too long is that we've wanted our wingers to stay wide/they've been reluctant to come inside. The extra variety in the runs they will make would give Mata the options he needs as typically his choice of pass is to try and pick out one of the strikers who are tightly marked or roll it out wide, there's rarely that run from outside to inside to pick out or open space.

But I think with Rooney captain and RVP sure to be a favorite than we'd need to play a diamond to play everyone. I think it would be a shame if we played Rooney off RVP as I don't think Rooney excels there nor would bring the best out of Di Maria or Januzaj just because of his style of playing there and what he wants to do.

A diamond though would keep Mata/RVP/Rooney where they want to be and then Di Maria/Herrera have the energy to burst forward and overlap Mata to give an extra passing route. I don't think it would work as well as the first approach I mentioned but I think it's the only realistic way to play all our best players.

253~~~
To be honest Mata is looking more like a waste of money as each game goes by. That money could have been used so much better elsewhere. He's a great guy and a great player but I just don't think he's a Manchester United player at all.

254~~~
Needs to be dropped and someone should be given a chance. On current form, he's horrible

255~~~
Of the attacking players we had on today he should be the last one dropped. The other two were worse.

256~~~
Since the end of last season he's our only reliable source of goals, and yet he still gets shat on on here. I just don't get it. He's almost the only attacking player we have who looks comfortable on the ball, sadly enough.

257~~~
It gets worse. This is a post from another universe. A screwed up universe.

258~~~
Certainly better than RVP and Rooney and probably our biggest attacking threat.. Mata was average but we had virtually no movement in front of him.

259~~~
The good thing is that he scores goals and we need his goals, his play hasnt been very good.

260~~~
If only we had a midfield which allows him to be more active in the final third as a Number 10 should as opposed to having to drop so deep to start things off

261~~~
But that's a sign of our problems. He shouldn't be the one scoring the goals he should be creating them and yet he hasn't. And he's not scoring the amount of goals that our going to pick us up and win us games.

262~~~
There was a moment in the second half where he'd been on the ball for a good 5-10 seconds with his head up clearly looking for Rooney or Welbeck to get in behind Sunderland, but both came short for the ball. 

I think the current clashes come from our players wanting to walk the ball in.

He had to come so deep to get the ball today with Cleverley and Fletcher scared to make passes over 5 yards in a forward direction. Then as Mata came deep Rooney and van Persie came deep. And then when one of the three were on the ball, no one was looking to get into, or in behind the Sunderland defence and it all looked very poor. 

Good goal (it's refreshing to see a United player sniff out a chance in the 6 yard box nowadays), but we need to get equally good player on the left and right of him to stretch teams if he's going to have any chance of looking good. He was never the type to take the ball and single handedly destroy teams.

263~~~
Like Kagawa, he suits a more counter attacking, direct style. 
He's not like Silva who thrives with slower tempo and congested areas.
And with our quality of football, It's like plonking him in the Newcastle United team with Rooney and wondering why things things aren't working.

264~~~
At least he can be predatory in front of goal and prove efficient even if his overall performance is mediocre or poor. The last half of last season was indicative of that and it might be much of the same this season. You expect more.

Wasn't as bad as RvP and Rooney though.

265~~~
Scored 7 goals in the last 8 PL games...

266~~~
Hold on, you're saying he's not good enough for United. 
I point out that he's our only source of goals. 

And you say that's another reason he's not good enough?

Give him a worthwhile midfield to work with and he'll be even more productive.

267~~~
Not very good. Scored a goal but still. Went for a hiding again.

268~~~
Mata reminds me so much of Berbatov....he doesn't get involved enough due to a huge lack of pace which makes life impossible for all our other attackers around him....From what I've seen of Mata since he arrived here I am thinking Mourinho mugged us and I can see Mata being benched if Di Maria arrives. I'd sell Mata before selling Welbeck any day but we'll not even get a half of what we paid back for Mata from anyone else so that's why Welbeck will be sacrificed instead...

He's starting to look like another panic buy from Moyes where Moyes was willing to throw crazy money at anyone that was willing to sign for us in a desperate attempt to try and save his own sorry ass last January whether they were the right fit or not

269~~~
Not a good performance but like others, suffers from a lack of pace and tempo in the team alongside him.

270~~~
I'm saying that he was signed as a midfielder / no 10 to provide service to our strikers and he isn't currently doing. Goals are great but no one can argue that he is currently justifying the amount we payed for him. I am frustrated with everyone at the moment so bare that in mind. We just need to be seeing more of him and more of everyone.

271~~~
Spot on. If we can get di Maria and januzaj down the flanks, then the range of Matas ability will be shown. He thrives on other players movement , he'd have been some player in our previous squads with Ronaldo, tevez, and old school Rooney. The problem he has now is everyone is either running toward him or behind him.

272~~~
Players like Mata need the rest of the team to be at their 100% to look good. He thrives around quick tempo, sharp play, accurate passing and quick one twos. The closest thing to a one-two he's getting right now is Rooney's first touch. We will never see how good Mata is if our team keeps playing the way it is. Fletcher and Cleverley couldn't even get a 10 yard sideways pass right.

273~~~
He didn't go for a hiding. He was even too deep at times, what game do some of you watch? The lack of runners up front is a big reason why Mata hasn't excelled here, if our attackers make good and fast runs, he'll thread passes to them all day long.

274~~~
What are ppl expecting him to do? He was better than both RvP and Rooney, so should we drop all 3 then? He had to drop deep, helped out in defence, scored our only goal and won some free-kicks. If ppl are expecting Ronaldo/Messi level performances from one player alone then they will be disappointed and it won't matter if that player is Herrera, Mata, Di Maria or Vidal. No one will get us over the line alone if some others are playing like amateurs.

275~~~
Indeed, if anything he needs actual football players in midfield with him and players giving him the ball in the right spaces.

276~~~
One thing I do expect better from him is his delivery from set pieces which has been atrocious in the first two games.

277~~~
He's just not a Manchester United style player. Kagawa deserves a chance in the next game.

278~~~
And having mata in your team does not require the need of playing 2 strikers, why? because his contribution makes up for that one striker sacrificed, he scores goals especially with di maria on board. The rooney and rvp axis has not place in this team if you have mata on board. I do think 4231 is the best way to get the best out of mata, and for me di maria mata and janazaj in a front 3 behind the striker will offer us more balance, very few teams play 2 upfront. Mata needs players with pace for mata to do well, with wingers that can do damage it gives mata the space, and he has far more options either side of him. If everything is played infront of him, it makes mata's job much harder, and you may is well play him out wide

Imagine how good we could be playing this 
di maria mata janazaj
rooney

mata would be like a new signing, and we would regain that speed that has been lacking for so long

279~~~
He'll not be getting it unless you're talking about MK Dons. Kagawa isn't even next in line.

280~~~
He, Rooney and RVP don't get the ball enough to be effective, constantly dropping deep because our midfield can't find them with a pass or make space for them.

281~~~
What exactly is that type of player?

282~~~
Who's next in line? And I was talking about MK Dons. If he does well against them then he should play the next league game too.

283~~~
This Mata bashing is getting ridiculous lately. He was the best of our 3 star players and somehow he's getting all the shit.

284~~~
Someone who has either a modicum of presence off the ball, or at least provides a huge threat on it e.g. Ronaldo. Mata is a luxury player and we've never had any success with luxury players at United.

285~~~
Just like Kagawa(or maybe to an even bigger degree?) Mata is very dependant on high tempo and having players on both wings running at players to create space and panic. But he still scores and assists! It's actually amazing how good he is at being at the right place at the right time. He must have better awareness in front of goal than 90% of top strikers.

Today's game perfectly illustrated <i>why </i>Mata is a dead on starter. He has the ability to get those simple tap-ins at any time, unlike most no.10's. I wouldn't trust Özil, Silva, Kagawa, Iniesta or Götze pull off the same on a bad day.

286~~~
Januzaj clearly since he's been the go to player in both of our games. Playing against a League One side isn't really grounds for claiming a first team spot in the Premier League.

287~~~
He's only a luxury player if you play him out of position or don't have the necessary back bone to get the best out of him i.e a competent midfield that can actually pass the ball forward quickly and effectively, and runners in behind a defence.

288~~~
This is what I mean too. Too often he's absolutely invisible on the pitch when he's not on the ball. He's not got that presence and hardly moved around off the ball to get into good positions to receive it.

289~~~
I am not comparing the two obviously as they are a long way apart in terms of ability but that sounds alarmingly like the excuses that used to be trotted out for Cleverley. Mata will need to offer a bit more to be a regular starter and actually adapt to differing circumstances and take the initiative. If he can't, then 38 million or not, we need to reconsider whether we play him.

290~~~
He's only a luxury player because he needs every other player in the team to fit in with his style and set him up in the right areas in order to be properly effective? Yep, that'll be the definition of a luxury player there.

291~~~
I could maybe understand the sympathy for him if he didn't instantly look to go backwards or safe every time he picked up the ball, even though plenty of times he had time to turn and go towards goal.

I think he's a bit of an embarassment. He's the club's record signing and yet he's the biggest coward/bottler in the team.

I know people seem to have a thing for these fancy no10 type players, but sooner or later the excuses will run out.

First it was Mourinho being racist against him, then it was Moyes playing him out of position, then it was Moyes not picking the right players around him, now its all of his team mates faults for not carrying him enough. It's like listening to a bunch of derranged over protective mums.

What it is is that he needs to man the feck up and grow a pair instead of only showing up in games where the opposition don't.

I would just drop him personally. Though Rooney isn't faring much better with his array of sideways buckpasses.

292~~~
And you propose fixing this by playing Kagawa? Where have you been the last two years?

293~~~
A competent midfield, surely not asking too much?

294~~~
As an AM he's scored 7 goals in his last 8 PL games in a horribly dysfunctional team filled with utter dross, with no competent CM's, and no competent wingers. And he's the problem?

295~~~
I'd say the odds are getting higher that soon Van Gaal will switch to 433 with Mata being the odd man out who gets benched...He's just not a Utd player and never will be

296~~~
Kagawa at least makes good runs and tries to make things happen. He's a site quicker than Mata too. I'm by no means sold on Kagawa but I've seen glimpses of a guy who could fit in at United - not really seen much of that in Mata myself.

297~~~
The run made by Mata for the goal was shite enough too. Mata has performed better than Kagawa without ever setting the world alight himself. No great surprise given he's a better player.

298~~~
How many of those games resulted in wins though? He hasnt even nearly got the level he was at during our second season with him and  that I think  some of you overhype, we were an average team then and he shone.

299~~~
So play him as a poacher then if that's all he's good for. One good run does not a swallow make. Or something.

300~~~
Sounds like what people were saying about Kagawa last year.

301~~~
Rooney is dropping deep because he is no longer capable of beating a defender or running in behind. He's taking up the same positions as Mata constantly. It was a problem for Kagawa when he first joined and he needs to stop trying to be a number 10 or midfielder he's incapable of it.

As for Mata you'll never see the best from him unless you get players with pace to take advantage of his passing range. Both Rooney and RVP couldn't beat O'shea in a straight race.

302~~~
If you think that's all he's good for I'm not surprised you want Kagawa in the the team ahead of him. You obviously haven't been watching football for long.

303~~~
Neville genuinely doesn't like this guy does he?

"He'll drop the £40m players, he's done it before" - Very vague about who he meant there briefing after saying RVP and Rooney were starters or something.

304~~~
I really don't get why people are lashing out at him.... what do they expect him to do, dribble past the entire defense with lightening pace to create chances for himself and score goal after goal from it ?

Mata is not such a player, never was, not even in his best time at Chelsea, he is a playmaker, his value comes from his ability to read the game and see opportunities that others wouldn't see and his ability to accuratley and quickly play the ball were he wants it. But if the other midfielders, wingers and strikers around him don't move about and create any openings there is not much he can do, except from trying to force things himself but that is not his game, trying to play some long balls and crosses and try to impact the game on a free kick or corner and I think he he has impacted our game quite alot since he has been here already, as you said 7 goals out of 8 games and also a couple of assists, it certainly not bad. He can improve and I have no doubt he will, but he'll never run the show alone, he is no Ronaldo, Bale or Suarez who can open up a game by theirselve and we all know he lacks the speed and defensive workrate to be effective on the wing, he needs to play in the hole and play intelligent balls behind the defense, but before he can start doing that we need midfielders, wingers and strikers that will make more runs and play faster, Di Maria will be a huge boost to Matas game aswell and Januzaj needs to start playing more games aswell and if Rooney and RVP keep playing like this then Welbeck deserves his chance in the team aswell.

I don't know about last season as most of the games were meaningless by the end and he seems to have no issue showing up once it's not important (i.e. when there's no pressure).

He's definitely been the main problem going forwards in the last two games. There were times today where he was picking the ball up facing the opposition goal, with no player close to him, and then TURNING AROUND to look for a backwards pass. It's annoying enough watching people like Carrick be too cowardly to try and create anything. Mata is in the team specifically to do that, and the club paid a record fee in order to get him to. 

We have set up with a system specifically designed to cater for his position, at the expense of other players, and not only is he not doing the job but he's too scared to get on the ball and try. He certainly doesn't have the excuse of not being talented enough.

Van Persie and Welbeck's movement were fine today as well. Cleverley was running off the ball whenever he could. Young and Valencia constantly got forward to drag defenders away. All of the excuses people have made since this time last year, just don't wash. Our centrebacks were bringing the ball out of defence looking for a forward pass, and time and again Mata was nowhere to be seen.

306~~~
I think you're wilfully misconstruing what I'm saying. He's a brilliant player. He doesn't fit in very well at Manchester United - I expect more than a good poacher's run in a game from a player with Mata's abilities.

Kagawa is a slightly less brilliant player. But I think he could fit in at Manchester United.

307~~~
Have to agree with your general sentiment, although you are a tad too harsh.

308~~~
This thread is turning out just like the Kagawa thread. They both need runners to bring the best out of them.

309~~~
He has a look inside the box and sees both Rooney and van Persie on the edge of the box with none of them making a run inside, of course he has to go sideways or backward. He didn't even have midfield runners in behind him to help our team penetrate the opposition back 4. Our team lacked movement, ideas and creativity.

310~~~
Nobody's movement was "fine" today. Our strikers/wingers are the most static forwards I've ever seen. 90% of the time they're standard still/walking, looking longingly at the man with the ball rather than actually doing anything. He is not one to dribble through defences, he relies on others making runs which our forwards appear uniquely incapable of doing.

In fact, I actually remember Mata penetrating the box a couple of times...something our other forwards failed at horribly.

311~~~
You were on to something until you started talking about movement.

312~~~
He does very little for my liking. Today's game doesn't show how good he is, but just pathetic everyone around is. I don't want him dropped, just not yet, he really needs to involve more though. Doesn't look like a player currently one would pay that much amount for.

313~~~
No one's going to make a run inside the box when we have it centrally and the opposition have their entire team lined up behind the ball, because it would be literally impossible to find them with a pass. That's why good teams always play at a tempo.

I think you'll find if you watch the game back without your Mata mothering glasses on, that the main issue was the amount of time it was taking anyone to get the ball off our centrebacks and actually go towards the opposition goal.

It wasn't just Mata, but he IS the player who's role in the team is specifically to be a playmaker (i.e. to make sure this isn't an issue), and half the time he wasn't even showing for the ball let alone doing anything with it.

He doesn't look like a good player in a shite team. He looks like a pointless player hiding in a shite team.

But yeah whatever, it's everyone and everything else on the planet that's making him play poorly. Nothing to do with himself at all.

314~~~
I think he's the source of all evil.

315~~~
At the end of the day the mainthing he's done so far is look good in a, by their standards, poor Chelsea side, when the team was specifically built to play around him.

Mourinho came in and wanted a functional, efficient team as he always does, and suddenly found that whatever role he put Mata in, he didn't do enough, so benched him and then got rid.

People seemed to want to overlook that, and to be honest I was willing to if he'd come in here and done the business, but so far he hasn't. He's turned it on when the team as a whole have been spanking the likes of Norwich. When the games are tougher you invariably seem to find the luxury of him being there turns into more of a burden.

He's talented enough to do something about that but I'm not convinced he has the guts or fire in him to make it happen. He reminds me of Veron or Berbatov.

316~~~
I don't think he is been playing half as poorly as people are making him out to be.

What do people want exactly ? Playing him another position, benching him, selling him ? What good will that do us, we all know he is by far our best option on the 10, we know he can be a massive player, have people given up on him or something ? We need to support him, play him in the n10 position and do something about the really bad players like Cleverley, Fletcher, Young , Valencia and set him up to succeed, it is what you do with your good players....Surely Mata deserves our support and the time to turn things around, he might be one of the few in the team that actually has the skill to do that, together with Januzaj and RVP and Rooney. If people start to give up on these players aswell and want them out, I truely wouldn't know what we have to do as a club, these players are the way forward for us, helping them to succeed should be our and the managers number one priority.

I get people are frustrated about the result, more than anything, but I taking it out on Mata is just not fair and won't solve anything. He wasn't one of the worst players on the pitch, he was one of the few decent ones and he is the one that scored the goal that got us a point, his 7th goal in 8 games so far, the best player at Chelsea for two seasons, fecking get some perspective !

He isn't part of the problem he is part of the solution, people really need to start seeing that !

317~~~
I will always support players who give it their all and aren't afraid to try.

I'm not going to waste my time blindly supporting players who hide from the ball or are too scared to try and do anything with it, just because they're apparently nice blokes or have some army of biased, heat map loving internet fans.

He needs to man up and show he's got an ounce of fight in him. Otherwise he very much IS part of the problem, as he was today and against Swansea.

318~~~
Seems like Mata is this season's scapegoat.

319~~~
Not at all. I thought Jones, Blackett and Keane were the only three who were better than crap today. At least with players like Cleverley for example though, it's because they're genuinely not that good.

When you've got Mata and Rooney, supposedly two of the best attacking players in the league, pioneering the new found skill, the "buckpass", it's fair they should shoulder more of the responsibility for the resulting shite performance, because they are the ones who have zero excuse to not be doing better.

Valencia is another. He might not be as good as he was but even if he was, he'd never find out because he's become too shit scared to try and do anything a below bog standard player couldn't do.

If you don't like or want the responsibility of being a United player, then you're not a United player. Basically

320~~~
why are people moaning about Mata? Or are we doing that exceptionally irritating thing after every non win, of systematically moaning about a different player on every thread.

321~~~
"Giving their all" isn't enough.

And aren't you the one who questionned what Özil does and aren't you the one who generally doesn't see the point of a No 10? Then you will never like Mata. You probably don't appreciate players like him, Silva, Cazorla or Özil as United never had players like them.

322~~~
Mata was United's best player today. We have worse concerns than him.

323~~~
Silva's excelllent and Cazorla is a decent player as long as the other team don't have the ball.

Ozil disappears whenever things get difficult and has a similar clan of obsessive, weird internet fans as Mata does and Kagawa did have. He's stupidly overated.

I don't recall saying I don't see the point in a number ten...in fact in our current set up it's probably the most important position, but don't let what I did or didn't actually say get in the way of you completely making stuff up.

324~~~
I am not making stuff up, you said you don't see the point of them because they neither contribute too much to attack nor defence. But it's OK as long as our players "man up and give everything" it's of course better than having talented players like Özil or Mata.

325~~~
He'd clearly prefer a team full off Valencias I guess

326~~~
For a number #10 like Mata, none of our wide players or forwards stretch teams enough for him, and our midfield aren't good enough for him to dictate the game. 

Look at the Chelsea side who won the CL with him, I'd argue that's Mata at his best. You had Drogba on the last defender using his size and strength and power, and the likes of Malouda, Kalou, Ramires etc out wide using their pace to get in behind.

327~~~
That's not what I said at all and I also named Valencia as one of the cuplrits in a post more or less directly above these two.

I don't have an agenda against a position on a pitch. Not sure why I'm needing to point that out.

Not sure how I can argue against people who just completely make up absurd things I've never said in order to argue against me, but I guess its brainbox hour on the caf again.

328~~~
Wow.

329~~~
Chelsea had huge problems that year with Mata in their team like us now. 

Mata is a player that will add goals from midfield and a touch of class. That's him. We are getting that from him. The reason we aren't winning matches lies elsewhere.

330~~~
Midfield was poor, Rooney wasn't great, Wingers were terrible, van Persie didn't do much, there is a case for some of the defenders but Mata was the only one who looked like hurting them, and he scored the goal.

331~~~
They had huge problems but they utilised Mata superbly. The problems didn't stop them winning the champions league, and then making themselves stronger by signing Hazard and Oscar.

332~~~
It was everyone else who made him look bad.

The United players, Mourinho, Lord Lucan, the allignment of the planets. That and light reflecting off a weather balloon gave the illusion of making him look more pedestrian than he was.

333~~~
You said you stick by players who man up, give it their all and show an ounce of fight. I don't know what players in the team you are refering to exactly, but Valencia for me is a player that often fights and shows himself, so is Young in fact, but it is clear they aren't good enough and them fighting and trying isn't winning us any points. Next to them you have a neat player like Mata that has a football brain the likes of Valencia and Young could only dream about, positioning him more carefully and actually scoring a goal that won us a point today, his 7th goal in 8 games...more than Young and Valencia have been scoring for us combined in like two seasons. Now again I don't know what players you are reffering to, so maybay Valencia and Young aren't the example, who is Rooney ? because I honestly can't think of any players that consistently gives more "fight" or whatever you'd call it than Mata and are so much worthier of your support, Januzaj perhaps or RVP (who in my opnion is also doing feck all for the team atm).

I just don't get people criticsing Mata at all, what has he done so terrible wrong that he deserves people lashing out to him like that ?

334~~~
I get the criticism of him in terms of him personally driving the play, it's something he needs to be improving although you could apply that to everyone. However I think some are being harsh. Said it before but if there were runs he wasn't picking out or link up's he was missing I could understand but that's not the case. Got players who don't move off the ball and players who continually check when on the ball, you can't play a give and go cause odds are the other guy will pass it back/sideways.

I don't think it's a coincidence that in terms of play making two very established players in Kagawa and Mata are struggling. Not like either are really making a step up in terms of quality of team they came in to. Personally I think our attacking set up would lead to anyone bar an excellent dribbler struggling because these types of players are reliant on the movement and interplay around them to shine.

335~~~
What? Will you read that back to yourself you actually sound like his mum

Valencia is THE biggest culprit when it comes to going hiding. Young you can't accuse of that so much but like Cleverley, Fletcher, et all he just isn't very good. The key is neither is Valencia, really. Not in comparison to Mata or Rooney or RVP. Van Persie I thought just didn't look sharp, while Mata and Rooney were DEFINITELY shirking the responsibility of spearheading our attacking play.

Mata has been given the role of orchestrating our attacking play, and our attacking play as a result is absolutely fecking terrible. It's not entirely his fault but in his performances I don't see a player trying their best to make it work or making sure the game and opportunity doesn't pass him by. I don't see a player who looks more talented than everyone else in the team and worthy of the team being based around him as opposed to the four or five other players who probably think they're best suited in that position. I see someone who just wants to coast through games doing the nice things but then cowers away like a wimp when it turns out the opposition aren't just going to roll over and let him.

He doesn't have to go elbow anyone in the face or anything, but he could at least TRY and do something other than have about 6 reluctant touches then pass the ball sideways. Anyone can do that.

It says enough that people feel the need to come on here and blame everything under the sun for him not playing well. If he WAS doing his job properly you'd all be on here gushing about how good he is, not making, at best, weak excuses for why he isn't.

How long have the excuses been going on now? Over a year, over two different clubs. three different managers, countless different positions and systems he's played in. When will it sink in that maybe, just maybe, HE is the one who needs to start doing better if he wants to make a success of himself?

336~~~
There was no movement or pace ahead of him today. Fletcher and Cleverly behind him can't be easy either. Di Maria should be great for Mata, and Herrera returning will help him as well. I don't think there's a problem with Mata at all. We just have two many mediocre players in the team at the moment.

337~~~
He did seem to not want the ball a few times today. It was suprising to see him getting the ball and getting rid of it seemingly as quick as possible rather than look up and try something.

What the feck have you done to him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

338~~~
We're awesome at neutering our attackers. Mata, Kagawa, Welbeck, Nani, Chicharito...

339~~~
He ain't that type of player, he excells at distribution and controlling the tempo, you want a player that can carry the ball forward himself, you should have signed a player with more pace, who is better at dribbling and has got some more steel in his game. People imo are looking for the wrong things from Mata, I get distribution can't be and shouldn't be the only thing he tries doing, but I think he really trys his best when he is not on the ball, he certainly doesn't strike me as pedestrain or lazy as some are labeling him. People can't expect a player like Mata to be one of our most dueling players out there, you can't expect him to recover a shit load of balls, that is not his game, he has to contribute to that and I think he trys hard and isn't as absent as many people describe him to be, nor can people expect him to be like Ronaldo or Bale and dribble his way past a hoard of defenders at lightening speed, that isn't his game either. You need him on the ball in the middle of the pitch for distrbution, but if he can't distribute the ball anywhere because nobobody is making any runs into the box or our wingers are completley useless, you can't expect him to open things up just like that and create a chance, nor can you expect him to control the tempo of the game if everybody around him losing the ball all the time because of bad touches or because of bad passes or because of the fact they don't know what to do with the ball half of the time and end up being pressured into losing the ball. 

It is very hard for Mata to do what he is good at and what we bought him if all the rest around him isn't even capabel of playing basic football at times. Ienesta would be ineffective for us aswell if the other players play like that. A number 10 needs movement around him to shine, players opening up gaps to play the ball into, players that actually have the technique to properly receive the ball they get and pass it on, that is the way you can up the tempo and create chances, and that is what Mata is good at, distribution, being the maestro of the midfield controlling the tempo. If you expect him to be anything else than that you have been fooling yourself from the start and if people can't understand how hard it is to be effective in this role if the entire team around you isn't capable of doing certain things like making runs and having a good first touch and playing the ball at decent tempo than you just don't understand  enough of the game and how everything is connected on the pitch.

340~~~
Probably the result of there not being any opportunities for him to play the ball into. When he knows he can't do anything with the ball, it is sometimes best to pass it on and start moving yourself rather cling onto it and slow down the game. He should only be clinging  onto the ball if he has a purpose for it, in fact I think it is one of our biggest problems is we have to many players holding onto to the ball too long and slowing us down. if you don't immediatly know where to play to, sometimes it is just best pass it on as fast as you can and move, if everybody would be doing that pass and move, the tempo would be going up and gaps would be opening up and somebody like Mata may actually find a purpose for a good forward pass or cross when he is on the ball instead of just looking to get rid of it asap.

341~~~
I doubt Mourinho got rid of him for absolutely no reason at all...and to be fair when he looked decent for you was when you were a million miles away from looking like a title challenging team. Now all of a sudden you do despite not really having anyone as talented in his role.

To be honest I still think he's got it all to prove when it comes to being a very top player. There's plenty of players who have all the ability in the world but lack the fire or drive to go with it, and until he starts showing otherwise I've still got him in that category.

Though one thing is when he was good for you I never saw him go hiding like he does for us.

342~~~
1: Lets agree to disagree because I don't see Mata in that way at all, in fact I disagree on about everything you said in that little discription about him as a player.

2: This somehow just doesn't sink in with you at all, but in order for Mata to be able to do his job at orchestrating the attacking play it is also required other players do a better job. Again you can't expect him to play in a forward pass into the box if no one attempts to run into the box and it is very hard to up the tempo of the attack if everybody around him is losing the ball all the time and slowing us down all the time. It is like blaming the director of an orchestra for playing bad music while the musicians in the orchestra don't half know how to hold their instruments properly. I'll grant you the fact that he hasn't been playing at his best form for quite awhile now but the two things are ofc not entirely disconnected. I'am also not saying he is playing fantastic football because obviously nobody in the team is, I just find the criticism (and he deserves to be criticsed as much as anybody else) over the top and I don't understand people like you lashing out at him like that. I don't get it at all, that is the only reason I'am defending him.

3: What excuses are you talking about ? Mata has not been a succes at Chelsea ? He was their best player for 2 consectuvie years for crying out loud, ask the fans what they think about Mata and see if they agree on your stance that he wasn't a success there. The only problems were with Mourinho who didn't rate him as much as he rated Oscar for some reason and didn't let him play as much as he deserved, and why has he been a faillure at United exactly, again 7th goal in 8 games and I don't know how many assists, but I think he has a couple of them aswell. How in anyway is that a failure ? Sure it not winning us games and the overall attack sucks donkeyass but again that is not his sole responsibility, in fact he can't do much about that if he has to play together with turds like Cleverley and Young. Really again what excuses ? The excuse that n10 is better suited to him than winger ?

343~~~
Wait are you suggesting Chelsea became a title challenging side because they got rid of Mata ?

Obivously I don't want him to leave but part of me would like him to have played in a beter team than he has so far with us and prove you totally wrong. Do you rate Silva and Ienesta as top players or are you weird about them aswell ? Because I bet my ass neither would be anymore effective for us if they have to play with this shit around them.

344~~~
Just wait until they make Di Maria look like Bebe.

345~~~
Surround him with energetic, technical players like Di Maria, Herrera, Shaw and Rafael and I reckon we'll see him flourish. I still think next season we'll probably need to get a forward with real pace to see the very best of Mata and Di Maria but just having everyone back fit will have a marked difference because Young, Valencia, Cleverley and Fletcher are nowhere near the level of their counterparts.

346~~~
Wow you really are bitter about him moving to us aren't you ?

347~~~
I'm outraged.

348~~~
you cant criticise Mata on here, people will defend him no matter how bad he plays. Just because he is a likeable guy and looks attractive, he seems to have his fanbase on here. Creating nothing in the 2 games is really poor. His deliveries from set pieces were awful too. We have enough players who could play in his position. He should be benched for a few games and can write about his feelings on his blog.

349~~~
<a class="username" data-user="66456, @NoArroJusBeta" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66456/">@NoArroJusBeta</a> , I actually found myself agreeing with most things you said about Mata.

Noods and a few other posters will have egg on their face at the end of the season.

350~~~
Its not the other players, its not the formation,  he just doesn't play like he used to, he used to do things by himself, scoring tap ins and blind crosses were not Matas strong points.

351~~~
He certainly has a dip in form indeed, benching him might be the best for himself. So he doesn't feel like an automatic starter and gets that drive back.

352~~~
Not easy for him to perform at his best seeing as he only has two players in front of him to who both just pretty much stands there. There are no runs being made at all, no spaces created in which to run or play through balls. No wonder we're passing it backwards/sideways and hoofing it. Still did the most out of the front three today, would rather see one of Rooney or RvP benched and go 4-2-3-1 once we get some midfielders back.

353~~~
I think the problem with players like Mata is that they need to have other players with pace in the side, players who can commit defenders to drag them out of position and stretch the opposition. Someone who can create the space for them to operate in and pick the opposition apart, but also quick players for the attacking midfielder to pass it to, or runners in behind. Probably why both Mata and Kagawa have struggled, as has Rooney when playing in a #10 position the last few years.

354~~~

355~~~
Benching him will not bring his best form back either. i'd be all for benching if there was serious reason to belive that kagawa, Rooney or januzaj could do a better job in the hole but for the same reasons as I said that Mata is uneffective for us atm so to will those players be uneffective, in fact in some aspects I think they will be worse than Mata. I don't mind other players getting their chance, but I don't think it will adi us much to be honest and benching Mata also won't bring the best out of him either.

356~~~
In that case we might as well bench the entire team bar Jones, DDG and Blackett. I understand what you mean but it is not like he has been having a bad game whilst everyone around him is flourishing. He has been really poor the past few games but I feel it has a lot more to do with the lack of quality service from behind him rather than his own poor performances. If you are the team's primary creative force and aren't even getting the balls in the danger area what can you do? He is not someone who can ghost past 4 players and put it in the top corner or miraculously pluck out wonder-passes with zero teamwork/good runs from his teammates. I have already made a huge post on this and don't want to continue repeating myself(not directed at you Vato). I will just quote the post for anyone interested in reading it.

357~~~
1) To be honest if you didn't think Mata, for a player of such supposed talent, played badly today and last week then your opinion on anything in any football game probably isn't to be trusted.

2) Look, if you're willing to argue that it's literally everyone else on the planet's fault for Mata not performing before you'll even consider looking at Mata himself, what's the point in even having this discussion? No matter how bad he plays he'll never do wrong in your eyes. There'll always be an excuse that avoids the need for Mata himself to do better. 

Do you seriously believe he couldn't have done a lot better than he did today? All those times he shirked away from the ball, actively turned away from goal to go backwards. Every single piss poor set piece, was entirely someone else's fault other than his?

Seriously? 

3) I know a lot of Chelsea fans and they all love him, but you wont find any that wont concede they're a much better team now than they were before Mourinho decided he could do without Mata. A number have told me Oscar, Willian, Hazard etc. simply do more for the team and when Mourinho gave Mata a chance that wasn't the case.

Mourinho's made Chelsea into a title challenging team by getting rid of Mata. It's not really possible to claim otherwise because whether you like it or not this is literally what has happened. You can argue about the ins and outs and reasons why, but it's highly unlikely Mourinho just thought he'd get rid of him for a laugh, is it?

The problem is if we had a better team than we do I'm begining to strongly suspect he simply wouldn't be in it. Either that or HE would have to start being a lot less pedestrian. I hope he does start doing that but today and last week were hardly encouraging...and this idea everything poor Mata does is someone else in the team's fault is frankly stupid and childish. It's a completely self defeating and dumb argument.

"oh, it's not his fault at all. He needs great players all around him in order to play well" ...well then by definition he's not a great player, he's a passenger

358~~~
I honestly want to know what players aren't passengers by noodle's definition. I've watched a lot of football, and even the best are restricted by an archaic system, and a lack of talent around them. Not saying Mata couldn't have done more mind, but our lunatic way of playing football inhibits his ability to flourish. IMO.

359~~~
Is every system we play going to be "archaic" if Mata doesn't play well in it? Because he's played in like three different systems since he's been at United. Morurinho tried him in different roles in yet another different system. If every system being used these days is archaic, then how exactly can they be archaic?

And if you haven't noticed, we do actually have a rather large number of passengers in the team at the moment.

Just out of curiousity, is there an army of idiots in the Rooney thread attributing his poor performance to everything except the possibility of him playing poorly? I bet there isn't.

360~~~
Just looked...nope. Full of people saying Rooney's finished and we should sell him...One goal and two poor performances each so far this season.

Sorry but this place is full of absolute tools.

361~~~
Yeah but Rooney isn't spanish and was signed a decade ago, big difference clearly

362~~~
All fair points, especially on Rooney.

363~~~
I haven't said he played well in the Swansea or Sunderland game. But hardly anybody played well in those games and certainly today Mata was one of the players that annoyed me the least, in fact I think today he was one of the few decent players, not brilliant not even good but just decent or atleast acceptable if compared to the others. That is why I don't get the over the top critcism he is getting from you, again what has he done this game to upset you this much, because I can certainly tell you I was fuming when watching United this evening but it was Cleverley, Fletcher, Young and Valencia that were winiding me up primarily and to an extent also Rooney and RVP because I always expect something from him and he literally did feck all, our defense I was happy with, didn't do much wrong and from all other outfield players Mata was the one that didn't annoy, he certainly didn't blow me out of the water or anything like that, yet I was happy at his intelligent run in that led to the goal. So if you want to vent frustration, I get it but shouldn't you be all over the other players first instead of brining it all onto Mata ?

Mata playing really bad is not Mata not making creative passes when there is no opportunity for him to make any, it would be Mata not playing decent passes when there are alot of opportunities for him to do so. Mata can certainly do wrong in my eyes, but again why should I single him out if he was one of the only players today that I actually saw doing something good ? He didn't play brilliant and he can certainly do alot better, actually the reason i'am defensing him on here is because I know he can do alot better, because I have seen it already in other games and at Chelsea. I'am I happy at his performance no, but if you can't accept that his performance is also linked to the performance of other players in the team than there is no point in discussing with you. Again how can he set up a goal or anything like that if RVP and Rooney don't run into the box ?

Chelsea became a better because they brought in Mourinho not because they let go of Mata. Certainly Mourinho chose Oscar over Mata because he is more his type of player, that doesn't mean Mata is a bad player and was pulling Chelsea down it just means that Mourinho chose a path forward for Chelsea in which he didn't need mata anymore, another coach might have had a different path forward with Mata that might also have succeeded, in fact Mourinho never even tried Mata, he just consistently didn't play him and picked oscar over him, alot of Chelsea fans didn't understand his decision and still don't understand his decision in that respect but accepted it because he was Mourinho and was higher in the their hirarchy then Mata and because Chelsea were doing beter than in the previous years. Ofcourse Mata wasn't the only different factor to previous years, most important was a diffrent coach and certain reinforcements like Willian, Schürle, Eto'o and ofcourse Matic and Mourinho didn't drastically improve Chelsea, he made them more consistent versus smaller teams but they weren't exactly title challening last season, Liverpool and City were and they justifybly ended up behind both of them, they weren't any more challening than Arsenal. And yea now this season they will be up there but that is because they have Courtois, Costa, Luis and Fabregas as additions. I think you are seriously overstating the effect Mata had in this change, like he was somehow the one holding it all back and having the guts to drop him somehow solved all their problems ?

In fact here is a really nice analysis of Mata under Mourinho and how Mourinho basically had laready made up his mind about Mata and Oscar in the first place and just set him up to fail by playing him as a RW.

It is not because you need great players around you to get the best out of you that you are a passenger. I wouldn't exactly call him a passenger, he has scored 7 goals and gave 5 assists in a total of 18 games he has played for United, how is that bad, how the feck can you even suggest he is a passenger ? If he is a passenger than who the feck isn't according to you ?

364~~~
I was hard on him last week but I actually thought he was better. Certainly better than RvP and Rooney. He dropped deep to get the ball quite often (though can you blame him considering who we had in CM?) I want to see him and Welbeck play together. They looked good in pre-season and Mata can play around Welbeck's pace.

365~~~
I thought he was pretty crap, and yet still managed to be in our top 5 best performers... which speaks for itself really.

366~~~
It is funny that whenever Mata or Kagawa plays poorly, the majority of posters blame everyone else but when Rooney plays poorly, there's barely a single peep about how other players performed.

367~~~
Definitely.

368~~~
When they are poor they don't give the ball away and play with a first touch that feels like a ball hitting a lead foot. Rooney's short range passing and overall game has been comfortably worse than anything Mata or Kagawa have produced and his industriousness has dropped several levels since his prime.

369~~~
Because they are at the very least tidy. Rooney's touch and passes become awful when he's playing poorly.

370~~~
Rooney being piss poor at his worst shouldn't be a reason why Kagawa and Mata get excuses rolled out when they play poorly. And both are absolutely spineless at their worst.

371~~~
How people are discrediting him after our open to the season is beyond me.

372~~~
I vaguely recall after a Utd vs Chelsea match a few years ago a good post <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> made about Mata. People were saying he ran the game against us which I thought was a huge exaggeration. Brwned said something to the effect that he was a creative attacker who tended to drift in and out of games rather than a playmaker who controlled matches across the full 90 minutes. I thought it made sense at the time and I worry it still holds true. I wanted him to be the creative hub of the team but I'm starting to have my doubts as to whether that's the right role for him. That doesn't mean he can't be a success here,but it might mean yet more shuffling around looking for the right formation and line up.

373~~~
I think it's always been painfully obvious that he's not a playmaker. He's a final 3rd player and a brilliant one at that but not the kind of player we needed. Still, it could have been worse. We might have signed Ozil for 40m and he doesn't even score tap ins.

374~~~
Agree with a lot of what you've said in this thread (especially the last sentence)

Mata seems to have some "get out of jail free" card which makes him immune from any criticism from the vast majority of caftards, no matter how badly he plays. It's frustrating. I assume it's on the basis of his record at Chelsea because if people on here really rate him as highly as they do based on how he's played for United than this place has gone to the dogs far more comprehensively than I feared.

Through most of last season his relative anonymity when we needed him most was put down to a crap manager, playing him out of position. Now he's under a very good manager, playing in his preferred position and equally as peripheral. I remember thinking he was great at Chelsea and I still hope he can turn things round at United but I do worry that he's not as good as he's being made out to be and that he's turning out to be a 40m quid headache Van Gaal could really do without.

375~~~
Noodle is right about title challenging and Mata, it's something I felt even while he was here even during his excellent second season with us.

I never felt as though we could win the title with him, he didnt contribute enough to that. Winning titles is about a lot more than  goals and assists, but that's a symptom of the narrow minded view of football whereby attacking players get far more praise and support than ones that attack and defend.

Willian for example does a far better job than Mata towards winning a title, but I  doubt many would say Willian was a better player, simply because hes not quite as a technical.

'Better player' is  all subjective. Vidic is a better player than RVP and Rooney imo ( all at their peak).

Once we had established Willian into the team and Mata had gone we had our best form and conceded about 3 goals in 11 games, now  Matic and Fabregas are in the side full time his contrubition is shown even more.

It's something i;ve had to come to realise too, as  some of you know I was against the selling of Mata at first, but within  a month I came to realise that it was for the  good of the team.

376~~~
Agreed..building an effective unit comes first. Individually, RVP, Rooney and Mata.. are all capable of racking up decent stats, but for a guy like Danny.. makes us look a far better team due to his ability to run at players. He is a handful.

377~~~
I didn't realize that we're ready to start knocking Mata yet. Signed in January, played under a shite manager out of position with a bunch of pedestrians for nearly 6 months. Yup his number is up! 
if any of Rooney or RVP did any better then I get that we're hard on Mata,but they were all rubbish and to that end I would say he gets a few more matches under the new manager to prove his worth.

378~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So true

379~~~
I would have thought these two results would have indicated maybe Moyes wasnt as bad as was made out, and that a lot of the onus is on the players?
Playing out of position is a poor excuse as well, its not as if hes being played in goal. You are right though Rooney or RVP arent much better at present, this is a problem though, you constantly say they are your best three players but  in the last season and 2 games they have not shown it at all. How long do they still ride on this ' best three status'?

DDG is by far and away your best player, and this season so far I think Blackett has been your second best.

380~~~
We currently have a star studded attacking department (Mata, Kagawa, Rooney, RVP and Januzaj) and yet we still playing shite. Now either Chelsea's player of the year (2 occasions), Bundersliga player of the year, the captain, one of the finest strikers in the EPL and one of the most promising wingers in the world have suddenly become shit or else we simply do not have an adequate defensive department to support them. 

Hence why I don't see Di Maria as the answer. He's a fantastic player but priority should be given to the DM and defense

381~~~
It's more to do with the system, I believe. 

At no point have both Rooney and RvP shown that they can play together - even during Fergie's last season. Individually, those three are the best players at the club, but when played together, they just don't work at all!

382~~~
Plus they need a midfield to supplement them. Atleast a functional one.

383~~~
They may be talented but they are too static (I am thinking of the "first choice" three of Mata, RVP and Rooney). Unless the option is Di Maria or midfielder (and surely we can afford both given the circumstances), then I see only upside with Di Maria. United have gone far too long without a high quality, pacey attacker with dribbling ability (probably going back to Nani's deceptive "emergence" in 2010).

384~~~
I'd be patient. I really think if someone can get them ticking, it'll be Van Gaal, but it's still incredibly early days to be writing them all off. They need more training and more games in this new system to get them playing more naturally.

385~~~
Also, for some reason, people on here seem to think Mata is a below par player. All things considered, Mata is the best number 10 at the club. And it was Rooney himself who didn't want the sideshow role at the club anymore. Now that he has been put at the top, I don't see any reason for him to drop deep in the midfield now that we have Mata on the pitch. In the last two matches, many a times when Mata has received the ball, he had no one to pass in front of him and was crowded out for space, hence had to pass it sideways.

386~~~
Can't believe what I'm reading at times on here. Don't care what Chelsea fans say, he was head and shoulders their best player. They are not a better team solely cause he's left. Mata came here in January to the worst team for a decade. It's still the worst utd team for a decade. LVG I believe will put it right but you need the best players to do so. Mata would not look out of place and has the technical ability to play at any top team in the world.
The best teams have access to the best players and he's one of them. I think we need wake up cause we can't just keep apportioning blame on individual players when the sum of the parts are so bad.
Anyone also forgotten that's 7 goals in 9 games now for Mata?

387~~~
Yup, and even marking Mata off right now is senseless. He just needs time and a settled system to start performing, which we still don't have thanks to the injuries and the midfield. Even with Chelsea, they had a system of 4-2-3-1 and kept to that. We have constantly changed it since last season to try out all sorts of things, which obviously doesn't help any of the players.

388~~~
Btw, Mata was comfortably the best player of our front 5 yesterday. RVP and Fletcher worst.

389~~~
Di Maria may improve the situation slightly. However the major issue is still there. We are expecting the likes of Cleverley, Fletcher and Fellaini to win the ball, shield the defense and pass it to the right channels where these players can do the damage. Its basically like installing a mini minor engine on an F16 and expect it to fly.

390~~~
Rooney drops deep because he gets zero fecking service from the midfield or Mata. When he does get it there's a wall of defenders ahead of him so he goes wide. Rinse and repeat. If we were playing good football there would be no reason for Rooney to drop deep but the fact that we're shit means he drops deeper and deeper until he's deeper than the actual CM's. RVP just disappears when we are shit.

Mata (along with Rooney and RVP) is part of the problem, the sooner people accept that, the better.

391~~~
What do you think about playing Mata as the most attacking option in a 3 men midfield (alongside DM such as De Jong and Herrera)? I think he would be great in that role.

392~~~
Chelsea are better without Mata because they replaced him with William, who is miles better defensively and is faster. They are playing Oscar in no10 role, who is more of a playmaker than last 3rd player like Mata IMO. They make a better unit defensively, and when you have Hazard, Fabregas and Costa in the team plus Oscar and William then you don’t have to worry about goals.
I don’t think anybody is questioning Mata’s ability, it’s just he thrives in certain circumstances which at this moment we can’t provide.

393~~~
Footballs about opinions but none of those players that supposably replaced him have influenced them winning anything in the same way Mata has done. When they do, then you and Chelsea might have an argument. Their loss is our gain IMO. 

To say he thrives on certain circumstances? Isn't that the same of every player....and yes there are those who question his ability to perform at this club.

394~~~
Of course. But Mata at least keeps the play ticking. And people are easily forgetting how Mata, Kagawa, Adnan linked together at the end of last season. 

And it's not as if Rooney helps by dropping deeper. He only passes it out wide wherein the pass is either cut off by the defender, or the cross hits the first man.

395~~~
Oscar can 'playmake', or whatever that even is, all he likes, he's a serious downgrade on Mata and that was particularly evident during the final stretch last season. Mata is a better player by a fair distance and has proven so for a good number of years. Wilian is a good fit for Chelsea, but again, not as good. 

Fabregas is a better player, and Chelsea will improve as a result of his inclusion in the team, but the majority of the discussion in this thread is hugely symptomatic of the grass is greener complex with which so many supporters suffer. One year ago Mata had just torn the league to pieces and was a legitimate member of the footballing elite. I thought he was better than Bale that season and I said as much at the time. Yet now, now we see him every week, and only look to search for negatives, "he's just not that good." I know you didn't say that, by the way. Honestly, I find it baffling. 

We have one of the best footballers in the league and one of the best #10s in the game. Certainly one of the most productive. We need to ensure we can get the most out of that. A 433 with wide runners like Di Maria and Januzaj would be a good start.

396~~~
He's a great player - not one of my favourites - but regardless, he positioned himself greatly for the goal. I think that was one of three actual runs the forwards made off the ball, which is staggering. My gripe yesterday was that he looked just as passive as Fletcher and Cleverley in coming for the ball, and he had just as many sloppy passes as Rooney was making.

397~~~
This was my question for last season as well. We had pretty much the same squad if we look at the midtfield and attack, and we sorely needed a defender (to fill in the gap after the players we knew were leaving) and midtfield (a position we have been screaming to strenghten for several/many years). I find it strange that nothing, or very little has been done in those areas. But on the other hand, we have more than overfilled the attacking positions. Yes DiMaria is a great player and really awesome in many ways, but this was not really what we needed right now...

398~~~
It's something to do with these Mata/Ozil/Kagawa type fancy players who can go through a game doing nothing useful at all, but because they can pass the ball in slightly more silky looking ways than other players, for some reason this elevates them from criticism. In Mata and Ozil's case, doing absolutely feck all of use when the other team has the ball also seems to be deemed unimportant. There's only two players on the planet who are good enough to act like pedestrians when the other team is in possession, and it's not Mata and Ozil.

Kagawa is also a particularly baffling one because when he plays badly his first touch is horrific and his passing not much better...but he got played out of position to start with and that became the go to excuse. With Mata it actually has become everyone else in the team's fault, but in reality he just doesn't do enough, or even try to do enough, which to me isn't acceptable. 

He's certainly not the only one I'd label that at, but this thread is called "Juan Mata 2014-2015 performances", so despite the crybaby protestations, it does seem like a logical place to dicuss the performances of Juan Mata...I don't want a team of cowards and at the moment we're carrying far too many of them. They got an easy ride last season hiding behind Moyes while he took 90% of the shite...now there is no excuse left to carry on hiding.

399~~~
What does "keeps the play ticking" mean? He's not there to keep the play ticking. He's there to create chances which he doesn't look like doing any time soon. And no people aren't forgetting anything. A 20 minute spell against a Newcastle side that was beyond pathetic should not be used as a mesaure for anything.

400~~~
Talking and thinking like Mourinho, what a surprise! 

So with Willian you win titles? Come back when you have won as many titles with Willian as with Mata!

Also great to read you conceded "3 goals in 11 games" with Willian. And how many did you score? 

You know if your manager's mind set was a bit more positive than that, you would have managed to score more than just one lucky goal over 180 minutes against Atletico Madrid where you didn't have the "anti-title-machine" Mata, but instead your other awesome players available. But if you are not called Mourinho or his Chelsea, then football is not only about not conceding, but that is his style and he only allows one and an half player at the very most who doesn't defend almost all the time. That's also why his multi-million teams are so brilliant to watch.

Ofc Mata is in most games not the right player if Mourinho wants all his team to defend and play as an underdog, he is a creative player who will contribute to attacking. There are a lot of great players who wouldn't fit Mourinho's system, take Iniesta for example. Doesn't mean he isn't a great player either. 

Hopefully you keep your consistency and once you don't win a game you come here blaming Oscar/Willian the same way you come here everytime United don't win with Mata.

401~~~
If we bring Di Maria in and switch the formation I think Mata will show just how good he is. He needs people making runs and we haven't had that since he joined. People want him to take the onus and he definitely could do more to raise the tempo etc but there's only so much he can do where the supporting players are so passive. Everyone is passing the buck and no one is showing desire to really make a run and make something happen. It's not like Mata isn't spotting passes, there's nothing there to spot.

Problem with Mata and same with Kagawa is that they're not the sorts of players who are really gonna shine when the team aren't playing well. They add to an already well functioning team. It's definitely a limitation to their game but personally I'd be more concerned about why for such a long period we've been content to have players who don't take on their man, put in rubbish crosses or stop short and play it short. Taking Mata out for someone else isn't going to change much imo. You might get a bit more individual brilliance from someone like Di Maria who can carry the ball himself in a way Mata/Kagawa can't but to really succeed he'll need others to play as they should be at this level.

402~~~
I like Mata and am willing to give him time to find his form. He at least looks like a footballer, which is not true of half the team.

403~~~
I can't be arsed ging through all of that, but I wouldn't disagree that Cleverley, Fletcher, Valencia and Young were all terrible. The thing is though, it's largely because they're just not very good, so I find it bizarre people willing to slag off and abuse them yet maniacly defend a far more talented player who barely manages to do any better (save the 3 yard tap in I don't think he's done any better than any of them at all).

It'd be like me putting you and Usain Bolt in a race against Dwain Chambers, then when you both lose twice in a row, slagging you off brutally but making loads of excuses for Bolt.

Rooney I would put in the exact same category as Mata so far this season, while Van Persie I give a little bit more slack for now seeing as he had no pre-season and it was his first game back.

I would agree with EssexRob that Blackett has been our best outfield player this season, purely by virtue of the fact he hasn't done anything horrific and isn't shit scared to have the ball at his feet.

404~~~
Erm...

405~~~
CL
EL
FA Cup

I know Mata hasn't won a PL yet, but PL isn't everything!

406~~~
If I had to put money on which one was more likely to win a trophy next, I don't think it would be a difficult choice.

407~~~
It seems to me that there are more people saying that everyone is giving him some kind of mystical get out of jail free card, than actually people giving him it. He is getting a hard time and rightly so, he's a £37m player who hasn't addressed any if our issues. Is this his fault? Partly as he has the talent and should have the balls to elevate us and create chances out if nothing. Just like it's also Rooney and RVP's fault as they likewise have this talent.

However he was never going to transform us into a great team, simply because being in a midfield 5 with Cleverley, Valencia, Young and Fletcher doesn't allow it.

He is rightly being negatively judged at the moment, which is fair. But being written off is absurd. Write him off after being the least effective in a team including Rooney, RVP, Di Maria, Herrera etc. Not being the most effective in a mid table looking team.

408~~~
Good for him! Want to give us Fabregas and Matic who we can play together with Mata and see how well Mata does? Or instead want to take Cleverley and Fletcher and play them next to Willian and then see how well Willian does? 

But of course Mata is the main culprit. 
I know how he was for Chelsea and I don't give a shite what Mourinho or his fanbois have to say.

Even more I know how he was at Valencia (where for me he was even better, especially relative to his age back then).

Wait until we have a world class winger and CM, I am sure we won't see you as often then un Mata's thread.

409~~~
I agree with the bolded bit. This season he has been called out on his poor performances.

410~~~
I get people want Mata/Rooney etc to do more, the former could do more to raise the tempo and the latter needs to get his touch/reaction speed up but both are limited by what's around them. Unless you want Mata to pick the ball up and run past people (which isn't his game) then I'm not sure how much he can do. It's like we could have Scholes back and he could keep playing great balls to Valencia/Young etc in good areas but if they either don't get a cross in or stop and turn back inside then what else could he really do? He can't force players to make runs or to try to link up or be positive when they get the ball.

I personally defend Mata because I'm confident that with players who make runs and look to link up and move forward that he would look much better. I think a top player player who isn't a dribbler or a power house would struggle to shine in our attack and even they would be limited to indiivudal bursts of brilliance. 

Where as with the other players they're the one's not doing their job for individual reasons. Young/Valencia see the ball more than anyone and pass the buck more than anyone other than Clev maybe. Fletcher just can't seem to deal with the pace of games. Between the 4 of them they're not doing their jobs properly and the blame for that is much more with them than the other players around them.

Rooney/Mata/RVP have limitations being shown up by the poorness of the other players around them but I think they could all play better if the other players around them even if they weren't off the right quality were making runs and showing the right desire.

411~~~
Does anyone else think that Mata could be the one to make way in the team once Di Maria is in and everyone is fit?  GNev and the other pundits also hinted at this yesterday.

412~~~
I'd literally kill myself with first available tool if Mata found himself on the bench with Cleverley OR Fletcher in the first team.

413~~~
Completely different positions mate.

414~~~
Mata is not GNev's type of player. Mata will be dropped at times, but then we'll moan soon enough that nothing is going through the middle. I think over the entire season Mata will play more than at least one of RvP/Rooney.

415~~~
True. Nev does seem to prefer Valencia.

416~~~
Yep but I'd literally shuffle the whole team around so that neither of them has to play. Play Mata on the wing, play him off the striker with Di Maria in midfield and Rooney out wide, anything, you might not get the best out of Mata but we'd probably benefit more from playing injured half-arsed Mata on the wing than Cleverley in his favourite position playing his best game ever.

417~~~
Would seem bizarre if that was the case. Di Maria is exactly the sort of player Mata needs and Mata can produce the passes that Di Maria is looking for to play himself in. When you think in Di Marai, Mata and Januzaj you've got 3 players who could bounce of each other so well not fitting in at least 2 of them would seem an odd use of our resources.

418~~~
When Di Maria comes him and Mata should be the two players we should build the team around. Both young, both excellent on the ball with great technique, both very productive. I'd be livid if Di Maria coming meant Mata being marginalized, we HAVE to get the best out of him for this side to function properly.

419~~~
Yeah. Personally can see a bit of a Gerrard/Lampard situation arising in that we'll try to play RVP and Rooney in that they're the best individual players/biggest names but potentially starting with one of them with di maria, mata and januzaj behind them could give a better team balance and an allow one of them to shine. Still I think it would be worth trying a diamond and trying to get them both in with probably januzaj missing out.

420~~~
He will be brilliant in a 4-5-1 playing behind the striker, LvG loves his number 10 to be a bit more of a forward rather than a playmaker and Mata is just that.

421~~~
Indeed. We'll probably try to fit in Rooney behind van Persie even though he's much worse than Mata there. I think what would fix this team more than any other transfer at the moment would be one of van Persie and Rooney making space for the other and accepting a bit part role/leaving. Rooney's not going to leave anytime soon though.

My belief that we could fit in all 4 with good effect is almost gone. We could play them all at the same time but there'll be no fluidity. Our team is not equipped to that, Mata can be effective out wide but not at United.

422~~~
I think RVP/Rooney are just do similar to lead the line together, it would be great if it could work but I just can't see it. I think though they're too good to not give it a go with better players, particularly as Di Maria has excelled in a midfield role and so should be able to play one side of a diamond very well but I do think that we'd get more out of the team as a whole with di maria, mata and januzaj off one of them then trying to play them both.

423~~~
You don't need two players of that mould, it's restricting you. One is enough, and put 3 mobile players behind them - Mata, Di Maria and Januzaj for instance - and we'd be absolutely golden. Imagine Herrera and a solid DM - say de Jong - behind them with most in form players in defence. This is a good team.

424~~~
Not worried about Mata at all, oozes quality. If we sort out that midfield we'll see how good he can be.

425~~~
We need two pacy players alongside him, having Rooney and RvP in front of him with the wingbacks being unproductive is going to do nothing

426~~~
When Mata was at his best at Chelsea ? Did he have that many pacy players around him ? I think more than pace, it's an issue of mobility and intelligent runs.

427~~~
He always had proper wingers on either side of him. Hazard, Kalou, Malouda e.t.c. The least fastest player he had was probably Oscar but even then there was Hazard there. We have nothing there so far

428~~~
Seriously? We HAVE to get the best out of him for us to function properly as a team?

Based on what?

The fee we paid for him? How he used to play for a rival team, that subsequently found they didn't want/need him in their squad? Or his performances for Manchester United?

Only the first two reasons would be a terrible justification for placing him on such a pedestal and if it's the third reason then I don't think I've been watching the same games as you.

429~~~
Someone mentioned he was excellent on the right for Chelsea, anyone wanna comment on him on the right of a 433 or 4231?

430~~~
He was mostly good towards the end of last season in a terrible team, scoring goals and being our creative force. His performances for Chelsea cannot go unnoticed either, he was basically one of the best playmakers in the league for two years running and is still only 26 so can most definitely get back to that level in a good set up. Most of all he's the sort of player we should be aiming to have - creative, good on the ball with great technique. To move away from our ancient tactics we need to go exactly in that direction.

Well then again he's not British, not called Rooney or anything and people generally like him so it's enough of a reason to write him off.

431~~~
He <i>was</i> great for Chelsea but a very good manager (who a lot of people wanted at United - including you?) can't find a place for him in their squad. That's obviously a concern. At his best, Mata is clearly a good player to have in any team. We haven't seen him at his best for United. Not even close. Lots of reasons for this in a season where nobody looked any good, so he should have a blank slate for this season - like everyone else. All the excuses about Moyes ruining him by playing him out of position are gone now, though. And all that any of us can do is judge him game by game, in his preferred position. Very early days, still, but I find it utterly bizarre that people have been watching the same games as me and come out with stuff like "We HAVE to get the best out of him for us to function properly as a team". That's the sort of fantasy fanboi stuff MentalWinger posts about Kagawa. Very hard to take it seriously, after actually watching the player being discussed in his performances so far for United.

Did that make sense to you when you typed it?

432~~~
Yes, I wanted Mourinho and I understand how Mata might have not fit his philosophy. Mourinho liked hard-working players and Mata isn't one, there are plenty of players who Mourinho might not fancy who'd be good enough to make an impact pretty much everywhere else.

We've played TWO games this season. No player of ours has been good. Mata was good last season. One thing I know is he needs the team to play reasonably well to be at his best.

Yep, Rooney plays like Mata has 10 games in a row and people still back him to bounce back. Mata has two bad games and all of a sudden he should be dropped. There's this tendency to play down players who people feel generally excited about.

433~~~
Absolute bullshit. Have you seen the fecking Rooney thread? 9 out of 10 posts are calling him a useless waste of space. He's been getting dog's abuse ever since the Sunderland game. Could not be more different to this thread where there's, at most, one or two people daring to point out that Mata was kind of crap and perhaps that might not be the fault of everyone else around him. Bearing in mind the positions they played and the pattern of play during the game (not a single clear chance created for any of our strikers over 90 minutes) it does seem a just a little weird that one of our strikers is getting so much grief but our (alleged) main creative hub is getting far less criticism.

Not sure anyone is even calling for Mata be dropped anyway. I know I'm not. Just saying he had a poor game (second in a row) which is worthy of criticism and he needs to play better next time. For some reason this provokes the kind of over-sensitive defence that we've seen from people like you. Where he's being hyped far in excess of what he's actually produced, at any time in his United career to date.

434~~~
I didn't think he had that bad a game yesterday at all. The reality is he's not the type of player to win a physical battle, something that is so lacking with all our midfielders.

435~~~
I don't think Mata or Rooney should be criticised too much when the players behind them were utterly incompetent.

436~~~
I think its overstating it to say they are totally incompetent. We really need a physical presence in midfield. It really is a tragedy if we don't address that area of the pitch again.

437~~~
It says a lot about Mata when he is criticised despite winning us our first point of the season, whereas our 2 strikers couldn't even keep the ball the few times they received it and never looked like scoring.

438~~~
Thats inevitable because of the price tag. The pressure on Di Maria is going to be immense too. Given the way we have to keep overpaying for players.

439~~~
It was a one yard tap in (although credit him for making the run). As mentioned above he cost a lot and so expectations are high, plus, based on his United career to date, he has little credit in the bank, unlike RVP and Rooney (who got slagged off in any event). For all the mitigating circumstances arising from the inadequacies of his teammates, you would look for a bit more impact against limited opposition like Sunderland. He needs to raise his game (admittedly along with many others).

440~~~
That goal had far more to do with the quality of the cross than it did the finish (I'm still not entirely convinced it wasn't an OG) I don't think you'll find many posts in the Valencia thread pointing out that he won us our first point of the season. Instead, they will focus on his overall performance. Which is as it should be.

Re our strikers. Yes, they never looked like scoring. Are we expecting them to finish off goals they create for themselves? Or perhaps the other players in the team are supposed to create chances for the strikers to finish. Our number 10, for example.

441~~~
Well the strikers didn't get much service but I clearly remember incidents with both RvP and Rooney where they received the ball, even had space, but did absolutely nothing apart from losing the ball. 

Everyone has reasons ppl blame them, with Mata it's the price tag, so whatever he does ppl will expect more.
At the same time with Rooney it's his wages and him being captain now that ppl expect more.

442~~~
The same applies to every one of our attacking players. It was a bit of a theme for the game as a whole!

I just think that it's incredibly unfair to pick on our strikers for that particular performance. The formation we chose was supposed to allow the two of them play as out and out strikers, yet the service they got was diabolical. Like I said, not a single clear chance created for either of them over 90 minutes. That's atrocious. Obviously, they both had chances to try and create something out of nothing but it was invariably against a packed defence because our inept midfield took so long to get the ball to them that Sunderland always had loads of time to get back and defend.

For me, the main sinners were Cleverley and Fletcher but Mata was given a free role to link midfield and attack so has to share the stick they've both been getting for our painfully laboured approach work. In that scenario I don't really get why so many people are laying into Rooney and so few criticising Mata. The difference in the levels of vitriol between these two threads is amazing and doesn't reflect what actually happened on the pitch.

443~~~
This has got to be a joke surely?

The Rooney thread has mostly been full of people calling him a fat useless wanker (or words to that effect) for well over a year. People who brought up his goals and assists record were ignored in favour of pointing out a ball he might have miscontrolled.

444~~~
Not talking about the general notion as Rooney has been disliked for a while by a number of posts, just the certain type of posters on here who will defend Rooneys and Valencias (and some other players) but will play down players like Mata, Kagawa etc., for some reason.

445~~~
I think when Giggs dropped Mata for his first game in charge as manager I think he was making a statement that he doesn't rate him......Mata has played some great games when we are spanked inferior teams.....but from what I have seen of him since last January i'd be stunned if he's not dropped soon......I hope he can prove me wrong obviously though

446~~~
I can't help to think that a few posters' opinions on Mata are being swayed due to Gary Neville not rating him.

447~~~
Well if our 2 strikers were advised to just play as out and out strikers then it is even more unfair on Mata as he was left alone with a useless midfield behind him. But as far as I could see Rooney and Mata were dropping deep and God knows what RvP was doing, he was annoying me the most yesterday.

Mata has only been here for half a season whereas some ppl are just fed up with Rooney being hot and cold for years. He has been living on past glories for more than 2 years now. In 2012/13 we relied on RvP and last season apart from first few games where he was playing for a new contract he was average and even more useless than Fellaini in some (Bayern, Everton for example). He has lost a lot of his positive attributes which made him the player he once was. Now if he scores a tap-in and is not completely useless, his fanbois like yourself are happy. So pls let's not pretend as ppl are blaming poor Rooney for nothing. Difference between Mata and Rooney is that since Mata has been here he has been the better player (which doesn't say much as Rooney has been useless), but while Mata still has the excuse for settling in, Rooney has been below-par for at least 2 years now.

448~~~
Definitely, and that everyone's darling Mourinho got rid off him.

449~~~
My opinion has been swayed by the fact that he simply hasnt performed as well for us as his reputation and price tag would suggest. We have changed to a formation which he is meant to be one of the key beneficiaries of, but he is anonymous for a lot of the game.

I think he needs to be a bit more disciplined in his play - stick in the hole, stop dropping so deep or pushing so far ahead of the strikers.

That said, the strikers also need to do a better job of creating space for him - drag the opposition defenders around, and show some better movement for Mata to pick them out.

450~~~
I don't watch the Sky Sports punditry so not guilty on that score. Admittedly the fact that one of the shrewdest managers in the business deemed him surplus to requirements does set a few alarm bells ringing. But the main fact is that he has not played very well for United in games that matter irrespective of his displays for his former club. Admittedly he has joined United in difficult circumstances and he may come good as the team improves, but he needs to be assessed on an objective basis like the rest, without qualifications for him being a nice guy or Chelsea's player of the season under Rafa.

451~~~
I think its more that fact he hasnt been anywhere near his best since his move, although even with this I am impressed with his goal and assist return.

But he has come into a bad situation. He has joined the worst positioned Man Utd for 25 odd years.

452~~~
I've been critical of him of late but yesterday he was one of the positives. He got involved a lot more which is what we've needed from him. His generally was tidy without being exceptional and he got a goal.

453~~~
Since he joined only Rooney has scored more PL goals (9) for United than Mata (7).

Since Mata joined no one has more PL assists than Mata (4). 

The most depressing part is how those figures aren't close to what he was producing at Chelsea and how disjointed our attacking players are. He should definitely be performing better, he should definitely offer more threat as a £37m player BUT there are several other who fall into a similar category but because they weren't a David Moyes signing/previously part of a winning team with us, they get out of jail free a bit.

I think he'll end up having a decent season and all of the early moaners are going to look back with palms on faces.

454~~~
With a couple of them probably penalties which Mata won.

455~~~
He looks more like a support striker than the type of player who can pull strings between the lines. Great in the box, not so great outside it. 

I actually think we'd have looked better on Sunday with Mata much closer to Rooney and Kagawa or Januzaj as our attacking midfielder, with RvP on the bench.

456~~~
He's probably been our most productive player the past six months, how are people labeling him a poor signing?

457~~~
Rooney stopped taking our pens long before we signed Mata.

458~~~
Not a bad suggestion to be honest.

459~~~
Maybe. But Mata won a pen against Aston Villa which Rooney converted. RvP was probably injured then.

460~~~
I've been a critic myself and haven't been bowled over by Mata.

I think is certainly an excellent footballer but not one we needed given our options at number 10.

Being objective though - which United players have impressed in 2014 since Mata arrived? De Gea is genuinely the only player who I feel has played well. I think Jones and Blackett have started this season well.

I don't think we will really see the ability of Mata until, collectively as a team, we get over this slump we've been in for a year now - when we turn the corner (hopefully quicker than Houllier) we'll start to see the best of Mata as he links up with Rooney, Di Maria etc....

461~~~
He needs players to make runs and he needs the ball a lot earlier. At the minute, he is getting the ball with no one ahead of him and surrounded by opposition players, as he is being passed the ball after it has touched every defensive member of our team.

462~~~
Like Müller then?
I would say there are some similarities, but they are not identical. And ofc he is not a playmaker like Silva, he is probably something between Müller and Silva if it makes sense.

463~~~
He'd have looked much better if he had Wingbacks providing more threat wide so Sunderland were stretched and he could drift outside the area looking to make some angles. 

As it was, they sat comfortably in shape with the wing backs holding the line and the centre mids cutting the space in front of the centrebacks. Now the old joke is "getting to the byline" and it's all well and good taking the piss out of that phrase if your only plan is to whack a cross in every time you "get to the byline" but it doesn't matter what formation you play, you need players who can attack wide areas and force the opposition defensive line back into their own area which means not only space around their area but also pockets of space in the area. It's a tactic Barcelona used to use to great effect, they'd have someone attack wide, a midfielder would come and collect and shift it back centrally or to the other wing until they were stretched and an angle or opening was forged. 

When your fullbacks can't beat a man and create space beyond the 18 yard line in wide areas, you're screwed for space, the ball just gets shifted to across to nowhere and the opposition push out and push you back.

The hope is that having someone like Di Maria attacking from anywhere will force the opposition deeper and we can exploit the space created by that.

464~~~
The problem is that we never needed him in the first place, Mata is best behind a single striker. We have one genuine striker [RVP], and another [Rooney] who likes to drop deep, thereby congesting the area where the #10 should be doing his thing. Secondly, he needs a defensively sound midfield behind him, who will constantly feed him the ball which will allow him concentrate on the final third, that's where he's at his best. At United, he doesn't have this, meaning, he has to drop deeper and deeper to get the ball and by doing this his influence in the final third is diminished because he's not particularly fast. He also needs runners and if we have those, he'll pick them out with ease, but we are slow and have zero off the ball running/movement. Mata is and was never a player to force a game or carry a team, but when there are certain things in place as i mentioned, he's a joy to watch. So, we'll have to make a BIG decision about him, either sell or drop Wayne Rooney because RVP is quite comfortably a better striker and player all together.

465~~~
Yep. Needs players like januzaj and di Maria on the wings to stretch teams and give him space, rather then everyone crowd him out. Wouldn't be surprised is suddenly our front players all took their game to another level with di Maria here. Just hope we use Januzaj on the other wing.

466~~~
Hasn't looked it for at least 12 months, probably longer. Without doubt the least effective of the three of them against Sunderland.

467~~~
By his standards was poor last season but somehow managed to outscore Rooney [if am not mistaken] who we're told had an excellent season, was relatvely good in the WC where Rooney was poor as usual, in terms of technique and general play, RVP is quite comfortably better than Rooney.

468~~~
Talks of Mata being dropped to accommodate Di Maria. This can't happen... he's one of our best players and is a great presence on the pitch.

469~~~
You are mistaken, he had less goals.
He's really not better then Rooney any more. Rooney up top will give you a similar amount of goals but these days van Persie hardly gets involved in the game.

470~~~
I thought RVP was largely anonymous in the latter stages of the WC, despite having probably the tournament's best player on his flank. Rooney didn't set on the world on fire either but came up with a nice assist against Italy and scored against Uruguay. I think the uncomfortable truth is that both may have seen their best days and that, before too long, the club will have to splash out again. Hopefully before then we will get one or two more productive seasons from them as we aim to reconsolidate in the top 4.

471~~~
Rooney gets involved but it's sometimes to the detriment of the team, his poor touch doesn't help too. RVP is better for me.

472~~~
He really wasn't though. Van Persie at least dropped deep and got himself involved for the goal. Drove at their defence and could've got himself a penalty. Rooney did nothing. Both weren't good enough mind you. One's only coming back into the team though.

473~~~
He needs a solid sitting midfield behind him. We have someone like Vidal or even De Jong giving him that protection, he'll be lethal IMO.

474~~~
The issue for me is I see Rooney and Mata actively shirking the responsibility of making something happen. Rooney just wants to get the ball out wide rather than drive towards goal and Mata's first intention is always to go backwards and get rid. 

So there's no movement ahead of him? There's not going to be when 90% of the time his first touch is to deliberately turn away from goal or into a safe area...so by the time he gets round to looking for a forward pass (if he even does, which by the way he was guilty of not even doing numerous times yesterday) there isn't going to be one.

Even so, he could try committing a player for a give and go, running towards the box and trying to play off one of the strikers. He only did either of these things once from memory, in an entire 90 minutes of football, and even then he only went for the give and go because Welbeck's layoff forced him to, and it ended with him lying uselessly on the floor.

He's a £42m player and the most technically gifted player in the team. He's not there to pansy around waiting until other people start playing well so he can turn up and share in the glory. Again its a self defeating argument. If he's completely reliant on other players and the system doing most of his job for him, then we shouldn't have been paying £42m for him in the first place.

£42m should be buying you some solid foundations to build on, not a piece of fancy decorative wallpaper.

475~~~
Since he's arrived, Mata has not lit the world on fire but he's been comfortably better than Rooney or RVP. He hasn't reached their heights as a match-winner, no, but imo he also hasn't reached their depths and been a complete passenger like RVP or lead-footed lump like Rooney.  

All 3 could and should be playing better. IMO, that will come soon enough, once they are all match fit and used to their respective roles in this system. The de-Moyes-ification is still in process.

476~~~
Thing is, i wonder if we are far too congested in the middle with those three. RvP mentioned it last season and i wonder if that will always be a problem. Similar players making similar runs. If Mata was played a little further back it might work wonders

477~~~
I like how Rooney fans are turning this into "Mata was equally bad as Rooney" even though Rooney was crap in both games, and not just that, but he messed up everything pretty much every time he touched the ball looking like championship player in the procces.
Mata was easily our best attacking player against Sunderland(Rooney was nothing better than the likes of Valencia, Fletcher), so even comparing these two is just showing how unfair some people are on Mata. Against Swansea both were wank tbf, but at least Mata didn't have problems like controling the ball and passing it to teammate who is standing 5 feets next to him. But it's always nice to see how Rooney's  fans are blaming everyone except him, last year it was RvP, and this season it could be Mata.
Now, I am not saying he was out of this world since he came here(at least he was easily one of the best performers in the team, that wasn't hard though), but when Rooney scores 7 in 8 games that's usually described as him being back to his best.

478~~~
Mata didn't even play in the game after which RvP made that statement. But yes, they all have to interchange more like Ronaldo/Rooney/Tevez did. If Di Maria can play a bit of that Ronaldo role it will be a huge help.

479~~~
What a shite post.

480~~~
Well at the time we had Kagawa playing which i guess is similar to Mata. Ronaldo/Tevez/Rooney were all different types of players though

481~~~
I don't think his price should have anything to do with it. He didn't set the price you can blame Woodward/Moyes for signing a player who takes a good team up a level when we didn't have that base to start with fine, but don't think it should be used against him. He is what he is, he's not going to suit every team but tbh I can't think of many players who would shine in that team if you did a direct swap. There's so many aspects of it that just don't work and together combine to make an even greater problem.

His job for me is to find the passes to make things happen but to do that he needs players willing to run past him and to link up just like if you're a poacher you're job is to score goals but you need other people to create the chances. If players do make themselves available then he's one of the best in our league at finding them. That's what makes him an expensive player. I agree his game is limited in the same way you could say RVNs game was limited but he did what he did well.

Again I agree he could do more but he's limited by whats around him. Who's he gonna play a give and go with when no one gets ahead of him from midfield? Rooney/RVP were just a poor and they were doing the exact same thing of having the ball played to them and promtly playing it backwards because for one reason for another be it lack of sharpness in RVPs case and who know's what in Rooney's case neither could turn away from their man.

In terms of driving forward yeah he could do that more but in the context of the game there was a lot that made that very hard. Sunderland just weren't stretched at all by us, they didn't have to press us high cause they knew our defence weren't going to cause problems with their passing on the ball and so they could flood the middle and their final third this makes it a lot harder to drive through the middle, you need a good initial pass to set you off which wasn't coming.

I think actually the one give and go you mentioned came from Fletcher actually playing a good pass to RVP to set the move off. The rest of the time Mata had to keep coming so deep for the ball that there wasn't really anywhere to go. Personally as well I think due to the lack of pace/choice of players the formation only serves to put more reliance on the wingbacks putting in a good ball which we know is a massive risk.

I think there is an argument to be had that Mata isn't a leader and that when the chips are down he's probably not the man to turn to but that doesn't mean he can't bring a lot to the team. But the set up has to be right for him but I can't think of many star players who that isn't true for. Should we bring Di Maria in and play a more ambitious line up, particularly if it's based on the best team then I think Mata will be an important part of that.

482~~~
There are players in the team performing much worse than Mata. Atleast he contributes with goals fairly consistently.

483~~~
I love you too.

484~~~
I'd have to completely agree with everything that is said in this article. The reason why Rooney and RVP were so poor against Sunderland was because the main guy that was supposed to be feeding them with a quick pass was not involved in the game enough because he has no athleticism....It's the same reason why our attack went to crap when we had Berbatov. Berbatov scored plenty of goals for us which led many fans to believe he was getting an unfair abuse from other fans that slated him...but with Berbatov scoring goals it tricked many into thinking he was not the root of our attacking troubles and the same thing is happening with Mata who was another astronomically priced Moyes panic buy. I just can't see Mata being anything other than a squad player here..hope he proves me wrong

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/stewart-robson-di-marias-arrival-means-matas-place-is-under-threat-at-manchester-united/164655" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/stewart...e-is-under-threat-at-manchester-united/164655</a>

Stewart Robson has stated that he thinks Juan Mata’s place in Manchester United’s starting eleven is now under threat, with the imminent arrival of Angel Di Maria threatening to displace him from the squad, as reported by <a class="externalLink" href="http://talksport.com/football/exclusive-di-marias-arrival-man-united-could-be-bad-news-mata-reckons-robson-140825109911" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><i>Talksport</i></a>.

Former Arsenal star Robson stated that it is a lack of athleticism that is a key issue for Mata, meaning he will generally struggle to make his mark at the Manchester side with Di Maria now on his way.

Robson said: “I’m not sure where Di Maria is going to fit in. I can’t see him fitting into the side at the moment without taking Juan Mata’s place.

“It isn’t working for him [Mata]. I can understand the problems Jose Mourinho had with him.

“Juan Mata can only play in a side that is completely dominating the play. He is very creative in the top third of the field but he doesn’t like it when there are big, open spaces because he is not a particularly good athlete, whether he is counter-attacking, having to run with the ball or he is having to defend in big, wide open spaces.

“When he is playing in a team that aren’t quite the best and are going to be counter-attacked, his lack of athleticism has been found out. It has been found out at Chelsea under Mourinho and also at Manchester United.”

485~~~
Didn't Kagawa come on very late in that game anyway? RvP was definitely not meaning Kagawa or Mata. Most probably Rooney, maybe even Welbeck.

486~~~
If United are going to play with 2 Forwards and a Playmaker, then between the 3 of them they need to create more chances than they are doing at present. Simply blaming the crappy CM's is an easy excuse, especially when we all know the CM is a weak area at kick-off! 

Someone should remind Mata that on the rare occasions he gets the ball from the CM it would be wise not to simply give it straight back to them.

487~~~
I do feel sorry for Mata a bit if he does end up on the bench again, but that article is fairly spot on.

488~~~
First i'd like to make it clear that I am not the biggest fan of Mata and that I never thought he was right for us to begin with and I still don't. However, I don't like the way he's being targeted here. I agree about what they say about his weaknesses, but never do they even mention the weaknesses of Rooney or RVP despite the fact that some of the weaknesses attributed to Mata by the article could just as well be attributed to either of Rooney and RVP who have never clicked with each other anyway so why persist?

At this time Mata has played just as well if not better than them, although that's not saying much at this point. Out of that front three who started yesterday Mata should be the least threatened by Di marias arrival based on their performances so far.

His job isn't made any easier by the fact that he had absolutely no movement in front of him once he gathered the ball, the strikers were pretty much glued to their defenders and weren't making any runs for him to find them. Meanwhile Cleverley and Fletcher were hiding, our wingers weren't making any runs and couldn't do anything worthwhile with the ball even if they were.

Rant.

489~~~
Can't believe the shit Mata is getting, the guy is awesome.  Plays for Spain regularly, you know the nation that probably has the biggest pool of talent out of any other nation.

I don't think this would happen if he wasn't any good.

490~~~
He doesn't really start for Spain but well, Iniesta is no bad competitiom (even though he's a shit athlete too, no pace, no strength).

491~~~
Under pressure now. If Mata is not at his best, he will be benched like every other player as well

492~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bv6ll0pIYAAVL3a.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bv6ll0pIYAAVL3a.png"/>
7 goals, 2 assists and 21 chances created in 10 appearances playing as a number 10 in a team that's playing way below average. How is that bad?

493~~~
Im going to say Di Maria will help Mata in a big way. You dont need ever player to be lightning quick to be good at counter attacking. Teddy Sherringham proved that when he was here.

Mata has the first touch,passing range,quick feet and ability to make dangerous late runs into the box to be a big player under Van Gaal.

494~~~
Can see Di Maria and Mata playing some excellent football together. It'll be wonderful I tells you.

495~~~
No doubt. Di Maria will make space and create openings with his pace and movement, and Mata will thrive in the pockets of space and pick out Di Maria's runs countless times. Herrera's mobility will help as well.

This is going football heaven. Burnley, be afraid! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

496~~~
No, he isn't. Silva, iniesta, Xavi, cesc have been ahead of him. TBF I always rate him but I kind of agreeing with Mourinho when he benched Mata. He always has trouble when the position team press alot and need players around him to open some space. He's very dangerous when  comfortably playing in a team with good possession but we cant offer that in here and I don't think LvG and his total football philosophy fit mata's style either.

497~~~
I agree mostly but I wouldn't call it 'painfully obvious'. He's technically brilliant and he's creative. I think there was a decent argument behind giving him a chance in a playmaker role, but there's little sign that its going to work out yet.

498~~~
I don't understand the criticism of him. At all. He is a player who relies on the forwards and midfielders actually doing things. When they do we've seen he is our best player. Even still he provides more of a spark than anyone else.

499~~~
When Mourinho is willing to sell a player to his biggest rivals then there is a reason for it....put it this way - would he sell us Diego Costa if we were willing to pay enough? Very Doubtful

500~~~
So you are saying we spent 37 million on a player that relies on other players to make him look good? I don't doubt Mata's quality. But if this is the case that he is basically a 'cream on top' kind of player then I think we overpaid and he probably wasn't necessary when we definitely had deficiencies that needed fixing.

501~~~
No, we relied on a player who is extraordinarily talented and a playmaker requires movement, cleverness, and ability around him to provide assists and make plays. What good is a playmaker with nobody to make plays to...

Is Ozil useless, is Silva?

502~~~
Personally I think having Di Maria will open up Mata and Rooney both who like to play the ball out wide.  The only problem lately is that Young is useless and Valencia was out of position a lot dropping back so deep in defense.  

I personally think a 4-3-3 will be ideal but the problem would be fitting Mata and Herrera both in the midfield.  I think Herrera needs to bulk up a little to handle the abuse of the EPL but that being said I trust LVG will now have quality on the wing at his disposal which is something I think all United fans are glad to see again.

503~~~
If we are playing 4-3-3 whats the problem fitting in Mata and Herrera in the same team? We need worry about how we are going to fit in Rooney and RVP. Are we going to sacrifice Januzaj for the time being? Is he going to be an impact sub?

504~~~
Im mainly meaning in terms of defensive ability, dont get me wrong I want to see it.  They both possess great passing qualities I just fear our midfield being over run in against the bigger teams we will play with our defense still trying to get it sorted out.  I guess Fletcher/Carrick/Fellani could supply enough cover I just fear there lack of pace will bite us.

505~~~
To be honest, it doesn't look like we are going to go 4-3-3 unless we bring a proper midfielder. We will just be too open. Plus we have quite a few defenders to play if they are fit. Herrera and Carrick could MAYBE handle things but not if Carrick is out. We have to play a diamond with 5 defenders like Gary suggested to fit everyone in.

506~~~
I like players like Mata in that role. They are comfortable in possession if they find themselves in a deeper position but have that licence to get forward. People will be against it because it's not a proper 'number 10' role but I think it's a good way and keeping him central.

507~~~
Nasri cost about 25 and is an important part of a very good side. Mata being better in the final third would be worth 10 million for them. The difference is the same reason that Kagawa looked 5X the player at Dortmund. We play turgid, horrific football almost exclusively and those teams manage to move the ball quickly and forward, albeit with very different styles, formations and tempos.

508~~~
All players like Mata are like that though. Kagawa, Ozil, Silva; they all need runners in behind and on the wing to stretch the opposition to give them space to work in. If they get that, they can be deadly, but if they have players like rooney and Van Persie, or Valencia and Young, then everyone just comes inside and crowds the space, making them useless.

509~~~
Herrera is probably better defensively then Fellaini is. Just because he's a fancy spanish midfielder doesn't mean he's poor defensively. He likes to tackle and get stuck in, is a hard worker and definitely isn't a luxury player, or somebody that you need to make up for defensively. He's just a classic box to box player. He actually knows how to stay in position and cover space, while with Fellaini you'll always see him chasing backwards a few steps behind the play always.

510~~~
Funny how he was one of the best players in the league when Chelsea were playing some atrocious football then aye. They were hardly dominating teams back then and yet he was the only consistent performer in their team.

511~~~
Yeah, that's a load of rubbish.
If anything, he's like Kagawa in that he thrives when the game is a bit more stretched, open and he's being given less attention.
When his team are completely penning the other team back with slow possession, like Kagawa he tries to be too precise, measured and neat, which detracts from his game. Di Matteo probably gave him and the two other 'amigos' too much freedom, but the three of them looked most threatening when the game was stretched and open as they often were. This style got the best out of Mata, but obviously wasn't sustainable long term, and the level of Mata's defensive contribution at the time could be called into question.

I'd classify him as a second striker, to be honest.
He's not like Silva who can dribble in tight areas with incredible accuracy at a walking pace, deliver an inch perfect pass into feet every single time, and generally run a game even under tight marking. He's less precise, and a very instinctive player, unlike Silva who's naturally measured. People seem to bracket Mata with Silva, but but he's more similar to Rooney, in my opinion.
And from where that guy's got the idea Mata needs a completely dominant possession team to thrive, I don't know.

512~~~
Those stats, when playing centrally, are impressive. In a way, though, they also highlight why he might not be what we need in the positions he keeps getting picked. He's scoring almost 4 times as many goals as he is creating. This would be in contrast to players like, say, David Silva, Fabregas or Coutinho who are much more likely to create a goal than they are to score one. That's really the sort of qualities we need from him if Van Gaal is going to get this 352 to work. We don't need a number 10 whose best quality seems to be being a bit of a goal-poacher.

Mind you, as Nev pointed out last night, those stats are from a season where the whole team was fairly terrible. When he played for Chelsea he his stats looked much more like a proper playmaker. So I'm going to stick my optimists hat on, agree with Nev and and decide that the arrival of Di Maria will bring the best out of him. Bring it on.

513~~~
I think he is still settling and the other parts of the team, especially in the forward phase, aren't playing enough of their part to produce a unit but he needs to step it up, get on the ball more and look to utilize his vision and passing. We can't continue blaming others for his shortcomings.

514~~~
Bang on mate. Everybody in the world, including LVG, knew that Fletch - Clev are not being played for their creative prowess. Their job was to get the ball to the attacking players, and with 55% overall possession, it's clear nobody in our team took the impetus to do something with it. This is where I think Di Maria will shine. He doesn't have to rely on others to get things done, he can do it all himself.

515~~~
I sort of agree with you, at times with Mata it's like playing with an additional striker which makes him redundant in a 2 striker system I think he will be able to find more space and create more chances in a 4 3 3. 

Although I don't agree with him not creating enough chances. He created 3 times as many clear cut chances as goals.

Angel di Maria transfer to Manchester United spells trouble for Juan Mata | via @Telegraph fw.to/oqJ3vdE
10:54 a.m. Tue, Aug 26

517~~~
Link to the article in which Ogden states that he understands Mata's future in the side is vulnerable following the arrival of Di Maria. Describes him as a 'square peg in a round hole' in a United 4-3-3, and likens him to Berbatov. Slightly ominous...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11056101/Angel-di-Maria-transfer-to-Manchester-United-spells-trouble-for-Juan-Mata.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ster-United-spells-trouble-for-Juan-Mata.html</a>

518~~~
I'd say di Maria affects Rooney/RvP more. Mata is comfortably our best #10.

519~~~
Mata really shouldn't be the player to be dropped. This Rooney and RvP front two just simply isn't ever going to work, we either need to play with one striker or if we persist with two we need Di Maria/Welbeck to start with Rooney or RvP. Personally I'd much rather bench Rooney or RvP, Mata may not necessarily be better than them but we need the balance of having some pace up top.

520~~~

Moyes didn't want Mata, Utd wanted to make a statement signing to appease irritated sponsors. Mata has the same problem Kagawa does.
4:03 p.m. Tue, Aug 26 from Bakersfield, CA

521~~~
I think van Gaal considers Mata as our best number 10 and the feeling I get from his interviews is that we will drop RVP or Rooney if we switch to a 4-3-3 variant.

522~~~
I have always said this, signing mata defeats the point in the need of playing 2 strikers, he is your classic number 10 that thrives in a 4231 system, 2 wingers who can stretch the play, and a striker he can feed the ball to. He is a pretty impressive goalscorer, and if you have speed on the wings either side of him, his passing ability can advanced the wingers, and the wingers gives him the space to work his magic. So if VG tries a 4231 with di maria and janazaj either side of him, with rooney or RVP up top, the juan mata signing is like a new signing

The thought of mata on the top of a 4231, playing off the striker gives me the excitement this guy will be fantastic for us

herrera carrick
di maria mata janazaj
rooney/RVP

We will truly see the best of mata, who could easily bag us 20 goals, and his free kick ability is a huge weapon we could have. The di maria signing will see the very best of mata

523~~~
Anyone think he'll be moved on/used as a makeweight for a potential new signing before the end of the window?

524~~~
No.

525~~~
I agree, mate, but there's been too much anti-Mata talk from respected United men in recent months for there not to be more to it.

We all know the lack of pace in our attacking triumvirate of van Persie, Rooney and Mata is a hindrance and if push comes to shove, there's one man who's more expendable than the other two under the current regime.

526~~~
Amazing player but I can see why José got rid. His touch and finishing is excellent as well as his passing but he is too slow to be  striker and too lightweight for midfield.

Hopefully he can adapt to this new system or else we will have another Kagawa on our hands.

527~~~
he played every game so far, cant see him leaving. Why should he, Kagawa is as good as gone.

528~~~
Agree. He won't leave because he's clearly ahead of Kagawa in the pecking order. If anything it'll be Shinji that goes.

529~~~
He's now been dropped from the Spanish squad along with Torres. With Xavi & Xabi retiring, thought there will be need for midfielders, but seems Mata's slipping in the ranks there.

530~~~
I don't get the negativity to mata he's still a very new player and having a stat of 17 games with 7 goals is a top return when you consider exactly how shit we have been.

531~~~
different positions. Mata isnt a CM/DM. Herrera will have good chances.

532~~~
I have seen a few people saying that Mata will be dropped to accommodate Di Maria?

Anyone want to have a guess at what LVG will do with his forwards now when it comes to a starting 11?

533~~~

534~~~
Jose got rid of him because he cannot defend and didn't fit in his system. Just re watch Ki seung' goal  and you'll see why Jose got a point, I ain't sure he can adapt to LvG's system either.

535~~~
Its a travesty if he's dropped ahead of Rooney/RVP.

536~~~
I agree with this. i don't think he has been good but he's been better than those two.

537~~~
If he is dropped, then why LVG let kagawa go. Makes no sense

538~~~
Really poor again.

539~~~
Rooney or Mata

not both (though injuries have forced LVGs hand)

540~~~
needs to be dropped.

541~~~
Kagawa anyone?

542~~~
He needs players making runs and the ball to feet. Our defence have hoofed it over 30 times in this match. How are playmakers meant to get into the game with that sort of service?

543~~~
Di Maria hasn't done bad...

544~~~
M.I.A. Needs to get himself free to receive passes and affect the game.

545~~~
Don't expect too many to understand this, they will all be blaming him. Anyway still, Mata, Rooney and RvP don't work, only two out of those three can play at once!!

546~~~
I know he's been our best player, but Mata needs the ball to feet, and he rarely gets it because the team don't play to his strengths. Infact I don't think they play to any of our attacking players strengths anymore. We create nothing and the attackers just suffer.

547~~~
He's got to come deeper and get closer to Fletcher.

548~~~
I think he has had the ball a few times and played poor balls into the box, you are right in some cases but he has also been a bit poor when he has got the ball

549~~~
No.

550~~~
Well yeah, he could have done better but Rooney and RVP are suffering too, so I think it's more a problem with getting the ball to any of our attacking players rather than just Mata. They are all suffering.

551~~~
Mata got the ball to his feet, slips. Sums his season up so far.

552~~~
Don't be a twat.

Everytime he has had the ball he has done nothing with it.

Got in the way in the box on one chance, dawdled and miss hit a pass to Di Maria in the middle on another. Hit an aimless pump to the box on a decent paced break.

He may not be getting much ball, but when he has he has been poor.

553~~~
His season, or our 3 attacking players? They are all playing below par. Wonder why that is...

554~~~
We'd be so much more flexible without him in the side, and to be honest, he isn't proving why he should be in it. A mobile midfield three of di Maria, Herrera and Blind would work so much better.

555~~~
Actuially his season, but the other 2 also.

556~~~
Blind is as slow as Mata is.

557~~~
my opinion too.

558~~~
Mata is slow, but Rooney and RVP are also slow, it's obviously a problem fitting them all in. I'd take Januzaj over one of the forwards.

559~~~
All the front 3 are slow as feck. One of them needs to be dropped.

560~~~
If we keep these performances up, I wonder how long it will take before this becomes a running joke<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

561~~~
Well argued!

The rest you could say about RvP and Rooney too. Only 2 of them 3 should play.

562~~~
In my amateur opinion the solution is rather simple and something loads of people (including G Nev if memory serves right) have already suggested. At the max we should play two of Rooney/ RVP/ Mata. Juan's best asset is his perception of spaces, a bit like Ozil at Arsenal because neither of the have the dribbling ability that a more complete #10 like Silva has. Mata had that at Chelsea with Hazard, Drogba etc and he thrived in the system; Ozil likewise with Ronaldo or Benzema. They both have to rely upon runners around him to exploit the space since they can't do it themselves. He'll be wasted in the current system where our attacking trio is monumentally static and there aren't enough players to feed of his movement. All three of them play in front of the defense leading to the lack of dynamism in attack. The introduction of someone who's a little vibrant like Januzaj or Welbeck would immediately remedy the problem.

563~~~
This formation is acting as a leveller come on LVG don't be stubborn change it and win the fecking game

564~~~
I'm sorry but he's been rather shit. Most #10s can drop back and add to possession when needed but he's so freaking lightweight to add any more than cosmetic value when things are not all rosy.

565~~~
He can feck off, he has been soooo poor, lets keep Kagawa.

566~~~
Look who was hiding again.

567~~~
Anonyomous.

568~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

569~~~
Now do people believe me we cannot have all Mata, RVP and Rooney in the team? Because we should not be playing 352 for starters and any other formation there is no where for Mata. Jose saw that and we thought we were getting a bargain but again it was just a panic buy, only difference this time is we didn't pay £24 m for him and stand to make a £18 m profit.

570~~~
Our team seems to have the ability to suck the life out of talented, creative footballers. He seemed to be so devoid of creativity on the ball today and had a terrible game. When he signed, he looked like the stand-out in a poor team. It's like he's morphed into the rest of this team after a full pre-season with them.

571~~~
Mata, Rooney and RVP all terrible today.

572~~~
He's gone to doing a Rooney every time he gets the ball. Pass to wing.

573~~~
Didn't quite happen for him today, and he cut a frustrated figure. I wonder if there's anything to these rumours that if any of RvP, Rooney, Mata and Di Maria are to lose out under LvG, it's Mata who's most likely?

You get still get excited when he receives the ball 30 yards out and turns, because you know he *can* carry it forward and then either score or create. But he struggled to really influence of the game, and was then unfortunate to pick up an injury.

Looking for more from him, as I am from pretty much all of our big guns.

574~~~
Mata couldn't get involved in the game today. Feel sorry for him. The defenders aren't capable of bringing the ball forward therefore he ends up with no space to operate in. When he gets the ball he ends up being trapped and having to either go back on himself or out wide.

The play from back to front is far too slow.

575~~~
He needs to be dropped. He was invisible today and the only thing I noticed was his floated passed/crosses essentially gifting possession back to them.

He's one of the players as to the reason we've changed system. In order that to be worth he needs to perform and be involved much more than what he currently is doing.

576~~~
He had two brilliant chances that he made a mess of.  Useless.

577~~~
Actually was poor today. Significantly worse than the two previous games. But today you could tell he was playing deeper than normal.

578~~~
I just don't rate him, despite his stats.

579~~~
Time to start benching him. Very poor today and has been poor more often than not for a while now.

580~~~
Mata, Rooney and RVP are all terribly suited for this formation. All three of them require someone else to do the penetrative off-the-ball runs, dribbling and provide the width. Of course when they all play together that means nobody does it and we end up with an incredibly one geared attack. 

A 5-3-2 is great when the offensive two/three have absolute world class individual abilities in terms of flair/dribbling/pace. At most you want one of Mata/Rooney/RVP in such a set up, with the other two providing the dribbling and pace. 

Suarez/Sturridge/Coutinho worked even if Suarez and Sturridge were both highly egoistic and selfish because they had great pace and good 1 vs 1 ability. Ronaldinho/Rivaldo/Ronaldo worked because Ronaldinho provided the width and all Rivaldo/Ronaldo had world class dribbling/flair. RVP/Robben worked with Sneijder(who is a Mata type) because Robben provided the dribblin. 

The 5-3-2 completely relies on individual brilliance to break down the opponents defense, rather than having a system great for attacking play and exposing the weakness of the opponents. 

Understandable that any manager would try to get Rooney, RVP and Mata working together as the potential is ridiculous, but hopefully LVG will come to his senses and either bench one or play one out of position.

581~~~
Last two league games he was as bad as I've ever seen him. Injury won't help him get his sharpness back. 

That said, it's remarkable how short people's memories are. He's a brilliant player, obviously.

582~~~
Any word on the injury?

583~~~
I'd sell Mata any day before selling Welbeck.....but I think Welbeck will be sacraficed as it would be harder to offload Mata.......Mata will be benched once LVG can find a better solution to him in the team.....He's just not dynamic and athletic enough to be a proper Man Utd player...Di Maria on the other hand looks world class in his first game

584~~~
Yup, Mata's really looking poor in our team full of dynamic and athletic players. First thing that comes to my mind when I see our team play is 'damn, why isn't Mata more athletic and dynamic? I wish he was as athletic and dynamic as Antonio'. Hey, imagine that. Mata bulked up and his brain completly evaporated ( just like Valencia's after he started roiding ) and now he can only pass with his left foot. Now that would be something.

585~~~
He hasnt been good but to be fair, having Rooney and RVP in front of you as a number 10 is very difficult, they barely make runs and are always looking to get the ball in their feet.

586~~~
If it means he won't be forced into the team with RVP and Rooney next match, it's for the best.

587~~~
Ya I was thinking the exact same. If he had to spend a few weeks/months on the sidelines it could be a blessing in disguise.

588~~~
What has happened to him? 

His confidence is shot, I think. This is not the same Mata that I saw for Chelsea.

589~~~
He needs to drop back and help the midfield more - he is just not doing that at the moment, nor is he delivering defence splitting passes or running at the defence. He's been poor this season, so I hope he can pick things up and start playing like he played at Chelsea (or during some games for United last season).

590~~~
Sad that he got injured but in all honesty it might be a small blessing in disguise. He was poor <i>again. </i>Rooney and RvP were no better though. This "great front three" that keeps getting talked about is a complete fizzer.

591~~~
How can anyone play £37million for a player with no pace ? Mata is a good player, but he is really no better or worse than Arterta or Carzola. Probably doesn't help his game that both RVP and Rooney are off the boil.

592~~~
Mourinho has screwed us over. This isn't the Mata we all seen at Chelsea.

593~~~
Dire display. The idea that he starts ahead of Januzaj is simply ridiculous. Should have been taken off at half-time. Welbeck and Januzaj offer far more in terms of penetration than Mata. Since we have no pace, no movement up front, it is pointless playing Mata.

594~~~
Mata is a level above Cazorla. It's not particularly close.

595~~~
I hate this arguement of pace and how its the be all of professional football. There are tons of footballers who have had great careers without being blessed with pace. I dont think it helps his game when hes got no one making runs around him to pick out - this was a feature of his play while at Chelsea. 

I will however agree on the fee. I still cant believe we paid it knowing that Chelsea wanted to sell... Moreso when we could have strengthened the midfield for that money - Thanks Moyes!

596~~~
His best moment was when released Di Maria with that through ball - that's more of the shit we want to see, and it's why we paid that kind of fee for him. There was a play in the first half where Di Maria tried to play a 1-2 with him and somehow found himself in quite a bit of space in the middle of the park, and Mata just passed it out wide to Young. Frustrating as feck.

597~~~
He has talent, no doubt, but the fact I can watch a match like Burnley and forget he is even playing for long spells says it all.

598~~~
Would be interesting to see how he would do if he had Di Maria, Januzaj and Welbeck ahead of him.

599~~~
Mata = Berbatov and we're just going to have to live with that until we can eventually offload him for 10 million quid to a club in Spain in a couple of years.....A squad player at best

600~~~
LvG just needs to find a way of getting the best out of Mata, he was amazing at Chelsea i'm sure he can come good at United.

601~~~
Personally i think he would favour a 433 where he playing ahead of Carrick/Blind & Herrara, with Rooney/Welbeck/RvP, Di Maria, Januzaj ahead of him.

But LvG seems intent on having all 3 (mata/rooney/RvP) play at the same time.

602~~~
IF he was so amazing, then why did Mourinho sell him to a supposed rival?

603~~~
Some ridiculous over reacting to a player who is struggling for form in an unfamiliar system. 

I mean, he's actually been better for us since he arrived than Rooney and RvP have yet everyone wants him to be the one benched. Bizarre.

604~~~
He's been poor this season. But nothing is lining up for anyone. Someone needs to solve this puzzle and start to truck on. We need to go back to basics.

605~~~
When you mention a Dynamic and Athletic player that plays in central midfield when comparing Mata to someone then hey..would it not make more sense to compare him to proven dynamic and athletic playermakers like Fabreagas, Kroos, Gotze, Scholes, Modric, Gerrard, Iniesta, etc...why would you compare a creativeless speed merchant who plays a completely different role to a playmaker when talking about athleticism and dynamism?

606~~~
Mata's problem is that he has no pace off the mark to create some space for himself to play in, hence why he looks lost so often. If you look at Di Maria today it wasn't just his pace once he is off and running, it's his pace off the mark and body strength when receiving the ball in a tight area that gave him the space to start the runs and try forward passes.

607~~~
He's getting amongst the goals but his general play is pretty poor to be fair. He needs to be doing a hell of a lot more.

608~~~
This. Mata's main weaknesses are his strength and speed. Not sure we would have bought him, if it was up to LvG or SAF.

609~~~
He defiantly needs speed and strength around him, for two reasons. A) To create space for him to work B) So he can pick out the runs.

Atm we don't have that. Especially with Rooney and RVP up top. I'd like to see him surrounded with the likes of Di Maria, Welbeck & Januzaj. I suspect he'd look much better.

610~~~
So he wasnt amazing for Chelsea? 

Jose didnt rate him enough last season, that's why he went to us. Before that he was great for them.

611~~~
Thing is that as with Rooney, Rvp and now Di Maria, ppl expect more of Mata considering the team s situation. Today was perhaps one of his worst game in a united shirt.

612~~~
If he can't make his own space as a midfield player that is a problem, Scholes never had much speed but his speed of movement when receiving the ball in tight areas meant he always had a yard to make his pass.

613~~~
I remember in the newbies I used to defend Kagawa and say he need like minded players around him and that he needs players to make runs for him to find the killer pass.

Now I see a lot of people on here are saying Mata needs quick players around him or needs this that or the other.

For me we didn't need Mata nor will he bring anything to the side what Kagawa couldn't give.

If he was so great Chelsea would have never sold him to us especially being a rival! 

I don't think RVP, Rooney and Mata is working but I'll admit on paper it looks fantastic and when we signed him I couldn't wait for them to play together.

614~~~
Really poor today. Same goes for the two supposed world class strikers we had on the pitch, but that is the Mata thread.

Even his shooting and corners were off (well then Young and Anderson took them and were even worse at them).

Oh and so typical that a player who probably has never ever been injured in his life got injured today when we already have half the team out.

615~~~
3rd game in a row that MATA hasn't delivered, so he can't have any complaints if he is not selected in the upcoming matches.

616~~~
He was rubbish today. Like everyone else.

617~~~
Decent goal-scoring record (albeit half of them from set-pieces?) but can anyone remember a single game for United where he ran the show?

I'm struggling tbh. Which is a worry because that's what I was expecting when we signed him. What we've got has looked more like a small, not very quick, not very strong, support striker.

618~~~
Individual games under Moyes have blended into unholy mush in my mind, but my impression is he was our best player the second half of last season. Who was better than him?

619~~~
Nope. I was glad we signed him, even though I struggled to see how he fit in, but he hasn't looked the same player. Probably a lot to do with how poor a side he joined but if you had to make a snap judgement, which gladly we don't, you'd probably think he's not long for being at the club. I can see him being the one to make way at some stage.

620~~~
Invisible today

Any news on his injury?

621~~~
If we moved to a 4-3-3 does anyone think he could play wide with Di Maria playing as a hybrid midfielder/winger like he did at Madrid last season? At the moment he's not getting into the space between the opposition midfield and defense which is where he normally does the most damage. He ends up dropping really deep which isn't really his game.

622~~~
That's like asking who's been better than him under Van Gaal. Faint praise, at best. 

I remember him and Kagawa looking quite good against a completely disinterested Newcastle team at one point. Mind you, I can also remember Fellaini looking good, awat at Palace.

623~~~
You've a better memory than me.

624~~~
He played well against Newcastle but Newcastle had lost like 8 games in a row or something by that point.

625~~~
Would like to see Adnan in behind the strikers against QPR, I like Mata and he will certainly get more games than most, but we do need to utilise Adnan also.

626~~~
it says a lot that Anderson... yes that's right, ANDERSON... looked much better and more composed

627~~~
I don't think the system suits him at all. It just gets too congested up front with Rooney, RvP and Mata I feel, which leads us passing wide balls to our current wing backs (don't get me started). Behind a lone striker with two wider forwards I feel would benefit him much more. 

I still stand by my claims that Kagawa is a better player.

628~~~
Good analysis.

Kagawa wasn't the problem and Mata sure isn't the solution. Both super players in a totally different system.

629~~~
Agree. For Mata to be of much use to us he needs to be surrounded by pace, or at least dynamic players making plenty of runs off the ball.

630~~~
Besides today's performance, he doesn't strike me as the man with the idea's, the imagination. Is he a playmaker or a pass giver? I think this United needs a playmaker, a player who creates situations for a decisve pass, by moving, passing and moving and passing again. That takes a special football brain, Herrera maybe, Kagawa had it, Mata appearantly not.

631~~~
I really don't think the system is the problem. Di Maria pulled the ball back to him and instead of slotting he ball in the back of the net like you'd expect him to he fell on his arse. Just another one of those days, he'll get his sharpness back soon.

If the system <i>is </i>the problem, then the system needs changing. It might be a different matter if our other best players were thriving in it, but they're not.

632~~~
He's makes and scores goals. Look at his time at Chelsea he just needs people around him. The total lack of confidence which is running through the team doesn't help but I just feel if he had Di Maria, Rooney, Welbeck and attacking fullbacks he's be a lot more successful.

I don't think the system is helping. It not the cause of all our problems at the moment, the total lack of self belief/confidence to take the ball and try do something with is a huge problem. But the system isn't helping in my opinion.

633~~~
Was pleased when we signed him but never realised just how slow and weak he was, I think he was a panic buy who can only play in one position and all the pace and movement needs to be provided by players around him. No idea how he stayed on the pitch today as he was useless from the start and I actually think he is someone we will have to let go either in January or next summer.

634~~~
I don't think it's completely accurate to label him as a panic buy. Marouanne Fellaini was a panic buy. Mata was a player that we arguably didn't need, but still a very good signing for us nevertheless.

I think it's too soon to think about getting rid of him. It's still early in the season and he's one of several big players who haven't performed yet. While he was poor today, he remains a player who has a lot of quality and ability.

635~~~
Was he a good signing though? Not sure he was or will be unless we are prepared to get rid of other players, we would have been better off with someone who can play wide as well and offers a change of pace. I think he has lots of ability but it's not just about ability it's about players who compliment each other and that is where we are struggling right now, he needs quick players around him to open up space, we don't have that even with everyone fit.

636~~~
From what I've seen, I think Mourinho sold us a pup. He hasn't made the contribution expected from a £37m player.

For the sake of our season, I hope LVG stops pandering to 'names', and picks the players and formation that might get the job done. I'd try a reversion to 4 - 3 - 3 with Di Maria, Herrera and Blind behind Januzaj, Rooney/RvP and Wilson. Until their form improves, the 'stars' are not doing enough to stay on the pitch.

637~~~
I think a lot of people called it right before the season started. Mata, Rooney and RVP as a front three doesn't work. None have pace, none of them will stretch teams, which means teams can just put a man on each one then press us in every area of the pitch without worrying about being caught out.

Di Maria will be playing instead of one of them as soon as we have a fit midfield, I hope. I'm surprised and somewhat worried Welbeck or Januzaj aren't doing so already.

The problem for Mata is he's the biggest luxury player I've ever seen in a United shirt. He's a non entity when the oppositon have the ball. He doesn't go looking for the ball nearly enough when his team mates have it (reason enough on its own to drop him when he's supposed to be a no10, imo). He wont adapt to another position. He wont put a defensive shift in if you play him more wide. He doesn't work particularly hard compared to any other player.

RVP is a lethal striker, while Rooney is a player who can be every bit as effective as Mata, but will also do a job for the team and be willing to adapt if he's asked to play in a slightly different role. They're both easy to fit in if you're building a winning and stylish team. 

Mata's like a jigsaw piece that doesn't have a jigsaw. You start trying to force it in to another one and all the other pieces start crumbling away.

People can make all the excuses up for him they want. The simple fact is if he doesn't want to go down as the biggest waste of money in United's history, HE has to step up and start doing more. The world of Manchester United isn't going to start revolving around Juan Mata just because he played well once in a shit Chelsea team.

If Tom Cleverley had put in the three performances Mata has so far this season, people would be sending him death threats and demanding his exit, not calling for the entire club to be structured around his precious footballing style.

638~~~
It's not that he doesn't try to work off the ball, that's very unfair. It's more that he's so utterly tiny, weak and slow that it's pretty pointless him trying to put himself about as he's got nothing to contribute whether he's trying or not.

639~~~
And actually, the only thing that's mildly irritated me about how both Moyes and LVG have tried to use him is that they've pandered to this notion that he can only play well in the centre or cutting into the centre from the right. I actually think the best I've ever seen him play in the Premiership is when picking up space out on the left and he'd be worth keeping as a left wing option.

640~~~
He's a token effort though. So much so that even he blatantly looks like he knows it.

I wouldn't say he's lazy but you're never going to notice him busting a gut to get himself into the game. You wont see him going looking for the ball if it's not finding its way to him. He'll perform his token responsibility and then if the game doesn't automatically revolve into his path, that's it.

Not good enough. Especially not in a struggling team that's overloaded with players who can play in his position. He should be having to push himself every single week just to keep his place...and he isn't

641~~~
Thought he played quite deep today. Necessary though with di Maria also playing CM and I don't think it suits him. Unless we go for a diamond structure, I don't think he should play with di Maria CM.

642~~~
He wasn't getting a game and they were offered 37m. Him being sold to United is no reflection on his ability as a player. He's brilliant.

643~~~
So this will be the thread for most embarrassing comments this year? I shall look forward to it then.

Before people shoot me down for this, which they undoubtedly will: yes, he was dire today. Yes he hasn't had a good game this season (in fact, who has), and yes, he is slow. Some comments though have been beyond the level of stupidity that I expect  at times.

644~~~
It will be close between his and Di Maria's thread soon enough with ppl claiming "If he was that good Madrid wouldn't have sold him"

Watch this space <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

645~~~
He was great for us. Jose sold him because he didn't fit his way of playing, whereas Oscar did without sacrificing too much creative quality.

He seems to be a player that needs the team around him to be just right to get the best out of him, and ironically, that sort of team is the United teams of the past - quick, counter attacking sides.

Mata at his best is the best number 10 in the league, he won't run a game, but get him free in between the lines and he will cut defences to ribbons. United should be looking for a holding midfielder and playing a 4-2-3-1 formation (providing Blind and Rojo are the centre-halves, no idea what van Gaal's train of thought there is).

646~~~
Blind is the new DM.

647~~~
Blind is a midfielder, he'll play next to Herrera. But yeah, fundamentally I agree with that <a class="username" data-user="83245, @TheShedEnd" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83245/">@TheShedEnd</a> .

Playing Mata with two unbelievably slow strikers, and a team full of players that don't make any runs or decent movement, and you're not going to see the best of him. Its no coincidence that in pre-season, when Welbeck played, Mata looked a lot more involved.

That, or Jose has sold us a dud. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

648~~~
Was screaming to have him subbed earlier. The game was crying for some pace and Mata was completely ineffective 

Hope he can find a way to get more on the ball in this system

649~~~
He should remain the corner taker because Young is useless at them and Mata is usually good.  Haven't seen Di Maria take them but going by some of his inch perfect long passes today he might be better than Mata.

650~~~
He looked injured coming off, any news?

651~~~
It's strange watching him now. The first couple of games for us he looked like a revelation, much like Di Maria today, picking out passes nobody else in our team seemed capable of finding. Today he looks like he's been infected with whatever the rest of the team has though. He often has a good option ahead him, but instead he'll opt to take another touch or two, and just end his move on the ball with a safe back pass.

It was so very, very clear seeing it in contrast to Di Maria, who so often tried to pick out the option further forward on the pitch. He seems completely devoid of any confidence on the pitch, and doesn't seem to trust in his own abilities any more.

It's sad, really, because I've seen him play so much more adventurous so many times that I simply cannot accept that he's just "lost it". I only hope that he doesn't end up as another casualty of our zombie passing style, because he has so much in his locker.

652~~~
All the team is playing shit and i mean <b>ALL</b> (Rooney, RVP included) yet why is Mata getting most of the shit?

When the team is playing well again and are winning, you'll see a different Mata, infact Mata will probably be one of the main reasons in this happening.

653~~~
It's a reasonable explanation, but I do notice that this gets applied very inconsistently to players depending on whether one likes them or not. Pretty much every player thread on here at the moment has posters who say 'he's shit' and others saying 'it's the team's fault'.
When it comes down to it, the main criticism being levelled at most of our players that have left or are leaving is that they haven't taken their opportunities by making things happen when they played. I don't see why Mata should be any different in this regard.

654~~~
I don't just mean here.  Mata seems to be the target of the media too - 'Mata needs to up his game' 
'Mata to be axed for Di Maria' (before the game against Burnley).

Just a few of many headlines regarding Mata.

655~~~
Last season he was always coming to get the ball, playing through the middle etc. This season he's been shying away slightly, playing sideways passes. He's been infected with cleverleytis

656~~~
He was a panic buy. Satisfied the fans and made them lay off Moyes for a bit because we had signed a "quality" player.

657~~~
Fair enough, I hadn't really noticed him being targeted specifically by the media. I certainly don't think it's the case on the forum (at least not more so than about 7 other players).

658~~~
Have you not looked in any thread except this one?

All of the players get shit, especially Rooney. Mata is the only one who has people running in to make bullshit excuses for him that you could apply just the same to any other player.

For some reason Mata to some people has a free pass to go hiding in games without it ever having anything to do with him.

I say again, if  Cleverley put in the three performances mAta has this season, there wouldn't be anyone making an excuse for it, other than "it's because he's shit"

659~~~
That's exactly the problem with labelling him a panic buy though. How can buying a quality player be a panic buy? Perhaps an unnecessary one and not in a position we needed to strengthen, but people only seem to have started saying this lately since his poorer form started. When he was playing well when he first came in, everyone was delighted and thought we had one of the best players in the league.

Maybe he won't be successful long-term, but the problem here is that if he has three good games, people will be back to calling him our best player and saying he was a superb buy and that Mourinho was crazy to let him go.

660~~~
Yeah fair point. Maybe more unnecessary than "panic" then.

661~~~
Yeah, I could agree with you on that.

662~~~
Needs to step up a bit.

663~~~
If he is injured and misses a few matches and our play improves it'll be interesting to see what LvG does with him.

664~~~
If he's hurt I hope Herrera gets a few games in that #10 role. Mata seriously needs to step up a notch with his overall play to get the strikers some good service.

665~~~
Who would you play in CM then?

666~~~
Is Mata's FB account real? He just welcomed Di Maria and Blind to United.

Edit: My bad seen the blue tick.

667~~~
What does signing Falcao mean for Mata ? Could it be that he gets dropped for Rooney ?

-------Blind---Herrera--
------------Rooney
--------Falcao-----RVP

668~~~
Carrick & Blind hopefully

669~~~
I think Mata is the logical omission.

It would be nice to play 4-3-1-2 (next match), with:

DDG
Rafael Jones Rojo Shaw
Herrera Blind Di Maria
Rooney
RvP Falcao

670~~~
Rather have that we kick RVP out and play Mata as a 10, Rooney just isnt a 10, when was the last time he gave a through ball? Or even an assists from open play..

671~~~
----------Blind---------
---Herrera-----Di Maria

---------Mata--------

Falcao--------RVP/Rooney

No?

672~~~
Jesus that lineup is tasty. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

673~~~
Yes. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

674~~~
Yes, if we're playing six a side  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

675~~~
Rooney could play rush goalie <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

676~~~
According to Ogden this is how we may go, but put Rooney where Mata is, and put on the bench.

Rather

-------Herrera-------Blind---------
----------Rooney/Mata------------
Janujaz-----Falcao/RVP-----Di Maria

Give us some width.

677~~~
Please yes.

678~~~
I don't think so, the more natural fit would have Mata in that #10 position. 

No doubt they would rotate though, it's actually a perfect set of four players to rotate as Rooney can cover 10 when Mata is rested otherwise one of the three will have a game off. It's a lovely set up.

679~~~
With Falcao here one of Rooney/Mata/RVP will be on the bench I believe. If not two

680~~~
Is it only me who thinks RVP might not play that much in the near future - maybe because of injury, or maybe something else.  Sometimes he doesn't seem as interested as he should be. 

I really like Mata and hope he's not the one to make way.

681~~~
Not sure if it has been posted but in his latest blog entry he said that he got cramp against Burnley, and that he had tests done and there is "nothing to worry about." Will be interesting to see what his involvement is against QPR with Falcao coming in.

682~~~
So Juan Mata not in the Spanish lineup - does that come as a surprise? He had a bit part role in the world cup (as expected), but scored when he got the chance. Agreed that he is not having a great season; but I expected him to have a run out with the national team

683~~~
Not a big surprise, no. If Spain hadn't had a few injuries he'd probably have missed out on the World Cup squad too, he's pretty much on the fringes.

684~~~
You know when Spain's games are? Due to all the chaos and news at United the last few days I haven't had much time to follow their news recently <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/> But looking forward to watch them again, always so many quality players around!

685~~~
Play tomorrow against France in a friendly and then a qualifying match against Macedonia on Monday. Not sure about the times though...

686~~~
He's rated 85 in FIFA 15 #official, for the guys interested.

687~~~
I tend to be pleased when United players sit out internationals but we play so few games this season, I actually think it would have done him some good to get a bit of action for Spain. Might give him a bit of a lift if he has a good game for them.

688~~~
Pisses me off too much than it should! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 
United always get criminally underrated on fifa! I remember Rafael having 77 after that season when he was the best right back in the league bar Zabaletta. 

You watch, Di Maria 86, Van Persie 87, Rooney 87, Falcao 88

689~~~
Thanks!

690~~~
Bar di Maria who should be 88/89 after last season, those ratings are fair.

691~~~
I agree. But I mean the fact that Di Maria and falcao have gone to united will mean that the ratings will go down by a point or two!

692~~~
I think its about right to be fair, he hasnt been great last season, he was rated 87 after his freaking good season at Chelsea, to get -2 is quite fair. Di Maria should be higher tho, and I hope they dont underrate Januzaj/Shaw. Shaw was chosen best LB last year, so if they dont give him at least 78 I will be surprised.

693~~~
One thing that I'd say has disappointed with me with Mata is his passing ability. When he was a Chelsea, I was always under the impression that one of his big strengths was his ability to pick passes and through balls, very much in the Ozil and Silva way, for example his pass to Ba for that goal against us in the FA Cup. Yet at United, he hasn't really shown that sort of vision or skill. If anything he's played far more like a second striker then an attacking midfield. Scoring goals, but not really setting them up in the way I was expecting. So whats the reason? Have I overestimated that part of his game, or are the runs simply not being made as much at United, for him to be able to pick those passes?

Maybe a few of the Chelsea or Spanish lads could clear things up a bit?

What kind of Spanish fan are you? You should have an in depth knowledge of every single Spanish player to ever have played the game. Ever. Pffft.

You don't deserve our beautiful Di Maria <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Who? <span style="color: #ffffff">;-)</span>

697~~~
Not really.

698~~~
At United, he has certainly been like a second striker, ala Totti or Del Piero. He did create in the first few games here (when he was not crossing), but this season he has often not played those killer passes. If you look at a lot of our attacking moves, he looks to get at the end of them (frames where you have all three of Rooney, RVP, Mata looking to get at the end of attacks) rather than instigate them or play the through pass. Has certainly been disappointing this season.

699~~~
Juventus' top target for January, according to Tuttosport.

700~~~
bullshit.

701~~~
They'll probably offer us a loan deal paying 20% of his wages

702~~~
I'd sell him. Not even for money's sake, but he just doesn't fit a 4-3-3 as a starter.

703~~~
Don't get why so many seem to want him out of the starting XI now. He hasn't set the world alight but he's playing in a broken team with no attacking movement, which makes it extremely difficult for him to make the passes he's capable of. He's done fine with an impressive goal return. Mata's not the problem, it's our style of play.

704~~~
In the midfield 3, at the tip. LVG has played no.10s there.

705~~~
Di Maria... If not, then Herrera. 

Mata's not really a 'number ten' in my opinion, more a second striker.
The further away from the striker, the worse.

Priority should be one or two wide men (a traditional winger, and a goal scorer - both with pace) this summer, provided Blind, Herrera and Di Maria work well as a midfield three. If the midfield still looks under par, then a midfielder and one traditional winger.
I really don't want to see Mata in midfield. We could keep him for rotation, but that would just be wasting everyone's time.

706~~~
Sense.

707~~~
Mata is the epitome of a no. 10. Creative, technically very strong and operates in the space between the opponent's defence and midfield. If that's not a no. 10, what is?

708~~~
Rooney and Van Persie to come off the bench <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

709~~~
The criticism you can make against him is that he does not drop deep enough sometimes (unlike lets say Silva or Oscar). Otherwise, as rightly pointed out, he is the epitome of a no.10

710~~~
I am sure the two international captains will have a word or two to say about that! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

711~~~
Then they'll have to do their talking training or on the pitch. No place for mediocrity in this squad any more.

712~~~
He was playing from the half way line against Burnley. He had to drop so deep because service was so poor.

713~~~
I see Silva as a number 10. And I think he's very different to Mata.

Mata's more of an instinctive player than a dictator of play. Looks best when the game is more stretched and he has space to use and can time his runs late into the box.
Whereas a number 10 excels with holding the ball (and waiting for that pass) even when penned in the final third under tight marking.
A number 10 often finds themselves isolated and needs to hold the ball without the space to build up speed. At in these circumstances when I think Mata goes missing. A bit might be due to a lack of patience in his play.

Mata at his best, is all about great control, passing it short and moving up the pitch for the return. He can obviously thread a final pass - very well, but so can Kagawa, and I see him as a second striker too. And playing those passes doesn't ake them number 10s. 

His close control is brilliant, and he has it in him to play it about well, but he doesn't dictate the game or leave his mark on the game like a proper number 10 for me. He tries (as it's expected of him), but I doesn't seem natural to him, and I actually think that takes from his game, which is more geared towards being direct and closer to goal being instinctive.

It's hard to explain really, but I don't see him as someone to build a successful side around. And I definitely wouldn't give him the role of number 10, let alone midfield. I also don't think he shields/protects the ball well enough when starting from stationary, which means he has to release quickly - which isn't ideal for a number 10. The ball doesn't stick to him when he's tightly marked and slowed down.

It's an unpopular opinion, and I'll probably be replied to by a Chelsea fan telling me I'm completely wrong, but that's just how I see it.
He's never come across as a proper number 10 to me.

714~~~
Him and Kagawa was the most positive thing of last year for our overall game. Without them in the team we looked absolutely clueless and zombie football was at its worst. 

We are currently looking very slow and zombie like so removing him will be the wrong way to go. He needs to drop down deeper though and it has been his natural position as an AM, it looks more like manager instructions to play him further up.

715~~~
I also am far from sure that Falcao will do well if up top on his own (albeit supported by Mata).

716~~~
i just dont see the point in that, keep him in central midfield where we actually need a player to dominate the role.

717~~~
True that- I think I remember one of the commentators saying as well "Mata's not really getting into the box to create or get onto the end of something, he is spending way too much time trying to provide a passing option to Jones"

718~~~
I am not sure .. He played a two striker system with Atletico; but was all alone at Monaco (with James as the no.10), wasn't he? Did well there.

719~~~
I can see where you are coming from; especially with Mata not having delivered performances where he has controlled the games for Man United (He has been prolific with goal scoring).

With Chelsea, however, he was always the one who dictated games. Chelsea did not have a deep lying playmaker or pass master behind Mata, and it was the no.10 who was charged with building attacks, especially under Benitez. I thought most of the interesting attacking plays went through Mata at Chelsea and he wrecked havoc when charged with build-ups.

When the 3-4-1-2 was devised for Man United, I thought it would benefit no-one more than Juan Mata; because in this system the no.10 is even more classical than the no.10 in the 4-2-3-1. It gives the no.10 that moment of pause in the mould of a true <i>trequartista</i> and bring everyone into play, as you've mentioned. Clearly, it has not worked so far but I still have faith that this system will bring the best out of our playmaker. 

I understand your point about Silva being a more classical no.10 but I think Mata is a fantastic no.10 in his own right. I definitely believe that our attacking play can go through him and that he can dictate games. Thats the beauty about the <i>trequartista</i> - no two of them seem to be alike and each of them bring different combination of qualities to the table.

720~~~
The problem going forward this season, so far, has been much the same as last.. a complete and utter lack of service to the front, particularly through the middle of the park. 

There will be no point having attacking players with the quality of RVP, Falcao, Rooney, Mata, Di Maria if we can't get them on the ball in positions where they can have an impact. 

I'd like to see how we'd do playing lining up in a diamond with 2 up top and Rooney in behind. 

======Blind=======
=========Herrera======
==Mata=============Di Maria
=========Rooney=======
=====Falcao=====RVP====

The main concern would be Blind and Herrera really - I haven't seen enough of them to know - but it might actually get the ball to our front 5.

721~~~
Mata needs runners around him. We had zero movement up top because we took so long to get the ball to our attackers. 

Having Di Maria and Herrera next to him instead of Ashley Young (who is fast, but doesn't have the intelligence to make good runs), Carrick, Fletcher will make a world of difference.

722~~~
What a weird argument. How do you see van Persie and Rooney fitting with Falcao as a starter in 433 then?

723~~~
Rooney can fit in on the left. Depending on how well he does we may need to bring in a better, specialist wide man.
I don't see space in a 4-3-3 for van Persie. But I don't see anyone buying him right now anyway. And he at least plays as a striker, so he offers a direct replacement.

Mata doesn't fit in anywhere in a 4-3-3 in my opinion. I don't like 3-5-2, and I don't think Mata's one to build the team around, and alter the system for.Not sure how that's a weird argument.

724~~~
So you would move to the bench/sell all our three best players?

725~~~
I wouldn't necessarily have bought Falcao this summer. But now that he's here, he's better than Rooney as a lone striker (assuming he's back to his old self) and doesn't slow things down like van Persie, so I don't see why not. I don't consider them our best players any more either. 

If we must play 5-3-2, I'd have Rooney up top with Falcao, and Di Maria behind them; Blind and Herrera behind him. Again no Space for Mata, but at least he'd offer a direct replacement for Di Maria.

Either way, I wouldn't start him or van Persie in either system. I'm hoping it's 4-3-3 though.

726~~~
I'd rather get rid of Captain Fantastic, than him.

I'm curious to see how we will line up with Falcao, probably Mata is the one that will get dropped.

727~~~
If they want Mata, then give us Pogba.

728~~~
What the feck? Im sure ive seen this post in every single one of our player threads. Why dont they just make the whole club their top target?

729~~~
I'm pretty sure Mata won't get dropped and he'll get to his best again soon having Di Maria and Falcao in front of him. Exciting times ahead for you guys.

Hell, I can't even wait for the next United game to see how you'll line up and play. Really curious if you'll hit the ground running or if some might need a bit of time to adapt.

730~~~
We all know Mata can't play out wide as has been proven at Chelsea and already at United. He can't run or defend. It's either he plays No.10 role or he's benched simply. Don't think he'll be a United player this time next season barring any major injury to Falcao, Rooney, Di Maria or RVP.

731~~~
I'm not traditionally anti-Rooney. but he's the one who should be pushed out of the starting XI by our new signings in my opinion rather than Mata, whether in the current system or in a 4-2-3-1/4-3-3. Mata is a world class #10 and Falcao a world class #9, Rooney is a step down from both in their respective positions and isn't great in midfield or on the wings. I'll be really dissappointed if Mata is sacrificed on account of Rooney having been handed the captaincy.

732~~~
United need to stop trying to shoehorn the best players into one side, they need to pick the best side instead. Inevitably, that'll lead to a few noses being put out of joint. So what? A large portion of this squad has under performed for the last 18 months or so, so it's not as though we owe them anything. Time to get ruthless.

Problem we have with Rooney is that he's been made captain - poor decision, imo, because of his inclination towards drastic swings in form. I'm on record as saying, on reflection, Mata was a luxury buy, but given a sustained run in the hole, I believe he'd have a greater influence than Rooney. Problem we now have is that Rooney would appear to be close to undroppable.

You have to assume Falcao will be first choice, that RvP will play and that, as captain, Rooney will play (in the hole). In that scenario, it's hard to see where Mata will play, let alone Januzaj, who I'm very worried for.

733~~~
I pretty much agree with everything in this post. I believe eventually LvG will make the correct decision. He didn't hesitate to drop RvP in the Dutch NT at first before he allowed him to play himself back into contention and eventually the captaincy. I don't think he will be afraid to drop any of the big names in our team if he believes it is best for balance overall.

734~~~
Hasn't got on the ball enough for me in the last few games. His instinct is to pass the ball to a teammate and start running forward even when there is no chance that he could receive the ball back in the position he is running into.

735~~~
I think Mata, like Rooney and RVP, will be given plenty of game time and we will start to see a coherent team.

One of these 3 (or even Falcao) will use this game time as a noose in which to hang themselves by with their (poor) performances. Whoever this is should be the player benched.

My money is on the captain, which in itself may afford him a few extra lives.

736~~~
Sure. But I worry that Rooney was the wrong person to make captain, because he's far less likely to be dropped. Ideally, the captain would be a more consistent player.

737~~~
I don't understand this Mata is a world class # 10 that's been bandied about? Based on what?

738~~~
Proven world class player at Chelsea. 7 goals and 5? assists in half a season at a new club. Great passer of the ball, can finish. 
In the premier league I can only think of Silva, Hazard being better than him as a #10. And No I didn't forget özil.

739~~~
When was the last time Hazard played as a #10? And Mata was by far the best player at Chelsea. Things havent gone his way since the new Mourinho era.

740~~~
A track record of being a world class no. 10?

741~~~
Big season for him. Really hope he can reproduce his Chelsea form with us as he was truly world class for them. If he carries on as he is I can see him being sold <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

742~~~
10/11 33 appearances 8 goals 12 assists
11/12   34 appears 6 goals 10 assists
12/13 35 appearances 12 goals 12 assists
13/14 15 appearances 6 goals 4 assists

I am not calling those world class numbers because  there is only 1 really good season in those numbers and 1 season does not make you world class.  

Even if we do not boil down his game to a bunch of numbers , his tactical inflexibility is a problem for me. I consider a world class attacker to be able to play to a very high level in multiple positions in order to make the team very fluid.  Mata can only play at # 10, play him out wide and he is perhaps 50% ineffective, can't play in at attacking midfield not enough defensive presence and energy.

743~~~
It's simple to use categorized stats but why dont you use the stats of the whole season, in 2012/2013 he had 21 goals and 29 assists, the season before that he had 16 goals and 22 assists.. And Silva for instance, his stats dont come close with Mata's but yet Silva is the better player, Iniesta his stats also arent near Mata's so the stats dont define directly who is world class/the better player. But it says enough that Mata has been Chelsea's best player 2 times in a row, and was voted in the team of the year 2 times in a row.

744~~~
I used league stats only because I don't want to get into arguments about CL level and international level etc.

Secondly, I said in my 2nd paragraph disregarding the stats he is simply not effective anywhere else but #10, look at Iniesta he's played at a high level at LW,AM and even at the start of his career as holding player. Silva also can comfortably float outside and inside and for me that's a big issue because I believe the best teams derive from players comfortably floating into different positions hence why Saha was always a better fit for us than Berbatov.

745~~~
It's completely bullocks, do you remember MaCaZar? The starting attacking trio was Hazard - Oscar - Mata.. And Mata performed every literally every week, he played on the left wing at Valencia and that earned him a transfer to Chelsea and interest from Barcelona...

746~~~
Since last season everyone in our team has been doing this and it's so fecking annoying. Forget sensibly running into space to receive the ball back or provide an outlet for whoever is on the ball, it's just mindlessly running forward into a heavily congested area where the chance of receiving the ball is zero. No wonder LvG said it will take time to train their brains. They seriously need to think about doing things differently. I don't remember so much of it under Fergie.

Back to Rooney, I think playing as one of two up top is the reason he isn't on the ball as much, if he drops people will say he's getting in Mata's way but for me he's better when he's more involved.

747~~~
Yeah I agree, he wouldn't have been my choice as captain. Maybe LvG thought it could elevate him but I still don't think he will be afraid to drop him if he can see the team will be better off without him. He was good on tour, I think we should wait and see how the team clicks after the internationals when a few more of our injured players are back and we are somewhere closer to having a full first choice available.

748~~~
See, the thing is, back when he was scoring and assisting loads for Chelsea, they weren't actually very good. And I wouldn't say he dictated their play, but even if he <i>did </i>- they weren't dominating teams and penning them back, they were going from back to front very quickly, and Mata didn't do very much off the ball at all. And he thrived in that.

I just don't see a player who actually dictates games when his team are holding the ball and penning the other team back. He needs quite a bit of room and space to play at his best. He's too instinctive and not enough of a dictator or ball carrier to be a number 10 for me - like Kagawa. And not somebody you look to to control and set the tempo for a successful side.

But, like you say, I guess there are different ways to play it. And I can understand why people see him as a number 10.

If we were playing a 4-2-3-1, and going back to front quickly, I'd definitely have Mata in behind Falcao and look to draw teams onto us a bit, before breaking with a couple of quick wide men. I could see him scoring loads from his well-timed runs into the box and cut backs. Though he'd probably do almost nothing defensively. 
But it's likely to be 4-3-3 which doesn't suit him as a midfielder in a three or a wide man.

749~~~
Unless we put out some weird muppet-like formation, we can now only play 4 out of Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj, Rooney, RVP and Falcao. 

Which two do you see dropping out?

750~~~
I will add this because I debated it with you guys here when Mata was at his best with us. He was never world class, he was top class, although not far off.

751~~~
The whole stats thing is being used in this thread to prove that Mata is world class. Mata has yet to deliver against a half decent side after being almost a year at Utd so far and in most games tends to go missing.
Kevin Mirallas got 9 goals and 7 assists last season.  Jonjo Shelvey had 6 goals and 6 assists. Should these players not be at Real Madrid by now based on their stats?
I really hope Mata can make it here. He's a very nice guy but he just looks to me like a player that will never make it here. Also players like Iturraspe and Alcacer are getting picked ahead of Mata in the Spanish team. Seems like both Mourinho and Del Bosque don't rate him

752~~~
I don't think it's possible to play Rooney RVP and Falcao in advanced positions in the same team so one of them for sure, though I think the three of them will get a fairly level amount of playing time. Then between Mata and Januzaj I suppose.

Di Maria is the only one who should be guaranteed a place right now because he covers two positions at a very high level whereas Mata, Rooney, RVP and Falcao demand specific positions and Januzaj hasn't quite found himself yet under LVG.

753~~~
I think Rooney can be played behind RVP and Falcao.

754~~~
It'll be tried out and most likely it'll be as bad as the Mata-Rooney-van Persie trial where none of them really do anything of note.

755~~~
Mata started inside right sure , but for most Chelsea games I bothered to watch he eventually stayed middle and Oscar drifted out wide because Oscar is a willing runner to stretch play and put in a defensive shift covering fullbacks. I didn't see him play at Valencia so I can't comment on that. At Utd, he is completely ineffective out wide, yes I am aware there are lots of extenuating circumstances such as rigidity of the whole team under Moyes and general confidence of the man and the team. 

So in essence to my original argument, 1 good season does not make you world class and neither does drastic inflexibility. You haven't given me enough to refute both points because he has not played enough years to carry such a tag.

756~~~
His statistics for us have been surprisingly good.

757~~~
So in the 2011/2012 season he was just average while being nominated for Player of the Year and voted Chelsea's best player? And there's no shame in being able to be very good in just one position, do you think RVP could play other than a striker in his best year? Or do you even think now Ronaldo could play as a #10 or a striker? That doesnt make you a lesser player imo. Mata had 3 very very very good season in a row, since his last season at Valencia until the Mourinho era, all of a sudden he is just bang average lol.

758~~~
I also have no idea which number 10 would do a good job with Rooney and RVP around him, strikers who make zero runs behind the defence, always come in your space. Not to mention Young/Valencia. The number 10 role in 352 is also just useless, as we saw at the World Cup..

759~~~
Xavi had 4 good seasons in his whole career and could only play CM. Tell me how your logic works now?

760~~~
I'd drop Mata and Rooney but given that LVG made the latter his captain he clearly rates him so I'm guessing he will be starting regardless of how poor he has been so far this season.

761~~~
Are you serious? Alcacer is a striker and Iturraspe is a defensive mid. Those selections have absolutely nothing to do with Mata. He's been here for what, 7 full months when our team has been at it's worst in years, and other key stars have been struggling to make an impact. Stop talking nonsense.

762~~~
It'll be worse.

763~~~
On his way to juve as a Pogba makeweight in the next 12 months with any luck.

764~~~
So the only way to classify a player's performances are world class or average? I don't care about nominations and individual accolades, Valencia was club player of the year in 11/12, doubt that means anything to anyone at this point in time. 

There is indeed no shame in being able to be good in just one position. I don't think it's is an attribute that a world class player should have. RVP can drop deep and be part of the build up, would it be as good as Mata, nope but would his level of play drop so drastically, no either. Ditto Ronaldo.  

We are going to have to agree to disagree about how many good seasons he has had because even if i were to overlook the limitations of his game, I would need 3/4 seasons of 02/13 to call him world class.

765~~~
Details, I clearly said not a good attribute for a world class <b>attacker</b>. If I was going to define every position based on that then there would be no world class keepers, defenders or central midfielders. Also, only 4 good seasons, seriously?

766~~~
I thought so.

767~~~
I don't know why people want Pogba here. He'll feck off to Madrid in two years.

768~~~
The suggestion that Rooney has a brighter road ahead of him that Mata is a bit looney. 

Roo may be undroppable for United (and England) for commercial reasons but he's clearly in decline, though a gradual one, and he simply hasn't been the equal of a Mata over the last three seasons.  We'll see if Van Gaal has the balls to start Mata over Rooney, but in the day he does this United squad will be a revelation.

769~~~
Reminds of Giggs losing his mojo in his late 20's and early 30's. Rooney 's going to have to reinvent his game to reach those heights again.

770~~~
Rooney doesn't strike me as the sort of dedicated professional who would do that, tbh.

771~~~
Fair point. Though, Rooney has changed a whole lot in the last couple of years. He's become a lot more mature and doesn't get into any antics like a spoilt brat. He may yet be a dedicated professional. You never know.

772~~~
Rooney was, without question, much better than Mata last season.

773~~~
Really, in United shirt?

774~~~
Did Mata do something for us last season that I missed? I remember a few goals very late in the season.

Rooney had 19 goals in 40 starts (wiki) while Mata had 7 in 32. Assists probably similar.

775~~~
Mata started playing for us in late January, that's why I asked are you comparing their performance just in United shirt, because since Mata's arrival Rooney has been in awful form.

776~~~
So will De Gea and Adnan if they turn out world class...whats your point??

777~~~
Which is more reason to sell Rooney.Jesus he wanted out due to our lack of ambition....

778~~~
Mata looked like one of our best players when he came in last season. He was a creative player who could actually do something on the ball, unlike the majority of players who were playing some dire stuff. Unfortunately, it seems like he's almost been sucked into that poor football this season as he's not been anywhere near his best.

To be fair though, Rooney was one of our better players last season considering how poor we were. Admittedly, it wasn't very hard for him to probably be our best outfield player and it wasn't his best season, but he was still decent overall.

779~~~
I said last season, which is what I meant. I was replying to someone else who suggested Mata has been better than Rooney for 3 straight seasons.

I'm keeping the faith but I haven't been much impressed by Mata yet, he seems to get dispossessed a lot by average defenders.

780~~~
Mata has 7 goals and 4 assists for us in 17 premier league appearances. I found this stat surprising.

781~~~
I sure wouldn't have guessed he's been that productive, good to hear, he's very likable.

782~~~
Why? despite you and loads of people here moaning about him off he's hardly played badly. 

'He's a second striker'
'Doesn't get involved much in the buildup'
'can't pass as well as x y z for man city, real madrid...'
'Buildup play is average'

He's barely played 20 games for us and already people's minds are made up, I fear for Di Maria and Falcao when they cross the ten game mark. Woe betide Falcao is he dares to go two matches without a goal.

783~~~
I dont think he's put in many bad performances for us at all. He's a fine player, but yeah, he can improve on the first two points for sure. Stats are not everything as Rooney proves pretty often.

784~~~
Juan Juan Mata
There's only Juan Juan Mata
Juan Juan Mata
There's only Juan Juan Mata

yo soy un hombre sincero
...

785~~~
Sorry for not looking then, my bad, I thought you were comparing them in United shirt.

786~~~
Playing Rooney, Falcao and Van Persie in the same side is the height of stupidity, let's not kid ourselves it's akin to playing Makalele, Gattuso and Sven Bender in the same side. Something has to give, egos bruised, players getting dropped and some getting offloaded. Mata at least lffers something different from any of our players, especially with Shinji gone, and if his form returns he should play. Adding Falcao to the Van Persie-Rooney-Mata head ache is not the brightest of ideas but since he is here LVG has got to stand firm and play the best team not the best collection of players.

787~~~
The way Mata limped off from the last game, he might well make the decision easier for next week.

If we kept the 3-5-2, Rooney would simply play in front of Di Maria and Herrera, with Falcao and VP ahead.

Who knows how this will pan out going forward, I couldn't see VP playing wide in any true 4-3-3 if we changed formations, unless we're plotting more of a 4-1-2-1-2

which would be a

        Blind
Herrera    Di Maria
       Rooney

VP   Falcao

type feel.

788~~~
Yeah noticed that too and it then feels like we are playing with three strikers, we need him on the ball more and orchestrating moves otherwise itls pointless to select him.

789~~~
Not sure whether it is part of the system though? I've never seen Mata play this far forward and be so inactive in the play. Usually his best traits are exactly that, connecting midfield and attack perfectly. 

He's not effective in the role/form he is in though that is for certain.

790~~~
Definitely Januzaj. He is still untapped potential and he doesn't warrant a starting place purely because of other established players being out of form. His time will come and I'm sure he will force himself into the starting team in the not-too-distant future, but not yet.

Then I would say van Persie out of the other four. We simply should not field Falcao, van Persie and Rooney in a starting eleven from the off, as that means Rooney playing deeper which would be to the detriment of the team. That would mean Mata's starting berth is secure, unless you want to be even more ruthless and bench three. Therefore, it's a toss-up between van Persie and Rooney. The latters captaincy status plays into his hands and quite frankly, RvP has been just as poor lately, so it isn't even farcical to drop him instead of Rooney. Our two new signings are untouchable, as they are our best players.

Front six: Blind; Herrera, di Maria; Mata; Falcao, Rooney

791~~~
Not really.

792~~~
It's beginning to sound like the Anderson thread in here....'He's not really made any impact but he's extremely likeable so for that reason alone he should stay a long time here'

793~~~
Loveable guy, great player, but just smacks of somebody bought without any prior thinking. A statement/panic signing rather than a player who was going to fit into our tactical system in a position we were already full of great players. I can't help feel its gonna be another Veron.

794~~~
Take the blinkers off.

Mata > Rooney

All you have to do is watch their play.  I'll grant you lot that Rooney is a slightly better finisher, but Mata is clearly the better playmaker.

With so many clinical finishers on the squad now, we need Mata's ability to create scoring chances more than we do Rooney's "leadership".

795~~~
I have to admit to getting a bit worried about Mata. I love the guy, but my god he is not an athlete at all. And that's why he needs a lot of movement and pace around him, because he's just not going to be able to create that by himself, he doesn't have the physical capabilities imo. Hopefully the new team we're building will change things, as the team he's played in so far has been so stale and slow, and he's still managed to rack up good stats, despite not hitting the heights we probably expected. 

If we can get the right support, and it clicks, then I hope he could be special. We'll just have to wait and see I guess. I really hope he's not another of our expensive recent flops. I'd love the guy to succeed here.

796~~~
What he has done since he joined though is give us regular goals from midfield. Not done since Scholes left.

797~~~
The inevitable rumors of him leaving in January are starting to pick up albeit from unreliable sources. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2746313/Juan-Mata-sold-January-Louis-van-Gaal-looks-accommodate-Arturo-Vidal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...-van-Gaal-looks-accommodate-Arturo-Vidal.html</a>

798~~~
He won't go anywhere. If LVG persists with the 352 then you need a proper number 10 type, and he's the only one we've got. Others can play there but it will be a makeshift position for them and they won't be as good.

799~~~
Hope we keep hold of Mata, he really is quality when he's in form. 

Also, as much as I rate Pogba, I wouldn't necessarily like to see him swapped for him. I doubt Pogba would come back here anyway.

800~~~
Mata is someone we have to fit into the squad, not someone who automatically fits into the squad.

Thanks Moyes <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

801~~~
Mata was never going to be the soul saviour of our dreadful season just gone and so far this season (barring pre season) it hasn't been much better.

However, for me he has shown enough glimpses so suggest he could be a very good player with other good players around him. There has just been a total lack of the creativity and  movement which surely brings out the best in Mata, the time for real judgement is herein imo.

Let's see how he plays with more solidity behind him and better movement to the sides and in front of him. He could be a very special player if things click.

802~~~
Keep hearing rumours he might be off in January. Personally I think we'd be fools to sell him, I'm sure van Gaal will find a way of fitting him into his system.

803~~~
It would be great to get rid of any of the attacking players who isn't approaching 30. Hernandez and Welbeck are done, Mata is the next.

804~~~
Typical. Man United, where quality number 10's go to die.

Fecking joke if we sell him.

805~~~
He needs legs around him and no tactical responsibility.

806~~~
Don't worry about that, he's nothing like Anderson, that's for sure.

807~~~
Clearly Daily Mail bollocks.

808~~~
Rumours seem to have started from tuttosport bollocks. Can't imagine there being anything in it.

809~~~
Selling Mata would be officially insane. He's started the season really well imo, just needs to be more selfish in front of goal and go for more shots.

810~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Rob Sheperd's 'football grapevine'. Ay, chill out guys. There's lads on the Caf with more club sources.

811~~~
I dunno which is more laughable. Us selling Mata or Juventus buying him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

812~~~
If you think about it, the whole 3-5-2 is in place to accommodate Mata, which tells you everything you need to know.

If it was for the sole reason of playing Rooney and Van Persie together, he could do so in a 4-4-2, as it is he has opted for a 3-5-2 because that way he can play Mata in behind them.

813~~~
Get back on  Red Alert RS  Im going to totally crush you for that remark, hes been one of your poorest performers this season! That said theres others you should be selling before him.

814~~~
The same narrative that was used to defend Kagawa is now being used to defend Mata.

815~~~
I can never understand this logic. We are one of the biggest clubs in the world. Why do people automatically assume that if one of our players turns out to be world class they will join the likes of Real and Barca? We have had plenty of world class players in the past that have spent their whole careers, or at least their best years, at the club. Plenty of players view us as the best club in the world.

In the case of De Gea he is Athletico through and through so he won't join Real Madrid. We also beat loads of top teams to sign Adnan as a kid and those same clubs were bound to be interested in him last season yet he stayed. I don't see why he will suddenly jump ship if he fulfils his potential.

816~~~
If Juventus want Mata, they'll have to return Pogba, it's as simple as that. He has just over 18 months remaining on his contract vs 4 yrs for Mata who's in the prime of his career. Next summer Pogba's value will fall to ~£30 million so it's a fair trade. They get a really good creative midfielder and we get a player that should never have left in the first place.

Or we could use him in a player + cash deal for Koke. He'd slot right into Atletico's setup with Griezmann moving to the left and Mata occupying the central areas.

817~~~
He definitely needs legs anyway, and lots of them. I don't think we can fit him and Rooney in the same team together. Just too slow.

818~~~
I highly doubt Pogba would ever want to come back.

819~~~
I understand what you are saying but if two similar players fail in the same team like what's threatening to happen here, isn't the problem more with us ? There is a reason we signed Kagawa, (dismissing Mata as a panic buy here) and that was because we wanted the specific qualities he brought but the team wasn't ready to change direction and individually   Kagawa was not a dominant personality that could force himself and his style on the team. Maybe it's time we start dismantling the infrastructure that is around the No.10s before rushing to confirm Old Trafford as the graveyard for such a player.
I mean, this team is lost when asked to play anything that doesn't involve working the ball wide to Valencia ignoring infield options crying out for link up play. That is not to say that Mata has been in sparkling form himself, he hasn't been involved in build up play enough but we shouldn't rush to write him off just yet when there is probably half a dozen players who should be sold before him.

820~~~

821~~~
Even still, he left under a cloud and created a storm with the comments he's made ever since. He can feck off, I don't care how good he gets.

822~~~
Not one bad word spoken about the club though.

823~~~
No he hasn't. There was an interview in the Mail (I think it was anyhow) where he did complain about the club but he subsequently posted on twitter that he never even met that journalist let alone gave the interview. He has spoken very highly of the club since he left and he even described himself as a Mancunian in one interview.

824~~~
"Juventus counting the pennies" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Good luck with that.

Mata is now the only real No 10 we have, unless once LvG gets Strootman and as a result uses Herrera as 10 ahead of Blind and Strootman. On the other hand he likes goal scoring No 10s which Mata undoubtly is. 

At least one of the 3 big strikers will be a bigger issue to fit in than Mata, who if we indeed have a strong midfield could also play on the wing in a 4-3-3.

I know ppl love to point out that he has no pace and is not an athlet. But we don't know what LvG wants now, because he has actually just let go our only athletic and pacey striker and as a result has left us just with Di Maria to provide pace. So for all we know he could see Mata as his ideal No 10 without giving 2 cents about his lack of pace/athletism and play 1 or 2 pacey wingers around him and our striker(s).

825~~~
He's had a very poor start to the season, but selling him in Jan would we an awful move. There's quite a few you can and should sell before him! Besides, what do you think we'll get from his sale - at most 20-25 mil, if we're lucky? That's an outright 12-17m loss within a year FFS!

826~~~
I like Mata, but if Juventus were to offer a swap deal, which would see Mata going to Juve and Pogba coming to us, I'd bite their hand off. Van Gaal eventually does want to play a 433, which means he only wants centre midfielders.

827~~~
Scored 7 in his last 9 games. Scored or assisted 60% of our goals since he joined United. Does not contribute.

Mata: 3 shit games and a goal. Let's sell him.

Rooney: 3 shit games and a goal. Get's nominated at "Player of the month".

828~~~
Please dont tell me Rooney has actually been given POTM? Or just nominated.

829~~~
Just nominated voting still on I think, it's in the hands of the fanbois now. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

830~~~
Best #10 at the club by a country mile (he is a class or two above Rooney for sure) who has to start in that position if that position exists in LVG's plans. If not, who knows?

831~~~
Because on the most part, it is true. However Mata has been productive for us, unlike kagawa.

832~~~
I take it you haven't been to the Rooney thread then?

833~~~
He's not a quality number 10 though, and neither was Kagawa.
If an actual number 10 like Silva came in, he wouldn't suffer like Mata and Kagawa, in my opinion.

834~~~
Where did you find that?

It would be quite silly from Premier League to nominate anyone from United.

835~~~
Mata is a quality no10 and so was Kagawa. Get off it. It's no coincidence both have come here and struggled after having top seasons. Mata has managed to remain productive though.

836~~~
United player of the month.

The way to get the best out of Mata is to play him in his preferred #10 role with plenty of hard workers around him.

---------------Blind----Strootman

--------Januzaj----Mata----Di Maria

--------Rooney / Van Persie / Falcao

838~~~
SAF bought a few that needed fitting into the squad.

839~~~
Juventus can't even afford Mata's boots. Biggest scavengers of Europe.

840~~~
feck selling mata. Even if we move to a system where he isnt a guaranteed starter. we still need world class players to come off the bench, rotate for competition for places, and to cover for injuries. FFS look at bayerns, madrids, and city's benches.

841~~~
But the question will soon become, will Mata be happy here if he's on the bench? Clubs want top quality benches as well, but if you've got players who could fit into plenty of top teams, they're going to want out if you don't play them regularly. Look at how many top drawer players Real Madrid have let go over the years, for example.

842~~~
Ah. None of them deserving really.

843~~~
You simply don't bench a world-class player when he's fit and ready to play.

If you do, he's going to want to leave the club.

844~~~
Top seasons not playing as actual number 10s.
And in Mata's case playing in a poor, gung-ho, tactically poor Chelsea side, whilst being given no defensive responsibilities at all.

I'm not denying he's a very good player, but he's more of a second striker for me.
People seem to think he's a David Silva type player who'll  get his foot on the ball and dictate the game, but he's not.
Like I said, you swap Mata and Silva and Silva doesn't struggle here, whereas Mata doesn't do Silva's job for City half as well.
Di Matteo's 'system' was perfect for him.

Like you said, he's productive in terms of goals and assists though - which is great. But that comes down to his instinctive nature. And scoring and assisting doesn't make a player a number 10 in my opinion.

845~~~
I'm a bit worried about us even considering Juan Mata. He's clearly a world class player so went 37 million on him last year. We need to keep what we have and build for next season.

Fans need to develop an attachment to players aswell, we have lost the likes of Vidic and Evra who "got United" understood the passion and despite their declining quality in recent years, they had a positive relationship with fans throughout.

If we start buying and selling within a short space of time, that will be gone. I don't want to us almost have a revolving door with players coming and going constantly.

I do think it might be RVP that might drop to a squad place in the long term.

846~~~
Reports emanating from Italy and sports daily <i>Tuttosport</i> claim <b>Juventus</b> are lining up a move to sign <b>Manchester United</b> attacker<b>Juan Mata</b> on loan in January with a view to a permanent deal next summer.

This shit again.

847~~~
Then why post it?

848~~~
Because it's only my opinion that it's bullshit, not that Juventus aren't really considering him.

849~~~
It's trivial and also only early September

850~~~
Absolutely absurd to sell Mata, he's is going to be fantastic for us. 
Once he clicks with everyone else in the centre the park he will prove a lot of people wrong

851~~~
Being early September doesn't mean that we're not being linked with new players (like Strootman) for the January window and it's reported by some reliable papers like the Telegraph.

Mata is our player and even though the Juventus link has already been discussed, the stories about Juve's interest seem to be sticking around so I thought it's worth posting again. 

Can't see us getting rid of him though.

852~~~
Not absurd at all. Not only has he performed poorly (like the entire team), but the attacking lineup seems very crowded these days. Why? One of the strikers/attackers has to be Rooney, the other will be Falcao, no way he is benched if fit. That could probably mean RVP and Falcao up front with Rooney as the 10-er. On top of that Di Maria will definetly start as often as he is fit which means that Mata will either play out wide or at CM, which I can NEVER imagine he will. Herrera is also occupying one spot at the middle, and VC Fletcher will most likely play as many games as he can. So either Mata goes or he lives the rest of his United career as a benchwarmer with occational minutes.

 Can easily see him move on to Juve, he would ravish the Italian league. Can't see him having a bright future here though (look above).

853~~~
Since when does being Vice Captain guarantee minutes? That's just daft.

854~~~
I can see him moving on, he came here to play not to sit on the bench and he wants to play in his best position which is as a number 10. Something has to give this season because I don’t think we can keep Rooney, Falcao, RVP, Mata and Januzaj all happy this season (especially if we don’t finish in top 4) and by the end of it or even in January someone is going to want out. 

Having said that he is a good player and if he plays well then he will keep his place, so far this season he has been very poor though and I think Januzaj has more to offer, he offers us more pace, skill and occupies players to create space for others and we are crying out for all of those things at the moment. Mata was a short sighted purchase by Moyes and Woodward he wasn’t needed, he might come good but is he really that good a player that we risk hindering Januzaj’s development or possibly even being forced to sell him.

855~~~
Apparently LVG either wants to hide his feelings for RVP by not naming him VC or he wants an excuse to play Fletch because he rates him. Either way, this isn't really about Fletch being VC is it? And even if it was, let me get you on topic again...
Mata won't play in CM.

856~~~
They're not letting up,saying that United as quoted 30mil euros for him.

857~~~
One bad season and everyone forgets who you really are.

858~~~
Wouldn't shock me if it happened if he struggles to get into this current team with the group of attackers we have. Would be a shame though.

859~~~
My Fantasy Football is saying he's injured. Any news?

860~~~
Pretty sure he is alright. I read somewhere (might have been his blog) that there was nothing to worry about and that he just got some cramp against Burnley.

861~~~
Thanks <a class="username" data-user="83951, @ZDwyr" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83951/">@ZDwyr</a>

862~~~
7 goals in 8 games is a streak that a number 9 would be proud of. How can anybody say he has done nothing since coming here?

863~~~
Kind of amazing how everyone is second guessing LVG on Mata. Why do we assume his place is up for grabs? Seems to me the battle is on for RVP.

864~~~
He shouldnt be going anywhere. We are lucky to have him and we will miss him if he leaves. He is a wonderful little player and one of the world's best #10s. Rooney is a good #10 but Mata is better.

865~~~
he hasn't had any bad seasons in the PL.

866~~~
Seems to me he's the Wes Schneider we never signed. Why would LVG ship him out <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>?

867~~~
Selling Mata. You guys are insane...

868~~~
Did Sneijder sign for a club team LVG managed or was he just the best player available to him for the national team? I honestly dont see Mata as a LVG signing at all and I think he'll find game time restricted as the club moves forwards with this new philosphy. I may be wrong but he looks the most likely casualty to me....Rooney the most obvious..Mata the most likely!

869~~~
Yes you're right, LVG never signed Wes. I'm just saying I think LVG will value Mata's technical ability, just like he valued Wes S. I'm not sure Mata is the most likely to miss out. The press are pushing that idea but lets see.

870~~~
Mata's record is very good and is suffering from having no movement in front of him. As soon as we move away from the 352 to either a 41212 with Falcao or a 433, he will be better. 

Rooney and RVP together up top do not offer enough pace if we aren't using wingers. Falcao, at least, makes some very good runs.

871~~~
If Juve is interested in Mata, this might be one of the rare cases where a direct swap (Mata-Vidal) might actually make sense. The press love talking about those! I highly doubt it'll happen, but Mata left Chelsea because he was marginalised, so <b>if</b> LvG is going to play Rooney in his role you never know.

872~~~
Rooney for Vidal seems like a more fair swap for me.

873~~~
He had a poor season so we should sell him? Guess what , the whole team had a poor season. I'm sure LVG will find a way how to use him. Selling him would be absurd.

874~~~
13/14 was poor for him, obviously.

875~~~
Selling Mata so Rooney can play as a 10 with Falcao and RvP. Man United fans have sunken to a new low.

876~~~
True story. Whats next? SMH

877~~~
Our results with Mata in the team show absolutely no improvement from the awful set of results prior to his arrival. In the PL: Before W11 D4 L7. Since W8 D3 L5 (games Mata started W6 D3 L5) + this season W0 D2 L1. Indeed our goals scored when Mata starts in the PL is an alarming 23 in 17 matches. Therefore it would be worth exploring other options. Personally I think Januzaj offers far more creativity than Mata. The idea of Rooney as a creative player is somewhat alarming.

Mata's best hope was that the promising axis with Kagawa became a key element of the team. That or new wide players with superior movement.

878~~~
So he's the problem although he was probably our best performer since he joined? Ok then.

879~~~
Mata has started every game for LVG except for the cup game, and Rooney hasnt even been tried at the number 10 role has he? 

YOu people are crazy if you think we will sell him any time soon.

880~~~
He just needs a few good performances to pick his confidence up and the teams/supporters in his ability to play in our system

Trouble is competition is now high! May help him more though with more quality around him

881~~~
Still the best player in the squad. Play a combination of Di Maria, Januzaj, Rooney and Falcao either side or in front of him and we'll be laughing. It just requires a set of bollocks and dropping the right players, namely Van Persie.

882~~~
That would be Di Maria quite comfortably.

883~~~
Di Maria is coming off the back of an exceptional season, and you're only as good as your last game, but I think Mata is the better footballer. If this debate was to be had coming off the back of 12/13, then Mata was by a fair distance the higher rated player.

I'll quickly add, though, that Di Maria is probably a better fit for a team being built from scratch. His dynamism is great.

884~~~
He just isnt or at least never showed it so far

885~~~
Shown it where? He has in the Premier League, certainly. There is an argument to indicate that he has, at least, likewise Van Persie prior to last season. 

As for United, he's been the best outfield player at the club since February. It doesn't count for much I'm aware, but true nonetheless.

886~~~
It always comes down to personal opinion if talking about the best player - however looking at our actual squad most of us would agree that di Maria is our best player who was able to shine despite playing beside Messi, Ronaldo or Bale which makes him part of that exclusive group.
Mata is a great player if used in the correct way (and given he has the right players beside him) - however I am afraid he will be the one suffering from the summer transfers.
I would prefer playing him and rotate (only play 2 out of) Rooney/RvP/Falcao.

887~~~
It does. Right now Di Maria is the man in form, but Mata himself is evidence that these things can change very quickly. One year ago today the argument would have been in Mata's favour. Di Maria's position at Madrid was looking uneasy and Mata had just come off a sensational season at Chelsea. Things changed, Mata was a victim of Mourinho's changes and Ancelotti came across a formation that suited Di Maria down to the ground. 

I don't know if he will be the one to suffer. In truth, neither do you. He could fall by the wayside but I think that would be wrong. That would be the third good player between the 23-27 age bracket we'd have cast aside in a matter of months, in favour of stroking the egos of near 30 year olds that have all sorts of question marks surrounding their fitness and form. 

Like you say, we should be playing two - or three, I think is possible - of Mata, Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao. For me, Van Persie should be the first fall guy. The oldest, the least dynamic and the most likely to succumb to injury. I'm worried this won't be the case.

888~~~
Not for United and not for some time at Chelsea. I wouldnt see him as our best player. ADM, RVP, Rooney, DDG are better players for me (Falcao might be as well).

And he was by no means the best outfield player at United since February. Have you watched the last 3 games? He was very poor and couldnt complain if he gets benched

889~~~
"Some time at Chelsea" meaning the few months before his move when Mourinho decided to drop him in what the whole of England seen as a silly move? Mourinho will be vindicated, he makes big decisions that no other coach in football has the nackers to make, it's what makes him the best. But let's not pretend as if Mata's form was anything to do with that decision. He just wasn't fancied for the kind of team Mourinho wanted to build. 

I've covered more Mata-related thoughts above, read them. As for your final point, I didn't realise that 3 games in a make shift team extends to a period of 6 months. Either way, both Rooney and Van Persie have been shite too.

If Mata wasn't our best outfield player during the latter half of the season then who was? He was scoring goals most weeks, making them, and put in some good performances, particularly when linking up with Kagawa.

890~~~
Mata isn't the best player in the squad, no chance. People like to make statements like, 'he needs runners', or 'the players aren't on his wavelength', or 'look how good he was at Chelsea' but it doesn't matter. The fact is, the player who benefits who really does benefit most from the 3-5-2 is Juan Mata. Yet he shows no sign of making good of this fact, he has been absolutely passive and his passing in has been sloppy as hell. He's tactically inflexible and beside from his stats that people push out, has been average since joining.

891~~~
It's also a question of context - Mata stood out for Chelsea but the Chelsea side of those two seasons was probably the worse of the Abramovich era (and, yes, I know they won the CL, somehow). They failed to mount any kind of title challenge. Likewise, he was playing for a team of relative also rans in Spain. So we still don't know if Mata can be a key component of a team with ambitions to win the title. I'd say, based on both club and international record, Di Maria is the more proven performer at elite level.

892~~~
I would not call Mata a "victim". Mourinho has just a very straight vision of how to play football in the most effective way and Mata is a player who can be canceled out easier by the opposition than other more dynamic players.
Pirlo is similar in that way although he is playing much deeper and therefore has a bit more time for his passes.

Could Mata btw not become a great midfield maestro similar to Pirlo?

893~~~
For me he was not a star performer at United and what he did at Chelsea 2 years ago is not relevant for United right now. Once he's our best performer over a longer period, then we can consider him our best player. As things stand, he isnt

894~~~
That's true. I think Chelsea in general, though, were going through a tumultuous time on a number of levels, much of which came as a result of sacking a perfectly good manager in Ancelotti and Roman's mad pursuit of a Barcelona-lite brand of football. Then there was the Villas-Boas experiment. I think Mata, for good or bad, was secondary to most of that. Individually he was excellent for two seasons and Chelsea still won silverware.

I must stress that I'm not even going to massively disagree with the arguments stating Di Maria is the better player. Infact, I've even agreed that on today's basis he currently is. I just think that football is an ever-changing game and that if we can get more of the Mata we seen at Chelsea then I think that's the best player in the squad. I think he can be an incredible influence towards future success. Like I said, last season this will have made for a very different conversation.

The nagging reality right now is that I wouldn't be surprised if we're having similar conversations in the Di Maria and Falcao threads come the end of the season. "Well player X doesn't do this or that," and the likes. And then that player will be defended just like I'm doing now. And then somebody will pop up and say, "well, look, he was brilliant at Madrid" only to get shot down. It irritates me that obviously good players are not succeeding as they should at this club, and it will get to the point when we must look at the systems in place. Van Gaal has a job on his hands here, and I'm hoping he gets it right. If Mata is shifted out then fair enough, but it must be in the name of balance.

895~~~
He had the second half of last year in a god awful team & 3 games this year so it's a bit harsh to start slating him. The 3-5-2 gets him in the team but by no means does it suit him as he's played his best football in 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3. He hasn't set the world on fire but none of our players have in the past 18 months. 
His link up play with Herrera in pre-season was very encouraging & i'd be very surprised if he doesn't kick on once our team is more settled & he has better players around him. If he doesn't play better in a good team then we can start digging him out.

896~~~
Definitely agree with this.

He scored lots and assisted lots, but it was poor Chelsea Team:
They didn't have a proper system, they were gung-ho, they were ridiculously open due to him (and others) being given no defensive responsibility. They didn't play a possession game or dominate teams, or show any control.
He shone in a team that played from back to front quickly (conceding lots of goals, and losing too many games in the process), and where he had space to run into.
He also didn't really dictate their play, and even if one believes that he <i>did </i>- it was hardly great play.

For a supposed 'no. 10' I've yet to see Mata actually dictate or run anything worthwhile in his years here, and also have doubts that you can build a successful team around Mata, or even make him a key part.

897~~~
I don't think so. His scoring rate for us was very good, despite the dinosaur manager.

898~~~
Certainly don't think he's the best player in the squad. I'd say De Gea and Di Maria are both better than him.

899~~~
Cant really compare a GK to an outfield player. Comparing with Di Maria yes but not with De Gea.

900~~~
Yeah I know, tough comparison. I still think De Gea is better in his respective position than Mata is in his but the comparison is tough.

901~~~
Agree with these sentiments. Purely as a player perspective Mata is better. The Di Maria of a few years ago wasn't even comparable to Mata at that time. So far he really hasn't found his rhythm at United but you can only hide quality for so long. He'll be back at his best soon I believe.

902~~~
he's not being sold. absolutely no chance.

903~~~
If United have a season or half a season like the last, Di Maria will also start seeming like a not so effective player to everyone. 
We have started doubting talents of players like Rooney and Van Persie, who have played wonderfully and won us trophies. Underestimating Mata after the way our team has been playing is expected. It is stupid but expected.
Mata is class. 
Di Maria and Mata both have to start every game for us in the suitable positions. Both are class and both have unique qualities.

904~~~
If we're playing a X-X-1-2 type formation then there is no logical reason for Mata not being a first choice player and we will be a poorer team for leaving him on the bench.

905~~~
I think its pretty inevitable that Di Maria will take up that "1" role for himself for 80% of our games. Di Maria as one of the CMs wont work in most matches when he's just accompanied by 1 other CM.

906~~~
Think RVP Rooney Falcao & DDG all have a case to argue for this also! What a start of a great squad/team we are building!

907~~~
Starts today. Really happy for the guy. A lot of talk about it looking like he'll be out of here soon but I've got the feeling LvG really likes him. Wouldn't be surprised if he starts most games for United this season with one of Rooney/RvP/Falcao dropping down to the subs' bench.

908~~~
Agreed, pleased to see him in there.

909~~~
He is playing all the time since the league has started, and I think he played the most on tour from all our players, I think it's quite obvious van Gaal likes him, I can't understand why people think otherwise.

910~~~
We have Falcao and van Gaal's mate up front, Rooney has the armband which makes him tough to drop. So it's easy to draw a conclusion that Rooney could force Mata out. I agree that van Gaal likes him but I also see how many think Mata could miss out a fair bit.

911~~~
Agreed. I think we can keep everyone happy providing we have Champions League football back next season. Otherwise it will prove difficult

912~~~
I understand why he could drop him, but I don't think it's because he doesn't like him. Also, I highly doubt he would bring Falcao if he wasn't thinking of dropping Rooney or van Persie at times.

913~~~
Had a good half.

914~~~
Looks the odd man out I'm afraid <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Definitely not playing bad, but his lack of urge makes him the player any manager would want to to substitute for if things aren't going well.

915~~~
These 'odd man out' things should really be put to rest for at least some longer period of time.

916~~~

917~~~
Such an intelligent player, thought he was very good today.

918~~~
Superb today, picking my man of the match is a tough one.

I don't think he has any worries about his future here.

919~~~
Team dropped a gear when he went off.

920~~~
Unbelievable.

921~~~
Brilliant today, but I'd like him to step it up against the better teams now. Di Maria's pace has really helped him. He's a final third number 10.

922~~~
Twice the player when things happen around him and he doesn't have to waste his time coming deep for the ball. His movement today was amazing, created so much space for the rest of 'em.

923~~~
He was excellent, I am really interested to see how much he covered, he was all over the pitch.

924~~~
They said he won't fit in this team. He fits in it a lot better than the old one!

925~~~
Once Falcao is fit and firing then it becomes a choice between Mata and RvP I think. Based on current form and the balance of the team it should be Mata who wins that battle. Rooney is nowhere near as good in that role behind the strikers.

926~~~
With better movement next to him he was always going to play better.

927~~~
Very good performance. He and Di Maria will link up very well. Hopefully LVG continues playing him in the #10 role.

928~~~
Definitely. He links up a lot better with midfield than Rooney does. Rooney has a striker's instincts, Mata a midfielder's and it makes a huge difference. Rooney drops in and turns looking to go forward, Mata drops in and will fill spaces left by Di Maria and Herrera giving us more fluidity in the middle. As a pure #10 Mata's better than anyone else we have.

929~~~
Interpreter too, his abilities know no bounds.

930~~~
Thought it was his best game for us.

931~~~
More movement around him and he looked class again...who would have thought!

932~~~
It was pretty glaring.  A lot of people pointed it out in the matchday thread.  You could see Herrera and Di Maria dropping back to maintain the diamond and the camera following the action into our half while Rooney stood still around the center circle, the diamond getting stretched and stretched and stretched until eventually Rooney exited stage left.

933~~~
Oh don't get me wrong, I want him to succeed here as much as any player, in fact more than a few. But, he'll be the most subject to squad rotation I fear. Not because he's any lesser than those around him, except for the pace and urge that our new signings have plenty in them.

934~~~
A lot better today.

935~~~
Seriously how is it possible not to love this guy? He even acts as Di Maria's translator!

936~~~
Very good today. He's not just staying high up the pitch but was involved throughout.

937~~~
When Di Maria said thank you (in English) at the end and Mata translated it and said "he just said thank you" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Quality.

938~~~
That was great<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

939~~~
When Rooney dropped in deeper, he reminded me why he shouldn't be playing there. Mata brings so much more to the team in that postion.

940~~~
He's obviously been getting a lot of criticism lately along with doubt over his future here, but he was a lot better today. He's the type of player who I think will benefit a lot if those around him are playing good football.

941~~~
If we insist with this midfield diamond i think he should play at the top of it, was great today and seemed to be everywhere.

942~~~
His future has been talked about being in doubt based on very little evidence. He's started every game under LVG.

943~~~
True, although he hadn't been particularly great thus far this season and was coming in for criticism. Had he not improved, his place in the team may have been at risk. He was a lot better today though, which is a positive.

944~~~
The team suffered when he went off and Rooney dropped into his role so it's safe to say if we continue with this diamond he's probably safe in this starting team.

945~~~
No surprises here, he thrives on movement. If we play with movement, Mata will be fantastic as a number ten.

946~~~
Glad he played well today.

947~~~
8 goals in 10 games. We have been crying out for goals from midfield and he's been delivering them.

948~~~
He's still the best number 10 at the club and you can see that LvG appreciates that very much.

949~~~
He is now playing with quality players, it's inevitable he is going to look better. Finally he is playing with players on his wavelength.

950~~~
Fair enough, QPR were shite, but that was masterclass from Juan. I saw a lot of people wrote him off when we brought Falcao aboard, but Mata is comfortably our best #10.

Hes also such a likable character, must have a great impact in the dressing room as well

951~~~
We'd be crazy to sell him he's class.

952~~~
Very good and needed performance. Hope we start him and two strikers next game like today and not Rooney, RvP and Falcao all at once.

953~~~
Too slow. Terrible player, isn't he?

954~~~
There's no way LvG would sell him I think.

955~~~
He actually has this really great ability of popping up in the box at the right time and is a really accomplished finisher. As we saw with his goal today and against Sunderland.

From deeper positions he can easily get 15 goals a season which is worth its weight in gold.

956~~~
In a decently tuned team he's worth 20+ total of goals and assists.

957~~~
His best moment today was when he was sat on the bench and the camera was right on him and he broke out a smile so warm it'd make Vinny Jones' heart melt.

958~~~
I think we will get there before long and the noticeable drop, when he exited, attests to how good he was. That's the benefit of having players like Di Maria around, he draws the opponent's attention to him and allows others to have enough space and time. So far Van Persie looks like he is losing the battle of who makes way for Falcao.

959~~~
Mata's 7th goal in his last 9 league starts for Manchester United and some wanted him gone.

960~~~
He reached nearly twice that number in his last full season at Chelsea.

961~~~
Yea I guessed he did but wasn't sure. Anyways, if his total contribution is 20/25+ for us this season, I'd be ecstatic!

962~~~
Excellent game from Mata today. Showed how much of a difference it makes when you have players in front who give you the option to play the forward pass. That extra man in midfield instead of defense is going to be the making of our season. It's going to be battle for the front 3 position. RvP missed that chance from Di Maria, but it was a hard chance to take, but he had a very good game overall. Rooney started slow, but he was buzzing after 20 minutes. Falcao came on and looked very good in his cameo, would have put away that chance he had if he had a few more games under his belt.

963~~~
We instantly dropped 2 levels when he came off. He can and will still improve when everyone has a better understanding of their roles and he as well about his, but at least today he had other players around him who have heard of that strange thing aka "pass and move". 
Amazing how every pundit on the BBC page had him starting on the bench despite no evidence at all that LvG might not prefer him. In fact he has started every pre season game and league game this season under LvG.
He isn't going anywhere. Why the hell would we get rid of our only real just 26 year old No 10 with a great goal scoring and assists record over the last 5 years as well as an excellent fitness record? 
Some ppl ...

964~~~
Having Herrera and Di Maria either side of him and Blind holding allowed him to show his qualities today, took his goal really well too.

965~~~
I was wrong, it's 8 goals in his last 10 for us and also 4 assists I think.

966~~~
Yeah, that was great, deserves a gif. <a class="username" data-user="32240, @Olly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/32240/">@Olly</a> <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>  where are you guys?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/matalgjq8.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/matalgjq8.gif"/>

968~~~
We are getting regular goals from midfield for the first time in years.

969~~~
Hold me<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

970~~~
To be fair, when Mata came off Rafa came off too. Mata played beautifully today and his contribution to the team was there for all to see. Just don't underestimate what Rafael contributed. Taking them both off at the same time was extremely detrimental to the way United played. Falcao looked ok, but Rooney was awful as a 10. As for Valencia, well the less said the better. Such a shame. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Mata obviously has such an influence in the dressing room and especially with the new Spanish speaking contingent. He must be an integral part of the team. Surely LvG can see this? Let's hope the rumours were just journos grasping at straws. I'm still laughing at everyone saying he and Daley Blind are slow. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

971~~~
Was one of our best players said it when there was threads criticizing him. He benefits from players making runs and interchanging with him he is a clever player and as I said he will be one of our best players come end of the season.

972~~~
People were doubting him way too soon. When people are running around him and he gets the ball in the right positions, he's devastating and truly world-class.

973~~~
He was the difference in the middle. Maybe we took the foot off the pedal, but after he came off we were not that incisive. Adds a touch of brilliance to the team!

974~~~
Played like he has had a rocket put up him, I've not seen him get about the park like he did day since he signed.

975~~~
Valencia once did amaze me with his dribbling when he did something different first time in his career probably just to stumble on the ball in his next move.

976~~~
Mata is the type of player that looks shit when those around him look shit and looks really good when those around him play well. He's the kind of player that provides the finishing touch to a good move that opens up the enemy defense or scores a goal and right now he's mostly scoring goals. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Juan Mata he scores goals!

977~~~
With corners and free-kicks. But it looks that Rooney and Di Maria will be executing them.

978~~~
i just loved that piece of skill he performed in the f
so basically like Shinji

979~~~
Very similar players but Mata is a few levels above in terms of talent hence the decision of keeping Mata and selling Shinji.

980~~~
we could never sell Mata after half a season, Shinji was unhappy and the rumours with Dortmund started months earlier, not just the rumoured swap deals with Reus or Hummels. It was easier to sell him than Mata, lets be honest. Although i agree that Mata is better, but not a few levels better.

981~~~
So pleased to see him score.

982~~~
Me too. A goal for RVP and Falcao would have made it perfect. 

And the ref fell over!

983~~~
At least my opinion comes from Mata having so much more to his game including set pieces with his wonderful left foot, shots from outside the box and the variety of goals he scores. His range of passing and balance are also better than Kagawa's. You can compare Mata's best season at Chelsea and Kagawa's last season at Dortmund. Mata was just unstoppable during that season with 18 goals and 25 assists during the 2012/2013 campaign. He could even surpass that if he keeps his current form throughout the season.

984~~~
He's productivity is still more than Shinji and talent in almost every area. 

(8 goals in last 10 games now with plenty assists too despite the team playing not well)

985~~~
Kagawas balance is fantastic too. On the rest i agree, although the Kagawa this season will be a different one. He will score plenty of goals too. Just saying that they are not miles apart, after this season we should reevaluate Kagawa again.
He plays every game, Kagawa score too yesterday after playing in his favourite position from the beginning. 

I dont want to start another Mata/Kagawa discussion, but Kagawa will score plenty of goals this season too.

986~~~
In the German league in Dortmund's system and style of play yeah. Wasn't working for him at United or the BPL though.

987~~~
he wouldnt look out of place in this team right now against QPR.

988~~~
Oh my.

989~~~
Would like to see his running statistics. Seemed to be absolutely everywhere during the first half. Good performance from him I thought. Hope he holds onto his position, Rooney in there doesn't fill me with confidence.

990~~~
Has anyone ever been as maligned as a flop with such an exemplary goals/assists return? He's been involved in something like half of all our goals since he signed. I wish our other flops were as floppish as him. I'd be happy with a consistent string of flop signings of this caliber in the future too.

991~~~
He's got a lot more in his locker than Shinji and is a proven PL performer unlike him which is a big difference. For one, he has great goal scoring instincts for a midfielder, even in that delightful pass that Di maria played for RvP you could see Mata was ready for the rebound after making a well timed run. It's a big thing to have that, it gives the defenders another serious threat in front of goal to think of, no coach will ignore a player who has 8 in last 10 games when giving instructions to his defenders on who to be careful of, and that gives more freedom to our actual goal scorers. Basically the merits of having a goal threat from midfield.

Really liked him today, finally he gets the support that would bring the best out of him. Here's hoping he soon reaches the same levels that made him one of the best players in the league a couple of seasons back.

992~~~
Yup, never understood it either. How does a player that can present those figures gets criticized and called a coward? <i>Especially </i>when the whole team is playing horrendous with a handful of players that weren't fit to lace his boots? I thought it was pretty obvious that the problem wasn't him? I'll put it down to frustration I guess, seeing as I'll probably hound out Ronaldo with a pitchfork myself if we don't start winning soon!

993~~~
Ok, that's it, decision made. I was thinking of gettin Januzaj on the back of my shirt but was tempted by Di Maria's performance but that smile has done it. He just knows it.

994~~~
Well said. Mata is not slow, maybe his way of play pass and move give the impression that he is slow but his acceleration is quite impressive if you look him closely. He is simillar to Van Persie and even Rooney in that aspect. They can run fast but they do it only when it is needed. Blind can move around very well to, maybe not one of the fastest players but still fast enough to oversprint many players and fast enough to do his job.

995~~~
We lost something when he was subbed off. I still think Van Persie who had a poor game and was on a yellow card should've made way instead.

996~~~
I was criticizing him earlier for the first few games, and he like everyone else deserved it really. Was brilliant today, and he can still offer even more. He's got great movement though and you can always count on him to pop up in the right position to grab a goal or an assist. Hopefully now that he is surrounded by other world class players, he can kick on and show how good he is and have a great season in the hole for us.

997~~~
The only reason I watch United.

998~~~
Is there any fan of any club who doesn't like this guy?

999~~~
Would have him in the squad before RVP at this moment. Thought he was excellent today. Game slowed down when him and Rafael came off.

1000~~~
Good game. I think the axis Blind-Herrera-di Maria-Mata-Rooney worked quite well and looked balanced so judging only on yesterday`s game it might be between RvP and Falcao.
Of course we have a special situation with none of them injured - however I hope Mata can build on that performance and he got some confidence.
Nice finishing for the goal as well.

1001~~~
So we should sell him, aye?

1002~~~
I love Mata, he's very quickly become my favourite player. I'd be gutted if we sold him, Mad Winger Kagawa style gutted.

He gives us something we've lacked for about 10 years which is goals from midfield, he's a fantastic finisher. If he is a regular starter this season I reckon he'll be getting at least 15 goals this season.

1003~~~
People are overstating his performance imo. Not that he was bad but the rest of the frontline was better even RVP who's been getting some (undeserved) stick. RVP held the ball up very well and Rooney, Herrera and Di Maria linked very well with each other. I expect more from him as a creative number 10.

1004~~~
Didn't you know goals are the be all and end all in any argument. I'm not saying Mata wasn't good, but the way I see it is, he played not much different to recent games, only difference is that he had better players around him who got the ball into Mata's feet quicker so he was able to express himself more.

1005~~~
.... which is a pretty big difference, and so the fact that Mata could express himself more made him play much better in recent games... right?

He also provided an excellent link between midfield and attack - and occupied vital spaces on the field when we didn't have the ball. He could drift around and help double-up on people which helped us win the ball back much quicker than we have done in recent weeks. He covered an immense amount of ground, and moved the ball very well... in fact, he was probably the player who moved the ball out of his feet the quickest, which contributed to the pace of play that we all enjoyed.

1006~~~
That is the point that will make mata better, he needs players around him who are quicker and can carry the ball, it opens the space for him to do his magic. 

Many say how poor mata has been this season, well look at the team selections before yesterday's game, you had cleverly fletcher Valencia and young providing the width and control of the midfield, to blind Herrera and di Maria has your width and control of the midfield, See the difference? 

If the team is one paced, and a midfield so poor it can't put into words how bad they were, there is only so much mata could do. He needs the players around him also

1007~~~
Yes, which makes the claims that he should be dropped sound rather daft now, considering he is our best number 10 and just needs better players around him. The difference when he went off was telling too. I love watching Mata play, and think people have been harsh on him.

1008~~~
The media clamour for him to be dropped was pure bullying based on name as far as I'm concerned. He appeared to be the softed target of all our big attacking names to drop.

Not trying to get after Rooney, who was very good yesterday, but both of them showed in their performance that Rooney is simply incapable of replicating what Maa offers in the 10. He just doesn't have that silk. The moment where Mata took the ball on the edge of the box in the first half and we almost won a penalty from Cilnt Hill - that couldn't be done by Wayne. He was surrounded, his touch was outstanding under pressure. Both should stay in their respective roles.

1009~~~
He adds something to the team. We need him to be there.

1010~~~
Spot on! 

Yeah I said the same earlier in the thread. Definitely lost directness, pace and shape when Rafael AND Mata came off at the same time. I think LvG subbed Mata because he wanted to try Rooney as a 10. Hopefully he saw enough to know that although Rooney can play there, it's definitely not his best position, and Mata really is a class above as a 10. Although maybe he wanted RvP to get another yellow so he wouldn't have a difficult decision to make in the next match <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1011~~~
Spot on. He gets a lot of unfair criticism on here and in the media because he would be the easy player to drop to fit in the new signings. 

He has scored 8 goals in 10 games     That's great. Very impressive when you consider how poor we have been playing. If Rooney, Falcao or RVP had that scoring record in the past 10 games we would be sitting here saying they can't be dropped due to their form... But when it's Mata there seems to be a large group of people suggesting he should get dropped.

1012~~~
He contributes a goal or assist every game, he's class.

1013~~~
Rooney has 8 goals in his last 11 United games. Just saying is all.

Anyway, said in another thread on Saturday that people seem to be forgetting just how highly rated Mata was in 2011/12, and in 2012/13 especially. It wasn't seen as an outlandish argument to say that <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/juan-mata.344796/page-10">he was as good as or even better than</a> Silva.

Then Mourinho didn't fancy him, and so he joined a struggling United side, and his star waned a bit. Even among United fans. Part of that, I reckon, is down to Fergie's 'cow' argument i.e. that someone elses cow always seems to be better than your own, even if it's not necessarily so. I guess you could also call it 'Coveting Thy Neighbour's Ox'. Umm . . . where I am going with this again?

Oh yeah. Mata is f*cking brilliant, and we're lucky to have him.

1014~~~
All you have to do is look at Ozil, who Arsenal payed around 10 million more for and you'll see how ridiculous the criticism is. He was never going to boss every game in the static United side we've seen over the past 12 months.  He's still made golden contributions though. That's what top players do. Now that we're looking like a unit again, he'll thrive in overall play and continue to score and assist.

1015~~~
Pretty much. Yep, he's a 'soft target', seeing as his 'brand' seems to have dipped a bit by him being discarded by Chelsea. It always happens in football though. It was always going to be Di Maria who made way at Real for James, and while Welbeck is currently everyone's favourite in England, it will take significantly less poor games for him to be dropped than it will for Rooney or Sterling.

Mata has been as good as any in the league over the past 24 months or so. He has to justify his performances more than some others because his brand isn't considered as big in my opinion.

1016~~~
Please send him to:

Manchester United
Sir Matt Busby Way
Old Trafford
Manchester
M16 0RA

Cheers in advance!

1017~~~
Good post.

1018~~~
Yep he was one of Chelsea's best players. I'm pretty sure we will see the best if Juan Mata now that we have a good midfield behind him. I thought he was very good in the number 10. role yesterday. 

Yep spot on. I think van Gaal rates him highly, he has started every game, which is positive for us because he is our best number 10 and a fantastic player.

1019~~~
I see Ollie Holt is making a bit of a fool of himself on twitter, comparing Mata's assists for Chelsea to his 4 so far for United, apparently not realising it works out as a very similar assist to game ratio. Not to mention his superior goals to game ratio for us too. Clown!

1020~~~
I think it was also so that RVP could get a full 90 mins because he didnt get a proper pre season.

1021~~~
Couldn't believe it when I read it. He has rightly been called out by several journalists.

1022~~~
With such dangerous players around him he has the space to do his thing, defenses can't key on him.

When he has that bit of time and space he's great, definitely better than Rooney playing behind the striker(s).

I'm curious who will back him up, hoping it's Januzaj or Lingard.

1023~~~
I thought he played well yesterday. Kept it simple in possession but took up intelligent positions and kept the ball ticking. He also gets himself in the box, its been a long time since we had a goal scoring midfielder.

1024~~~
Holt's been on one since he claimed we lost our soul by selling Welbeck, he seems to have lost all perspective when it comes to United. I understood the journalists speculating about Mata before the QPR game, but why go there after Mata played so well yesterday? Strange...

1025~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1026~~~
Great talent, can't see how anyone could rather Rooney as a 10.

1027~~~
He's probably more of a goalscorer than a creator, he's Lampard like.

1028~~~
He wasn't for Chelsea, he got about 30 assists over the 3 seasons there. I'd imagine he'll improve for us in that regard.

1029~~~
He's almost a false nine for us, but yeah, he was assist king for Chelsea.

1030~~~
He has still yet to turn up in a big game for us and often has been anonymous in most big games so i'll hold off with lavishing him with praise for his QPR performance for now. He has always looked top class against weaker teams but seems to lack pace and hunger when the pressure is on....I really would love if he can kick on and eventually become a big influence in big games though...The jury is still out

1031~~~
Nah, he's contributed more than anyone the past nine months.

1032~~~
I can understand that his performances might not have been as stellar as expected, but at the end of the day the actual purpose of football is to create and score goals. No one has done that more effectively than him since he got here. Ignoring that seems like over thinking it. It's like saying the jury's still out on Neil Armstrong 'cos he just sat there during the launch. Dude got to the moon. That was point.

1033~~~
It was beautiful!

1034~~~
I really hope Mata does not end up as the 'odd man out' after the recent spending frenzy

He is a fantastic player and we have definitely not seen the best of him yet

1035~~~
His quality looks like and really should prove enough to keep him in the team.

1036~~~
At the risk of letting my man love go too far, I was just watching the game again and his goal, whilst simple, it really was such a clever finish. Got the ball out of his feet, he knows the keeper is going to make himself big and make Mata choose a side and to just lift it perfectly over him was great to watch.

1037~~~
Remember the preseason clip of LvG telling players to look up and wait for the keeper to make his move because finishing? Probably has something to do with Mata's smart finish.

1038~~~
It looked like Mata was playing centrally and Rooney&RVP were moving to the side of the pitch. His positioning is very good around the box but I think RVP should be staying central in that formation. The same goes for Falcao.

1039~~~
His goal/game in the last 10 games is exceptional. Really is an excellent little poacher. Would like to see a bit more of the creativity he's supposed to be bringing to the team but can't knock his goal threat.

1040~~~
I think the creativity will come as he finally gets to play with players on his level. The passing of Blind, Herrera and even Rojo and the runs and movement of Falcao will make sure the player who comes straight from the Xavi/Iniesta mould will have a great season at United. I am wholly convinced of this. I'll be very disappointed if we let him go.

1041~~~
He can do a lot more on the creative side of things, but goals are the most valuable thing in the entire game. I'd rather he continued banging in goals at the rate he is than assist every game. Plus, we've been missing goals from midfield severely for years now.

1042~~~
Well that's just mental. You'd rather he continues at his rate of scoring 0.42 goals per game than assist 1 goal per game.

1043~~~
Pretty sure he's talking about the fact he's scored 8 in his last ten games.

1044~~~
Still, 1 assist per game > 0.8 goals per game.

1045~~~
No gif of that bit of skill he did to try to get into the box?

1046~~~
I think a lot of people want him to get direct assists, but he is involved in a lot of our build up and he's good at that initial pass that sets up the start of a move. Plus he creates so much space for our strikers, he drifts all over the place in that pocket.

1047~~~
I still do not get these rumours of swapping mata for strootman, yea strootman is a good player, but I do not see replacing mata with strootman I see has an upgrade. Get mata taking our freekicks in beckham like area's, that is another weapon to have in our ranks

1048~~~
I don't get the talk of selling mata either, he's quality and there's players I'd see the back of before mata, but where we to sell would he really go for 20m, almost half his purchase price, come on!!

1049~~~
The media will always try to stir up some shit even when the evidence suggests otherwise. I think he is showing, in a very good way but quietly, an important aspect of his game by being very productive even when he hasn't looked near his best for most parts of his time here. I don't think that Van Gaal would be so stupid as to sell a twenty six year old AM to accommodate three aging strikers. He will find himself on the bench, when the coach deems it necessary just like any other player, but indications are that Van Gaal rates him highly.

1050~~~
I'd rather have player who'd score 40 goals in 50 games, than has 50 assists.

1051~~~
One provided 40 goals, other 50, it's illogical to want more the former one.

1052~~~
It is truly bonkers.

1057~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Wow

1058~~~
It's actually not all that clear cut. For example, you might have an absolutely fantastic striker (Messi or Ronaldo) who inflates the assists record of all those players around him (I'm looking at you, Mr Ozil) At the end of the day, goals scored is the most rudimentary statistic in football. Everything else is slightly more likely to be deceptive.

1059~~~
Assists and goals produce the same end result so why would one prefer one of number in comparison to the other ? Makes no sense to me.

1060~~~
Yet without the assister, Ronaldo and Messi would still not have got those goals. An assist whoever the pass is to and whatever the situation is always equates to a goal and therefore is as valuable as a goal. You can look at Ozil all you like, he was the 3rd highest assister in the Premier League last season.

1061~~~
They're equivalent in their value to the team but if you're judging individual players someone with x amount of goals might be valued more highly than someone with x amount of assists.

Just look at Ashley Young's stats for Villa if you want to see how misleading assists can be. They scored almost all their goals from set pieces and he took all their set pieces. As we've seen that doesn't translate so well to a team that expects their wingers to have a bit more to their game.

1062~~~
You could say similar about players who take penalties though, no?

I think it's dependent on the player, really. I'm less worried about goals with a player like Di Maria and more interested in assists, because that's what we'll be reliant on. Likewise I'm more interested in goals from RvP and Falcao.

1063~~~
In the end what matters the most for me is what the single person can bring to the team, whether it's goals or assists. A player can rack up  a big scoring tally while taking many penalty kicks.

1064~~~
Yep.  Diego Costa with 40 goals will be more valuable than Mata with 50 assists. I'd prefer we have a front three of Rooney, Falcao, Mata that score 30, 30, and 40 goals , than have 30 and 30 goals, and 50 assists respectively.

But of course, players performance as a whole is more important.

1065~~~
Ignore the stats. Rooney's goal at the weekend would not have happened had Mata not linked up so well with Herrera in the middle of the park. Their technique, ability to create space and all round game produced that goal. Mata hasn't got an assist or goal ticked alongside his name for that move, but his one-two with Herrera was a massive part of that goal. That's what counts.

1066~~~
Exactly. I always cite a goal like the one below as an example of how you can be a huge part in creating a goal yet not actually get an assist. Rooney does some great work to set up Scholes to cross. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffzyRxSk33U?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1067~~~
Phrase it like that, of course. One gives you guaranteed 100 goals, other 60.

1068~~~
Yep. It's a no brainer.

1069~~~
Mata's performances for Man Utd could see him recalled to the Spanish side if Del Bosque still thinks he needs a false #9.

Its interesting that Van Gaal has his forwards split and go either side of Mata when we don't have the ball, effectively Mata plays centre forward when we defend. When we have the ball this changes and Mata drops off, bolstering midfield and allowing us to gain a numerical advantage in the middle third. If you count pre-season, more than once the role Mata's playing has had a huge impact. The third goal against QPR was a great example. In the build up to that goal Di Maria, Herrera and Mata are all in the inside left channel, which created the angles that allowed us to move the ball rapidly around QPR and up to Rooney. Of course, Herrera still had to be gifted enough at one touch passing, and quick enough upstairs to go with the play, but the fact he had Di Maria and Mata close made it possible to play the pass and move game Herrera excels at.

What Mata's doing for us is exactly what a false #9 is meant to do. Furthermore, I don't think I have seen any other Spaniard do it quite as well. I always felt Cesc was ill suited to that role and I'm not sold on David Silva acting as the central focal point of Spain's attack either. Silva is less direct and less <i>muscular</i> in his play than Mata, he works better off other players drifting in off the flanks. If given the chance I could see Mata thriving as a false #9 for Spain.

1070~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1071~~~
That idea is interesting, and I've thought about it earlier as well. While Mata has some skills to be able to play the false. 9- namely an ability to engage the center backs, good finishing ability, top vision, movement and passing skills onto wings/on rushing midfielders he lacks a couple of attributes IMO. And those are dribbling and ability to beat defenders/ run in behind with his pace. Mind you, Mata has good movement, but probably not the most electric pace.

Of course, the false. 9 is not an easy position and IMO neither Fab nor Silva has been uber successful at it. Its difficult because you really need the full set of skills - pace, finishing, movement, vision, passing, dribbling. Not everyone is a Messi who could possess these skills.

Why I got thinking about it was because of what Mata said before he went to the world cup in an interview with Sid Lowe. I'll produce the relevant part here:

1072~~~
<a class="username" data-user="79183, @Maroo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79183/">@Maroo</a> Interesting quotes. I get what you are saying about Mata's pace but I think you are underestimating him a little. You're right to point out Mata's not Messi-lite, but Thomas Muller has played false #9 effectively and he's not like Messi either. I think Mata's intelligent enough to make it work, especially with the practice he's getting in Van Gaal's system.

1073~~~
Hahaha - Muller: Like a lot of people, I don't understand his play! He is effective though.

Again, as I said I feel Mata is sharp, has good movement. In the last game against QPR, he covered amongst the highest distances in the minutes that he played also implying that we in this Forum often underestimate him. But my gut feeling is that it will not be easy for him to beat defenders as he is not a natural "dribbler" or someone who can run in behind. Again - something which we cannot be sure about till he plays the false.9 or striker role.

With respect to Muller, and him duelling with defenders, this is what he has to say (Recent interview with Honigstein):

So essentially he says that he works well as a false. 9 because he is a space master; always looks to get into little pockets of space. I think Mata can do that, but we've not tested that. Where Mata works for me is his ability to work the ball through tight spaces beautifully and find that teammate or make brave forward passes.

1074~~~
Indeed, for me Juan Mata's acid test starts now with a team that has much more attacking confidence, fluidity and movement around him, both on and off the ball, this is what surely works to his strengths?

The QPR game was the start of his and our season for me.

1075~~~
Amen

1076~~~
A lot of his assists at Chelsea were from set-piece delivery, which is exceptional, but it was a bit off in the first few games and now it seems as though Di Maria has usurped him.

For me, he's our best free-kick taker in goal scoring positions. I'm screaming at Rooney to feck off every time we get one!  We've got an impressive set of set piece takers to be fair <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1077~~~
50 assists implies that someone scored 50 goals. 50 goals>40 goals.

1078~~~
Hehe... got caught there buddy <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1079~~~
What? There are 10 other players on the team. Like I've said before, would you rather have Rooney - Mata at 30 and 40 goals, or at 30 goals and 50 assists?

1080~~~
I see him as a false nine.

1081~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1082~~~
I just love Mata, he is like the most likable guy ever, and he is brilliant.

1083~~~
Lol

1084~~~
Yeah he does seem like a cool guy, Just having him and Herrera around in the squad seems of given everyone a lift, Nice to see the players happy again

1085~~~
I see him getting loads of goals this season if we continue a 442 diamond. The midfield is capable of supplying as well as defending now so it makes him the 3rd option in attack (the two strikers being the first 2 options) but that has a massive benefit in the strikers pulling their men away to open up space, especially since our strikers are so good they'll be man marked all game.

1086~~~
I love that picture.

1087~~~
Love Juan. He's going to have an excellent season

1088~~~
Before all of these new arrivals, myself along with many thought Mata would be the one to watch this season and so far, it could be close to the money.

1089~~~
Do you actually think what you are saying is logical? For an assist there must be a goal. Therefore 50 assists = 50 goals. 40 goals=40 goals. It's more goal output plain and simple. You can't then just assume that the rest of the number of goals in the team would be the same and then say "see it's better that he scored more goals". I mean come on, think about it.

Edit: Sorry didn't realize this was from the other day.

1090~~~
I'd rather have a playmaker that can score 40 goals, than one that make 50 assists. How's that sound? it's plain and simple, but it's more about preference.

If Mata can score 40 goals this season, and Fabregas has 50 assists; and both us and Chelsea end up trophy-less, with close league position; I'd say Mata has better season, individually. Playmaker that can score goals are rare, thus more valuable, than one who can give assist.

1091~~~
Doesn't that mean he ceases to be a playmaker and becomes more of a goal scorer? In a squad with Falcao, Rooney and Van Persie a creator is more important than a scorer from midfield - if he can strike a balance then fine, say fifteen goals and twenty assists and if Rooney can match those figures (he has the capacity to), Di Maria with his- well that's a level of output enough to power a title challenge.

1092~~~
For a team that plays 3 kind-of playmakers like City with Silva, Toure and Nasri or Chelsea with Fabregas, Oscar and Hazard behind one striker I would agree that they have to add some goals from the midfield. 
However, in our case we are almost forced to play 2 strikers up top, and still one very good striker will sit on the bench. So for us a playmaker who can provide assists is more important than the one who scores goals. 
This.

1093~~~
Got this bad boy today. Man love reaching dangerous levels.

1094~~~
Whats the size? Medium?

1095~~~
Yeh.

1096~~~
It's bizarre. I didn't realize that number 8 is a gorgeous number. That symmetrical curve formed a loop that represents the circuit of life. And someone named Mata just stand above it as the king.

1097~~~
LvG quotes very harsh on the lad.

1098~~~
Mata was the easiest choice. The best striker in the world, the capatin and his buddy were the other options.

1099~~~

1100~~~
I don't really get them. He linked up well, gave nothing away (98% completion rate) got on the score sheet and kept the ball moving far better than how Rooney does in that role.

1101~~~
Lets not over-react with the team news today.

It's one game and against Leicester i believe United have the opportunity to play all the forwards!

1102~~~
His brain is certainly very dynamic, and his passing qualities would unlock any defense especially in Europe. We don't need pace and power all over the park, that is just stupid from Neville.

1103~~~

1104~~~
RVP is LVG's golden boy, no way him or Rooney we're getting dropped, feel so bad for Mata.

Not a bad thing though, Because a fit Van Persie is the best striker in the world.

1105~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Neville can't stand him, can he?

1106~~~
That's the reason why he's putting out the training cones for England. Hasn't a clue.

Mata isn't dynamic enough, gimme a fecking break.

1107~~~
Hasn't really done anything to warrant being dropped. But what can you say? We've brought in Fal-fecking-cao, who's no slouch himself.

1108~~~
#FreeMata

1109~~~
Typical English coach. Doesn't understand the brilliance of Mata as a no.10. Prefers headless chickens running around at 100mph, tear arseing into challenges.

1110~~~
Just reminds me a bit of the Kagawa situation, van perise becomes available and w ebuy him, Shinji fecked. The same with Mata happening here. I know people will say we rotate, but at the end of the day Mata will be the one who will be dropped the most.

1111~~~
Personally i would rather have Rooney and Falcao up top with Mata playing behind them. 

I would rather see Mata play but trust LvGs assessment. I am sure LvG is still assessing the squad and wants to see what everyone can do - hence why if Rooney doesnt work in this role i expect to see Di Maria or a forgotten number 11...

1112~~~
Been miles better than RvP, he should be starting today.

1113~~~
I think Mata must have kicked Neville's dog or something. He's had it in for him since day one. Still no need for everyone to overreact about Mata being on the bench. If someone performs shite they will be out and Mata will be in. He's a great option to bring off the bench and change the game too.

1114~~~
I guess the fact is that we have such an abundance of quality up front that some will have to miss out at times. Usually you think of that sort of selection issue causing the player's grief while in this situation it's the fans who are getting annoyed by who they think is a better option missing out.

1115~~~
I'm not best pleased about this.

It smacks of not picking the team on merit. Neither Rooney nor van Persie nor Falcao has shown more than Mata so far this season. Either one should've been dropped ahead of him.

Meh. I just hope we don't aleniate him, brilliant little player that'll thrive with Di Maria and Herrera buzzing around him.

1116~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sorry but before the QPR game, many were calling for him to be dropped.

1117~~~
Just listening to LVGs interview and sounds to me that Rooney at the tip of the diamond might be given some time which I did suspect would happen but still disappointing for me. Just think Mata brings more there but will have to see how it goes on the pitch.

1118~~~
Don't know why he is on the bench. I understand it might be rotation but shouldnt it be the players who are not in form be subbed first.

1119~~~
What the hell is he smoking?

1120~~~

1121~~~
If your saying Mata as been bad then fair enough but however you rank is performances he's been better than RvP, that's for sure.

1122~~~
I don't agree with dropping him but we'll see how it works out.

1123~~~
He's had it.

1124~~~
Van Gaal just keeps disappointing, great stuff. Drop one of our best players from last game for lethargic RvP who is in his worst form in career/striker playing in number 10/new player who isn't even our player and showed nothing to claim starting position yet. But as long as we win everything will be fine.

1125~~~
Mata must have pissed Gary Neville off once or twice.

1126~~~
That's not what I'm saying. It's what a good portion of the caf were saying however. I've been defending Mata actually. I love the little guy.

1127~~~
Seriously Nev and Scholes go a bit OTT with their impartiality sometimes to the extent that it feels like they go out of their way to criticise United's players. Especially Mata for some unfathomable reason.

1128~~~
How can a new player show something if he isn't playing? You can make that argument if Falcao has played 10 games and hasnt scored but not now.

1129~~~
I think Mata behind Rooney & Falcao would be my choice but LvG clearly thinks Mata and Rooney would overlap too much - hence why RvP starts. My thinking is if RvP doesnt look up for it today we will have Mata/Rooney/Falcao start the next game.

1130~~~
I think LVG probably thinks that Mata will not do well against a pressing team like Leceister. So he is just a victim of the strategy for this game.

1131~~~
Giggs dropped Mata in one of his games in charge and he came on to score 2 goals, hopefully he can answer LVG the same way.

1132~~~
All will be fine when he comes on for RVP and scores, smiles and starts next week.

1133~~~
Pretty harsh words, and maybe worrying for Mata. After all, where else is Mata going to play?

That said, LVG has a pretty blunt way of putting things. Perhaps best not to read <i>too</i> much into it.

1134~~~
Just because he showed class for other club means he should be an automatic starter for us? Mata deserves to be dropped for new striker just because we paid big money for him?

1135~~~
That's been said before ,and maybe the reason Jose got rid.

1136~~~
Yeah it's funny really, he was probably the least impressive out of our midfield diamond against qpr as well. His form has been exactly the same as van persies this season, apart from scoring two tap ins, but because he got dropped today doesn't mean this is how it will always be. Rvp needs a goal as much as anyone and van gaal could be trying to play him into form.

1137~~~
He isn't an automatic starter. This is his first start. Did I say Mata should be dropped? Did you read my post above in this page?

1138~~~
It makes no sense to me because it sounds like he rated Van Persie's performance

1139~~~
Well Neville, you let us down from a defensive perspective time and time again in our biggest games (the games against RM come to mind immediately), but in Mata's case thank God he is actually here to attack and not a defender or a defensive mid.

1140~~~
Neville is hugely annoying with all his Mata hatred, really. Maybe he's fighting his inner manly love for him this way?
I hope that Van Gaal would see that Mata is our best n.10

1141~~~
^ this...

If you were unhappy with Rooney how could you be happy with RvP?

And this get on Mata stuff is just obtuse.  He is an ACM and he is sublime.  I hope LVG just wants to rest mata and save him some lumps, cause after AdM Mata is the 2nd name on my dream United team...

1142~~~
Weird. Now we have the sort of attacking personell to help Mata thrive he's dropped.

Rooney might offer more defensively than Mata does but Mata infinitely better from an attacking perspective in the #10.

In the #10 Rooney's first thought when he receives the ball seems to be "get it out wide" whereas Mata is cute enough with the ball to feed the strikers.

1143~~~
Ridiculous that RvP starts and Mata is benched imo. No matter if RvP scores - he's done nothing to be starting over Mata. Very harsh and clear favouritism.

1144~~~
Lost the ball cheaply in a very dangerous position, which lead to the fourth goal. Not sure why LVG put him on for Di Maria, mind. He should have been put on as a number 10, with Rooney partnering Van Persie.

1145~~~
Should be our first choice number 10.

1146~~~
His lack of physicality was an issue again although Rojo was mostly at fault, that was a terrible ball to play in that situation. As you said, I have no idea why Van Gaal put him in midfield, Di Maria didn't seem to be struggling and surely it would have made more sense to bring on an actual central midfielder if there was an issue. I suspect Mata is going to be mostly a substitute waiting for one of our 3 strikers to get injured.

1147~~~
I know he is a huge Caf favourite and seems a very genuine and nice guy, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if he is sold in one of the next two windows, I think LvG will be looking to add more pace and physicality and Mata lacks both.

1148~~~
It was a woeful ball to him from Rojo. 

Wait, LVG put him on in CM??

1149~~~
He's the type of player who is a bit of a luxury in some ways but to get the most out of him you have to build the team around him. If we start him in the number ten role I'm sure he will be great for us. Anywhere else not so much. I don't think he's the type of player you want to bring on as a sub either.

1150~~~
I think the problem currently is who kept him out. Van Persie, though he scored and had a hand in the third goal, was an absolute liability in attack. Last week he was helping us with clever and quick passing that had us playing some sensational stuff. You'd think if Falcao had been at the end of the two or three chances Van Persie got we would have been out of sight before we collapsed like a deck of cards. With Mata in there you'd have fancied him to create more chances. However our biggest issue was not a lack of goals, three goals should at least, at worst, earn you a draw. That collapse was pathetic!

1151~~~
It's funny ppl complain about him not defending and then when he doesn't play we looked awful, as well, got overrun, couldn't keep the ball, scored 2 goals because of Falcao's and Di Maria's individual brilliance and conceded 3!

1152~~~
when we lose the ball, he s a ball watcher. I can't see a serious premiership team affording more than one such player, perhaps a maximum of two in easier games. We have Mata, rvp and falcao, I think eventually lvg will opt fir the latter two

1153~~~
Falcao actually did his share of dropping back and getting a couple of interceptions today.

1154~~~
We dominated possession so I'm not sure where you're getting the idea we couldn't keep the ball. We actually got far worse at keeping the ball when Mata came on.

1155~~~
Needs to play, he scores goals and/or assists. Pure and simple.

1156~~~
Yep agree with all of that

1157~~~
We gave the ball away too often before Mata got on. That's why we conceded 3 times. Of course we were going to lose more possesion once Leicester get even tighter and Di Maria comes off. If he had actually started with Mata or at least brought him on earlier the team would have been more balanced.

1158~~~
Valencia>Mata right?

1159~~~
Btw, LvG agrees. Even more baffling then why he didn't act quicker:
"We didn't keep ball possession in the right way," said Van Gaal. "Leicester have already showed against Arsenal and Stoke that they can come back and they did it very well.

1160~~~
TBT wasn't quite who I had in mid. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1161~~~
Pretty much. He is contributing more end product than anyone we're picking over him.

The fact that he makes our team more balanced is almost secondary.

1162~~~
I reiterate the fact that he is one of the best #10s in the world. We are lucky to have him and it will be a huge mistake to sell him. If LVG needs pace up front, he should let go of RVP and add a striker with more pace. Its not the end of the world if every single player is not quick up front. Look at the #10s in the world - are all of the them quick? No! Oscar, Isco, Silva, Iniesta, Ozil, Rodgriguez etc. are a few of the top #10s and they aren't exactly lighting quick.

Mata was the only bright spot in the second half of the season for us last year. He found a way to score and was good even though every single player around him was shit. It will be an utter waste to sell him now because he has top players around him. We have a chance to see how good he can really be. I think he can emulate his Chelsea form where he scored like 12-15 and assisted more than 20. Even team has defensive frailties. The answer is not to sell them but find a way to compensate for it.

1163~~~
As did Scholes on a fairly frequent basis, yet you would have been crazy to leave him out of your team back in the day.

1164~~~
He just adds a different dimension to our team as he's the only one who's extremely comfortable in the tightest of areas and under pressure. A player like that offers confidence and makes the team more comfortable and I don't think we'd have turned this nervous and stressed if he was on the team instead of Rooney. 

Not sure what Rooney adds in that number 10 role, we already have two world class strikers up front - we don't need more goals or presence inside of the box.

1165~~~
Sort of and the bigger point is Mata plays up front with three central midfielders behind him as cover. Scholes played in a midfield 2 with no midfielders behind him as cover.

1166~~~
Agreed, it's baffling how quickly some opinions of him seem to have changed recently. The guy's fecking quality and should be one of the first names on the team sheet for us.

1167~~~
Oscar is an AM not a luxury #10, he puts a lot of defensive work in and can also play on the flanks. Ozil has struggled here due to being too weak and lazy. Silva is the only one on your list that is a genuine success story in our league and he does it floating off the wing where less defensive work is needed, Silva also is much better at protecting the ball where Mata just gets knocked off it too easily.

There is no rule in football that says you have to play with a #10 and with Di Maria and Herrera in the side we are not short of good creative passers. I might be wrong and you can come back to this and put me in my place, but I see LvG selling Mata and adding another box to box CM to make us more secure and combative in midfield.

1168~~~
Right now there's no better option than Mata as a No 10. Rooney is not a good No 10 if we want a change of style, especially not when Falcao and RvP are playing as well. If LvG wants a "tougher" No 10 he can play Herrera there, BUT not at the moment, as we need him in midfield. So if he doesn't play Mata then he has to come up with another solution. Playing 3 strikers however is not the solution, but the problem. And this was Leicester, not City, Chelsea, Everton, Arsenal, Southampton, ...

1169~~~
No idea why ppl are screaming out for him after our best performance attacking wise without him. We were a joy to watch for 60 mins offensively.

1170~~~
And that underscores the bigger problem: it's fine having creative players like Scholes and Mata in the team, as long as you are sound behind them. In Scholes' case, he was supported by the likes of Keane, Carrick, Rio, Vidic, Stam and Brown, while Mata has had to rely on the likes of Fletcher, 2013-Carrick, Evans, Smalling and Jones to cover up for his defensive lapses.

1171~~~
Perhaps he will discuss his part in the fourth Leicester goal in his next blog post...

1172~~~
Better than last week? My stream was dodgy today, but last week seemed far more convincing.

1173~~~
Can't believe he didn't start today. In the end we scored three goals and still lost, so I doubt he'd have made too much difference to the final score, but that's surely not going to do anything for his confidence after looking like he was returning to some quality form against QPR. Then he gets chucked on god knows where (CM?) In the last twenty and gifts them the ball for the goal, again not going to do anything for his confidence. Think Van Gaal has managed to this one poorly.

1174~~~
Yeah, our attacking performance was not the problem today. It wasn't as good as last week, but it was acceptable and impressive for the first 60 mins of the game.

Opinions on Mata seem to be fluctuating constantly here. A few weeks ago he was disposable, a flop and an unnecessary signing who didn't have a future here. Now, a week on from a very good performance where he showed his ability, he's transformed into the solution to our problems and should automatically be in the team. From one extreme to the other for many.

1175~~~
As much as I enjoy a lot of Neville's punditry, some of his United related stuff often feels very agenda driven, as he wants us to stick to traditional United football, which he doesn't see Mata as being a part of unfortunately. Really disagree with him on that front.

1176~~~
We were fine for the first hour. Mata wasn't missed at all. Starting him wasn't the answer to our problems.

1177~~~
Mata's a cracking player but good under pressure? I'm not so sure about that. He regularly loses the ball when he has a defender at his back as we seen on the 4th goal.

1178~~~
How can you say we were fine when we gave away a 2 margin lead twice? It's not in doubt that when we are leading Mata keeps posession better than probably any of our other players. He should have brought on at 3-1 to keep the result, let alone at 3-2.

1179~~~
With an hour gone we were 3-1 up. How would starting Mata have saved us from being a shambles at the back? We were worse after he came on and it was him losing possession that led to the 4th goal.

1180~~~
Well it's all speculation. What we know is that we didn't concede 5 goals in any game this season when we started him with 2 strikers. And last game we scored 4 goals when he was on the pitch, and got worse when he came off. 
He is not an impact sub (just like Rooney and RvP), he needs some mins in a game and he then usually improves. You can't expect him doing much in 17 mins when the team had lost all shape. It's really not rocket science to bring on a mid/attacking mid for a striker to bring a bit more balance, edpecially if you are playing with 3 strikers.
We won't get anywhere if we start all 3 strikers again!

1181~~~
Not sure how this is relevant considering it was a terrible pass from Rojo.

1182~~~
He could've shielded the ball better regardless. Less popular players than Mata would be getting slaughtered for it.

1183~~~
We should just play Valencia ahead of him because he is better defensively. And Falcao too, because he was good for Atletico Madrid.

1184~~~
Rooney will do more defensive work than Mata. Playing Mata will not make us any more solid.

1185~~~
Neville's agenda against Mata is rather cringeworthy now.

Here comes the concept of 'defending' and it's literal meaning. You're as well defending if you're circulating the ball right and your opposition doesn't have it. While I didn't have too much bad things to say about Rooney's performance untill the whole team's gone to shit, I'd rather see Mata in the #10 than him and simply play with two strikers. Mata's synergy with Di Maria, Herrera and even Blind seems to be simply better.

Plus, to me the team looks more gelled together when it's Mata in the #10, rather than two split formations when we're playing 3 strikers in three top positions.

1186~~~
Nah, if Mata is playing a central role we have to ensure that Fellaini is ahead of him. More defensive minded.

1187~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Amazing, isn't it?

Ppl have been ridiculing the likes of Valencia and even Welbeck as "defensive wingers", as they want attacking players to attack and not defend, but Mata, one of the best attackers in the world should be judged on defending? 
And Rooney is better? Yep, as shown by his clearance for the equalizer! 

I am just completely shocked at LvG playing 3 strikers after complaining that we have an unbalanced squad. 
Then if that wasn't bad enough, he doesn't seem to have the balls to take off Rooney or RvP. Very Moyesesque!

1188~~~
Mate, I was being sarcastic. I'd have 20 years of Moyes here before I'd want to see Fellaini ahead of Mata.

1189~~~
By far our best no10 and one of our in form players and he gets dropped so Rooney who is nowhere near as good in the no10 role can play. It's true Rooney is undroppable. If Mata is fit he has to start and if that means no RVP, Falcao or Rooney so be it

1190~~~
I know! I agree with you and Amar, that's why I quoted you guys. But seems I am as bad at it as the team today at football <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1191~~~
Ah right, I thought you were taking me seriously for a moment.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1192~~~
I think he is agreeing with you!

1193~~~
Yeah, he is. My bad.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1194~~~
Phew! Thank God someone got it!!

1195~~~
This is where this whole concept is flawed, it was not nor should it have been a Rooney or Mata situation. Rooney played well last week, so did Mata and so did the whole team except one man. To play Falcao it's Robin that had to make way and his all round performance only reinforced that fact, in hindsight. Rooney didn't need to be in the hole to contribute defensively either. That said that decision alone didn't cost us the match but it was the manager's inability to shore up a weak defence and the lack of leadership on the pitch that cost us, eventually.

1196~~~
Granted the ball weren't the best from Rojo, I personally feel Mata should be doing better to shield the ball anyway. 

And yes <a class="username" data-user="73962, @saivet" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/73962/">@saivet</a>, I'm pretty sure Mata got put on as LCM, replacing Di Maria, with Rooney as a number 10 and Van Persie and Januzaj up top. I personally would have put Januzaj LCM, that he could give us some width - almost playing as a left winger, while pushing Rooney up top, with Mata in the no.10 role. 

Mata wasn't really able to influence the game in the position he was in.

1197~~~
It's a joke that we dropped him to start Rooney in the hole. He adds so much more to the team in midfield than Rooney ever will.

1198~~~
Was disappointing to see him on the bench after he played so well against QPR, but this wasn't the reason we lost the game.

1199~~~
This.

1200~~~
Think that's a bit unfair on Scholes, who found ways to not get constantly beaten 1 on 1 despite lacking pace or strength. He was part of some incredible defensive performances in a 2 man midfield, too.

Well said. Great post, and I completely agree

1202~~~
I really don't want to see Mata's exclusion used as a stick to beat Rooney with.

For me, it comes down to van Gaal dropping his mate RVP. Time to see how big his balls really are.

1203~~~
Maybe, but he was still a bit of a liability, especially as the years went on, and yet with exception of his final season, SAF was pretty consistent in finding ways to field him.

1204~~~
I wonder if both Rooney and RVP shouldn't be dropped. I'd love to see Januzaj get a start.

1205~~~
Maybe this is a controversial statement but I think he is our 2nd best player, only beaten by Di Maria. The stick he's getting in the last month is a bit pathetic. he's a phenomenal player and he should be in the team almost every game. Heres hoping he is.

1206~~~
I don't understand why he didn't start.

1207~~~
He didn't do a lot when he came on but it was a difficult situation for him so I understand that. He should be in ahead of RvP next week.

1208~~~
I hope people now see the difference that he makes on the pitch. I doubt we would have been in that situation had he been there from the start.

1209~~~
I disagree! I think you can't go wrong having either Rooney or Mata in the team. We were 3-1 up and threw it away.

It comes down to us being disorganised and not defending well as a team. You can't really put the blame on one player but of course our defenders were poor.

The important thing is that we are scoring goals for fun and eventually that will put the fear into opponents who play us.

1210~~~
Mata is a better passer/retainer of the ball than Rooney, even if you take the excuse of Rooney running a lot/being more physical. Also, we dropped our most inform player to make way for the "captain". So he takes the responsibility. It's all hypothetical right now, but had Mata been there, we would have kept the ball better and maybe avoided this.

It's very easy to say the teams would fear us. Leicester didn't, and going by the looks of it, I doubt even West Ham would.

1213~~~
I believe LVG preferred Rooney over Mata as he knew it would be a difficult away match where our players would need to "put in a shift" defensively. Its my guess that LVG sees Rooney as someone who is more responsible in defending than Mata. Might also have to do with the physical nature of Leicester and having too many midgets in the side might see us lose out on set pieces?

Anyways, I think had we not been struck back so quickly after the 2nd/3rd goals then we probably would have come away with 3 points. Heck, if we hadn't gone into panic mode when it was 3-2 or 3-3 it would have been a different story. Just a disastrous performance but one we are unlikely to repeat again. Its not common that we are that poor when holding onto a lead.

1214~~~
Didn't LvG say that Rooney prefers to be played as AM?

1215~~~
The fazing out begins...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/22/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-midfield-louis-van-gaal?CMP=twt_gu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...ter-united-midfield-louis-van-gaal?CMP=twt_gu</a>

Poor Juan, he's a top drawer player but it looks like this may be his second club in a row where he's a square peg in a round hole despite being good enough and playing well enough to not be. Manager preferences may ultimately be killing him in the quicker English style, maybe Italy beckons?

1216~~~
Agree with this, Spain or Italy would be perfect for his style of play.

1217~~~
But it's not that he's struggled here with the 'quicker English style', he could've easily been player of the year in one or two years for Chelsea, it's the same fecking bollocks with 'having to fit Rooney no matter what' again, same shit we've seen under Moyes. Play him as a striker and that's all, #10 should've been Mata or Januzaj's position, we've already got rid of Kagawa. For all my liking as he's my idol, I'm really starting to wonder if it's not Giggsy's job being done here, when he was the manager he dropped Mata too in favour of some garbage in the team.

If we'll drop Mata, we're making two steps backwards, next stop we'll be signing 'strong, physical lads who run a lot', Neville's style.

1218~~~
I've not suggested he struggled, I fully agree with you on POTY stuff and I think he has out performed Rooney since his arrival by a considerable margin. Just for the record, I said manager preferences were the cause.

Agreed on the Rooney comments btw. The undroppable one looks like he may claim another victim who's a better number 10 than he is now, following Shinji.

On reflection, when I was in Paris watching PSG, they played a slower game, if Mata could work well behind Zlatan then that would be an ideal destination too. He'd finally be at a European giant but surely be a star player with a midfield dynamic built around him. Unlikely to see that anywhere else immediately...

1219~~~
Stupid decision to drop him.

1220~~~
Mata is so much better than Rooney.

1221~~~
His PL stats since he joined suggest that it's actually the perfect place for him to play.

1222~~~
Mata although a wonderfully talented player does not do enough defensive work to be considered an elite player. So for me it was a no brainer that Rooney took his place in midfield yesterday. Problem with Rooney is that he is not a playmaker so neither of them are ideal in that role. But Rooney is a much safer bet than Mata in a struggling team.

1223~~~
Agree, he is intelligent in the way he reads the game, positionally always good, grabs goals and assists and his link up play between midfield and the attack is very good. He may not have the pace of others in a similar position but I haven't found this to be of detriment.

1224~~~
There's also the rather obvious point that he is bang in form. 8 goals in his last 9 isn't it?

He's THE link man. Stupid to drop him. 

When he hasn't performed it's generally been because he hasn't seen enough of the ball due to the failings of the rest of the team (the players behind him).

1225~~~
When you have more of the ball, you need less defensive work.


Rooney gave the ball away 12 times yesterday, compare that to Mata misplacing just 1 pass against QPR. That's 12 times we had to change shape, chase the ball and get back to defend.

I prefer prevention over the cure.

1226~~~
Plus the fact that we seemed to lack any kind of control as soon as we let in 2-3. The time when we went 3-1 up was for calming the game, keep possession and pick Leicester off on the counter. We didn't do that, we allowed ourselves to get bullied and countered on and subsequently collapsed.

1227~~~
The fact that he was dropped because of reputation, rather then actual form, is quite saddening.

1228~~~
He does have the knack of being in the right place at the right time, but can you truly think of an outstanding performance from him this season, he pops up with a goal but is pretty average/pedestrian rest of the game. His defensive contribution is also 0, the part of the game we are struggling with at the moment. LVG has been pointing out all season we are not defending as a team, if you watch Chelsea the best defensive unit in the league they defend from top to bottom.

1229~~~
Dropping Mata was hardly the issue yesterday. He wasn't missed going forward that's for sure

1230~~~
It was part of the issue. 

Playing three up front with no solidity in midfield was right at the crux of the issue.

1231~~~
Were we struggling defensively because of him playing in the QPR match? 

Ball possession for feck's sake, defending is not just throwing last ditch tackles. He was doing top three running alongside Herrera so he was cutting passing lanes and keeping the possession. Rooney's not a better defense contributor just because he throws himself at somebody now and then, just no.

1232~~~
Jose Mourinho knows a thing or two and about football and also felt Mata's defensive contribution is not satisfactory. 

I just want us to go back to our powerful, pacey counter attacking style with wingers that we were once famous for. Playing with players like Mata is against that ethos, like you said he's a possession player and would fit in nicely to a team that plays the tiki taka style of play. I don't want that style of play at United tbh, i find it boring and tedious.

1233~~~
It's a worrying sign for him that LvG has said Rooney is undroppable and now says he would rather he didn't play as a striker. Mata may not get many starts if that's the case.

It's fecking criminal that Rooney got to the top of ladder at this club so quickly after last summer. It's not like he has even put in the performances to warrant it. I won't get completely on his back as I did like the way he was bollocking the defenders after the third goal yesterday so there is hope for his reign as captain, but I guess this discussion is for the Rooney thread.

Edit: Actually, looking at the LvG quote again it looks like he was referring to Mata in the CM role and not his #10 position.

1234~~~
What's Van Persie's defensive contribution like? Falcao's?

Defence is not all about tackling. You can't just pile players into the team whose main mission is scoring. You need a link man. Rooney is not anywhere near as good as a link man, and the others are out and out strikers. Away from home, you play one of them.

I think LVG is very arrogant and I think it shows in his team selections.

1235~~~
It really wasn't.

Mata will not provide defensive solidity. He didn't do for Chelsea and he won't for us.

1236~~~
Will Falcao? 

Will Van Persie?

Will Rooney?

1237~~~
Oh yea, because what we've been playing untill now was tiki-taka and we should get back to the 'United's way!' ( we haven't played that for last fecking 5 or 6 years but hey ) Right on then, bring on Ashley and Antonio to the moshpit, let's have fun.

1238~~~
He will in a sense that he is more inclined to work in a unit with the 3 midfielders behind him as opposed to the 2 attackers ahead of him, whereas Rooney's inclination is obviously to work more with the strikers then those behind him, which is one of his big problems when playing in the role. 

With Mata in the #10 role, he is part of a clear midfield unit -  and we retain the ball a lot better, which means we have to defend a lot less, which is a good thing for us.

1239~~~
I think that's the issue, you can get away with one striker who naturally stays up top, but having 3 players who don't work hard enough, esp in this league  won't work.

1240~~~
He'll play the next game, judging on Van Gaal's comments regarding the difficulties of playing 2 pure strikers.

1241~~~
No to RVP, maybe for Falcao, yes for Rooney.

But it's irrelevant. We did not miss Mata going forward yesterday which is what he brings to the team and Van Gaal's decision was vindicated by the way we played going forward. 

Mata's QPR perfprmance was overrated on here as well and I said it then he should be the one that should be dropped not RVP. Van Gaal seems to agree.

1242~~~
That's why we would have been better off spending that 37m on a Marco Reus type winger, we all know Young and Valencia are not good enough. Mata was a panic buy another poor decision by Moyes.

1243~~~
But we haven't, we have bought one of the best CAM's in this league and given how rubbish our wings are, we'd be absolute idiots to play with wingers of Valencia or Young ilk now. You play to your strengths with what you've got, Mata is one of our best players.

1244~~~
Not sure mate. From my own observations it seems like its his favourite position since that's where he started off as a youngster. Its where we played him originally when RVN was his partner. However, the current Rooney doesn't have the same pace or explosiveness to beat a defender hence Im not even sure whether its the most suitable role for him! What I do like about him in that role is his ability to track back and help out the defence (compared to Mata).

1245~~~
? Which comments?

Anyway, Mourinho got rid off Mata, but he is a very defensive coach anyway. He never ever would start with 3 strikers, let alone away from home. IF you drop Mata because of a lack of defensive stability, THEN you for sure can't play 3 strikers. Mourinho usually plays with one very hard working striker. He played with only Costa yesterday, who btw did more good defensive work (with "good" being the key, instead of just running around like a headless chicken) than our 3 strikers combined. 
Dropping Mata because of a lack of defensive work would make sense if he started with one more midfielder or "defensive winger" instead.
However dropping him and then starting with 3 strikers doesn't suggest he was dropped in order to bring more balance/defensive structure, but it rather suggests that LvG isn't prepared to drop one of the three strikers. Which is extremely concerning.

1246~~~
This is not really true, not for the Mata at United at least. As recently as against QPR, he was closer to a 3rd striker than a 3rd midfielder. He's a brilliant player but he's a final 3rd player. No David Silva that's for sure.

1247~~~
Agree with this and explains his goal scoring record. I think it's very naive to play Mata and 2 strikers, either we play him upfront with a striker or don't play him at all.

1248~~~
Nah I'd say that's not true, Mata covered a shit load of ground against QPR - he had the highest average whilst he was on the pitch. He was consistantly linking with the Midfield and bringing the ball into attack. 

It's only when we didn't have the ball that he was stationed really high up the field - as it was his job to pressurise the centre-backs. When we had it though he was everywhere - and the stats back it up.

1249~~~
So we played him as a support striker/winger during the RvN/Ronaldo days. Made him the star striker and then he complained about our lack of signings. Bought two of the best players and he again ended up whining at the end of the season. We still granted him his wish, gave him a shiny new contract, played him in his favourite position (all this time with him being regressed) and now he is taking a position from a player better than him. FFS.

1250~~~
That was because our midfield was poor. It isn't now, there are enough quality players who can drop deep and do the job, so we don't really need him running all through the pitch all the time.

1251~~~
Even if Mata was dropped because of reputation I don't think it will be for much longer. RvP has to find form soon or he will be out, surely LvG can't stick with him for too long.

1252~~~
Mata only really came alive in the final 3rd and even then there was feck all creativity in his play which is something he's supposed to bring to the team. Even in his post match intervew he talked about getting into the box and scoring goals. When Rooney and RVP dropped deep-ish, at times he was the furthest man forward against QPR when we had the ball.

What he's done for us so far is score plenty of goals. Excellent but we have 3 other strikers who are all better at scoring goals given the service and if that's all he's going to provide then he puts himself at risk of being dropped.

fwiw I'd have started the same team that played against QPR, so in that repect Mata was a bit unlucky. But at no point did I think we missed Mata. In fact Rooney did a better job in creating chances than Mata. Clattenberg and everyone collectively losing their head was why we lost, not because Mata didn't start.

1253~~~
Mata should be our first choice no.10, tip of the diamond, we should dropped Rooney instead (or play him as striker)

1254~~~
I actually think Rooney could drop a little deeper to give more protection to our backline. There were times when we were a bit stretched yesterday.

1255~~~
If we are going to use a striker to do that work, we might as well not play him as one. There is no point, tbh.

1256~~~
As far as I can tell, LVG made the right decision to play Falcao over Mata. We were 3-1 up...

1257~~~
That shouldn't even be debatable. We were playing very well at that point

1258~~~
I didn't realise there was such negativity towards Mata.

From my perspective I felt United lacked the more rounded fluidity that was shown against QPR. Personally I felt Mata linked up better and also did his fair share of tracking back. I don't like Rooney as a 10 because when he plays there he never stays there, he drifts everywhere around the pitch and I don't think it helps the team as much as many here are making out.

For me I was gutted to see Mata dropped yesterday. Agreed United scored 3 goals, 2 of them were similar to QPR in that they were scored or assisted by Di Maria, and of course the first one was good link up between Falcao and RvP. But as I said it didn't look as fluid. I think Rooney caused problems dropping back and getting in the way a little, especially with his mistake for the 3rd goal. I agree Mata was at fault for the 4th goal, but I didn't see a replay of it and he was clattered from behind, my first reaction was he was FOULED, but as they didn't show the replay of the tackle/foul I can't honestly say.

United were undone yesterday by a number of factors and it all started with the foul on Rafa then the dive and the penalty. Actually it started with their first goal where the ball was out of play before the cross. After the first penalty United did crumble but Leicester had momentum. They took it off United, it was only minutes before Falcao had nearly scored a fourth. But the minute they scored the penalty that all changed. The crowd got right behind their team and it energised them and sent panic throughout the United players. United were at complete odds for the 3rd goal and then it only got worse.

Then we come to the 5th goal where I though Blackett was fouled first. So you had a player on the pitch who should have been sent off in the first half and 3 of their 5 goals being contentious. I defy any team in the world to overcome odds like that. It truly was a disgusting display by the officials. Yes as fans we can feel hard done by and no matter what anyone says the officials did change the outcome of the game. However, none of that negates the fact that had United won it would have just papered over the cracks that were always there for all to see.

The defence looked like it just needed an experienced leader and a calming effect. Up until the FIRST penalty, Blackett was my man of the match, he was superb in the first half. I don't think the loss of Evans helped the defence or their mentality either. Is everyone also forgetting our best defender this year was also out injured? Phil Jones is a big loss, and maybe bigger than first thought. The defence needs a massive shake-up but I think when injury free, it will be far better than yesterday. I am interested to see how Rafael, Jones, Rojo and Shaw would work. I am sure we could get a half decent back 4 line up from our defenders, but this is where League Cup matches would help in trying them out. We have to wait until January for the FA cup and by then we could have new players to fit in again. It's all going to take time and patience.

LvG still has lots to do, but can anyone honestly say they thought different just because of one and a half games? Nobody has said United had a problem going forward or scoring goals. It was midfield and defence that were the problems. Losing Evra, Rio, Vidic is more damaging than anything. Sorry, but isn't that the same criticism Rodgers and Liverpool were getting on Saturday? Herrera and Blind struggled yesterday and you can see why LvG gave Vidal until the very last day to prove his fitness. He wanted more steel and more aggression. He obviously didn't buy Carvalho as he felt with Blind, United could cope until January where he will go again for Vidal or Strootman who many feel is his first choice.

LvG also knows about the defence and will try to sort that as soon as soon as he can get anyone to do so. But I must admit I am a little confused by LvG now. I understand he is still trying out new things, that much is obvious and he is seriously hampered by injuries, but I was confused after yesterday. Rojo said he was bought to play CB and Shaw sat out yet again. I couldn't understand that one, nor could I understand him dropping Mata when I felt RvP would have been dropped, especially after he said Rooney is always going to play. It's a problem for him now as I think RvP and Falcao linked up better than RvP and Rooney in the QPR game, but Mata worked better as the 10 (imho) Falcao also needs time too, but one has to go and whichever one it is will cause massive arguments on here, and i'm worried Mata will be used a a scape-goat on here and dropped by LvG. I honestly can't see why because United were so much more fluid with Mata as a 10.  Especially after the QPR game where he was outstanding and linked up so well with everyone and United dropped noticeably when he was subbed.

Whatever happens we as fans are ALMOST back to square one again. However there is light at the end of the tunnel. United are devastating going forward and have a multitude of riches in the attacking options. The midfield IS better than last year and given time to adjust should get better over time. We have been unlucky with refereeing decisions and that surely has to change soon. And most importantly, and I fear this may have been overlooked. United WERE lucky this weekend. Lucky because Liverpool lost, Everton lost, and Tottenham lost and none of them were playing against 14 men like United were yesterday. Even the City v Chelsea draw was quite lucky in a way. So for that reason I feel a little more optimistic, and as LvG has said since the beginning, it's going to take time and no matter what, it's a feck load better than watching the shite last year and 100 times more exciting than watching 1700 crosses against Fulham.

Sorry for going off track there and for the exceptionally long post. It's just I haven't posted since the match and it all came out at once.

1259~~~
His endless apologizing on twitter is cringeworthy

1260~~~

1261~~~
is he not giving 'hugs' anymore? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Does seem a bit copy and paste lately his blog.

1262~~~
The question is whether he helps us better control tempo. This is where we went wrong, the game should have been slowed down and possession maintained.

1263~~~
+ 1. As soon as that penalty went in someone should have taken charge and dictated the play, slowing it down to mess up their rhythm. I saw Kagawa do it very often and I believe Mata would be capable if nobody else stepped up to the plate.

1264~~~
It's not <i>really </i>Mata's forte. I agree that slowing the play and gaining control was needed, but Mata's very much a direct, 'final third player'. Actually, Kagawa would have been far more adept at helping us see that game out than Mata IMO.

1265~~~
It looks pretty obvious - IMHO at least - that LVG doesn't really fancy him. The rumours were there during the summer and Giggs had him out of the side as much as in when he was caretaker. It'll be a shame if he leaves and, from what I've seen, it won't really be his fault as such. He'll just have played for another manager who wants completely different things than he can offer.

1266~~~
I'm afraid we'll have to suffer the same as the Chelsea fans did with regards to Mata; the pain of losing the greatest, kindest and most huggable person on earth from our squad. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

That said, I don't think he's exactly set the world alight for us so far. I expected so much for him after his initial appearances. He seemed to have such great vision for a penetrative past and the ability to execute them. But I feel like he's been playing within himself for a while, even if he's gotten among the goals consistently and probably been our most productive attacking player as a result. I just think he's got more to give, and I hope he gets a proper chance to find that something, because playing with Di Maria, Herrera, Falcao and / or a Robin van Persie who isn't glued to the grass in an offside position is exactly what he would thrive on.

But like I said, I fear that he might be marginalized. It all depends on how much patience and perseverance LvG will give his captain, oh captain and compatriot. They are all great footballers who will produce given time, just like Mata, and at the end of the day it probably comes down to which types of footballers LvG wants to execute his philosophy. It's still early days, but the signs aren't great for our Juan and only Mata.

Yeah yeah, I know, I'm grabbing my coat.

1267~~~
Mata on the top of diamond for me too. And Van Persie drops for Falcão.

1268~~~
Were they? I remember stories suggesting that Mata had impressed LvG and was his favored #10.

Clearly that isn't the case now but I hope it's not as set as that. Mata might still get the chance to impress and take it.

1269~~~
Mata is by far our best #10. Rooney showed at the weekend he's nowhere near as classy as Mata in that role.

Mata and AdM feeding Falcao would be the way forward. Sadly, slot the captain in upfront too.

1270~~~
Re Leicester, Mata's a lightweight and not suited to every game. Horses for courses.

1271~~~
Rooney did well. The bashing is ridiculus

1272~~~
As long as our three strikers are fit and scoring goals, I fear for Mata's involvement this season. Let's hope I'm wrong and van Gaal can keep him happy, at least untill next year when hopefully there will be more matches, and perhaps one striker less to compete with. With our luck regarding injuries, statistically it should only be a matter of time before one of them gets injured anyway, but let's hope that doesn't happen.

1273~~~
It really is. Everyone is shite apart from di Maria apparently.

1274~~~
Mata is far better than Rooney.

1275~~~
Not a fan of Rooney in the #10 but I also think he did well at the weekend and the criticism of him is, as usual, way over the top.

1276~~~
He was responsible in large part for their 3rd goal with his clearance and wasn't available as much as Mata though he did have his good moments too.

He plays that role pretty differently and direct which was part of the reason why our ball retention became worse and team more imbalanced.

1277~~~
He wasn't any more direct than Mata usually is. Mata has tighter control, but I actually don't think they play the role <i>that</i> differently. Mata's certainly closer to Rooney's style than Silva's, for example.
Rooney was good first half. Linked up well with Di Maria in particular.

1278~~~
Outside of his assist he did alright first half and poor 2nd for me but to your point He had 82% pass completion rate for beginners while Mata averages above 90 most games with a better touch to boot. Rooney wants to play that killer ball early, sprint quickly into attack or spray it long and wide quick instead of building up attacks with 1 two's and combinations which is different to Mata.

Also, as the focal point in the diamond and as the captain he needed to calm the team down at 3-2 instead he seemed all would end and panicky himself and his botched up clearance led to their equaliser for which he then proceeded to scream at Blackett and Rojo for.

1279~~~
I actually thought Rooney made a conscious effort to link up through the middle, and in doing so played the role quite similarly to Mata. But his touch isn't as consistent no matter how hard he tries, so it doesn't always come off. Herrera was the one spreading it wide right. Rooney didn't do too much of it on Sunday - first half at least.

Mata isn't really a truly great possession player either. He tries to be patient and Silva-esque, but it's not his natural game. He's not a million miles away from Rooney's style.

1280~~~
I thought Rooney was fine as the #10. Still think Mata is better in that role but if Rooney keeps doing decently there then I don't think LvG will be bringing Mata back in.

1281~~~
If the plan is to eventually transition to 4-3-3 then I don't see a place for Mata, I can definitely see him and one the strikers not named Rooney being sold next summer.

1282~~~
What's cringeworthy about apologizing to the fans for a loss? Would you prefer if he didn't give a shit?

1283~~~
I thought it was a good decision to play Rooney ahead of Mata against Leicester, who were extremely physical. IMO we shouldn’t be playing RVP in that game but I understand that we are still in the period of trying to accommodate all of our best players on the pitch at the same time.


Still, I don’t think we missed him in that game. Rooney was pretty good I thought.

1284~~~
I can see this. Like you say, he doesn't fit that system, but it's still a system worth moving towards, so so be it.

1285~~~
Very annoying that the newspapers have started to make stories based only on his blog..  To me it's very lazy journalism and even BBC and SSN are doing it now.

1286~~~
I agree, I like Mata but I think moving towards 4-3-3 is the best option.

1287~~~
Perhaps the fact he was a Moyes' signing will hurt him? I dunno, as much as I rate him I fully expect van Gaal to utilise Rooney as the no. 10 behind van Persie and Falcao. Hope I'm wrong though, he's a world class goalscorer.

1288~~~
Herrera is considered a number 10 by Van Gaal.

That is why he wants Strootman, 1 DM, 1 Box To box and 1 AM who will drop deep and defend as well as attack.

1289~~~
Long-term, yeah, I see us going 4-3-3. So you'd have a midfield three of Blind, Strootman and Herrera. With a front three of di Maria, Rooney and Januzaj.

1290~~~
That would weaken our attack considerably. Unless Januzaj develops the ability to score a lot of goals there'd be far too much pressure on Rooney.

1291~~~
The whole "Moyes signing" thing being a negative is so absurd. Even with the Fellaini case too. Why should it even matter?

1292~~~
Well I think LvG is expecting Adnan to develop in the scoring department and it wouldn't surprise me if we brought in a wide forward capable of scoring plenty to add to the front 3 options.

1293~~~
All this talk about what will happen if/when we switch systems and what that will mean for certain players. If a long term switch to 433 occurs, I don't think it should affect Mata, hopefully we will be in Europe and any squad will be stronger with his quality. van Gaal is a manager who will change things and if he wants a number 10, he is a great option to have. He is still on the young side too, so he definitely has a future regardless of what formation is used.

1294~~~
I was not too happy when we sold Kagawa but at least I thought this should Mata help to settle as our 10. Would prefer him + Rooney + either Falcao or RvP at top.
He has several problems though:

Hefty price tag after being sorted out by Mourinho
Similar to Kagawa he does not look too strong physically - this impression is boosted by the fact that he does not seem to be our fastest player
Can`t see anyone out of Rooney/RvP/Falcao being dropped in the long run
He is not as versatile as others (eg Herrera who can play as 10 but also as box-to-box)

However I believe Mata could shine for us as soon as he is more familiar with di Maria, Herrera and Falcao. He has great vision and an eye for the killer pass. Great little footballer he is...

1295~~~
I can see the decision to drop Mata against Leicester, as it was a fast tempo end to end game which wouldn't have suited him.

I am worried though that LVG did state he was not happy with Rooney as a striker, and not happy with Mata as a midfielder.

1296~~~
That statement loses any semblance of credibility when you take into account RVP's form and overall play, how can someone be unhappy with Rooney as a striker when his partner is as gash as Van Persie has been? Van Persie should have been the first to drop out if form was coming into play.
Secondly dropping Mata in the long run is a shortsighted decision imo, why drop a twenty six year old highly productive player for a player approaching thirty-two, with a dodgy fitness record and who looks to be on the wane ?

1297~~~
I don't know. I guess it's the way that Rooney moves. Maybe LVG does not like his strikers to drop deep and act as a 10, rather than lead the last man etc. He clearly likes RVP.

1298~~~
Which is worrying isn't it?  When he plays someone who is playing crap at the mo - and dropping someone who is playing well?  

Mata should be a starter for you.

1299~~~
This is the main problem of that game. We've let a bloody newcommer play a 'fast tempo end to end' game that you'd expect us to play against, don't know, Real Madrid or City, not fecking Leicester.

1300~~~
Leicester are no mugs. They've drawn with Everton and also taken Chelsea to the wire at the bridge. On another day with better finishing they could have comfortably scored a few. 

I agree it was a poor collapse, but they are actually a good team in great form IMO.

1301~~~
Mata's overall contribution hasn't been amazing so far this season, to be fair. Looked good against QPR but who didn't?

RvP has been awful though. Probably the only United player who didn't even impress against QPR. No idea what he has to do to get dropped.

1302~~~
Agree about being in great form but fecking hell, it sounds pathetic that our players are bending over just because some team is in form, what will happen if City or Chelski hit their form? They'll steamroll us 5-3.

I think that Mata would've slowed things down in that game and let us play possession football rather than the end-to-end one we've all witnessed.

1303~~~
That's probably why Van Gaal subbed him on but is that really Mata's style? 

He's a really attacking player, who constantly looks to get forward. Never seen him as someone to put his foot on the ball and slow things down. If anything, the opposite.

1304~~~
Mata is not David Silva. He cannot control or dictate the tempo of a game.

1305~~~
He's subbed him when it was 3-3 already, right ? Everybody went to shit then, it was pretty much game over. And can't really agree with the second point of yours.

1306~~~
At 3-3 we badly needed someone to get a hold of the ball knock it round a bit and generally slow things down. Still lots of time for us to get a winner but it was all far too frantic. 

I <i>think</i> Mata was brought on to be that calming influence. Didn't work, though.

1307~~~
How would I go about finding out the odds on Mata to leave United?

1308~~~
He is a bit lightweight is the only description you can reliably put on him.

You really cant ask him to do anything other than just float around up top near the strikers and look to play it forward or get in the box late, as he just hasnt got it in him.

1309~~~
So all you can say about Mata is that he is lightweight?

1310~~~
lightweight? whats that suppose to mean, that he's not physical enough? granted he's not strong on the ball but his pro's makes up for it, can linkup with players around him so much quicker than the likes of Rooney, has great spacial awareness, brilliant skills with the ball, provides great movement off the ball and score goals. Condemning him for making a unfair mistake against Leicester is harsh considering he came on as a sub and didnt settle in the pace of the game quick enough. Leicester were pump full of adrenaline with the comeback when Uniteds morale was waaaay down.

1311~~~
How did you manage to extrapolate that, from what I said?

You've managed to come up with a whole argument by yourself.

1312~~~
Yes.
 lightweight player, he is never going to track back reliably, isnt going to pressurize defenders over the course of match, is not going to go into a challenge, you play him in and around the strikers doing what he wants.

That does not mean he isnt excellent at what he does, but is that, on its own, enough to justify his place in the team week in week out.

I would say, I want a bit more from a player in that position, certainly when it comes to dropping back into the center.

1313~~~
i was making a detailed point to you that he doesnt just "float" around up top, like he doesnt do anything impressive. You mentioned his major flaw but didnt acknowledge what he brings more to the squad. What im saying is dont judge a player before weighing the pros & cons. His tracking back is a liability at times but in attacking terms just out weighs that con.

1314~~~
Well thats clearly not true. He's not been great, but he's not been awful. Awful would be your boy Rooney, when he's going through one of his regular, couldn't control a football to save his life routines. 

But hey, your agenda against any player not called Rooney has recently reached new heights, with you seemingly spending most of your time on here just defending Rooney and putting every other player down.

1315~~~
Yeah, once I typed that I thought it was a little harsh.

He's been well below par though and yes, he's been <i>considerably</i> worse than Rooney and is the attacking player most deserving of being dropped.

Your last sentence is horseshit by the way. Have a look at what I've posted about Jones, Hererra, Blind and Di Maria. Those four plus Rooney aside, remind me who else has put in performances worthy of praise this season?

1316~~~
It's exactly what he does, you are arguing about something that isnt even being discussed.

1317~~~
I too was looking this as I heard, Mata was buying a flat for his dad in Manchester, they have been putting off completing on the purchase for the last month or so. Word has it from the agent who organised the deal that Mata may be leaving, so of course it makes no sense for him to buy his dad a flat in a place where Mata won't be any longer.

Of course there could be other reasons he pulled out but speculation is Mata may be leaving.

1318~~~
For about 65 mins, LVG decision was vindicated. Falcao set up RVP, RVP kind of set up ADM for the 3rd goal. We were creating enough chances up to that point too.

Now let me firstly say, I want Mata to start. But, I can sort of see why RVP keeps starting games. If you watch the games, RVP is still making world class movements and runs. Di Maria keeps slotting him in atleast once every game because RVP is making the right runs. I can imagine LVG is the type of guy to see these things and think - as long as he keeps making those runs, his finishing will come back. This is just what I think is keeping RVP in the team. Rooney being captain means he plays more than most, we had to give Falcao his debut at some point...

1319~~~
Letting one of very few genuine world class number 10s leave in order to accommodate a pair of past it strikers would be the worst mistake we ever make. He's slap bang in his prime and if we continue to bench him he won't stick around much longer.

1320~~~
I don't think he'll be leaving. LvG will realise that RvP is declining (a little rapidly it seems) and make sure that Mata stays and Rooney will be playing up-front with Falcao.

1321~~~
What's all this about him leaving. Am I missing sthing?

1322~~~
Wonder what Van Gaal's reasons behind dropping Mata against Leicester were? Unless he was chatting rubbish to fit in Falcao, Rooney and Van Persie.

1323~~~
If Mata leaves i'll be very annoyed. He is one the best number 10's in the world. We'd be mental to let him go.

1324~~~
This kind of comment is utterly retarded. One might ask why you bother to read his blog if it bothers you so. By any measure, the guy comes across as a well-rounded decent fellow, the sort who is first to give credit in positive situations, and indeed, hold up his hands in negative ones. Which is more cringeworthy? A star player trying to apologize to fans, or some gimp behind a keyboard nitpicking in a desperate attempt to find things to criticize? It's obviously the latter.

1325~~~
An insight to the United's number 10 options; or rather why Mata isn't the best to play there: <a class="externalLink" href="http://livelifeunited.com/misunderstood-juan-mata/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://livelifeunited.com/misunderstood-juan-mata/</a>

1326~~~
I don't give any time to articles that use still photos to get their point across. A photo never tells the whole story, where did the ball come from earlier, what was the previous play etc. You could very easily take just as many snapshots to display him in a positive way.

1327~~~
Rumors say Leicester were too physical for him, and we wanted more protection from Rooney dropping deeper and helping out. 

What was in my opinion right decision, we didn't really miss him in that game.

1328~~~
But those photos shows where he ball comes from and his before and after positions. And the point about hi drifting out of position is true as well.

1329~~~
I understand that but you can't just look at the last 5 seconds. Was he back doing a defensive duty etc?, a photo just doesn't tell the story. He is open to analysis on his performance as much as anyone but in my opinion, he is a great number 10, one of the best in the world.

1330~~~
Really hope he's in the 10 role today. feck trying to get Van Persie firing or fit Rooney into the system.

1331~~~
That article is awful. He criticises Mata repeatedly for drifting out wide to receive the ball as, supposedly, he should stay central for the entire game. The author doesn't even acknowledge that as United were using a diamond formation, some of the attacking players will have to drift out to provide a degree of width as there are no wingers.

1332~~~
"It will be gradually better once there is a stable back-four playing together for a run of games." <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

God how long have I been hearing this line? It feels like at last 3-4 years that this is the standard excuse for our defensive shakiness yet nothing has changed we still can't field a consistent back 4 for more than a couple of games.

1333~~~
So basically the article says Mata is more of second striker than no10 in playmaker mould, because of his poor back to goal play and is best paired with one striker.

Interesting that he doesn’t feel comfortable in the role between midfield and attack and prefers to move high up the pitch to make intelligent runs.

Of course that might be instructions from LvG, but it seems Rooney played this role differently.

On the other side he is moving into pockets of space which is good, but I think it would be better if he stayed in the centre as he looks poor in wide areas IMO.

I must admit that I thought Mata is different kind of player when we got him.

1334~~~
Watching back when Neville interviewed Scholes just after he retired, and Gary asked him who is favourite PL players were, and he instantly said Mata (and Hazard) and that he loves watching Mata play, and since he signed for us they've both been fairly critical of him. Reminds me of something Fergie once said about a cow and a field.

Anyway, I hope he's back in the team today. He was getting into a nice little scoring/assisting rhythm and he shouldn't be dropped just so we can unbalance the team further and cram 3 strikers in. Mata is better for balance.

1335~~~
I know neville doesn't seem to like him, but Scholes? I don't remember hearing him being overly critical of him.

1336~~~
Scholes said he likes intelligent football with the likes of Mata and last season under Moyes was anything <i>but </i>intelligent football. I don't think anyone this season, bar Di Maria, has hit their form.

1337~~~
I don't think we missed him neither. Thought Rooney was fine in the number 10 role, but I don't buy that rumour about Leicester were too physical for him.

1338~~~
Two managers, top managers at that, have found him lacking I think rather than packing his bags, this time around, it's about time he looks into his game and think about making adjustments or else he is about to take a step down. I'd stay and fight if I were him, look to make the necessary changes if possible because it can't be a coincidence that he's lost his place for the second time in twelve months under two managers.
That being said I think Mata has a stronger case to play than Van Persie atm, though.

1339~~~
Hope Mata plays as a #10 to prove his critics wrong today!

1340~~~
However well he plays, the likes of Gary Neville will be critical of him.

1341~~~
I love Gary but that's how I feel when it comes to Mata.
Scholes criticised him a couple of times last season iirc - I suppose the whole squad was open to criticism last season to be honest but I'm not sure Mata deserved singling out at a newcomer into a poorly performing team.

1342~~~
He doesn't start again today. IM not happy.

1343~~~
Think he will be sold in January.

1344~~~
I think so. This is just the similar thing what happen to him with Mourinho.

1345~~~
This is ridiculous. Van Persie is the one who should be dropped.

1346~~~
Shame. Hopefully he can come off the bench in better circumstances than last week and perform well.

1347~~~
Our attack was perfectly fine last week and RVP scored...
Said it in the other thread but if mata wants to be starting, he needs to have di Maria levels in attack to make up for doing nothing off the ball defensively, and he's hardoh been any better then RvP.

1348~~~
Agreed. He's done.

1349~~~
Both Mourinho and van Gaal have dropped him, there appears to be more than meets the eye... Neville doesn't rate him either. He's a likable player with a beautiful touch who contributes goals and assists nearly every game, there has to be more to it.

1350~~~
Of course he wasn't going to start. LvG already mentioned that he doesn't feel Mata is a good fit for the role he needs the player behind the two strikers to play. If we stick with the 4-3-1-2 I'm almost certain Mata won't get much games this season unless someone gets injured, which is a pity.

1351~~~
An easy header which was perfectly set-up by Falcao, hardly the achievement of the season. He has been well below par.

1352~~~
It's the lack of doing anything at all defensively which hurts him. Attacking wise he's pretty much been a poacher for us, he hasn't exactly been creative or someone who can go past players. He has a good goal record because he has intelligent movement but he doesn't create loads of chances like you'd expect. And in his role, rooney will always have a better output then him.

1353~~~
Um...

1354~~~
And how has Mata been? A tap in against Sunderland and qpr, while not doing anything else, even less defensively then van Persie does? I agree RvP has been shite but mata has been equally shite which is why I don't care too much for who starts between the two.

1355~~~
Why is anyone surprised? We looked pretty good without him last week and it's not like he's done anything creatively for us. That said RVP is a bit lucky to still be starting

1356~~~
I don't see where is the problem. He was poor when he played, last week he came on and we lost a goal because of him. Also he played 5-6 games more than RVP and didn't manage to get any good for going, let RVP have that luxury too.

1357~~~
He missed a few easy chances that di Maria put him in for, his hold-up play was awful, he often dithered on the ball in attacks and just made a long pass backward, and his movement was pretty poor. Our attack definitely wasn't perfect, we lacked an actual #10 for ball rentention and controlling possession, as we are forced to put Rooney there because of van Persie.

1358~~~
In the current set-up I'd probably agree, yeah, Rooney can contribute more.

1359~~~
He has eight goals in his last ten, and has been directly involved in so many of our goals. (I'm sure someone has the specific stat for that) I'm hardly his biggest fan but he has been far, far better and deserving than van Persie to start.

1360~~~
Are you saying rooney isn't as productive as mata? Which would be completely wrong because if anything that's the best part about rooney. Always gets goals and assists. Also mata had 4 assists in 20 games for us, all last season. Hardly great numbers.

1361~~~
Disagree, Mata has been performing better al though he hasn't exactly been great either. Against QPR Mata offered more than RVP. On the basis of that, he did not deserve to be dropped, RVP did.

1362~~~
The competition for places is brilliant, Falcao and van Persie both know if they don't deliver they'll lose their place to Mata.

1363~~~
Yeah, he scored last season, so what? He also scored 2 this season in games where he wasn't very good, in the other 2 games he was probably the worst player on teh pitch.

RVP has played 4 games since the start of the season, Mata has played around 10.

1364~~~
captain, star striker and van Gaals buddy. Obviously he will miss out, said it the moment we bought Falcao. Nothing against the lineup, i think with or without Mata the quality is there, but i just think he is the easiest to drop.

1365~~~
This remains to be seen. Atm I think non of them would run the risk of losing their place to Mata not even if they fell asleep on the pitch.

1366~~~
Not sure that's true given Mata has played better that either and is the one dropped for someone who isn't as good in the position he's playing as Mata is. Give we're pretty week defensively you'd imagine this is the time to maybe go to a 5 but we're not doing that cause it means dropping one of rVP/Falcao and maybe both if we really wanted to be solid.

1367~~~
Indeed.

1368~~~
Mata is the better no 10 in my opinion, and Rooney should be played as a striker.

They should both play imo, but only one of RvP and Falcao should start. I'm surprised Van Gaal seems keen on pushing such an unbalanced formation.

1369~~~
Chelsea situation all over again.

1370~~~
Don't think its that unbalanced really. They do more defensively with rooney there but don't keep possession as well probably. Either way there isn't much in it, RvP and falcao have linked up well so far so maybe it's worth persisting with them two up top.

1371~~~
Looks like his days are numbered.

1372~~~
No disrespect to your opinion because I know you're a great poster - but surely you can see it's unbalanced to have two number 9s starting every game together in a team that lacks defensive cohesion?

I hope I'm proven wrong today, but to me starting them both seems very odd.

1373~~~
Well as long as we play 4-3-1-2 there will always be two number 9s starting. No idea why you think that's so weird.

1374~~~
I'm disappointed. He really looked excellent pulling the strings against qpr 

It should, be RVP who drops out

1375~~~
Doesn't look like it at the moment. Seems like RVP is undroppable as well.

1376~~~
But RVP is not in direct competition with Mata, is he?

I suppose it's Rooney vs Mata right now, with the former contributing more defensively. We didn't really look like missing him against Leicester, and it was probably much more difficult rival than QPR.

1377~~~
I'd take RvP at his best over Mata at his best. Unfortunately to get RvP to his best, he needs to play more and more, which means sacrificing Mata.

Basically I hope it'll be worth it long term, because right now on 'form', RvP doesn't really deserve to play ahead of him.

1378~~~
All of them are in direct competition. Rooney for me should be up top with mata behind

1379~~~
He is. He could be dropped with Rooney moving up top with Falcao and Mata playing behind them.

1380~~~
Not sure that's true to be honest.

1381~~~
And between the WC and early this season he had injuries and fitness issues, so you can't really can't that as a period of which to recover form.

1382~~~
But it’s not one-for-one situation. Dropping RVP means we’re shifting Rooney for striker so that Mata can play no10.

I’m not really bothered by that line-up, IMO good decision after last week performance.

1383~~~
He's started every game this season except for the first game against Swansea and he started every game for Holland in the WC. All under LvG.

There has to come a point where his actual form RIGHT NOW determines whether he starts or not, surely.

1384~~~
Yes it is. Mata would come in for RVP. Directly replacing him in the team.

1385~~~
I know what you mean but comparing what these three bring compared to mata behind the two of them, mata plays basically as a striker so it's not that different. Just my opinion but mata just doesn't play as a midfielder for us, at least defensively he does nothing at all.

1386~~~
-------Blind-------
Herrera---Di Maria
-------Rooney-------
<b>RVP</b>----------Falcao

-------Blind-------
Herrera---Di Maria
-------Rooney-------
<b>Mata</b>----------Falcao

Like that?

1387~~~
Rooney was announced as undroppable and he's not going to drop RVP with whom he shares a great relationship. The obvious choice here is to drop Mata. Even though RVP-Rooney has never really been a good partnership.

1388~~~
He's being Mourinho'd again.

1389~~~
No. I mean he would be replacing him in the team with RVP replacing Mata on the bench. I don't he will be playing in his position. I mean he will be taking his place in the team. It's a very simple concept.

1390~~~
He had no pre season.

1391~~~
It's a real shame, because he's such a great bloke, but his suitability for van Gaal's system overrides the fact he's a great bloke.

1392~~~
Eh? You are aware rooney can play up top....right?

1393~~~
So how can that be a DIRECT COMPETITION if we're changing Rooney position also? And IMO Wayne is the reason we're not playing Mata, not RVP.

1394~~~
Mata must be thinking deja vu.

1395~~~
If RVP was injured wouldnt he play mata with Rooney up top?  Of course they are all in completion for places.he also could play mata and Rooney in behind Falcao. It's a very flexible front line

1396~~~
Selling Mata would bother me far more than selling Welbeck did, largely because Mata is actually the best player we have at the club in his position.

Hopefully he wins LvG over but it isn't looking good for him right now...

1397~~~
Thus he should start every game? Not in my opinion.

Have to agree to disagree.

1398~~~
Rooney does offer more overall as a no. 10 no doubt.

Thing is, in all my time watching United we've never really played with an out and out playmaker like Mata. It's usually a striker dropping deep like Rooney, Cantona, Yorke, Sheringham etc. or a midfielder pushing up like Scholes.

I'm not sure if we can accommodate a player like him at the moment especially with RVP looking really really good today.

1399~~~
Because RVP and Mata are fighting a place in the starting XI. Basically there are 3 positions which Falcao, Rooney, RVP and Mata are competing for. Therefore they are in DIRECT COMPETITION with one another for those 3 positions. Your just being pedantic if you consider that not to be DIRECT COMPETITION. It's a very simple concept to be honest so I don't how you can't understand it! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1400~~~
Arguably RVP could be dropped to make way for Mata. We could play with Falcao as the long striker up top and have either Rooney or Mata play slightly on the wing.

1401~~~
You acknowledged that he wouldn't be playing in his position, yet you say it's direct competition. For me it isn't, if LvG wants to play 2 strikers and he prefers Rooney in no10 position then he's fighting with Wayne. Everything else means we're changing shape.

1402~~~
Not repeating what I've already said. Everyone else on here seems to understand that RVP and Mata are in direct competition. If you can't get your head around that fact then fair enough.

1403~~~
After Rooney's stupidity, Mata will get some game time over the next few weeks.

1404~~~
And if we play better with Mata than with Rooney?

We all know the outcome - Mata back on the bench!

1405~~~
At least we will see Mata behind RvP and Falcao in the next game now.

1406~~~
Three games with Mata as the 10 is fine by me... Will finally show LVG what he brings as the 10 with two tactically and positionally disciplined strikers in front of him. All this talk of him not showing enough defensively for a 10: did Kaka show such defensive work in a similar system at Milan? Of course not, they are both playmakers. They're job is to probe the opposition's defence, not fortify ours.

1407~~~
Spot on, same with Ozil/Silva.

1408~~~
It feels like this is a similar situation to the one Mata faced at Chelsea and it hasn't surprised me at all that Rooney has started the last two games for us. While Rooney isn't a better #10, his understanding is significantly better as he's more positionally disciplined. Didn't Van Gaal say something about Mata not impressing him in the role? 

Mata is a very good player, but when it comes to systems like ours in which he has to press high and be expected to play as the link man in the middle, he'll come up short. I believe the following reasons are why Van Gaal has opted for Rooney in the past two games:

1) Mata struggles physically. Doesn't press well and does have the tendency of being "lazy", but this is a minor point as we're not challenging for the league.

2) Doesn't play like a #10 should. Doesn't possess the control and skill Silva and Özil have which allows them to play in tight spaces. Often finds himself moving laterally to try and find space but that results to blocking passing lanes. That's why you'll notice him 

3) Poor under pressure - lacking the agility to turn - and doesn't shield the ball well hence he moves away from the middle to find space. Against Leicester he was pressured and did what he usually does in such situations - he panicked and didn't protect the ball.

Chelsea replaced Mata with Oscar and immediately they functioned better as a team, and not because Oscar is a better #10 but because he excelled in key areas of Mourinho's system. Rooney has come in and done better in the role, and again that isn't because he's a better #10.

1409~~~
Pretty sure he's toast in January/summer, but hopefully he impresses during Rooney's three-game absence. Don't be surprised to see Januzaj get some games though!

1410~~~
Why the feck did we get rid of kagawa if LVG doesn't want to play Mata?

1411~~~
Yeah, Gary Neville just wanted the excuse to stick up for his mate Wayne when he said as such last week. Couldn't believe he said it actually... The truth was, LVG backed himself into a corner with his undroppable line a couple of days prior and because Rooney wasn't as good as the striker and Mata isn't as big a name or his favourite, he put Rooney in his place.

1412~~~
Rooney and positionally disciplined do not go together. He's a numpty positionally. Will pop up at the fullback position just cos he fancied it, RVP said he was in his areas after Olympiakos away, his performance against Everton away was the perfect example of this also, constantly barging into Mata and Kagawa's position, pretty much stifled them and prevented us from building any kind of momentum. He should either be a 9, or he can get benched. Simples.

1413~~~
Kagawa would have been perfect in this system, adept at the press and would have kept the ball better than anyone else in our team.. But we were 3-5-2 at that time, and he probably would not have been as good a fit there. Mata is just more ruthless as the 10, plays that role perfectly in any system. LVG just dropped one of his notoriously big bollocks in naming Rooney captain. Hopefully, he'll realise that and act accordingly...

1414~~~
I don't think Rooney is the ideal fit for the position, but he's the best we have at the moment unless Mata performances in the next couple of games (assuming he plays). You'll know that I'm not a fan of him as a #10 because positionally he can be average, doesn't provide enough creativity, and his passing and touch are inconsistent, but we're playing a different system and he's done well so far. Conversely, Mata has shown no improvement between the lines and that's a concern, and it's not something that can be improved on. Still early on in the season of course and I have no idea how Van Gaal wants to play.

1415~~~
Yeh, I agree, Mata isn't perfect. But at the very least, he will control the ball, pass it and more often than not choose the right option... We can't say the same about Rooney. Both are very similar in that they aren't the total package as a 10, but despite that their numbers in terms of goals and assists are always there or thereabouts. They'll score and they'll assist. What Mata gives us is a better retainer of possession and someone who will always look for a goal. Rooney gives us the workrate, but where he loses out to Mata is that he won't put our defence under as much pressure because of a stupid decision or a stray pass which Rooney does. And he doesn't slow us down in the final third, it's usually one or two touch with him. Rooney on the other hand, just lumps it to Valencia on the diagonal or takes two or three (usually poor) touches before giving it to a more often than not, marked RVP... It will simply make it so much easier for both our defence and our midfield if Mata was there instead.

Kagawa should not have been sold. He would have been perfect for us in this system, but the 37m lumped on Mata in January necessitated the sale.

1416~~~
I think there's been a little bit too much emphasis placed on the difference Mata could possibly make if he was placed into the team. Yes, he is a superb player, but aside from the QPR game he hasn't exactly been superb this season. In fact, he was very poor in the draw to Burnley to the point where a lot of people were completely writing him off.

Granted, I'm looking forward to seeing how he plays presuming he gets more starts while Rooney is suspended and if he delivers and fits in perfectly then I'm happy to sacrifice one of our forwards for him to play, but I don't think it's a guarantee that he's going to deliver a series of superb performances. I hope he does, since he's one of the best assets we have when he does, but it's no guarantee that we'll improve massively with him.

1417~~~
There has to be a way to utilize Rooney's off the ball work rate and Mata's effectiveness in attack and generally better possession play. Rooney wants to play everywhere and do everything anywhere so I don't see any harm in allowing him to do that alongside Falcao with Mata moving into pockets of space in and around the box. Said it last week, Mata's problem is not Rooney but the manager who can't bring himself to drop Van Persie. Mata also needs to modify his game a bit because when we play him behind the strikers we want him to create not to be one of the people who require service from midfield.

1418~~~
Well he now has 3 games to convince LVG. Not going to be easy against Everton and Chelsea.

1419~~~
Looks like Mata is the new RedCafe sweeatheart, after the previous ones Welbeck and Kagawa were sold. Well, at least he is actually good at playing football...

1420~~~
I don't understand this clamor for Mata. At no point in the last 2 games have I thought "We really need Mata here". We've looked brilliant going forward without him. Mata's problem is that he doesn't provide enough creativity while being poor defensively. If he can change that in the next 3 games one of the forwards could be dropped when Rooney comes back.

1421~~~
The strange thing is that he was getting ridiculous levels of criticism a few weeks back after his poor performance in the draw against Burnley. A couple of weeks out of the side after a massive improvement against QPR, and suddenly it's unfair that he's not starting and LVG is showing too much favouritism to RVP and Rooney. I really like Mata and hope he impresses presuming he starts while Rooney is suspended, but I think some people are going overboard with the supposed impact he'll have considering Rooney himself has put in some decent performances recently.

1422~~~
Tut tut

1423~~~
A chance for him now with Rooney out. Hopefully he takes the chance.

1424~~~
I'd be gutted if we get rid of him in January.

1425~~~
We always seem to have one player that has a very vocal and resolute fanbase that is more interested in him than the team, first there were the Berbatovians, then the Kagawaites and now the Matalans.

1426~~~
I don't buy this nonsense of the club looking to offload him in January or even next summer. I don't think we are in a position to be selling players, especially our best players. If we reach our targets this season (qualifying for the Champions League) we are going to need quality in depth. We are going to need players like Mata in Europe.

1427~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1428~~~
We won't be getting rid of Mata at all. Don't worry

1429~~~
Would be plain stupid to sell Mata after getting rid of Kagawa and ripped off by Dortmund in the process.

1430~~~
The Rooneyans also belong to that group.

1431~~~
They're like a cockroach that persisted while the other groups died actually.

1432~~~
If thats the case, then I am a Januzajvian.

1433~~~
I'm still a van Persian myself.

1434~~~
I am a Di Mariaian and an ardent De Geaian.

1435~~~
Concerned about Mata's future at OT. LVG doesn't seem to rate him. They're so many rumors right now about him leaving the club as early as the January transfer window. Its worrying, because almost every strong rumor about player exits has come to fruition under LVG. Even though it was somewhat expected, rumors over Welbeck, Hernandez and Nani leaving the club all came to reality. The same almost happened with Fellaini before his injury. Could letting Mata go be a big mistake?

1436~~~
If LVG is adamant we're getting CL next season, then it's incredibly short-sighted to start shifting players now... we'll need a bigger squad next season.

1437~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://juanmata8.com/blog/en/a-seguir-sumando/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://juanmata8.com/blog/en/a-seguir-sumando/</a>

His recent blog is up too.

1438~~~
What happens if he doesnt perform in these 3 games to the level LVG expects,he could end up being benched alot this season ?
Ive liked what Ive seen in the games he's played under LVG especially in pre season but something tells me he may not get too much game time as a starter.

1439~~~
I've not read every post but in Mata's case i hope no one is writing anything stupid about selling him or worrying about where he will play.

Squads are not made up of just 11 players...one injury or suspension and Mata is back in the team...like he will be on Sunday!

1440~~~
Don't be surprised if Juan soon makes us ask "Wayne who?"

1441~~~
Arguably we have already seen this when he got benched after a great game against QPR. I think chances are good he's off no matter what. Him having good games should help our asking price though, so let's hope he delivers.

1442~~~
He's so cute isn't he?

1443~~~

1444~~~
The diamond will suit Mata perfectly. Shaw and Rafael bombing on out wide, and the movement of AdM, Falcao and RvP will give him plenty of options.

He really is our best #10 in my opinion and I hope he's able to show it over the next few games.

1445~~~
Unfortunate for Mata that Herrera is out at the <i>exact</i> time Mata is gonna be getting some game time.

1446~~~
He's not in the Spain squad for their upcoming friendlies. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/european-championship-qualifying/story/2068620/diego-costa-named-in-spain-squad-for-euro-2016-qualifiers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/european-champ...named-in-spain-squad-for-euro-2016-qualifiers</a>

1447~~~
Good. No injuries to worry.

1448~~~

1449~~~
Oh well, I was hoping Januzaj would get a chance but good opportunity for Mata.

1450~~~
Yay Mata <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Hope he makes himself undroppable.

1451~~~
Just watching MUTV now, pretty much confirmed Mata and McNair will be starting.

1452~~~
Yup, he's starting. Van Gaal just confirmed it. Good news.

1453~~~
I'm confused, just a few weeks ago he said he was unhappy with Mata in the #10 role, now he's saying he's happy with him there. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1454~~~
I think he was talking about Mata in the CM and not as #10.

1455~~~
I think that whole unsatisfied comment by van Gaal was solely directed at one game. He wasn't happy with their performances in their roles in one game. We can all see what a great 10 Mata is, I'm pretty sure van Gaal can too. Was blown way out of context in my opinion.

Good to see him start though.

1456~~~
How come he is no longer called for his national team? He wasn't called for the last 2 games either.

1457~~~
He has never been a starter for them. Has always managed to get into the tournament squads though, but in between the tournaments he has always been in and out of the team. So he is definitely not getting picked then if he is not even playing at club level.

1458~~~
Hopefully Juan Mata is not the new Shinji Kagawa and we won't have people questioning if he is United quality.

1459~~~
I love Mata

1460~~~
Me too <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I'm doing everything I can not to become Mad Winger MkII. 

It might be a bit daft, but I'm desperate for Mata to be a success here because of everything he represents. Let the good guy win for a change <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1461~~~
There should always be place for a player like Mata at United. Football IQ, touch and grace...
Hope he'll stay for many years.

1462~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYdytRdC_BM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

That touch <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> He's so adorable.

1463~~~
I think it's more of a case of cramming Rooney into the team because he's the captain, rather than preferring him to Mata.

1464~~~
He wouldn't have chosen Rooney as the captain if he wanted to 'cram' him in.

1465~~~
I am not someone who likes Rooney as number 10 but I don't think that's the case. Rooney gives us more defensive cover as a number 10 than Mata. Surely Van Gaal must be placing some value to that quality.

1466~~~
There is a certain Dutch striker and another Columbian striker we recently signed. I contend that if Van Gaal wanted he could play both Mata and Rooney within the same side and have Rooney's defensive cover but it will be at the expense of RVP, that is the one thing LVG is unwilling to contemplate.

1467~~~
Mata is a clear step above Shinji. He has more goals for us already and he is yet to be with us a year!

1468~~~
A hat-trick of assists and a couple of goals this weekend please. I would really love for him to be starting every game. Mata, Herrera and Di Maria is enough to make a grown man erect.

1469~~~
Completely invisible today.

1470~~~
Did well for the goal but not much other than really, he certainly lacks rooney's presence in that role.

1471~~~
Anonymous.

1472~~~
The commentator was saying that, i thought he was decent, always involved in all our build up play.

1473~~~
Terrible match, only the assist to save his performance. Too weak on the ball, too hesitant with his passing and too afraid to shoot it.

1474~~~
Yeah he'll have wished for a better performance today.

1475~~~
Playing Mata and VP in the same side slows everything down for me.

Rooney was a big miss.

1476~~~
Should've gone off for Fellaini.

1477~~~
Difficult for him when the team are not in control. He struggles when we sit back.

1478~~~
Very poor

1479~~~
He's becoming a problem. He's not a patch on the Chelsea Mata.

1480~~~
Aye he had a poor game today. Didn't get involved in much at all.

1481~~~
Rooney will walk back into the team no problem when he's back... We're too lightweight in the middle with mata there. He didn't do badly really, he got an assist for di Maria but he didn't really do much overall.

1482~~~
He was quite average today. He wasn't awful, but was just kind of anonymous at certain points and didn't have much of a presence on the pitch. If he wants to keep a first team place then he'll have to improve massively in his next couple of games.

1483~~~
Where are all 'Rooney shouldnt be a nr. 10' moaners right now..

1484~~~
Matches like these is why you start to see where LVG is coming from when he drops Mata for Rooney.

1485~~~
Agreed. He does have the excuse of not having games but Rooney offers more.

1486~~~
Not player to turn the tide, goes with the flow, if you are struggling he does absolutely nothing to stem the tide.

1487~~~
Too weak, gets shrugged off quite easily. Lacks some pace too, and at this moment, I'd take Rooney over him TBH.

1488~~~
I thought he was decent enough. Better than the two forwards anyway imo. His issue though is his strength. He gets shrugged off the ball quite easily at times which is frustrating. Certainly something that wouldn't happen to Rooney. Though I'd rather both Rooney and Mata play anyway.

1489~~~
There was a number of occasions where if he turned towards the opposition goal a couple of our players were in good positions. Instead, he just passed it back first time, under no pressure.

1490~~~
Mata has become a bit average really. Really strange, he was so good for Chelsea... where has that player gone. Now he is as inspiring with his footballing solutions as Antonio Valencia.

1491~~~
He's low on confidence now. No idea what the feck happened to him. He used to be one of our best players.

1492~~~
Had an ok game, but beyond the assist never really got going. Shame as it would have been good to see him really stake a claim with Rooney out.

1493~~~
Fed up with Mata. V quiet again, no pace, slowed down all of our attacks. Adnan should get a chance

1494~~~
He was average. Don't think he was poor or anything, was just not overly impressive. Don't expect him to hold his spot from Rooney.

1495~~~
Mata didn't have a brilliant game today, it happens, not such a big deal. However, it was the type of game that he had that concerned me. It wasn't so much that he had a heavy touch, or misplaced passes, or anything like that. What worried me was just how much the game passed him by. Mata's main problems have always been his lack of defensive workrate and lack of pace, but today we saw something else, we saw him be a passenger even on attack.

Still, I'm willing to bet that it's nothing more than a quiet game. For the amount of talent he clearly has and the number of good games he's had for us, some people are writing him off way too easily.

1496~~~
He's so far off his best it's a shame.

He needs to waken up, he's sleep walking through games and looks very labored!

1497~~~
Very quiet game, this was his chance to show why he should be starting ahead of Rooney - but his presence was almost non-existent during the second half.
Good assist for the first goal, should've at least hit his shot on target when AdM crossed to him, other than that not many good memorable moments.

1498~~~
I agree with the general comments on today's performance. Despite his assist, he didn't do much. I'd like to see him commanding the ball off players.

1499~~~
Assist, fair enough but besides that he was terrible. Worst performance since joining but he's been consistent until now so I'm not worried at all.

1500~~~
Thought he was poor today. Would still have him over Rooney at #10 every time though.

1501~~~
He's like the complete opposite to the player I thought we were buying. I thought he'd be the type of player that would help us control games, keep possession, and create plenty of chances. In actual fact, its the opposite. Its like playing with 10 men at times, he constantly loses the ball, doesn't get involved much, but consistently pops up with goals, and assists. Its really strange.

Could any Chelsea lads shed any light on this? <a class="username" data-user="10007, @duffer" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/10007/">@duffer</a>

1502~~~
I was disappointed with him today, nothing really seemed to come off for him. Hope he puts this behind him because we have 2 important games coming up with him nailed to start in the hole.

1503~~~
Too slow.  He wants 25 yards of space on the ball in the final third where in the BPL you are lucky to get 25 inches in those positions.  He usually produces one or two good moments a match, like the assist to ADM today, but for most of teh match he just slows us down.  Won't hold his place when Rooney is back.  Of course, with RVP looking so bad, we can either play Roo as a striker alongside Falcao, in which case Mata probably plays, or we bench our two dead weights in RVP and Mata and give Januzaj a fair run of games.

1504~~~
This,  although he needs to grow a pair of testicles.  The volley in particular is a situation any offensive player has to swing a leg at. 

Conversely his assist is a situation a Rooney shoots straight at the first man and we potentially get hit on the counter.

A mixed bag really although I do think his build up work is underrated (several occasions where most players lose the ball with a poor first touch, he kills it dead and drops it off). 

6.5 out of 10

1505~~~
The thing is, he kind of was this player when he first arrived. He was arguably the best footballer we had outfield in the second half of last season, being one of the only players to offer any creativity or imagination on the ball. Recently though, he's really not been doing that and hasn't stood out at all.

1506~~~
I thought he was very poor today. Pretty much a passenger a lot of the time and doesn't have the athleticism to pull his weight defensively or in 50/50 situations when he is having an off day. He still has all the technical ability in the locker though and will have some great performances in the future I'm sure.

1507~~~
Imo, it's like the Hernandez situation.  Has lost a bit of confidence and is too anxious.

Makes sense to me that if you know you're going to get regular games, you can perform more naturally.  If you're fighting for your place, knowing that even if you do perform well, there's no guarantee - well, it has to affect you.

1508~~~
Honestly wasn't impressed by Mata today. He needs to be doing much better.

1509~~~
He has found himself in a very difficult situation.

If we continue with the diamond, I don’t see him in the first eleven. Rooney looks better at the tip of the diamond for me, plus he offers so much more defensively. He won’t play as a striker ahead of RVP/Falcao. We also have two youngsters waiting for the chance.

If we switch to 4-3-3 there is no place for Mata either. I can only see him excelling in 4-2-3-1 as a proper number 10 (although he looks more of a false nine to me), but that means we play only one striker, and I don’t see that happening for now. It's not like we have a lot of games to rotate too.

Today he was quite poor, didn’t offer much bar good positioning in the box. What worries me is that he doesn’t try to control the game at all, just gives the ball back.

1510~~~
I'm not sure. You could argue it's the case, but then shouldn't all top players have to fight for their places? I think Hernandez was more of a case of a player who struggled to find top form because he was only getting glimpses in the team, but Mata is still getting a decent amount of football, even if he's not starting all the time. It's not just today he's performed poorly - he wasn't all that great against Burnley a few weeks ago, or in the early games of the season. Conversely, his best performance came against QPR, around a time when his place was expected to be under threat because Falcao had arrived.

1511~~~
I'd rather buy Barkley for that position at the tip of the diamond.. Mata was piss poor today, adds no drive to the game and keeps it far too simple.. you need to be probing and creating havoc.. that position is basically a free role, go cause havoc!?

1512~~~
He needs to be doing much better than he has been. Did well for the first goal but that aside he was largely invisible, slow and ponderous on the ball.

1513~~~
I dont know if Juan was playing to instructions or not but he hardly dropped deep to drop to collect the ball. He does that regularly. Apart from the assist,so so really.

1514~~~
Was expecting more from him today. Just dawdled on the ball too much today and his passing wasn't it's usual quickness.

1515~~~
Yeah that was annoying. Rooney's been doing it really well this season, coming deep and making it almost a midfield 4, Mata did the total opposite today. Kept getting the ball passing it wide, then running into the box.

1516~~~
Clearly has a lot of skill and ability, but needs more tenacity and urgency. With Carrick coming back, Herrera's good start and Rooney after his ban competing for places in the diamond he might have to settle for knowing he's not first choice. I would actually prefer Herrera right behind the strikers with Rooney/RVP and Falcao up front.

1517~~~
The one thing that stands out for me is his lack of athleticism or athletic presence. I mean he can't run, jump, and has no height or weight. He's really good with the ball but without it he's just not very good. It really holds him back I think.

1518~~~
His lack of athleticism really does hold him back, sadly.

1519~~~
Yes. Irrespective of whether we actually needed to buy him, I think we seriously overpaid, as I think will be borne out when we offload him for somewhere in the £18-22 million range.

1520~~~
Had OK game but it also showed why Rooney is more valuable in that role. Rooney gives the required goals and assists and also offers more in tracking back. I will hate to lose Mata and if we get back in Europe, we will need him, add to the fact that with him there is chance to tweak with formations for certain games but Rooney absolutely has to start over him in no. 10 role in current formation.

1521~~~
He was very poor today. Assist or no assist.

1522~~~
It's a bit disappointing to see such a timid performance from a player who must know he is not assured of a place. He had his moment but there just wasn't enough happening. 

I don't think van Persie is helping anyone around him at the moment but Mata's inability to impose himself is worrying regardless of what is happening in front of him.

1523~~~
He's got so much quality on the ball but that makes no difference if you're not imposing yourself on the game. At times I even forgot he was out there because it was our other players winning their battles or troubling their defence. Players like Falcao and Di Maria have such good movement he should be feeding some really clever passes into them. Everton just hustled him out of the game and forced him to be too negative with his play. He's got 2 more chances to impress otherwise Rooney is justifiably coming back in.

1524~~~
Needs to impose himself a bit more on the game, I am desperate for him to perform better.

1525~~~
Heh, goes to show you can see an entirely different game when you're at the ground. I thought he had a very good game funnily enough. Some excellent touches, and neat passing that really set us on our way... he used his quick feet to his advantage a lot today to get out of tight spots, knock the ball in the right direction at the correct time.

But considering I look to be the only person with this opinion, maybe I'm wrong.

1526~~~
I am not too bothered about his defensive weaknesses, it's his lack of  creativity that's the issue. He's basically a 3rd CF something people accuse Rooney of . I'd play januzaj next game.

1527~~~
I feel Mata can only play if we drop RVP or Falcao.  And play him alongside them and put someone more influential into midfield.

1528~~~
He wasn't that bad, RVP i felt was the bigger culprit in terms of poor performances, and if it wasnt for a goal Falcao aswell

1529~~~
I just don't think he does enough in that role at the tip of the diamond, he doesn't dictate the game the way Silva does and he doesn't have the explosiveness and workate to play as an AM in the role. He's really become a second striker who would probably be better off pushed further up nearer Falcao or RvP with either Rooney or Herrera in the AM/#10 role.

1530~~~
Spanish Ozil.

1531~~~
I'd play him against West Brom, but I fear that he'll be a passenger against Chelsea. Therefore, I would play a midfield of:

This midfield four will have the energy, grit and counter attacking ability to trouble Chelsea, in my opinion. Just hope Herrera's back.

1532~~~
Very harsh, that. He puts up figures that Ozil would pine for.

1533~~~
He needs to learn to drop deep and work hard else he will end up in the same way Berba and JSV did.

1534~~~
He'll thrive when our team- especially our attack- is more settled. Everton was always going to be tough for him tbh, they had an extra man in midfield and Mata had to contend with both Besic and Barry. He does seem to always be good for a goal a game though. Either creating or scoring.

1535~~~
I thought he played well in the 1st half, but faded after half time when Everton began to press more. He could have done with dropping deeper to help Blind out in midfield a bit more (something which Rooney generally does pretty well), although what we were really missing in there was Herrera.

Overall I doubt Mata did much to persuade Van Gaal that Rooney needs to be dropped in favour of him, but if it were me picking the side, on current form it would be Van Persie that misses out, rather than Mata/Rooney/Falcao.

1536~~~
I do wonder why he struggles so much physically. Yes he's small, but so are the likes of Herrera, Silva, Di Maria etc etc So why does Mata get so easily pushed off the ball?

1537~~~
Herrera is 6ft, Di Maria is 5'11'', 4-5in taller than Mata.

1538~~~
I was thiniking more in terms of body size. I mean Di Maria looks as skinny as a rake but you very rarely see him out muscled on the ball. Mata sometimes seems as weak as a leaf. Its really annoying as his abilty on the ball can be spectacular.

1539~~~
He was a passenger today, a few nice touches but didn't get a grip on the game 

I thought he was too advanced and there was so much space in front of Blind he should have been dropping into to pick up the ball

1540~~~
That's the thing though, he can't afford to be only thrive when the attack is all rosey. The good part about him is that he has been contributing to goals and assists.

1541~~~
Mata has two things against him for me. Firstly his obvious lack of acceleration, which during today's game I noticed meant that instead of receiving the ball on the turn and breaking forward, he got caught up by Everton's attacking players as they tracked back and had to avoid their challenges before releasing the ball. Secondly he can be overpowered and dispossessed pretty easily, his poor ability to hold up the ball left us open on the counter on the few occasions in the last 10 minute where we'd managed to get the ball upfield.

That being said, neither of these criticisms are anything new. I still think he's great and obviously his productivity is through the roof and in most games I think he should take the #10 position. However, when we're under the kosh a bit like at the end of today's game, the likes of Rooney and Januzaj are far better at relieving pressure from the defence and that should probably be taken into consideration when the fixture list starts throwing up the top teams.

1542~~~
The excuses look more and more daft each week tbh. Sick of saying it but if he wants to be a United player HE needs to do more. If he needs everyone else to do that for him, then he's little more than an obstacle. 

We can build a great team around Mata and hope he starts playing well, or we can just build a great team around players who already play well. One of these options is easier and much, much more sensible than the other.

That said I wouldn't say he isn't working hard enough. It's more that he just isn't doing enough. He puts a shift in, and he makes runs, but he gets the ball and takes too long to do nothing with it. He closes people down and takes up his position off the ball, but in a way that means he may as well not be there. 

He needs to grow a set basically, and play as if he thinks he's the best player on the pitch. Instead of just being a smoothed up Tom Cleverley.

1543~~~
Did alright. Wasn't part of our buildup enough, as usual. I don't see the need for him playing like a striker when we already have rvp and Falcao on the pitch. In this set up, mata needs to show why he's relevant imo. He can get goals playing right up too. We need creativity and playmaking from the guy at no 10.

1544~~~
Other than the lay off to di Maria he did nothing, too much of a luxury in this current setup, don't see him being a success with two up front because you end up with three players all stood centrally, offering nothing in wider areas and leaving the rest of the team exposed. He can only succeed if we start playing with one up front and more width either side of him, he just isn't mobile and athletic enough to be effective unless he is surrounded by movement and pace.

1545~~~
His habit of losing the ball in dangerous areas just because of a lack of awareness is pissing me off a bit. Gets pushed  off the ball too easily.

1546~~~
This is the biggest problem with him and is the reason he loses out to Rooney because even if Rooney's passing is inconsistent he, at least, gets involved in the build up play and is a factor off the ball. We should have never signed him as we wouldn't have let Kagawa go and he would thrive in this particular set up. I don't have that big a problem with his shit defensive game but he should be justifying his selection by running the game, like when we were under the cosh you'd expect him to keep hold of the ball, pass it about and relieve the pressure.

1547~~~
For how long is it going to be a case of "he'll thrive when..."?
Di Maria's been here a matter of weeks and he's thriving just fine.

You can argue that Everton are a tough team, but Silva would leave his mark on this sort of game. The problem is Mata's not actually going to influence games at all like Silva. He'll score and assist, but half the time he'll be pretty anonymous. 

It's got nothing to do with the lack of quality around him, and everything to do with his style of play. Just not that suited to our style of play going forward. 

The sooner people accept that he's a good goalscorer/assister, but not a proper no.10 - the better.

1548~~~
even with a couple poor games his recent goal scoring record is incredible. The criticism is ridiculous here.

1549~~~
Not enough upper body strength ?  I have no idea but one thing I do know is that it's got nothing to do with his height as there are plenty of short players who are tough to dispossess.

1550~~~
We really shouldn't build the team around Mata, even if he's playing well. He's just not the sort of player to build a team around, in my opinion.

He hits good numbers, but he's really not someone who can consistently hold the ball and dictate a game, which is what you need when you build your team around a 'no.10'.

1551~~~
I expected him to take that cross from Di Maria on the volley and hit the target, a rebound would have likely fallen for one of our strikers but he's just taking too many touches and being a little too passive as of now. He's got two more games to show something but playing him clearly means lesser defensive presence in the middle of the field and lack of someone who'd drop back to add possession. I like him a lot but he's got to show more to his game to justify that position.

1552~~~
Was also hoping he'd take corner duties from Di Maria, he's done a good job at Chelsea with those and Di Maria has been rather poor from set pieces.

1553~~~
No, I totally agree with you and I was there also. He's never going to be a 'power player'. Not sure why people are expecting him to be something he isn't, and wasn't at Chelsea. He's a clever little player who can make the telling difference, and he did that (yet again) today.

Always wanted the ball, and usually did something good with it.

1554~~~
This.

<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1556~~~
Hasn't been the same player since Mourinho shot his confidence to shit

1557~~~
Isn't today an example?

1558~~~
As a scorer assister you can rack up the figures in shite season for the team but a team with our defense needs the total package, someone who will post the figures but dominate crucial phases of the game. In this situation we can not have both him, Van Persie and Falcao in the same side. Decisions have to be made in the summer.

1559~~~
Explain to me how you can you score and set up goals and yet be anonymous?

1560~~~
I don't really see why Mourinho should get any blame for Mata not delivering for us. He looked excellent when he first came and showed glimpses of his true ability, but has flattered to deceive this season for the most part. If he's affected so much by being dropped by a former manager, even now he's at a different club, then that's not Mourinho's fault.

1561~~~
For shame, Noodles.

1562~~~
He worded it quite poorly, but Mata getting an assist today doesn't mean he made a superb contribution to the game overall. Barring that, he was fairly quiet and didn't have much of an impact. For a player who's entire role involves being involved and actually making an impact, that's quite disappointing. Strikers arguably have more leeway in that they can get away with scoring but performing poorly, however creative players like Mata are expected to do just that - create.

Ironically, some people had been calling for LVG to drop RVP for Mata, despite the fact that RVP had managed to score despite playing poorly in a couple of games himself.

1563~~~
I don't see any difference in Mata's performances this season than last season personally, lots of goals and the odd assist without ever really running the show like Silva does for City and like Mata did pre Mourinho at Chelsea

1564~~~
I said "<i>half the time"</i> he'll be anonymous. 
Today for example, he contributed very little to the team controlling the game - which, as a no.10. should be his role. 
The fact that he had one moment higher up the pitch doesn't disguise the fact that the game pretty much passed him by.

The sort of master-class Silva gave yesterday could never come from Mata. And it's got nothing to do with having poor team-mates. 
Swap them today, and Silva looks class here, and consistently contributes to us controlling games much better. 

Silva might not assist or score as many, but he leaves a bigger mark on the game as a no. 10. You can build around him so much more. 
Mata's a numbers man. He'll score and assist, but - like Rooney - almost at the expense of cohesion and of dictating the game.

1565~~~
Mata was clearly one of our better players when he arrived last season, and was technically above numerous players in our side. He often looked like one of the few players who could actually do something different and creative in a side which played some dire, unimaginative football.

Of course, our team in general has already improved massively this season, but Mata himself has been really quiet and anonymous at times for us. He's not been overly creative or imaginative when on the ball.

I don't think it's fair to blame his struggles on Mourinho. Perhaps you'd have had a point if he was still at Chelsea, but again, if Mata's still struggling with confidence because a guy who managed him nearly a year ago wasn't a big fan of him, then that's his own mentality problem.

1566~~~
Well said. In a nutshell he needs to pull his finger out and grow a set or else he is going the way of Berbatov, Veron and Kagawa. And we are rich enough not to worry too much about his transfer fee....

1567~~~
Mata didn't run the show at Chelsea:

a) The show was rubbish. They were poor in the league for the two years Mata was there.
b) they played back to front with a lack of discipline and didn't keep the ball that well. He scored and assisted lots in a pretty poor side that didn't control games very well, but he didn't run any show anything like Silva does at City.

1568~~~
I don't think his form is any much different to how he's played since coming here tbh. It's pretty funny really, as the majority of this forum were singing his praises last season at anything he did no matter how large or small, yet now when he's not really doing much different, he gets slated. Maybe because our level of players have risen since the arrival of of a certain few and people are now viewing what the likes are Di Maria is achieving in a United shirt and comparing that to what Mata offers? Up to now though, his form for United has never been close to his best form at Chelsea and for some reason he just doesn't look like he fits in with our attacking play when we aim to counter fast. Time will tell I suppose whether he is the right fit for us.

1569~~~
He was awful today, you know his limitations are strength and pace and you can accept that if he is displaying his touch, passing, movement, composure etc, but he just wasn't at the races on the ball, very indecisive and lacked confidence, wasted some very good attacking possession.

1570~~~
Did Jose sell us a dud?

1571~~~
You forget Mata's performances against us then

It doesn't matter how good or bad Chelsea were Mata was taking games by the scruff of their neck nonetheless something he hasn't done at all at United

1572~~~
He's a class player but you just have to look at the whole package. You need to build the side around him and accept that he'll be a passenger defensively, but you want to get him on the ball with space to pick the opposition apart often too. Some might see this as clutching at straws but it does make a difference playing as a 10 behind one or 2 strikers. He's limited in that he can only play as an attacking midfielder because of his lack of any physical qualities pretty much, meaning he can only play in a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1. We have better attacking players like Di maria, world class strikers like Falcao, Rooney and Van Persie and just someone else in his position who offers a lot more defensively, and more goals and assists as well (Rooney). He doesn't look poor or anything, it's just with the competition he has for his spot, he doesn't make enough of an impact or just isn't as good as Di Maria going forward to have us build our team around him and make him undroppable. Then once a player isn't an automatic first choice player anymore, they lose confidence and just generally don't play as well as when they are always first choice.

1573~~~
He took games by the scruff of the neck in the sense that he scored and assisted. But he never showed the ability to dictate games consistently or run the show like Silva. It's just not his game.
I don't think he's much worse than he was a Chelsea - he's still scoring and assisting. He's just playing for a manager who actually demands a degree of discipline and control from his side, and in a side who aren't completely Gung-ho, like Di Matteo's.

1574~~~

1575~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1576~~~
Becoming the new Kagawa. Does feck all yet people want us to build the team around him. For all his obvious talent he's been a disappointing signing so far

1577~~~
Out of curiosity, if someone offered 38 million for him in January, would you sell? I would

1578~~~
No

He might not be 'first' choice but he's still quality

1579~~~
Yes, because there's no point keeping a player who's going to warm the bench when a team would be willing to offer 38M for him. We'd be better off getting a squad player for less money, who suits Van Gaal's philosophy better.

1580~~~
a. I don't think anyone will offer us anywhere near 38M for him... but they might offer us 25M for him and I would probably take it.

b. Yes he set up a goal and had a decent (yet not spectacular) 60 mins but he should never have been on the pitch at the end of this game or any other game when we are defending a one goal lead.  He is a defensive liability (as he was vs Leicester).  I was stunned when LVG took off Valencia, who I thought put in a fairly decent shift today and certainly offers much better strength on the ball and miles better defensive coverage than Mata.

1581~~~
For 38m you really do need first choice. I think LVG would sell for that as well. If Fabregas was sat in there today you'd see a far better player.

1582~~~
Err if you are not aware of LVG being a huge believer in best form of defence is attack you really need to look at our 2 striker formation again at the expense of a midfielder.....

1583~~~
It may be time to admit that this type of player just doesn't fit what we do.  Easier to take now that the preferred alternative isn't to stick it wide to Young and Valencia for the whole match.

Edit: I very much mean it only "may" be.  I'm far from writing Mata off as a bad fit yet.

1584~~~
Essentially he's got a three part audition.  And though he didn't really fluff the first one, it was just a bit meh.

1585~~~
A performance to some up all his performances today. I don't think he has hit top level this season yet still produces an assist but needs to be more involved overall a 6/10 max, it wasn't his best day

1586~~~
This is exactly what I felt seeing his performances of late. He slows the game (as does RvP) way too much for my liking.

1587~~~
If Rooney will give this kind of performance some here would be saying he needs to be dropped.

He was very sloppy on the ball and give nothing in defense. I remember him got knocked off the ball 2-3 times. He needs to step up, work hard in defense and be as confident on the ball as we all know he can be. He still have 2 games to prove himself and it was only one game, he already played very well for us this season, so we have just wait and see what he will deliver in next two games.

1588~~~
Whilst he can look anonymous at times I'd still take him in the number 10 role ahead of Rooney, at least while we're playing the current formation. With Blind being quite isolated at times it's important that possession isn't lost cheaply and possession is maintained. It's not like we're short of attacking threat

1589~~~
The thing is, atm Mata is losing possession cheaply and easily. He's getting knocked off the ball far to regularly.

1590~~~
The problem for Mata is that a #10 in a diamond needs to get through a lot more graft than a #10 in a 'midfield 5', which is what he's used to (two CMs, two wide AMs and a #10).

The difficulty is that switching to something like that means shifting Di Maria either into a midfield 2 or out wide, both of which I'd argue would be a waste of his talent.

Fingers crossed we get back into the UCL and the different styles our playing staff allow us to play stops being a problem and starts being a positive.

1591~~~
Today he probably did more so than usual but overall with his quality passing he's undeniably better at keeping the ball in the attacking third. Rooney is always going to be a more direct threat and he'll also offer his best Scott Parker impression but playing RVP, Falcao and Rooney is crazy. I'd personally drop RVP and move Rooney up front. 

Mata certainly is not another Kagawa anyway!

1592~~~
The easy ticking over he does really sets aside the blockbusting new type of fans critique.

Yeah its all subjective viewing,but i really thought he kept things going forward more often than sideways or backwards.

8/10 hybrid that will only get better,and whats for damn sure hes much better as a 10 than Wayne.Thats unfair though as wayne isnt a 10.

1593~~~
Maybe he's just having a bad season? Paul Scholes is my favourite player ever, and even he had a few rough patches. I remember the 2004-5 season starting quite badly for him. I think we're too quick to hit the panic button. We're lucky to have both Mata and Rooney, and whoever is in the better form and/or health will likely get the start.

1594~~~
Was thinking the same thing. When playing from the back Blind looks for ADM- Blind made one pass to Mata-11 to Di Maria. ADM made 9 pases to Mata, but Mata mainly just passed it out wide rather than picking out a runner. 

Seems like Mata is more suited to a system where he receives the ball deeper in MF and then orchestrates the play-but the strategy appears to be letting ADM unlock defenses by running at them.

1595~~~
From crying about him being on the bench to questions about selling him in January..

My god..

For this kind of performance we saw today Rooney would get slated no end.. 

Matter of fact is Rooney looked good in nr. 10 position, and today Mata wasnt involved in the game as much as he should've been.

1596~~~
I think the same. I can't see us selling Mata and tbh he don't have bad season. He was very good against QPR and wasn't as bad today as some are saying.

He just need to keep the ball rather to be knocked off the ball 2-3 per game in bad area and he need to improve his defending. He is a very good player and will be very usefull through the season.

1597~~~
That may be the case, but since he's got a lot of competition and there have been rumours surrounding his future, it could end up that he's not here next season even if this just is a one-off, poor season he's having.

1598~~~
Reading this thread I feel like reading DDG's thread from 2 or 3 weeks ago when he was blamed for 'not doing enough' and 'not saving penalties'.

1599~~~
He was very timid today though, the easy option was his choice more often than not. 

I never thought I would say it but him and van Persie in the same team just doesn't work. In terms of pace and athleticism something has to give either way and the pair of them have their deficiencies in this regard. 

I think they're both fantastic but both are luxuries who were brought in illogically with very short term views. I do hope there is a way to squeeze more out of Mata, because I don't think there are many in his position who can be as productive.

1600~~~
I think we need "squad" players of as high a quality as possible. If we want to win the champions league again we need the depth in positions the likes of Mata gives us otherwise we may as well keep players like Cleverley.  The more depth in quality the more pressure on 1st choice players to perform. We need to keep Mata and players of his ability because we need depth in quality to be able to win trophies.

BTW what is it about Mata that doesnt suit LVG's philosophy?

1601~~~
The easy option thing, I wouldn't be surprised if it's down to the 'mistakes' RVP was talking about, ones the team has analysed, in reference to LVG's words about 'defending is not just about defenders'. You know, losing ball in attack and getting killed in counter ( just like in Leicester's game ). I rather have him and his assist and those 'easy' options ( that are still moving the ball forward ) than mindless attacking when we should be controlling the game. Today we've been doing it untill the last 15 or so minutes when, again, we've started to lose our shit for some reason.

Our front three today was disappointing though, it has to be said. Falcao missed some chances he's had ( diving header and that poor shot after di Maria's fantastic backheel ), RVP seems to be off-pace all the time and Mata did nothing spectacular. In the end though, Falcao got a goal and Mata got an assist.

1602~~~
and didn't the same LVG challenge DiMaria (the same DiMaria who has been BY FAR our best player this season) to try and improve the defensive side of his game.

Mata makes DiMaria look like Jaap Stam in a defensive capacity.

1603~~~
This is not the same as Kagawa. Mata is a much better player, no question.

This one game for me doesn't change much. Rooney has been very good this season as well though. Both are top players, and people picking sides is crazy.

1604~~~
Any stats on his performance?

1605~~~
I know what you mean, and I'm happy for Mata to stay here, as long as he's happy on the bench, but it's quite obvious he isn't, as he left Chelsea for the same reason. Therefore, if we were to get a 38M bid, which I very much doubt we would, I think Van Gaal would snap the teams hand off. 

As for the philosophy, Van Gaal, like many managers nowadays, like their players to press high and work tremendously hard off the ball. Mata, as good as he is on it, struggles off it, and this hardly comes as a surprise as he was dropped by Mourinho for the same thing. 

Compare Oscars work ethic to Ozil's today. Little things like that (well, it's hardly little) make a massive difference. 

If we could get a creative player who works very hard off the ball, I wouldn't think twice about swapping him with Juan.

1607~~~
No need to sell, even if he is not first choice. When we are back to 2 games a week next year, bench players of the quality of Mata will be useful. Like Isco at Real Madrid.

1608~~~
We won't see the best out of Mata unless he's playing behind one striker. With two up top, a lot of his space is already occupied when the play is moving forward. It's a shame as he won't be able to truly shine (and we'll persist with two up top).

1609~~~
Well, if Januzaj passes Van Persie as an attacking option, this could be our CL/Tough Prem Games lineup by next season:

-------Falcao/Rooney-----
----------Mata-----Januzaj
DiMaria--Herrera---------
-----------Blind-----------

1610~~~
That's a pretty well written article. Wasn't aware that Rooney is still banned for the Chelsea match, RVP and Falcao better pick up their form.

1611~~~
Albeit a bit biased over Mata and Rooney. As much as I like Mata Rooney looks head and shoulders above Mata in that position (10) this season.

1612~~~
Hmm, like maybe Kagawa then? That's the problem with the English game though, where creative attacking midfielders are required to work like dogs instead of concentrate on the attacking side. The worlds best attacking midfielders were not the most hardworking. Zidane, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Riquelme etc. always had someone else behind them doing the defensive work so that they can concentrate on playmaking. In the English game however..

1613~~~
If Mata showed even half the creativity as some of those you mentioned Van Gaal wouldn't drop him. 3 of the players you mentioned are ballon d'or winners and Riqueme never did well for a top team and he was more of a playmker than Mata will ever be.

1614~~~
He should have been involved more imo and seemed a bit slow. Let's see how he does in the next couple of games but anyways, he wont displace Rooney

1615~~~
He will be lucky to play the next two games, he can’t start against Chelsea if we play two up front, we will have to go with Di Maria or Herrera (if fit) if we want to play Falcao and RVP. Chelsea will rip us apart otherwise, having 3 players who can’t defend is just asking for trouble, if you have a lone striker and a number 10 in behind they don’t have to be great defensively but in this diamond the number 10 has to work hard or the midfield is too exposed which is exactly what happened against Everton, and even though Mata is willing he just isn’t capable of doing it.

The current formation would have been much more suited to Kagawa, I am not saying he is a better player but overall he would have offered a lot more in the position Mata played yesterday.

1616~~~
He'll do well if one of those strikers was Rooney. Rooney's habit of roaming and ability to drop deep will create space for Mata (see QPR) but when you have two classic #9s the space is not there.

1617~~~
I just wish he would shoot more often. Too many times he's been in good positions and tried to play a pass rather than take a shot. This isn't Arsenal buddy, take a shot or two.

1618~~~
Would everyone chill out and just hug it out?

1619~~~
Considering he only says generic things I still always enjoy reading that blog <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

You would think more players would now go down the Blog route to, Unless they do and I just don't notice

1620~~~
I don't think he's a much better player. Probably better, but not that much.
And I think it's very similar to Kagawa:

Two players being put into a system very different from the one at their old clubs, and being expected to play the David Silva-esque dictating role, which they can't do.
Both are instinctive players who need to pretty much play as second-strikers in a system that gets the ball from back to front quickly, and when asked to play the possession game like Silva, they just try to play with too much measure and precision - taking away from that instinctive nature. And both lack the ability to hold onto the ball like a proper no.10.

1621~~~
"I SHALL see you around here next Monday"

LvG already influencing the way they talk!

1622~~~
I thought he played well. He isn't as good defensively as Rooney<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>, but he's a more creative player and retains the ball better.

1623~~~
If he doesn't improve very quickly tactically, he will be a big liability against WBA away and Chelsea. He's neat but just don't good enough when we don't have the ball.

1624~~~
So Mourinho was right after all ... Right now I'd rather play Januzaj as a 10 than him.

1625~~~
Kagawa might have been a better option, as he's cheaper, on less wages, and does work hard off the ball. 

I disagree. It's got nothing to do with the 'English game', but more the way the game is going nowadays. You look at the top teams in Europe, and very few of those teams carry passengers. Athletico, Real, Bayern, Dortmund, etc. Heck, even look at the Barca team under Pep. As good as they were on the ball, when they didn't have it, they'd work like 'dogs' to win it back. 

You talk about Zidane, Ronaldinho, etc, but the games moved on a lot since then, and if they were playing in this era, they'd have to work hard too, or like Mata, would probably find it hard to get into their teams.

1626~~~
As my earlier defence of his performance,he was the glue.

1627~~~
I might be too harsh, but it really annoys me how he tends to drop in line with our 2 strikers whenever we need an attacking ball played. I would very much prefer a player alike Silva who's always buzzing around the ball ready to offer himself as a short option. Doesn't seem to have the quick turn or change of pace to take a defender out of the equation either like Kagawa and Silva which might be why people say he slows our play. When he comes deep for the ball, it's only to lay it square or backwards. There's no surprise change of direction, feinting, or taking on a man. His assist makes him a stat player but IMO he could be heaps more involved in build up play.

1628~~~
He's not great at holding the ball in the congested areas.
It's always got to be short and snappy with him. As soon as defenders are in and around him, he releases it quickly. He may not give it away and the ball might reach it's target, but as a no. 10 you really need to be confident holding the ball under pressure and carrying the ball out from those areas. Making the ball stick when you receive it.

Mata can see a pass, and he can link up play, but you just can't play the game through him properly if he's not going to hold and carry the ball.
A Silva type no.10 is exactly what we need. It would transform this side, but obviously they are extremely rare to find.

1629~~~
That's the point I was driving at. Playing at the tip of the diamond, I'd prefer a Silva-esque player instead of Mata who plays like a striker. We need someone who's always on the look out for the telling or killer ball through. Maybe the closest player in the league in that mould that might be remotely gettable is Christian Eriksen.

1630~~~
I am a bit concerned about the way he can get caught in possession and just falls over. Could lead to trouble against the likes of Chelsea or City.

1631~~~
A big concern for me. Can see Matic and Fernando/Fernandinho just bullying him physically. Rooney is at least harder to knock off the ball.

1632~~~
He's not releasing the ball as quickly as he should and is capable of doing. He needs to start using his head a lot more, or we're going to run into a lot of trouble in the upcoming big games. It's vital that we keep hold of the ball with our defence looking so vulnerable.

Seeing Oscar's defensive shift against Arsenal goes a long way to explain why Mourinho let him go. He's a fantastic footballer, but if we keep playing with two strikers we will need a lot more presence when we don't have the ball and Mata just doesn't fit the bill at the moment.

1635~~~
I think that's why Rooney may need to play instead if we persevere with two strikers. The work-rate and tracking back isn't perhaps as important with one striker, but when you've got two up front then you're going to need someone who can put in a high work ethic unless he's ridiculously good to the point where his attacking contribution can heavily outweigh his lack of a defensive one. Not only does Mata's not, but he hasn't been all that good at all even as an attacker when he's played lately.

1636~~~
Unusually wasteful in the final third yesterday which was surprising. I expect better against West Brom. In our front three Rooney is a priority given his added dynamism and we, and Mata, missed him yesterday.

1637~~~
One thing that really annoyed me about yesterday is the positions he was taking up. There was acres of space between Blind and the spaces that RVP/Falcao were operating in, but rather then dropping into those pockets and getting control of the ball, he was constantly running into the space already occupied by the strikers. He was virtually playing as a 3rd striker at times. I've actually been really surprised, and pleased, that Rooney hasn't been doing that to much. He's been dropping a lot deeper then we've seen with Wayne as a #10 usually, and it helps the team hugely. I'm not sure why Mata wasn't doing that yesterday tbh, its the kind of space Silva/Ozil love, and thrive in, and I expected that would be the same of Mata when we signed him, but apparently not.

1638~~~
It's true. I've said for a while, the guy's pretty much a second striker.
He's got nice technique and he can link up play, but he's all about getting close to the strikers. You wont find him dictating play and taking the ball on constantly and holding it like Silva.

The few times he does make a proper effort to dictate play, he ends up slowing the game down and passing sidewards/backwards, like Kagawa.

1639~~~
Wasn't it <a class="username" data-user="21825, @Ekeke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21825/">@Ekeke</a> who spent years talking up Mata as being far better than Silva when they were both linked with PL moves. Could he have been any more wrong?

1640~~~
To be fair 1) They both moved to England about 3/4 years ago, so back then it's not crazy to think they were closer in quality, as neither are as good as they are now... and 2) Not being as good as Silva isn't much of a criticism, he's the best player in the league.

1641~~~
Also, Mata did have a couple of seasons where he performed better than Silva.

Like you say no shame in not being as good as Silva anyway, he's comfortable the best no.10 in the PL anyway.

1642~~~
They probably were closer in quality back then but he argued with absolute certainty (as he is wont to do) that Mata was already the much better player and would continue to be so. 

And it wasn't really meant as criticism or Mata. Was just having a wee daydream about what might have been if we'd followed through on our (alleged) interest and it was Silva playing on Sunday instead.

1643~~~
Eriksen's closer to that Silva style of dictator. I like him, but haven't seen loads of him at Tottenham. I don't know how consistent he is. 
The absolute ideal would be Modric in a three man midfield. He'd pretty much do exactly what Silva does if played slightly higher up.  
Obviously not an option though.

1644~~~
Hererra's got a great eye for a through ball. Wouldn't mind see him get a go at 10.

1645~~~

1646~~~
I'm not a fan. Too slow, he needs to much time on the ball and if a game is going quickly he is out of it, he looks lost a lot of the time and he isn't a fighter. I posted a few weeks back he is a player who will post up stats goals and assist while being rather non influential over 90 minutes and yesterday's game was another example of that. I don't like him or Rooney as our 10's but I would rate her have Rooney just due to the fact he is more industrious and more productive in terms of goals and assists. He's not up there with the truly world class 10's and playmakers in terms of ability and it shows.

1647~~~
I believe he's more like a classical #10 than a modern #10. The likes of Silva, Eriksen, Kagawa, Ozil, Cazorla, Wilshere, Fabregas, Oscar, etc. drop deep and drift out wide, always looking for the ball and trying to dictate the game. These sort of players have a strong influence on a team's tempo, pace, passing rhythm and range, etc. Mata, on the other hand, has rarely, if ever, dictated play. More often than not, he hovers in and around the final third, waiting for someone to supply him the ball so that he can do his work in the final third. This is a reason why he has excellent goals and assist statistics whilst not being the most influential player in our team as modern playmakers normally are.

Given that he's not that dynamic, he's always at his best when he has dynamic players around him. In Chelsea, for example, he had Hazard, Oscar, Drogba, Torres, and Ramires, all of whom offered good movement and dynamism, which allowed Mata the chance to do his thing.

He's not really a midfield playmaker nor is he a modern #10. He's more of a final third player, and he's at his best with dynamic players around him.

1648~~~
He's looked more like a second striker than an attacking midfielder in many ways, imo.

With two strikers ahead of him I might rather see a more creative player in his position. 

But really my only complaint is that he losses the ball carelessly sometimes, he can be slow to react to defensive pressure. Or to apply defensive pressure.

I'd like to see Januzaj behind the strikers one game. Don't get me wrong, I like Mata, perhaps we demand a bit too much from him because of his price.

1649~~~
Creativity is not an issue with Mata. He's one of the most creative players in the world, IMO. His main issue, IMO, is that he's weak on the ball and not energetic enough to move around lots like several attacking midfielders do. Having said that, Mata's positioning is excellent. However, he doesn't really move around that much and drag the opposition around like many modern attacking midfielders do. Of course, his defensive weaknesses are very apparent, but I do agree with you over him struggling with defensive pressure and aggression from the opposition. This, I feel, is more down to his lack of dynamism and energy.

Comparing Mata to Januzaj, Januzaj is more dynamic and stronger on the ball than Mata. Januzaj moves around the pitch more than Mata, and he's also able to take on opponents, unlike Mata. Plus, he does have the quality and ability to be productive in the final third as seen in all levels of football.

1650~~~
Why is Mata compared to Silva? He is not as good, but others aren't either. Apart from Messi there's absolutely no No 10 in the world right now close to Silva's level. Very few - if any - might do it for a couple of games, but not over the whole season at the level Silva does. Only Iniesta at his best can match / better him but Iniesta hasn't been at his best for 18 months now.

When Barca played City at the Etihad last year, even with 10 men City Silva was the best player on the pitch bar Messi. The way he dominated the game on his own against the very best players can't be replicated at all by any other No 10 in the world, he is miles better in that role than any of Mata, Rooney, Oscar, Özil, Fabregas, Cazorla, Nasri or whoever!

1651~~~
Why? Based on what evidence? I'm excited as anybody by Januzaj's potential (and that's the key word right there,) but preferring him based on his very limited playing time in that position to Mata's (notwithstanding his somewhat indifferent start to the season,) is just madness. I can understand the preference for Rooney (not one I share, mind,) but Januzaj is as green as they come, and I would imagine is nowhere near ready to step into that position.

1652~~~
Exactly. It's like complaining that Di Maria isn't as good as Ronaldo. Mata hasn't exactly shone this season, but I'd say we're pretty spoiled for choice when he's our backup in that position.

1653~~~
I'm sensing too much animosity towards Mata. 

Feast your eyes on this piece of beauty from an older thread posted by <a class="username" data-user="68809, @Kill 'em all" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/68809/">@Kill 'em all</a> 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://fat.gfycat.com/LividAccomplishedIvorybackedwoodswallow.gif" src="http://fat.gfycat.com/LividAccomplishedIvorybackedwoodswallow.gif"/>

1654~~~
What exactly are you showing us? Any professional player should be able to control a simple ball like that. Did you see him waste that chance in the box when Shaw played him in against Everton? He should've shot the ball with his right first time but he tried to put it on his left and he got easily dispossessed and the chance was gone. Same thing happened in the second half when Blackett played a beautiful pass to him on the edge of the 18. He cheaply lost possession again and he should've done better. Right now Rooney is playing better than him in that role.

1655~~~
It's simply a case of wanting who is not there, fans will never change. When Rooney plays there, we want Mata, when Mata plays there we want Rooney. Just because Mata isn't on Silva's level and because he didn't have a man of the match performance against Everton, suddenly he isn't good enough?

He is a top player, so is Rooney both have important roles to play this season, it's only October, we are still yet to see the best of them this season.

1656~~~
It wasn't a simple take by no means and not many professional players would have been able to do it as well as Mata who has terrific ball control. I don't think he was particularly good against Everton and he could have done better generally despite ending with an assist. What is annoying is how posters need to be extreme when it comes to judging Mata and Rooney. They have a good game and people start raving about them and when they have a decent/poor game, people start berating them and scrutinizing every single mistake. I could have come up with about 4-5 situations when RVP and Falcao made the same mistakes and poor choices whilst having a generally poor game but Mata and Rooney will always have to face excessive criticism/praise for some reason or another. It almost feels as though if you are for Rooney, you have to be against Mata and vice-versa at times in this forum which seems bizarre to me. 

Mata for me generally is a better #10 than Rooney and I also think Rooney's skill-set is best utilized further up front as a second striker. However, on form basis and on general I would rather have Mata in the team ahead of RVP with Rooney and Falcao up front.

1657~~~
Some of us have maintained Rooney is a better player in that position when some were screaming for Mata and acting as if it's injustice for LVG to send him to the bench over Rooney. Granted Mata is a very good player, but in this current setup, Rooney works best for us. Mata will excel in a setup where there is two defensive midfielders hence, the work is cut out for him. Attacking wise, I question his positioning at times. Couple of times against everton, he was running in the same line as the strikers and when the crossed ball fell behind them, no one was there to hit it. A #10 shouldn't stand in line with strikers, he should have pulled back wait. It's simple things like these that Rooney seem to get.

1658~~~
Poor example - Mata scored in that same manner just a few games ago (the 1-1 draw) - it's how he's scored several goals for us since moving here January and picking one moment where his control was poor (he wasn't trying to switch feet he just didn't take enough sting off the cross) is silly. 

He's not had a proper run of games and so was not in the best form vs Everton. The same way Rooney is rarely in good form when he doesn't play 3 or more game sin a row.

That said he does need to bulk up a bit more and learn to withstand hard tackles (like the one he lost the ball from vs Leicester) - he's very much like Kagawa in that sense.

1659~~~
Creativity is very much an issue with Mata, at least at United. If he was doing that part of his job then you could ignore the other flaws in his game or at least I would.

1660~~~
Surprisingly dismissive tone towards towards Mata, whose productivity has been absolutely fantastic since he moved to England. The biggest difference between the two, imo, is that Silva has played a relatively settled role, whereas Mata has been moved from pillar to post under different managers.

Silva's more adaptable than Mata, which is why he can still shine from a wide position drifting in. I think Mata needs to be the number 10 behind a single striker.

Don't quite get the general negativity surrounding Mata's Everton performance - he's been out of the side, which is never easy, but he came back in and got a good assist.

I do feel he was a luxury purchase, and we rarely play a system to get the best out of him, but didn't see anything in his performance against Everton that warrants negativity.

1661~~~
I agree. He is far too forward minded for our current formation. More often than not he is the one making the runs looking to get on the end of things than creating. He'll pass the ball to a teammate and start running forward instead of into a space where he could receive it back like a playmaker should. That wouldn't be as much of a problem if we were playing with a single striker, but when we already have two players looking to get on the end of things, another one is overkill and specially when Mata offers very little when we don't have the ball.

1662~~~
You make it sound like he was out for ages. He missed two games.

1663~~~
This is the point a lot of people are making; he's a stats player who doesn't contribute much to overall play and doesn't make our offensive play cutting-edge and creative the way players in the Silva, Kagawa, Eriksen, Sterling and Oscar do. They provide alot of tempo and are far more involved in build up play. If you go over all our games we've played so far, Mata always drops into line with our two forwards rather than dropping to help knit play and trying to find the telling ball.

1664~~~
Yeah, I agree with most of that. I think he's at his best as a second striker - i.e. behind a lone front man - when his defensive workload is reduced.

There's no doubt he was a luxury buy, but I don't think it's beyond the realms of possibility that LvG can coax more out of him off the ball.

However, not sure why Kagawa is listed - massively overhyped player, who contributed zilch when he played for us. At least Mata is prolific!

1665~~~
Kagawa's skillset and play style is far more similar to Silva's than Mata's is. When you compare the way Klopp sets up Dortmund and how van Gaal is shaping us, he would arguably have been a far better choice for number 10 because he thrives in an environment that we are currently creating.

1666~~~
It's really not. Kagawa is another one who's closer to a 2nd striker than an attacking midfielder. His best form came when he playing just off Lewandowski.

1667~~~
I know what you're saying. I was just making the point that despite that, he's still more similar to what we need than Mata. In any event, Mata's contribution to build up play leaves much to be desired.

1668~~~
There's not many (any?) number 10s who typically play behind two strikers so singling out Mata as someone who is at his best behind a lone striker is being a bit disingenuous IMO.

1669~~~
Agreed. There are variations in the way that the number 10 role is played. Our number 10 at the moment needs to be more of a playmaker, responsible for directing the game. We already have two strikers in the box. Kagawa at his peak was a player who would make the final through ball, or arrive late to score, very much the second striker type.

1670~~~
I disagree. He's as much a 2nd striker as Mata is except Mata is hell of a lot more productive.

Yep. Mata is a brilliant player but we needed someone in the mould of Silva who can dictate things on the pitch. At least we didn't end up with Ozil eh

1671~~~
Yup. Agreed.

1672~~~
That’s the point isn’t it? The way we play (2 strikers and Di Maria bombing forward) is not the best way to utilize Mata. Personally I don’t see him starting much unless we move to 2 man midfield (unlikely IMO).

I’m more concerned about Januzaj right now than Mata anyway.

Regarding a proper playmaker in Silva type, I’m a huge fan of Isco.

1673~~~
We don't need any more playmaker in the team

I think that LVG is (and should) targeting two more defenders and one dynamic midfilder

The fact is that the way we're going to play, probably a 4-3-3 gives Mata lesser and lesser time to show what he has

I like him very much but he's very unfortunate that we are not playing well. In a team that play higher (so run less from deep) is a joy to watch, but we are so weak and can keep the ball.

Now that we have Di Maria and Falcao, I really think that the focus is there to balance the team including them, and unfortunately not Mata.

I think we've got also an issue with Wazza and RVP, on the team so adding Mata to that is tough yeah

1674~~~
I haven't kept track who was crying about Mata being on the bench and who said Rooney is better as nr. 10 but it seems some have realised Rooney is better in that poisition for us right now. Its just hard for some posters to admit that since the hate for Rooney is always strong here. 
Would be gutted if we sold him but right now it wouldnt surprise me, he is a good player but weather its our setup that doesnt suit him or he just isnt involved as he should be I dont know but right now it isnt working. 
If we do sell him in January maybe with one more CM (which we should buy in Januarly earliest) we can move Herrera or Di Maria to nr. 10 or give Januzaj more chances. 
I hope Mata will raise his game though.

1675~~~
Yeah, true.  Also, the 2 strikers we are using aren't exactly that varied in terms of type of players or the runs they want to make. Many times both of them want to do the same thing.

Kagawa is even more limited and a 2nd striker than Mata if anything. Though he will give you better pressing and workrate probably.

1676~~~
Mata as #10 and Rooney as a striker seems the best combination right now for me with RVP on the bench.

Rooney and Mata link up well generally too and Rooney offers varied skillset to Falcao more compared to RVP. Plus Rooney is sort of best as a 9.5 anyway.

Get a feeling LVG wants Herrera or Di Maria or someone of that sort as #10 though. Someone who starts from deeper.

1677~~~
We don't play with a #10 but with 3 strikers, it was already the case in the 3-4-1-2 with Mata, Rooney is a better second striker than Mata and he is a better defender, but he isn't a better #10.

1678~~~
Ideally we need more of a Silva type than a Mata right now. I thought Mata had more passing/creativity in him, but right now he seems more interested than getting on the scoresheet.

1679~~~
I understand the point sort of but Don't see a massive difference in playing style of Silva and Mata tbh when both are at their best, settled and playing well.

Silva can carry the ball better, i guess hence is more flexible somewhat while Mata has better movement and awareness in the box.

Once Carrick comes back can see LVG trying Herrera or Di Maria as a #10 tbh.

1680~~~
I've said it before...but what a wonderful problem LVG now has, picking between Rooney, Mata, Falcao with Januzaj upcoming too!

Mata is quality! He didn't score against Everton but he got himself an assist. No need for any drama!

1681~~~
I think there's a pretty clear gulf in their style, they're really not similar at all.

Mata will always provider better numbers (goals/assists) but if you want someone to run a game then it's Silva all day long.

1682~~~
Let me correct myself then, Rooney is currently better at playing behind 2 strikers than Mata.

1683~~~
I think that would be the best option with us buying a new CM of course. 

As for now, when Rooney returns we should play like you said with Rooney up front. RVP isnt in particulary good form and I wonder how long will LVG stick with him in the starting lineup.

1684~~~
You are right about that, but it's not a surprise, Rooney is a better player. It's not the place but Rooney is underrated, people judge him on the base of his tremendous above World Class potential, and refuse to acknowledge the fact that he is a world class player even when underachieving.

1685~~~
This - I'd rather see Mata behind Rooney  Falcao - RvP isn't really earning his keep - 2 goals and zero assists despite playing most games and almsot all of those games w/o being subbed isn't great.

1686~~~
Good article showing how unlucky Mata's been:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2014/10/07/5163060/why-masterful-mata-should-be-a-main-man-at-manchester-united?CMPID=TWUK_141007_MasterfulMata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896...hester-united?CMPID=TWUK_141007_MasterfulMata</a>

1687~~~
Mata is a great guy but he's not shown his Chelsea form at United, I really won't be surprised if he's sold next summer.

1688~~~
Which was what I said earlier in the thread <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1689~~~
No it isn't.

They're pretty similar: Both want to get up close to their team-mates, whereas Silva can bring others into play without them needing to be close by - he can carry the ball to his team-mates.
Both play at their best with fewer touches, and in and around the box - pass it off and move forwards towards goal, which is not what Silva's about at all.
Both are very much instinctive players, and not dictators. Both lack the patience of Silva, neither can dribble, shield or hold the ball like Silva. Both are pretty much second-strikers.

If either are played in a slow system and asked to dictate like Silva, they end up passing backwards and completely slowing the game down. They are then unable to utilise their strengths (getting close to goal and using their striker's instincts) and become accurate but safe passers who offer the team hardly anything.

The exact problems we had with Kagawa are the same ones we're having with Mata:
Both are being asked to play in a system that is much too slow and possession based for them to thrive in.

No coincidence that one of Kagawa's better performances for United came last year in the 5-0 away to Leverkeusen - a match that saw us move the ball from back to front quickly, against a defence that wasn't camped deep in their own half.
Even for his hat-trick against Norwich - two of those goals were scored as a result of one-touch stuff, moving the ball forward quickly into open space, with Kagawa barely touching the ball before finishing the move off.

1690~~~
Mata is fantastic. People need to chill. He'll show his quality soon. Mugs or players who aren't good in the PL don't score 20 goals and get 35 assists in a season. I remember when he was playing for Chelsea we'd all shit ourselves when he got within 30 yards of goal.

1691~~~
Nobody's claiming he isn't good. He's great technically, and very productive.
It's just that the system and style we seem to be moving towards seems so far away from the system that Mata (and Kagawa also) thrived in previously.

He'll still hit some decent numbers because he has that striker's instinct, but it appears we're moving towards a style of play that pens the opposition back and reduces the space to play within, and that really requires a dictator of play, who can shield the ball and hold it in tight areas, and generally dictate the game patiently. Whereas Mata is (as he did at Chelsea) usually looking to release it and move forward to score a goal.

That works for a team who invite the opposition out and move the ball quickly into that created space, but (a) Mata does little off the ball, and (b) that's not how we're looking to play by the looks of it anyway.

1692~~~
You can't doubt his past achievements and he clearly was one of the best EPL players - but you do wonder what happened in the last 2 years or so and what he needs to find that kind of form again

1693~~~
Hes a quality but despite rooney not being imo the ideal number 10 for us given his inconstancies with the technical bits, at least he always demands the ball. You need that from your numher 10 particularly if youre playing 2 uptop. Mata seems to make it three strikers and that's too many. He needs to drop deep and get in the ball more. His statistics are excellent because he's a fine player. But we need him to be a bit different.

1694~~~
Creativity is not an issue as his assist numbers are pretty good. Outside of stats, his vision to spot passes and passing range along with the willingness and ability to play difficult passes isn't an issue with him. His main issues are his positioning and movement, and the fact that he's weak on the ball.

His creative abilities are suppressed by his willingness to play more like a forward than like a midfielder. Too often, he positions himself high up the pitch and often looks to get into goalscoring positions rather than get into positions to receive a pass and dictate play. Not only that, but he doesn't have the energy levels to constantly move around, so he's more static when compared to Rooney or Januzaj. Finally, he's weak on the ball, so he can easily be shoved off when facing physical challenges.

In terms of creativity itself, Mata has no issues. In terms of his playing style and physical limitations suppressing his creativity, this is a big issue for him and how he can fit into this team.

1695~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://livelifeunited.com/misunderstood-juan-mata/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://livelifeunited.com/misunderstood-juan-mata/</a>

1696~~~
Found that really interesting. Love reading things like that. In Mata's defence there seems to be a few times (like the first illustration) where his runs open quite a bit of space between the lines in the attacking third because his run draws the midfielder away - that is a good thing, no? Obviously he seems to make the same sort of movements often though and so it does become predictable and slow us up.

1697~~~
Not really, to be honest.
That's an example of him attempting to dictate play, but he's essentially moving himself to an area of the pitch where he can't be closed down. Then usually when he receives it he plays a safe pass, and wont even attempt to carry the ball near to that congested area.

What you want from your no.10 is somebody who will remain in and around those congested central areas (clever movement in those areas is hell for opposition players), hold the ball under pressure, carry it without needing space, and play passes here, there and everywhere - controlling the play.

With Mata, it's one or the other:
- He either plays his natural game higher up the pitch (pretty much as a second striker) making few touches (to prevent being tackled/closed down), before sprinting up field for a cut-back quick finish. And this style really requires moving the ball from front to back quickly, to create space to run into. 
- Or he attempts to drop deep, but ends up dropping into harmless areas, slows things down and plays safe passes.

But he never does the precise job that's required. And it's even less ideal with two up top.

1698~~~
Not a bad article. Pretty much reinforces what a lot have been saying about his style of play, movement without the ball, and limitations in terms of holding the ball under pressure.

1699~~~
Fair enough. Just because he is the no.10 doesn't mean <i>everything</i> has to be played through him though surely? I mean, in the first one he opens space, couldn't Rooney drop in there and momentarily take up Mata's position and turn and play to RvP/Falcao/whoever the remaining striker is on the shoulder of the defender? Obviously though that would not be Mata dictating the play which is what you said he was doing. Blackett would have to ignore Mata in that scenario.

1700~~~
It looks to me like he wanted the ball (but in a comfortable area), and if he got it, he was going to play it simple to the left back.
An example of him trying to come deep and get involved, but really not doing much. If you do that every time you receive the ball with someone near you, it adds very little.

Whereas you'd probably find Silva where that circle is, and he'd probably turn and carry the ball forwards before looking for one of the full backs higher up the pitch for a first time cross. And Silva can do this because he has that ability to shake off physical duels, turn under pressure and hold the ball when surrounded.

No, it doesn't mean everything needs to go through him, but playing as an effective no.10 in a possession team requires that ability to receive and hold the ball in those central congested areas.

1701~~~
Don't think he was that bad against Everton.

1702~~~
He wasn't, he just didn't make enough of an impact to get in ahead of rooney. Positions like center back for United, players can probably get by with being decent. Behind the strikers they have to be world class to get in the team and play really well pretty much, because of the competition.

1703~~~
Rooney has had games like this before though. Mata deserves another couple chances before we can say definitely that Rooney should be playing. For the record, I was saying Rooney was fine behind the two strikers when people were itching to get Mata in there. They are both good players and some people are expecting too much from them at once. We are scoring goals and are improving.

1704~~~
Oh I know, but the thing is rooney always offers the defensive side of things which mata doesn't. It's great to have both as options though.

1705~~~
True. The thing is we don't have dynamic players bar Di Maria, I would rather play one striker so we could have a bit more control and stability in midfield. I still feel we are one more mobile cm and another player in the final third who can be direct and beat players one on one from being a top team.

I prefer the modern 10, their presence is more noticeable over 90 minutes than someone like mata, i would rather play januzaj because of Adnan's mentally out there. He may not have the bets game but he will demand the ball take players on and make things happen, Mata is too often happy to watch the game go by him. I think unless he is the one setting the tempo then he struggles when the game gets quicker and you have less time on the ball .

1706~~~
He wasn't particularly <i>bad </i>as such in that it wasn't an awful performance - he just wasn't overly great either, and didn't have as much of an impact as you'd ideally hope he would have.

1707~~~
The thing is, he still manages to produce an assist or a goal in most games he starts, even when struggling. Set up Di Maria's first vs Everton. That's the sign of a top player.

1708~~~
Agree. Despite his performance he is very efficient statistically. However Rooney is also very much the same way. Often scores when not playing that well.

1709~~~
This is pretty much spot on.
Good article. This is what I said a few pages back:
I have to be consistent in my opinion and that means Mata deserves just as much blame as Rooney for playing the #10 role in a manner that causes structural problems for the team. I find it odd that those who criticised Rooney - and don't get me wrong, his positional discipline can be awful and he's not my ideal #10 - last season for his positioning and lack of creativity haven't taken the same stance towards a player who is just as bad positionally.

Both players obviously have their weaknesses, but one thing they do have in common is that they slow down play far too much and are guilty of moving backwards causing the team to get back into shape. However, currently Rooney is the better fit because, although he doesn't offer the same creativity as Mata, he's a better all-round player to have and suits the system better, IMO.

He needs to show a lot more than what he has done for us and fortunately for him, he has more chances to display his talent. He's a quality player, but we're not the Chelsea of 11/12 or 12/13 and Van Gaal isn't going to accommodate his style because it's not the best for the team.

1710~~~
The thing is Rooney is captain and has done it for us (getting us thirty to thirty five combined goals and assists for ten years) so he should be getting a bigger leeway when he has those sort of performances. Mata needs to step up and be the link the team needs or else...

1711~~~
Mata has also proven what he can do at Chelsea. Treat them the same.

1712~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.imgur.com/X6ZUbYx.jpg" src="https://i.imgur.com/X6ZUbYx.jpg"/>

1713~~~
You've answered yourself there, in the red of Manchester United he's been good but not so good to earn the ''special privileges''.

1714~~~
He's contributing goals and assists. He's a top class player. He isn't scared to try things for us and will improve. Rooney can have 2-3 bad games in a row because we know he will still come up with something and have a run where he is on fire. I know Mata will pop up with goals and assists. The same cannot be said for Kagawa, who also looked scared at times. 

It's good we have both and they both deserve space for a bad game or two. I never understood why people wanted Rooney dropped for Mata when we were playing well with Wayne in the team. I also do not understand people wanting Mata instantly dropped after the Everton game.

1715~~~
For me he it's the acceptance of the fact that he is not the playmaker we need behind the two strikers, when he plays he looks like he wants to be another striker when we desperately need him to dominate thr ball and be the link between the strikers and the rest of the team. He'd be okay if we were playing with one striker but we are never going to that with the bug three around.
To me the team looks easy to defend against when it's only Di Maria that's providing the unpredictability and pace in the side, which is I think we'd be better served with having Rooney at the tip of the diamond and Januzaj forward with Falcao with the license to roam, in the Robben role. Makes us difficult to defend against when we have that different, unpredictable option in forward areas.

1716~~~
Agree. Don't understand folk. He's absolutely quality and classy player. He has his limitations but doesn't anyone. True world class player. His goal scoring means he also offers something that we've not had for a long time. People also forget he's not even been with us a full season as yet....

1717~~~

1718~~~

1719~~~
Where did that poll come from?

1720~~~
Haha I love it. Good stuff.

1721~~~
Jesus, so many people on that poll would rather get rid of Mata and bring in an injured vidal... 

RVP has been gash so far this year and needs the rest. Is it so hard to drop him, put Rooney up top and play Mata in the hole. That would be our best team, regardless.

1722~~~
I think it would be our best team too. But only because Mata has been performing better than RvP (but Mata hasn't been a lot better himself).

1723~~~
Play Mata behind a CF and he will score freely and create plenty.

I see Mata as different to the modern no.10 role, he is far better at putting the ball in the net than Silva, Ozil, Shinji, Hazard...

The problem for him at the moment is...United are stocked with strikers and attacking midfielders so he is being asked to do a role which is more of an all rounder aka the Rooney role.

But the team is still very much in the development stages so I wouldn't write Mata off just yet <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1724~~~
In all honesty, Mata is as much of a #10 as Rooney is. He doesn't want to come forth and dictate the play, set the tempo of the game, he prefers positioning himself in dangerous areas in the final third, delegating the possession to others. He isn't the quickest so he compensates with a very strong reading of the game, which results in him often doing very little in the middle/defensive side of the game. He may have stronger close control and short passing to Rooney, but the latter is far more physical for the role, with a better long pass. Mata has always been economical with his stats, but Rooney does trump him on this too. I just feel that if we are to continue the diamond with RvP + Falcao upfront, Rooney is a better fit, and Mata should look to move on rather than waste away.

1725~~~
What happened to the need for a good squad. If we were in Europe, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Chelsea have overlaps so do city. Why shouldn't we? It's already been proven we need cover with Rooney's red card.
Mata's not even had a full season with us and people are making Judgement. He's score more goals in his time here that all the other midfielders put together for about 2 seasons.
RVP is struggling, and doesn't look right. I think he's on the down wood spiral and it will be him that would will be surplus to requirements and not Mata IMO.

1726~~~
Yeah I don't understand it at all. If Mata's ok with it (and by the look it, he is,) then I don't see the problem. Rooney always gets injured and/or misses games due to suspension. Factor in RVP's health issues (which would result in moving Rooney forward) and the fact that Mata may well begin to hit form, and I can see no reason why we'd want to move him on.

1727~~~
I don't think anyone is seriously suggesting Mata is sold, but the poll question is black and white. I think our current starting 11 would be stronger with Vidal in the team rather than Mata. I doubt the choice would actually be one or the other though with our funds. The preference would obviously be both.

I also disagree with some who would have Mata in the starting 11 over Rooney or RVP. His performances have been just as unimpressive as RVP's so far this season, but Rooney's best position is in that #10 role, so I'd have RVP and Falcao up top.

1728~~~

Long interview with El Pais. It's in Spanish though.

He lives on the same street as Herrera and DDG.

1729~~~
Can't understand shit. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Something about profound England, industries and ambient universities in Manchester; and London being complicated.

1730~~~
Apparently Falcao has to frequently deal with rejection and Mata was in a band prior to joining United.

1731~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">@Paul_Morrissey 

Brilliant interview with Juan Mata in El Pais. Talks Manchester, London, Mourinho, Van Gaal, Life, Reading. He's such a wonderful man.

Mata: 'Manchester is the real, pure England. In London, everyone does their own thing, life's so fast. The people in the North are closer.'

Mata onChelsea: 'Id just had 2 fantastic seasons, voted MVP by fans &amp; teammates, then he (Mourinho) came &amp; I stopped playing.'

Mata on Mourinho (doesn't actually name him): 'There was no relationship, we had no dialogue. I was no longer happy there, then United came'

Mata on being left out of Spain squad: 'I think I'm more valued in England than in Spain.' (El Pais) Definitely true.

Mata: 'U fall in love with the Premier League. I've always loved British futbol, its pitches...&amp; the culture: music, fashion, the Mod thing'

Mata (dig at Mourinho?): 'I love Van Gaal's philosophy. And he's honest: for me it's more important to be a good person than a good coach.'

Mata on the Spanish clan at United: 'Myself, Herrera &amp; De Gea live on the same street as each other, so we hang out a lot together.'

Mata: 'I'm taking a degree in Marketing &amp; Sports Science. You can't stop studying and learning just because you're a footballer.' <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/crack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#Crack</a>

Mata on his life's philosophy: 'I don't understand people who aren't curious, who don't want to learn more or broaden their horizons.'

Mata: 'Van Gaal's very close to the players,he asks our opinion on sessions.Sometimes he mentions Guardiola, how Pep showed him some things'</span>

1732~~~
That Manchester-London thing is great. Will go down very well with the mancunians. I'm a big fan of London but there's a lot of truth in what he says. Most footballers wouldn't pick up in that sort of detail from their ivory towers. Hard not to love him when he comes out with stuff like that.

1733~~~
It's a nice article. Just adding to the comments above.

It's a cloudy, wet day and he describes it, "like in the Asturias." His family live in the Asturias and he had a couple of days with them last week (he wasn't in the Spanish NT squad)

He's very impressed with Januzaj - says that he can become a special player. Fletcher and Rooney lead the dressing room, it was Vidic, Rio, Evra last year. He likes everybody <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

He says LvG talks a lot to the players and that LvG told him that he likes to learn from his players (that Guardiola for example had helped him)

He likes being a footballer and he think the pressure is lower in England. He goes to training, the press aren't allowed in, and he can go home or out.

He lived in a flat in London, now he's outside the town (near Carrington) and that Herrera and De Gea have houses within 100m of his.

1734~~~
Can someone please translate this part thank you ? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1735~~~
It's Veron all over again. He's a world class attacker, an intelligent creator - the problem though is that the system we use is not the one he thrives in. Mata is best playing in the middle of an attacking three in a 4-2-3-1 formation. In terms of quality, Kagwa isn't fit to lace his boot, but they have something in common, and that is, they are not very adaptable players and if push comes to shove, they aren't the player to go to, however, when the team is balanced and in good shape, that's when Mata really comes into his own and in that form, he's insanely good. What do I think will happen? I think he'll be sold in the summer. I think LVG will gradually move us to a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 with 2 deep lying CMs and a Muller-like #10 and once that happens, there'll be no room for the genius that is Juan.

1736~~~
Which opponents have impressed you most?


R. VanPersie, Bale and Luis Suarez.

With the latter, when we played against Liverpool, I had the feeling that he could win the game on his own. He was 70% of his team.  

Of my team...I have very good companions, like Rooney, but Januzaj has surprised me a lot. He's great. You see it every day and he has a great left foot. He must have patience; if he has it we are talking about an extraordinary player.

1737~~~
Well that explains a lot then.

1738~~~
What opponent impressed you the most ?

He said : Bale, RVP and Luis Suarez and that Suarez was very impressive because it felt as if he was able to win the game alone.
He is impressed by Januzaj, who with patience will become a great player and Rooney is a great player.

1739~~~
Which opponent made the biggest impact on you?

Van Persie, Bale and Luis Suarez. This last one (Suarez) made you feel like he could win the game by himself when playing Liverpool. He was 70% of their team. And from my team... I have very good teammates, like Rooney, but Januzaj really surprised me. He's fantastic. He has a wonderful left foot. He needs to be patient; if he brings it up we will be talking about an outstanding player.

Edit - ffs jojo!

1740~~~

Thanks.

1741~~~
Mata is a class act. Sadly because of Rooney his appearances will be limited. I was actually quite pleased when Rooney got a 4 match suspention because I knew it mean Mata getting a run of games. He's a fabulous player, and very very creative (and linking up with Herrea is another bonus)

1742~~~
Good to know Herrera isn't living in a hotel anymore and to hear Mata talk highly of LvG and Januzaj.

1743~~~
Really good article. The two bits that stood out for me were how much Mata seems to rate LVG and how much he enjoys his philosophy. Maybe he has a brighter future then we were starting to think? And also how highly he rates Januzaj. Again, maybe pointing to him being highly rated throughout the club, despite the lack of game time this season.

1744~~~
Yes, he says in another bit of the article that the rivalry with City is big, but that: "In England, I've never felt a rivalry so strong as in a United V Liverpool. Such matches!" So he knows exactly what he's saying there. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1745~~~
Unfortunately Mata's not really been showing that this season though, and a number of his performances have lacked that creativity. At the moment, I'd rather have Rooney in the team than Mata who needs to start delivering this season.

1746~~~
Loved reading that. He's such a likeable guy. 
And the Januzaj bit <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1747~~~
I think they offer completely different options, but Mata is a more nature no 10 (imo), whereas Rooney like to be all over the pitch. Rooney is ahead of him selection wise, but as I'm a big Mata fan, I wish there was a way to play them both (and RVP, Falcao & Di Maria.... and Blind and Herrera..... Carrick & Fletch.... oh and Januzai)

ps. Sure I typed in 3 match suspension - keyboard gremlins strike again

1748~~~
Most lovely United player ever?

1749~~~
It's Berbatov all over again and I remember when anyone on here even mentioned that we should sell Berbatov then they'd be attacked on here for being clueless. Mata is a wonderfully gifted player but he is not dynamic enough to play at a club the size of Utd. He would thrive at a club like Valencia or Spurs but at Utd he doesn't have the pace or defensive capabilities that is demanded from every single player in the first 11 at a club the size of Utd for the team as a whole to function as a unit. He will be sold in a heartbeat once the club gets a big enough offer for him. Like the Fellaini deal  - Moyes got absolutely mugged in the Mata deal also.

1750~~~
If Mata was performing, I'd arguably like to see him in that role if we had one striker up front. But with two playing, I think we need Rooney in that role because as well as being very good ability wise, his work-rate is much stronger than Mata's, who relies more on his technical ability. That's fine, but he needs to actually deliver on that front because when he doesn't, I don't think he delivers enough in general play.

1751~~~
Yeah, it's one of those where it's clear he has quality, but I just can't see a successful side being built around him.
He requires a specialist system and the license to pretty much do nothing defensively.

Even playing a 4-2-3-1. He's better in that role, as he's free to get into the box more, but he still isn't a ball carrier/holder. And then the two behind him would need to be so so mobile and disciplined, because he'd do nothing off the ball.
Whereas, if you play Di Maria there, I can barely see any downsides.

A 4-3-3 also doesn't suit him in any way whatsoever.

1752~~~
He'll leave in January I think. Just doesn't do enough to warrant his place in the starting 11.

1753~~~
Yup, think so too. Van Gaal, like his protege Mourinho expects a high work-rate from his #10s. Probably justifies his preference for Rooney who's more of a Litmanen prototype forward.

1754~~~
Decision making poor that half. Wouldn't be surprised not to see him appear after break.

1755~~~
Are the Mata fans still glad to see Rooney suspended?

1756~~~
Poor today. Looks unsure of his role and therefore not very confident in his play. A shadow of his former self really. Hopefully he can change things around in the second half and prove he can still contribute to a team that isn't built solely around him. There just is not understanding between him and our strikers.

1757~~~
Pu£&y. All I can say about him. He won't be here for long playing like that.

1758~~~
Just awful. Get rid as soon as possible.

1759~~~
It's like playing with one man down.

1760~~~
Pretty anonymous again. I want him to do well since he's a great guy and talented player, but every week it feels more and more as if it's just not going to work here, which would be a massive shame.

1761~~~
Though his performance was poor, he was deployed far too deep today.

1762~~~
Now I know how Arsenal fans feel about Ozil

1763~~~
We need to accept that the Mata that performed at Chelsea is not going to be able to do so here. He cannot be shoehorned into this team any longer. Take the hit and sell him.

1764~~~
anonymous.

1765~~~
Either him or RVP or even both need to be dropped for next game, he just isn't contributing, would prefer to see di Maria given more freedom instead of mata.

1766~~~
He really isn't the player I imagined he would be. Looks scared when put under pressure and even when he has space, he isn't particularly creative. Most of the time, he will play a simple pass. I do think he worked harder tonight than usual so I'll give him that.

1767~~~
Was shite today tbh.

1768~~~
Good shout..

1769~~~
He needs to man the feck up and take some responsibility. Pretty sideways passes are nice and all, but he's in the team to try and create some goals.

1770~~~
I'm sorry but at least if Rooney played as ineffectively he would of still had some effect on the game with his closing down and demand for the ball.

A complete passenger today. We can't play people like him against Chelsea and Berties. If it isn't going for him he does nothing.

1771~~~
Was missing all game. People on here (rightly/wrongly whatever) slating Januzaj and Van Persie but Mata was actually the worst player thinking about it. I considered Blind our worst till the goal but that's only cos I forgot all about Mata

1772~~~
Anonymous today. Still think he should have stayed on instead of leaving Januzaj on. Despite an average performance I think we operate better with him in the team. Or Rooney for that matter. I think RVP should be dropped really, apart from one good effort, he's not done enough. Falcao at least looked sharp when he came on I thought.

1773~~~
Nothing from last season has gone right, not even this player.

1774~~~
Simply can't dictate play or hold the ball where you want him to. Added to his lack of defensive nous, it's hard to see where he'll fit in.

1775~~~
Too lightweight and nowhere near involved enough. Not good enough

1776~~~
He was poor, didnt make anything happen. At this rate he's not going to convince LVG and I could see him moving on in one of the next windows

1777~~~
He looks like his confidence is completely shot. There's only one way this all ends, as far as I can tell. He'll be moved on within the next 12-18 months.

1778~~~
Mata was getting as much criticism as Van Persie and Januzaj to be fair. I agree that Mata was worse, though. RVP was actually okay I felt personally, and Januzaj at least can use the excuse that he's not had a lot of first team football this season.

1779~~~
We're back to United 2011-2012. We have no penetration in the attacking third down the center. Neither Rooney nor Mata seems to be doing their job now.

In 2012-2013 we weren't brilliant down the center, but at least we had a taste of what it felt like. Mainly because Carrick had his best season yet, and the trio of Rooney, RVP and Kagawa combined really well. Then came Moyes and we became worse than ever in this aspect. Now Van Gaal is here, and things doesn't look much better.

Cohesion is the key, really. Without cohesion and confidence, it's impossible to attack down the center. It doesn't matter who you play.

1780~~~
What?

Januzaj was trying something at least. Same old cowardly shit by Mata.

1781~~~
For me, our worse player tonight. His touch, control and passing are poor. He just does not look the classy player on the ball that he was.

1782~~~
There was a time when I expected his free kicks to be as sure a thing as penalties when he was that close to the box.

1783~~~
Completely anonymous again. At this point I might start thinking Fellaini should play ahead of him.

1784~~~
Rooney's had a couple of good games thus far when he's played, while Di Maria could arguably make more of a central impact if he played in a more central role. With LVG, we undoubtedly look a lot better in this regard than last season.

1785~~~
Passive.

1786~~~
Didnt see the whole game but from what I saw he was poor..

1787~~~
He was poor, like Mata as a guy, but he has been very poor, pass him on and get us a solid midfielder. Not the Mata of 2012/13.. Not even 30% of him.

1788~~~
I don't think Januzaj pulled anything off. Poor decision making, several sloppy touches. He was dreadful, sure he's not played much football but absolutely nothing was happening for him and I think he should have been taken off.

1789~~~
Jose's sold us a dud. The wanker.

1790~~~
Absolute shite from him. Can't stand him out there atm. Pushed off the ball way too easy. As likeable as he is but if Rooney is back, Mata will be back on the bench and I for one can't wait for that.

1791~~~
Not upto it in my opinion,

1792~~~
What's happened to him?

1793~~~
Spot on... though I don't know how he puts up the stats. Nonetheless, he is a complete passenger in this side. Jose got a fantastic deal for £40m... imagine what we could have done with that money <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1794~~~
He put in a few good crosses and that one nice pass to Rafael. Not saying he was great but he was more likely to do something than Mata was.

1795~~~
He is just too lightweight, constantly getting bullied off the ball and losing it. To top it off, he doesn't demand the ball enough and doesn't involve himself in matches that much. If Rooney has a bad game, you could at least expect some kind of product from him or something. Bad or not, Rooney has some kind of an effect on the game while Mata is completely anonymous. F*ck sake, can't control the tempo, can't hold the ball, isn't creative enough and it seems like for those 40 million we got ourselves another Cleverley.

Jose ripped us off.

1796~~~
We sell him in January and we might get a decent fee. We'll inevitably wait far too long to shift him though and get a freddo bar in exchange for him.

1797~~~
Better, but not by much. We still play too many long-balls and crosses against established defenses, and we rely heavily on rare moments of individual brilliance, mainly by Di Maria.

1798~~~
His confidence look shot. Just what in the world happened to him?

1799~~~
The thing is at Chelsea he was my favorite non United player and at Chelsea I'd say he was in the top 5 players in the league (arguably the best in 12/13)

But you can't deny he's been garbage in play for us.

1800~~~
With Di Maria, those crosses are undoubtedly a massive improvement.

We do largely rely on Di Maria's brilliance, but in all fairness to him, there's worse players out there to be relying upon.

1801~~~
Oh our crosses are definitely better than before. But there are still too many of them. I don't mind crosses, as long as they are the result of outplaying the opponent and catching them off-guard. But when we keep hitting crosses and long-balls to the striker(s) from 40 yards out, praying for the ball to bounce awkwardly so that we get an actual goal-scoring opportunity out of it, it just speaks volumes of how much we lack cohesion.

Di Maria is world class, but he can't carry the team on his own game after game. We need to win as a team.

1802~~~
As a #10 I would expect more penetrating passes to runners. Instead, he seems to look to make sideways passes too often. Don't understand it.

1803~~~
Playing unusually deep today, wasn't he? Presumably under instructions.....

1804~~~
Exactly. Crosses are best used in teams like Real Madrid where they depend on fast counter-attacks that catch the opponent off-guard. It's absolutely useless to use crosses when the opposition team is sitting deep and waiting to counter you instead. Also, it's generally not advisable to use crosses in a possession-oriented system.

1805~~~
Pretty much sums up my concerns

Except with worse spelling

1806~~~
If we can use him as part of a swap-deal in January - jobs a goodun as far as i'm concerned..

A 6 year old kid could knock him off the ball & his general play is piss-poor. A shadow of the player he was at Chelsea!

1807~~~
Poor performance today. Chalk it down to a bad day at the office but its been a while since he has impressed.

Not really providing the magical through balls and possession domination that he was supposed to have when we signed him.

1808~~~
Rooney or Mata! More like Mata or Kagawa!!

1809~~~
Individually i am most worried about RVP.

Anyway, yeah Mata is worrying now too. So soft.

1810~~~
When the chips are down he's about as useful as a chocolate teapot.

1811~~~
Playing like a man who thinks he's getting binned in less than 3 months time. He's probably right.

1812~~~
I'd bite your hand off if we could swap him with Vidal + cash

1813~~~
He looks a shadow of his former self. I don't understand what's going on with him, is it mentality issues or is he not suitable to LVG's tactical set-up. Always used to defend him but that was a really anonymous performance and it was probably right to take him off instead of RVP which is saying something. Disappointing...

1814~~~
Was he always such a big coward at Chelsea? I don't think he even tried to create anything today and hasn't done for most of this season. It's like Kagawa all over again.

1815~~~
It's so long since he's looked like a really class player I've almost forgotten what he does well? I mean, he's definitely a goal-poacher but what else? Seems to get on the ball and pass backwards or do little lofted balls to nobody in particular. And that's it. So dissapointing.

1816~~~
It was one of his criticisms that he wasn't helpful enough in defence and Oscar was preferred over him. Smart decision from Jose in the end.

1817~~~
Pretty much this. Even his fk was utter dross tonight.

1818~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> had a long rant about him a few weeks back, and right now, he's spot on. He just doesn't even try anything anymore, he's become a coward.

Looking at him right now, I can't believe how excited I was when we signed him.

1819~~~
I so wish we didn't make any purchases last year and we just saved that money all for a CB this year. We could  have kept Kagawa and had a CB.

1820~~~
That's what he did at Chelsea.
Somehow everyone thought he was a dictator/number 10. Probably because he's small and Spanish, I guess.

He was always a second striker. He played best under Di Matteo who allowed his 'amigos' the freedom to not defend. It was a team that had poor shape in the league, and moved the the ball forward really quickly from front to back.

This minimised the physical side of the game. Most of his good work came as Chelsea broke. He'd receive it in his half, spin, pass it wide, sprint forward and score from a cut back. It was 4 on 4 counter attacking. Lots of space to run/pass into.
You put Mata in a part of the pitch where he's closely marked, and needs to hold the ball, ride challenges... and you'll get the Mata we see today.

1821~~~
He's just out of form. A few years ago, Mata was an even better player than Di Maria. Form is temporary and all that.... he'll come good.

1822~~~
His lack of defensive work does not bother me. That's not what we signed him for and now what I expect from him.

His lack of creativity is the main issue. He's basically provided the sum total of feck all creativity for us while playing like a total coward.

Also, apparently more than 50% of his assists were from from set pieces in his final season. Dare I say it, that sounds like Ashley Young.

1823~~~
...or Strootman, Hummels.. Basically anyone with top-class quality that will give us some feckin teeth again in CM & CB. 

I'd said this before, but i'd play Carrick at CB & get Hummels or equivalent in, to play alongside him. Then one of Strootman or Vidal - personally, i'd probably prefer Strootman at this point in time. 

Not convinced Vidal is ever gonna be the player he was before his knee problems (shouldnt have went to the WC), but Strootman has done everything right in his recovery to date & his age is a big bonus also..

1824~~~
Can we stop calling players cowards? It's one of the most puerile terms you could use. Just because he didn't take responsibility doesn't make him a coward.

Anyway, Mata's in danger of being sold come the end of the season. We paid £37.5m for a luxury player IMO, and his performances haven't been that great. He was probably our best player in the second half of last season, but that doesn't say much. When he plays in "demanding" systems, his weaknesses will be exposed and it's good to see our fans realise that he wasn't dropped at Chelsea because Oscar was better defensively. 

In terms of balance, Rooney links midfield and attack and doesn't shy away from responsibility. I don't rate him as a great #10 because of his inconsistent touch, passing, and awareness in this position, but he's our best option at the moment. Mata, however, struggles in key areas. He struggles physically and looks uneasy when defending. His hold-up play is pretty poor which means he usually takes position to the right or left, neglecting the centre of the field which means one of our strikers has to drop causing us structural problems. He simply can't operate in tight areas and I feel that's key in this system. And even when he does have the ball, he doesn't take enough responsibility and will pass it sideways. He's at his best when he's awarded freedom IMO, and we're not going to give him that here.

1825~~~
Probably the wrong option in hindsight, would have preferred Fellaini start in those sort of games. He needs to turn his form around quickly though. Still behind RvP in my 'most concerned about' list, but the gap is closing.

1826~~~
He was best under Benitez IIRC.

1827~~~
Why? Rojo is playing well, just play Hummels alongside him and we would be killin' it.

1828~~~
Yeah, that's quite well put. Mata just doesn't look like creating something out of nothing these days.

1829~~~
I can't think of a single thing he offered today. He was an absolute passenger. It hurts to be down on him because he's such a likeable guy, but other than tidy finishing on the rare occasion he has no other option but to shoot, he does next to nothing for us. When Rooney's out I'd like to see Herrera pushed up and Carrick coming in alongside Blind. He's looking like a waste of money at the moment unfortunately, and if it carries on much longer we should think about recouping what we can.

1830~~~
Have a feeling this is going to end like Kagawa <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> why don't we have any luck with #10's!

1831~~~
You're probably right. I thought he was good under Di Matteo too.
Benitez is known for playing that style (back to front quickly) too.

1832~~~
Because there is just one #10 for United, his name goes by Wayne Rooney.

1833~~~
We bought a CB - who's really a LB. Rojo isnt the answer to our CB problems, nor is Jones, Smalling, Evans..

How we only ended up with Rojo - when we all knew we needed world class CB's, is beyond me. Not to mention we were after Vermaelen aswell..

Its been a bittuva shambles recruiting CB's during the summer. Ron Vlarr, Vrij or both, would have been a massive improvement on our defence. They were excellent at the WC together & wouldnt have cost much more than £25m for both..

1834~~~
You do realise Rojo played the whole of last season in central defence?

1835~~~
Remember when 99% of all the football fans in this country (including many Chelsea fans) thought Mourinho had lost the plot for making it plainly obvious he didn't want 'twice player of the year' Juan Mata at Chelsea?, well Mourinho has made a lot of us look a little clueless over the last year or so.

1836~~~
We effectively started the match a man down and then you factor RVP's lethargic approach you could be forgiven for thinking we had nine men on the pitch. Both shouldn't be starting matches at the expense of more explosive or solid players, imo. We destroy Young/Valencia for being ineffectual in attack but when you look at the Mata-RVP axis you suddenly wish you had ine of them on the pitch because you know that off the ball they are a factor, at the very least.

1837~~~
I love Mata, and would like nothing more than him to become an integral part of our team, but he wasn't good at all today, and considering he was supposed to be the link between midfield and attack, he was probably one of the most culpable offenders for our poor performance. Just did virtually nothing.

1838~~~
If we'd just gone for Mourinho from the start, we wouldn't be in this mess either.

1839~~~
Rojo is a CB. He only played LB at the World Cup. In fact he looked horrible at LB for us and much better at CB.

1840~~~
Rojo does alright, but the jury's still out on him from my point of view.

The whole point of the summer was to replace Rio & Vida & Rojo is neither - same as the rest of our CB's..

Evan's is probably our best CB, but he's always injured & has been for far too many years. He misses half a season - every season, through injury - same as Jones & Smalling. LvG knew this too..

1841~~~
The snide cnut fecked us over alright. I'm beginning to think the whole "not good enough defensively" was just an excuse. That never stopped him from playing Ozil. He didn't rate Mata at all and got 37m for it

1842~~~
This has nothing to do with Rooney. Mata has had his chance while Rooney is out and he's done nothing with it.

1843~~~
I thought he looked great against QPR.. Then again QPR makes everyone look good - except the scousers though..

1844~~~
He won't be at the club in 12 months time. A shadow of his former self. Januzaj (although he was poor tonight) should be ahead of him in the pecking order for the #10 position.

1845~~~
Kagawa was never <i>this </i>meek and anonymous.

It's like I've always said: as far as <i>overall </i>game goes, Mata isn't really better than Kagawa. Mata is more effective in front of goal and is generally better at passing, not to mention set-pieces. But Kagawa is quicker, more versatile, better at linking up, more direct, more daring, works harder and is better defensively.

I'm starting to agree with the people who say that it would have been better to keep Kagawa. Today's game was screaming for a player like him, imo.

1846~~~
He's so talented on the ball, but physically he's like a child. So weak, very small, incredibly slow and that means that basically he has to be your main player in order to perform, and if not, then he'll be invisible. And he's nowhere close to being our most talented player. Sorry, lovable guy and all, but he shouldn't be a starting 11 player. If he's content to be a squad player then all the better for us as he's a brilliant player on form in the right system. I just don't think he'll still be here by the time next summer comes around.

1847~~~
Yes he fecking was. 

Not in your one-eyed wonderland, of course.

1848~~~
Januzaj, as poor as we was, was at least trying to make things happen. He played in a beautiful pass for Rafa in the second half for example.

Mata tried nothing, just constant backwards passing. Like watching Ashley Young in the middle of the pitch. Just whiter, and more dreamy.

1849~~~
I've been disappointed with him. I wanted him to cause LVG a selection headache for the #10 spot, but he just isn't doing it. Rooney has that spot locked down despite my preference for a player like Mata who has a better first touch and short pass. Rooney is just performing much better.

1850~~~
Not taking his chances well so far while Rooney has been suspended.

1851~~~
As much as I was a fan of Shinji, and I do think he would have been a perfect fit for Van Gaals style and generally is quicker then Mata, Kagawa was this anonymous plenty of times. My argument would be though that it was because of the style we played, which completely was opposite of the style that he's suited to and so he was just invisible far too often.

1852~~~
Vidal for Mata in January.

1853~~~
Yeah I was thinking more of the Leicester game, he was truly awful then.

1854~~~
No physicality or pace at all. Mourinho was right about him and Ozil.

1855~~~
Honestly Mata is one of the players in the squad who desperately needs to step up. Ive always considered him a world class player on the level of the likes of Silva and Hazard, but he has been completely anonymous most games this season.

He simply doesnt seem influence the game enough - I suspect he would do a lot better with strikers in the mould of Welbeck or Hernandez, and with Rooney out I really hoped that Mata would take his chance but he has been very, very poor.

Not sure what the problem is, and he is such a likeable character that it would be sad to see him go, but he just doesnt dictate the play the way he should. He pops up now with some nice goals and assists, but he can spend the other 80 minutes of the match invisible. That is usually acceptable for a striker, but the #10 needs to be the one constantly linking up play and looking to create.

1856~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Kagawa was just as bad. They are both as bad as each other except Mata is more productive..

Kagawa would have done nothing today either. Both cowards.

1857~~~
He played LB also. Portugese League isnt very physical though. The Prem's a different kettle of fish..

1858~~~
I remember there was a thread on Rawk a couple of years ago where many of them were arguing over who was the better player, Mata or Silva, most of them picked Mata.
Its pretty funny to think about that now.

1859~~~
Ya there was also a decent cross for Fellaini and that good run down the wing when Lescott was (harshly) adjudged to have fouled him. I literally cannot think of any positive contribution from Mata. As I saw someone else saying on here it was Ozil-esque is terms of his anonymity.

1860~~~
Thought he started the season quite well, he was making good runs and getting into the box, but I agree, he has been poor in the last two games. Doesn't get on the ball enough, drops too deep and doesn't do much with the ball.

1861~~~
Oh god, i'd do almost anything for that to happen.

1862~~~
Kagawa was more anonymous if anything. Mata and him simply aren't fit for the style we're trying to play.

1863~~~
Absolute passenger.  You cannot play in the PL in his style.  You get hounded in the #10 role for every blade of grass.  He will never get the space he requires or wants to be creative.  Should cut our losses and sell him.

1864~~~
It really is starting to look like Chelsea completely mugged us off with this one. They played us perfectly tbf. 

In hindsight, if Jose is quite willing to sell you a player, then that should probably ring a few alarm bells.

1865~~~
He's playing the same way he did in his last six months at Chelsea, when everyone decided it was Mourinho's fault for not giving him a chance...when what actually happened was Mourinho kept giving him chances and being forced to either move him around or take him off the pitch entirely to get his team playing effectively.

I remember people on here laughing at me because I said I didn't really rate him or Ozil, but the two of them are just prime examples of why people on the internet don't understand what a good footballer is.

1866~~~
I think even I thought he was nuts at first.

Luiz and Mata for a combined 88 million must be the best peice of business in 6 months ever.

1867~~~
Would love to do a deal with him for Vidal or as part exchange for Pogba.

1868~~~
I remember at the start of the whole 'Rooney saga' when there was that leak that Jose was willing to let Mata/Luiz go as part of a Rooney deal. Everyone thought it was madness, and clearly bullshit. 18 months later, and it turns out that it was probably true. Amazing.

We've been done up like kippers. If I didn't think he was brilliant, I'd bloody hate Jose right now.

1869~~~
Is Mata a sci fi fan? because I think he has bought a cloaking device off E bay.

1870~~~
Despite his apparently good numbers for us, he just doesn't do enough for me. Mostly anonymous in games we don't play well which is quite often worryingly. I'd much prefer Rooney to him regardless of the position. For 37M, you'd surely expect more.

1871~~~
He was immense at Chelsea for a while. I like the bloke a lot but he plays at a pedestrian pace and when the going gets tough he becomes invisible. I thought he'd relish his game time in Rooney's absence but he hasn't really.

1872~~~
This is a nonsense argument though. At Chelsea when he was excellent, his team mates and team as a whole were hardly pulling up any trees.

1873~~~
I commented earlier saying Spanish Ozil, but I think Ozil's far better..

1874~~~
Ah now poor and all as Mata was tonight lets not get too carried away.

1875~~~
Why? What has he shown to suggest that he should be ahead of Mata?

1876~~~
Januzaj fan boy alert. There is nothing you can produce to back that nonsense up. Mata hasn't been great but he is a far better player at present than Januzaj, who from i've seen thinks he is better than he is. Maybe he visits the caf where everyone thinks hes the new Mest (Best + Messi) and believes the outrageous hype.

1877~~~
Didn't Mourinho say something about Ozil being the best in his position in Europe? Sadly, his take on Mata is looking more and more correct.

1878~~~
Has had a great opportunity over the last 2 games to show why he should be first choice in that #10 spot and hasn't done nearly enough.

It's not entirely his fault though. As with Kagawa our passing play in the final 3rd has again been slow and laboured. Last night wasn't quite like Fulham away last season but for large parts of the game we still looked to have nothing through the middle and just looked to put it out wide.

1879~~~
Except he was.

1880~~~
The issue isn't simply the player. Every #10 we play (Mata, Rooney + Kagawa) we are unhappy with. Strikes me as an issue with the team/how we're playing than simply the player.

1881~~~
First sentence is exactly why no one takes you seriously on the matter.

1882~~~
I agree with this, we should just ditch the no.10 position. 

Like Ozil Mata is a fair weather player, looks great when the team is playing well but won't contribute in tougher games when the team is struggling. He's offered nothing in his last few games, he would do well in a possession/tiki taka team not so much in our style. Said it at the time he was a panic buy and is turning out that way.

If we play the same formation against Chelsea Fellaini should play in that position ahead of him.

1883~~~
Thought he moved the ball quite well. West Brom really closed the gaps well between their midfield and defence, so it made it hard for Mata in there.

Wasn't great but I think some of the criticism is over the top. Still a fantastic player.

1884~~~
The thing is that both players are more like finishers of moves rather than initiators which is what we are looking for. You look at Silva running the City attack and you see what we need, these are support strikers who happen to be physically weak. Rather tha bringing others into play they make runs to be brought into play themselves. You look at players like Iniesta and Zidane, how they never had impressive stats but their effect on games was pronounced and teams became successful because of that.

1885~~~
He needs space to work in, and the position Herrera was put in last night cramped up the whole forward line. He played IMO further forward than Mata similarly as did Fellaini, this caused issues as Mata had to drop deep.

You want mata to play in between the lines, last night he was forced to play in front of their defence and midfield thus offering not very much. Herrera tried to play in between the lines and as a result hardly got involved, we should have pulled Herrera back closer to Blind and asked their midfield a question about coming on to tackle thus creating space in between their defence and midfield for Mata, RVP to operate. 

However he is on the pitch to be creative and he was poor, his free kick was also a great opp, and that was woeful. (harsh but fair)

1886~~~
Why wont he drop deep to collect the ball? He only started doing it when Fellaini came on. Drop him.

1887~~~
I'm a big fan of Mata's but he wasnt on his game last night <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> He's definitely more dangerous behind a front two

1888~~~
He did it loads in the first half - if anything he was spending too much time being too deep, and not enough time near RVP to play stuff with/off him.

1889~~~
I guess we are seeing things differently. Even so,neither of us are satisfied.

1890~~~
He's a really good player, but let's face it, he's just not what we needed. A panic buy by a desperate manager who just doesn't really fit in. He just can't really dominate games like a true #10 should, someone like Silva, and what we need is someone to boss games, not just deliver goals/assists and a few pretty moments here and there.

1891~~~
The position he plays, behind two strikers, should be all about assists. His goal-scoring record is great but 5 assists in his last 20 games is kind of crap for someone who should be our creative hub.

1892~~~
it's not even just assists though, I mean they're useful and all, Silva (who, for me, is the sort of 'pinnacle' of a great #10) doesn't get an awful lot of assists, but basically links midfield and attack for City and bosses the game, something you never see from Mata. He never controls things. For all the stick Rooney gets on here, he can control games far more than Mata, which for me, is a fundamental aspect of a top #10.

He is basically the definition of a luxury player, actually, which is something I never really agreed with until I saw him for us.

1893~~~
Thought him and RvP would be our best players this season and thought the Mata signing was a masterstroke. I just don't understand how they can go from so amazing to so poor. Mata is still pretty young too.

1894~~~
Agreed. I thought last season he did well considering the state of the team he came into, but it seems like he is a bit of a shrinking violet. There is definitely a spot for him in the squad in my opinion (particularly if we aspire to a 60 game season), but he needs to start making things happen.

His free kick epitimised his performance yesterday: no conviction and no confidence. I still believe he can get back to a much, much higher standard though.

1895~~~
Yeah, I'm fast coming to the same conclusion. Which is really depressing.

1896~~~
Feel he will be the Kagawa of this season. The player the fans (including me) wants to do well but performs very average. Just a conundrum why? Confidence? The Mata of 2011-13 was my favourite non United player. He was such a classy player.

1897~~~
If we are gonna be playing two up front, I think Mata oughtta be counted as one of the strikers. He moves off defenders very well, has a great touch and a knack for getting goals from dangerous positions in the box. That screams striker. 

I've never seen United do well with "specialist positions" unless you count Park. We've never had a dedicated number 10 playmaker like Zidane or Rivaldo, and I think part of the reason is that we've always favoured a more dogged mentality. We get a lot out of Rooney in that position, because it's like having a free man getting up and down the pitch. We've always had our dangerous attackers getting down the flanks, because that's where you can hit teams quickly. 

Having someone like Mata (or Veron) getting the ball in a central area, getting his head up and picking his best option sounds great in theory. But to get the most out of these kinds of players - for us - we've got to play to the other strengths they have - in Mata's case, his movement and killer instinct. Rotating him with RVP on that right channel, I think we'd get a lot out of him.

1898~~~
He's already done more in 3 months than Kagawa did in the whole of last season.

Personally I'd sell Van Persie and have Rooney and Falcao as the main strikers next season, be plenty of games (assuming we're back in Europe) to rotate Rooney, Falcao and Mata.

1899~~~
Our system isn't working by playing a no10. He doesn't contribute enough offensively, and seemed too lightweight last night. He doesn't have the ability to take players on, saying that, we don't seem to give him the ball enough in tight areas, preferring instead to pass it out to the wings.

1900~~~
Being asked to do a job he can't do in a system that doesn't suit him.

1901~~~
Because he either positions himself as a striker - leaving a huge gap, or drops ridiculously deep and then plays a safe pass.
No in between. No positioning himself in between those two areas, turning and going past a man, and holding the ball - like Silva.
No dictating. Just floating about playing pretty backward passes to Blind, and then getting into the box.

Hence we pass it cutely in safe areas, and struggle to pass and create through the centre.
We need to get a winger and put Di Maria in that '10' role.

1902~~~
Yes, he was, but there are a number of reason that can explain it, unlike Mata. Kagawa was deployed on the wing most of the time, very rarely, if ever in the number 10 position. He was played by an inept manager and most of the time sat on the bench. In the good games he had (ex Swansea) where he was our best player, he got substituted in the second half. You can see that now in Dortmund where he is one of their best players, they play a different system though. The point is - Kagawa was never given a chance to perform, and believe me, I'm not a Kagawa "fanboy".


There is absolutely no excuse for Mata. He was given plenty of games in the number 10 position, but I don't see anything particularly good with him. No creativity, no control over the game, gets dispossessed way too easily and generally is too slow. He is actually more of a second striker to me than a creative N10. Yeah, sure, he scores a lot of goals, but what about it? We brought a player who we expected to control the game, make cutting passes, instead we got another striker... F*ck sake.

1903~~~
Lots of excuses for Kagawa when the matter of fact is he just wasnt good enough nor better than Mata currently is. he wasnt much better when played in his position.
He played in Fergie's last season too, didnt play a lot but didnt play that rarely ether.

1904~~~
Playing on the wing is an excuse  for being shit (And keep in mind he wasn't even an actual winger in most of those. He was a couple of yards out of position). It's not an excuse for playing like a coward.

1905~~~
I'm not trying to make excuses for Kagawa, it's just how it is. Mata has had enough chances in the N10 position and did absolutely nothing. As of right now, I really prefer Kagawa than watching Mata stroll like a turtle on the pitch. I'm sorry, he seems like a really likeable guy, but he has done absolutely nothing except score some goals which we already have enough people to do that, we don't need another one.

1906~~~
I like Mata. His first touch is out of this world, his close-range freekicks are a constant threat, and in terms of passing the ball around, he's a true Spanish midget. He's also incredibly likeable.

But as I've always said(and predicted); Mata <i>is </i>his goals and assists. The moment he stops scoring and assisting constantly, he's unfortunately a very limited player. And those times are sure to come, because unlike Rooney, who is a striker at heart, he doesn't have the same energy and individualism in his game. He's <i>dependent </i>on the ball rolling his way. When it doesn't, he's essentially only good for keeping possession and freekicks.

Having said that, I'm surprised that Mata has become <i>this </i>limited <i>already</i>. It's actually reached the stage where I'm starting to want to see Rooney in the no.10 position instead. And that's saying something, as I've always been opposed to this idea.

The three no.10's we've had since january have had different strengths and weaknesses:
<b>
Rooney
+ </b>The strongest individualist(nature of a striker)
<b>+ </b>Can <i>guarantee</i> goals and assists
<b>+</b> Hard-working
<b>-</b> Offers effectively <b>no </b>linkup between midfield and attack
<b>-</b> Not good at keeping possession under pressure
<b>
Mata
+ </b>Generally scores and assists a lot
<b>+</b> Excellent at keeping the ball in the team(good passing and makes few mistakes)
<b>+</b> Set-piece specialist
<b>-</b> Very dependent on the ball rolling his way
<b>-</b> Generally limited skillset once you isolate his goals and assists(no speed, can't dribble, bad defensively, low energy)


<b>Kagawa
+</b> Versatile(hard-working, decent speed, good technique, good at passing, good at intercepting, decent finishing)
<b>+</b> (Was) our best player at linking up(<i>especially </i>on the counter)
<b>+</b> If we take goals/assist out of the equation, he generally offers more than Rooney and Mata
- Lacks individualism. Will not save our ass on a rainy day.
<b>-</b> Can't guarantee goals and assist to the same degree as Rooney and Mata(doesn't have "Striker's Instinct").


_________________________________________________________

The truth of the matter is that none have been ideal for us. Rooney is not ideal in the no.10 position regardless of style, but he gets a free pass because of his energy and goals/assists. Mata is ideal for the no.10 position when we dominate games with technical football, but we're not good enough to do that yet. Kagawa was our most balanced no.10, but he couldn't save our ass on rainy days(which there were plenty of under Moyes). Combine this with the fact that he couldn't guarantee goals and assists the way Rooney and Mata could, and it became a gamble to play him.

<b>Long-term</b>, I still think Kagawa would have been the best choice, but that's a different story. I haven't given up on Mata yet, as he will come good when the team comes good. The question is: how long does it take before the team comes good? And will Van Gaal be patient enough to wait that long?

1907~~~
It's like Mad Winger watches completely different sets of games. In what fecking universe is Shinji Kagawa versatile? He's the most rigid player we had at the club

Kagawa and Mata have both been bad. When you have two bad players I'd take the one who scores or assists a lot rather he one who doesn't. It's that simple.

And can we stop this nonsense about Rooney offering no link up play. That's pretty much what he does very well when he plays there. And it's something both Kagawa and Mata have proved to be inept at doing.

1908~~~
People have regularly brought up Ozil struggling to adapt to the premier league but he rarely completed 90 minutes for Madrid, he was regularly subbed off after 60-70mins and benched for the biggest games.

1909~~~
I wish Kagawa stayed, but he's no longer here, so why he's being talked about, I don't know.

As for Rooney offering no link between midfield and attack, that's rubbish, in my opinion. Granted he doesn't always do it (neither does Mata. Yet again another passenger yesterday) he's just as good as Mata in his link up play, and gets involved in the game a lot more. See the Leicester and West Ham game.

1910~~~
Bit in bold is the complete opposite to what I think.

In a possession game, your no.10 will always need that ability to side-step a challenge in that congested area. And Mata has no such ability.
Passing alone can only get you so far.

Iniesta and Silva are ideal for dominant teams because they can receive it with two men on them, side-step the challenges, hold the ball, and slide a pass in.

Mata can't, so he drops to where he has space. You simply can't build around a no.10 who doesn't feel comfortable holding the ball or dribbling at all. You can't always make that pass. Play can't always be that quick. Space wont always be there.
We're trying to dominate now, and he's going missing until he drops deep and plays another safe pass.

I agree that none of them are ideal though. We need a Silva-type. Or failing that a Modric-type. Obviously hard to find.

1911~~~
Don't you know who you're talking to?

1912~~~
As it was said here, maybe that position is the problem. Or he isnt versatile enough. 

ANd to remember people were crying for Mata to replace Rooney at that position...

1913~~~
Well I disagree. If Rooney was at least a decent link between midfield and attack, then Fergie wouldn't have signed Kagawa and Moyes wouldn't have signed Mata. Rooney is a hard-worker and he scores plenty of goals and assists. What he lacks, is being an effective link between midfield and attack. If he <i>had </i>this skill, then he'd be the best no.10 in the world by a country mile. Mata and Kagawa wouldn't even have been considered then.

1914~~~
True. Was a stupid mistake, to be honest.

1915~~~
Neither of them are much better. In fact Rooney takes up better no.10 positions than Mata, from what I've seen.
It's not natural to either, but at least Rooney <i>tries </i>to dictate.

Mata spends half his time up front, and the other half extremely deep - passing it back 2 yards to Blind.

1916~~~
You think Moyes bought Mata causew Rooney isnt a good nr. 10 ? I think Moyes to this day doesnt know why he bought Mata or how should have he used him.

1917~~~
Oh, I thought we signed a number 10 as a back up to Rooney, or just encase Rooney left? Kagawa didn't exactly dislodge Rooney, did he, which is why he was often shunted out wide, with Rooney in behind Van Persie. Same goes for Mata. Rooney has never been dropped for any of these players, because when they have got their chance, they very rarely taken it. 

Just look at Mata now. He's been a passenger in the last couple of games, yet he supposed to be very good linking midfield and attack. At least with Rooney he will always get involved in the game, even if that means picking it up from the goalkeeper. Mata should be bossing these type of games against West Brom.

1918~~~
No, I think he bought Mata because there was no link between CM and attack. There's a reason why Mata took the no.10 position almost immediately. He basically drew the same conclusion that Fergie did, with the exception that we already had a proper no.10 when we signed Mata, which in return is one of the many things that made Moyes a moron.

1919~~~
Kagawa isn't a proper number 10. Silva is.

Half of the problem is that none of those three are/were 'proper' no.10s.

1920~~~
Kagawa was supposed to take Rooney's position, and Rooney was supposed to play as a striker. Then RVP came. As a compromise, Kagawa played on the left wing when all 3 started. Fergie stuck to this model, because it worked. We had very good stats with these three starting together, partly because Kagawa could work as a link between RVP and Rooney, who for some reason never have been a dynamic duo. Also, whenever RVP wasn't playing, Rooney was pushed up front, with Kagawa taking the no.10 role.

Mata played a shitload of games in the no.10 position with Rooney up front under Moyes. We rarely saw Rooney in the no.10 position with Mata on the wings(I can only remember two games).

1921~~~
Klopp and Dortmund would disagree with that...

People have different definitions of no.10's, though. It's a pointless discussion.

1922~~~
Think that Mou shattered Mata's confidence and he hasn't been the same palyer since his time as a regular starter for Chelsea. The fact that he isn't confident about his place in United's team doesn't help him one bit. He isn't playing well even thouhg statistically he hasn't been much worse than Rooney and RvP since the start of the calendar year. The thing with him is that he, unlike our forwards, is yet to enter his peak years. By contrast, RvP and Rooney have peaked and the same may be true about Falcao. I wouldn't be wise to ship him out.

1923~~~
<a class="username" data-user="59026, @Mad Winger" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/59026/">@Mad Winger</a> your obsession with bringing Kagawa into every discussion despite him being gone is annoying, so stop, now.

1924~~~
In a team who look to really dominate possession (which we have in recent years), he's no more useful than Rooney.
You want a dictator, and he isn't one.

Great for a system like Dortmund's though.

1925~~~
Its the stereotype. Rooney has played as a striker for most of his career (although he hasn't) so he can't play as a number 10. Mata, on the other hand, must be doing a better job because he's played as a number 10 for quite a while. Certainly not what I've been seeing.

1926~~~
It's difficult to not bring him into the discussion now that Mata isn't performing, though. It's only been a couple of months since Kagawa left, after all. I'm one of the posters who considered it a mistake to let him go, seen from a purely United perspective.

1927~~~
Kagawa did nothing during his time at United to prove he deserved to stay at the club, Mata is following the same road. Wayne Rooney continues to be our best number ten and for now also our best striker.

1928~~~
While Dortmund primarily is a counter-attacking team, they tend to dominate posssession against the weaker teams who park the buss. Kagawa hasn't looked limited at all for Dortmund this season against teams that lie deep. In fact, last game it was his agression and interepting that eventually lead to Dortmund's only goal.

1929~~~
Mata's only played a couple games this season. Kagawa had chances and was poor. People gave him chances and was patient with him. He's a talented player but bringing him up when he was a clear failure is just desperate.

1930~~~
Will. You. Ever. Shut. The. F<span style="color: #000000">u</span>ck. Up. About. Kagawa?

It's beyond frigging tiresome even in the thread dedicated to him but this is blatantly the wrong thread for your pathetic obsession anyway...

1931~~~
Completely different style of play. And still fast paced.
He's not in there to dictate, and it suits him.

He's no better at dictating play than Rooney. Neither is Mata. And that's what we've needed.

1932~~~
Agenda posting is not allowed.

1933~~~
well nobody else has so I'm sure you'll manage.

otherwise I'll just thread ban you every time you mention him outside of his own thread.

1934~~~
Might be a little too late for that.

1935~~~
I warned him, which took him over the edge. Short break, harsh but fun.

1936~~~
Shouldn't he be renamed 'Mad Kagawa'?

1937~~~
No.

1938~~~
I'd like to point out that even at my worst I was nowhere near that bad (Nani-wise).

1939~~~
hmmm.

1940~~~
yeah me too with Berby

1941~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1942~~~
Anyway, back on topic "Why can't the little man find his magic?"

1943~~~
You're missing my point, though. When everyone was fit, Kagawa and Mata were played out of position for Rooney, who did a very good job playing behind Van Persie, going on to win our 20th title with ease in Fergie's last season.

Again, under Moyes, Mata only played number 10 when Rooney or Van Persie were injured. Altogether, last he season Mata played a total of <b>6</b> times as a number 10 and <b>7</b> games out wide.

Cardiff - Mata number 10 - Rooney injured

Stoke - Mata wide

Fulham - Mata wide

Arsenal - Mata wide

Crystal Palace - Mata wide

West Brom - Mata wide

Liverpool - Mata wide

West Ham - Mata number 10 - Van Persie injured

Man City - Mata wide

Villa - Mata number 10 - Van Persie injured

Newcastle - Mata number 10 - Rooney and Van Persie injured

Everton - Mata number 10 - Van Persie injured.

Norwich - Didn't start

Sunderland - Number 10 - Rooney injured.

Hull - Didn't start

Southampton - Centre midfield.

1944~~~
A little too harsh? This isn't RAWK, I hope.

1945~~~
Be quiet.

1946~~~
Ah here, I told you that in confid.. oh wait.

1947~~~
Quite astonishing really, the lengths some people will go to defend someone who really wasn't all that and derail different threads to subject us to his stance on the matter.

Anyway, onto Mata. It's quite shocking how he's gone from the player he was at Chelsea to the player we see playing before our eyes at United. I was a big admirer of his at Chelsea and I still think he can play a role here and somewhat recapture his pre-Jose form. It's not like he's entering his thirties and a drop-off is expected - like with RvP for instance - so the player he once was hasn't simply vanished. His deficiencies as a #10 are really coming to the surface however and he looks less suitable for the role than Rooney and that's not just from a defensive standpoint either.

Along with van Persie, I don't see much future for him here and if he doesn't want to accept a squad role at a Chelsea team that was better than our current team, I don't see him accepting one here either unfortunately.

1948~~~
You couldn't be more wrong.

1949~~~
Mata is so likeable, but he's slow, weak, a liability defensively and doesn't get involved enough. He had a nice assist against Everton but for the most part he isn't pulling any strings and his passing is more Cleverley than Silva. Seriously, what happened to his passing? It used to be a lot more creative. Now it feels like everytime he gets the ball he lays it off to a midfielder or defender and disappears into a sea of opposition players. He's had a knack for popping up and scoring goals but other than that he's not contributing enough.

I really really want him to do well with us but he's starting to look like a Veron kind of acquisition.

1950~~~
Maddening. Mata has obvious skills-yet he also has some weaknesses that seem to get exposed.  Although it doesn't happen frequently, seeing him getting knocked off of the ball is not a pretty picture. And, his defensive work isn't great, which makes a deeper MF role for him problemmatic. 

So-I guess the most forward part of the diamond is his best role-but I can't recall too many killer passes to a runner. When he gets the ball the tempo just seems to stop, and he just lays a pass to the side. Maybe it's just a matter of getting guys on the same page. But, however much Mata improves as a playmaker, I think we can expect very little from him tracking back-which creates  need to play another DM in the diamond.

1951~~~
Yeah. Too many goals being scored. We don't need none of that shit. Conceding is where it's at.

1952~~~
Best banning in caf history. He's absolutely stark raving mental.

1953~~~
First of all Chelsea didn't rip us off, they didn't sell us a player who is considered deadwood by any means. Everyone knows how Mourinho's teams play on the pitch. They defend very deep, leaving no breathing space in between the lines and they are very rigid which means that they can not afford players who can't do their share of defending because that could lead to defenders drifting out of position and the whole team losing its defensive balance. It's true that Mourinho didn't have a place for Mata in his plans but he didn't want to sell him to a rival club. If it wasn't for FFP Chelsea probably wouldn't have sold him to us.

The same thing is happening at United. We can not afford to have a #10 in the starting lineup, no matter the formation, right now. Even if Silva came here he would also look rubbish. Doesn't Silva lose the ball, doesn't he make mistakes? Yes, he does. Does he even bother to track back and defend? No, he doesn't. In both cases Pellegrini doesn't give a flying rat's arse because he can protect him with two massive CMs playing behind him and with an incredible CB pairing that doesn't allow anything or anyone to get past them. Only in CL matches against sides who can defend effectively and can keep the ball City face serious problems.

Mata is good when he receives the ball in the final third and has teammates around him making themselves available for a pass. When you can't commit enough players forward because you know that if you lose the ball your opponent can cut through your midfield like a knife cuts through butter, Mata becomes anonymous. Asking him to drop in deeper areas won't work either because if Mata could operate in those areas Jose would have kept him in the team, he would have bought someone like Vidal, instead of Fabregas, and he would be playing now the way he did at Inter with Sneijder.

1954~~~
Seems to be happening fairly frequently at the moment, in the sense that 1-2 times per match (I remember 2 from yesterday but could have been more) in the positions it's been happening to him is completely unacceptable.

It's one thing to lose possession because you've been over ambitious around the oppo's penalty box, but it happens to him when he has his back to goal near our half way line, with only the back four deeper.

It led to a goal against Leicester; didn't lead to anything yesterday but both times I remember it happening it led to a dangerous situation.

As you say, it's not like he does enough defensively (or creatively, lately) to make up for errors like this, so he needs to cut it the feck out.

1955~~~
Wonder will he start against Chelsea... Probably has to, especially if di Maria is injured.

1956~~~
Right-that's my perception too. Not every time-but enough to be noticeable and always seems to lead to trouble. 

Reminds me of the bit in Annie Hall. Diane Keaton and Woody Allen are shown talking to their respective therapists.  Each is asked how many times a week they sleep together. Woody Allen says, hardly ever-3 times a week. Diane Keaton says, constantly: 3 times a week.

1957~~~
Hah. Then I'm with Diane on this one, it's constant!

1958~~~
Sorry, but I believe Silva's a different type of player, and wouldn't look rubbish all.
Most of the weaknesses that cause Mata to look so average aren't there with Silva.

Also I don't get the bit in bold.
We have no problems committing men forward. In fact, if anything, too many of our players are too high, leaving Blind with a huge gap ahead of him. 

Mata's problem is that he can't dribble, can't beat a man, can't shield the ball, can't dictate play, is often too focused on getting into the box, and when he drops deep - he plays it safe.

1959~~~
You know what I mean. We have enough players who can score goals in the face of Di Maria, Rooney, RVP, Falcao and even Herrera. We need a creative player who can control the tempo of the game and create chances for our players to score, we don't need another striker. What's so hard to get about that? We basically play with no creativity at the moment besides Di Maria's brilliance.

Also, <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at my title.

1960~~~
Veron all over again mates. Great player, wrong team/style. He'll be sold in the summer.

1961~~~
I also believe that Silva is a better player but City are designed to get the best out of him while we don't (or can't) use tactics to help Mata at all. Forget the PL for a moment and think about Spain, where Silva isn't the focal point when playing, or City in the CL facing teams that have a quality defense and aren't embarrassed to defend very deep, behind the penalty spot some times. Can you mention two or three of those games when Silva has shined on the pitch? Has he been excellent against Mourinho's tactics?

As for the second part you mention, i should have made it more clear. Yes, we try to commit players forward but these players have only the freedom of movement their starting positions allow them to have. They don't try to overload the side where the ball is played, they don't swap positions to trouble the defenders and create pockets of space in the final third and they are not trying to play close to each other which results in us being easy to defend in tight spaces. The fear of losing our defensive shape when out of possession seems to be overwhelming. Compare that with the freedom of movement City's creative players enjoy in the attacking third.

1962~~~
At least we won the league with Veron... Mata will always be a panic Moyes signing.

1963~~~
The longer time goes on, the more and more it looks like that.

Most of us (including myself) got completely taken in by the whole 'buzz' of us signing 'world class' Juan Mata. But in hindsight, it wasn't a very well thought out transfer was it? We already had Rooney, were struggling to fit Kagawa into the team, and a proven manager like Mourinho was quite willing to let him go. So spunking £38 mill on a #10, who couldn't get into the team of one of our direct rivals, probably wasn't the cleverest thing to do (and tbf I think a few people did try and point that out at the time, <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> was one iirc?)

You do get the feeling that Moyes, and the club, just saw the name and went for it. They basically got suckered into the same hype that we as fans did. I doubt we even did any sort of scouting on him, I mean, why would we have had any scouts watching a player that up until those last 6 months we would never have dreamed would become available.

1964~~~
Can't speak for others. I didn't necessarily see it as a poor signing, but was sceptical of why we'd bought him and I think I did point out at the time that he'd been poor at Chelsea for the first half of that season (rather than it all being Mourinho's fault for being racist against Spanish playes, or whatever the convenient/stupid theory was at the time).

I think the first real alarm bells were when Moyes said "I'm going to try him in some different positions" as that made it 100% obvious we had no idea why we'd actually bought him. No thought at all had gone into his recent performance levels or what he could and couldn't bring to the team.

That said, I still hoped he'd get his act together at United and would be able to improve us. It's like with Kagawa though. Each game seemed to make that look less likely rather than more likely, and after a while the excuses begin to get very thin.

1965~~~
you beat me to it. next time, please give me the honours. cheers.

1966~~~
Anyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyywaaaaaaaaay.

It's October. Mata hasn't been nearly as poor as people are suggesting, but I suppose it will come as a concern to him that with our summer signings all fit, he doesn't appear to have a starting place.

Nevertheless, it's up to each player to earn a spot. If they don't, I'd like to think they won't play. Only problem is this rule arguably doesn't appear to apply for RVP, but that's for another thread.

I still maintain that our biggest problem has nothing to do with the front six. It has everything to do with our defensive play which has repeatedly let us down this year. Yesterday was a perfect example, as we came out flying in the second half. 15 minutes or so later, we allow a completely atrocious goal and it kills our momentum and confidence moving forward. Players are too concerned about making a mistake, and as a result, they end up making plenty anyway.

I am convinced that if we could ever sort out our defensive problems, our attack will be more than fine. Mata included.

1967~~~
Kagawa is history man, let it go.

1968~~~
I think that's a pretty fair assessment.

1969~~~
Fans defending Ozil
The balance of the team is off, we need somebody to protect Blind first and forest, but to be a top dm you need to be able to defend and be good in obsession. In Spain or Italy he would be a better fit, but he is too slow. Once he pushes up if he doesn't win the ball he doesn't have the pace to recover. The reason Jones pushed so far up was because the Blind had pushed onto the man on the ball and left his man and they got passed him so easy. We need Blind/ Carrick (or Felliani) and Herrera, we need to play the way Juve's midfield operates. With Carrick and Felliani it isn't really feasible because they are so sow so we need to adapt it, bit no leaving Blind alone basically. 

Secondly the defence needs to be coached. The players seem to panic when the opposition are attacking. 

It is time of RVP to be dropped, he offers very little now. Falcao needs to be starting.

1970~~~
You maid misstakes, or is this a parroty?

1971~~~
Defence is a problem, but at least half of that is because we have so many attacking players in the team. Our two centrebacks and Blind are literally the only players who don't spend the whole game attacking...and even Blind spends half the game attacking, and yesterday Jones kept trying to move into midfield. 

It's a team set up to attack in order to compensate for not having a defence, which is why when Van Gaal comes out and starts going on about defensive discipline, it doesn't really add up. The first thing he needs to do if he wants that is pick a team and system that's actually capable of having it. You could have Vidic and Rio in their prime as our centrebacks, and Makelele in Blind's place, and we'd still be far too open and poor defensively.

The other thing is, for a team that's set up to be so dependent on attacking and with so many supposedly top class attacking players, we don't actually create that many chances. We seem to be limited mostly to players scoring wonder goals or launching shots in from outside the box which either fly in or luckily deflect to one of our forwards. Di Maria is the only forward player who I think has anywhere near done himself justice this season. Our second most dangerous attacking player has been Rafael Da Silva.

1972~~~
He's a ghost out there, not particuarly lazy but just doesn't seem to get involved enough, either out of possession and sometimes in possession, lacks physicality which is an odd comment to aim at a skillful technical player (usually not their forte) but it's noticeable moreso from him than anyone, i guess we're starting to see why Mourinho let him go, he should be worried for his future here, he's playing in his preffered position and still being hauled off nigh every game.

1973~~~
Veron was a bigger mystery - he had just played a key role in winning Serie A (recognized as the strongest league at the time) and was talked about as a potential rival to Zidane as best player in the world. Mata, on the other hand, looks like someone who belongs at a level slightly below the top tier - like Chelsea during his spell there. I doubt any of the clubs we consider peers will be in for him when we try to offload him.

1974~~~
The lad has only been given one start. How many has Mata had in comparison and he has contributed very little. His only good game came at home against QPR. Januzaj hasn't performed to the levels he did last season but equally he hasn't been given as many opportunities. 

Mata fan boy alert. I can back that up. Have a look at his performances last season to see what he is capable of. He has also stood out like a sore thumb whenever he has played for the under 21's. Obviously Mata is the better player at the minute. There would be something seriously wrong with him if a 19 year old player was more complete than him. My point is Januzaj has the potential to be a far better player than Mata ever was/will be. He won't reach this potential being sat on the bench. Mata's performances don't warrant him having a place in the team. We would be much better off giving Januzaj the sort of opportunities Mata has been given and been unable to take.

1975~~~
So by that logic equal, McNair should be our first choice CB ahead of Jones and Smalling. Mata has been pretty woeful this season, but you're conveniently forgetting his past achievements. If Januzaj goes on to hit the heights that Mata did while with Valencia and Chelsea, I'll be very happy.

1976~~~
No. Jones has been our best defender this season. Why would McNair be first choice ahead of him? Strange example. 

Mata's past achievements count for nowt. What relevance is it that he was once one of the best players in the league? Going by that logic RVP should be the first team on the team sheet based on his past achievements. What matters is the present. Mata has not been himself for the last 18 months.

1977~~~
Fine, use Smalling (although McNair has arguably impressed more than Jones). The point still stands. And you're right about the present: at present, Adnan Janujaz looks nowhere near ready to be replacing Mata as Rooney's backup.

1978~~~
The future is also important too. My whole point is that Mata isn't that significantly a better player than Januzaj to warrant benching him and affecting his development in the long run. I'm not suggesting that Januzaj should play ahead of Rooney (who is at present a far better player) but that he should play ahead of Mata who is only marginally better. If you look at their form since Januzaj first broke into our first team last season I think he has been the better player. I don't see what is so outlandish about suggesting that he should be ahead of Mata in the pecking order. It would undoubtedly benefit us more in the long run.

1979~~~
We'll just have to disagree then.

1980~~~
Fair enough.

1981~~~
So, what happened to him? Did he turn shit over night?

I think he's gonna lose his place in the first 11 for the Chelsea game probably to Fellaini. The worse thing is that I would be deserved. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1982~~~
I just feel it's one of those things from fans. When he isn't there, we want him there, when he is there, we want better.

He is a great player, offers so much, lacks in certain areas, like any other footballer. Would be devastated to see him leave.

1983~~~
Passenger. Did jack all. Can't believe he stayed on for as long as he did.

1984~~~
Mr treacle shoes, when you watch him run it's shocking how slow across the ground he is, be seriously worried for us if he starts against Chelsea or City to be honest, the energy of Chelsea and the power of City will see his pocket picked far to often.

1985~~~
Playing with Mata behind Rooney and Falcao wouldn't solve the issue we have at the moment. The main issue is that Mata has failed at positioning himself centrally to offer our players an outlet, and that's because he can't shield the ball and doesn't excel in tight spaces. This is the exact same player who played for Chelsea, but the difference is that his deficiencies are exposed further when he's not given a "free" role. What we need in the #10 role is a game changer and Mata doesn't fit this profile because of his style. As much as I hate to say this, he's a luxury player and I'm not sure he has a future at the club - he's far too good to be a squad player - unless we see a drastic change in our system or his style.

1986~~~
Pretty much, not to that extent though. I'll be disappointed if it doesn't work out for him here, but he'll have to take responsibility for his failure. The best thing he can do is try and move to congested areas and make a difference for us, rather than remain in open space where he can't do much. Fwiw, Herrera would be an even better option to have as a #10 which again shows that you don't need to be the best playmaker in the world to excel in the role.

1987~~~
I was delighted when we signed Mata because I convinced myself he had enough pace to play out wide - the realization that he is a pure number 10 has been a disappointment really. Add to that a few less than convincing performances as a number 10 and it's becoming a little worrying.

1988~~~
3 weeks ago, everyone was going on about him and his goal record and now after two sub par performances, his time at Old Trafford has been a major disappointment?

Give it time lads, might work out, might not but give it time. He hasn't even been here a year yet.

1989~~~
I'd be interested to see how he'd do in the 4-4-2 Citeh play with 2 of Rooney/RVP/Falcao up front, Di Maria out left, Mata narrow on the right and Herrera + Blind/Carrick as the 2 midfielders. With Rafael up and down the right wing, 2 dangerous strikers and Herrera + Di Maria surging forward to his left, he might have the runners/options he needs to create, and sometimes it's easier to find space in that triangle between the other team's fullback, CM and CB that Iniesta lives in for Spain and Nasri tends to take up for Citeh. Silva just floats everywhere now, the annoying genius that he is.

1990~~~
I’m not sure whether he understands his role in that team, or he just isn’t the type of player we need in this system.

He either stays too high up the pitch, or too deep just to simply pass it wide. He rarely plays in the areas I would like him to operate. Not influencing games enough. Interesting whether he will start against Chelsea, Personally I would drop him and play 4-3-3.

1991~~~
I just watched this review of his last season at Chelsea: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwTEV0-F2zU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Now, I'm well aware of the dangers of judging a player based on a youtube video, but given that he was their player of the year, there was obviously some substance behind the style, so to speak. What I can't understand is that very little of what you see in this  video (incisive passes, surprising strength on the ball, movement and tricky dribbling,) has been evident in his time here. Why is that? Has he been shorn of confidence? In the case of RVP, it's clearly a case of declining skills, undoubtedly related to age and injuries. What's the reason for Mata's being a shadow of his recent self? I'd love to hear what any Chelsea fans have to say about this? Is the Mata that we have seen sleepwalking around the pitch with United in any way similar to the one who played for Chelsea? 

For the record, I love Mata, and still think he has it in him to shine for us, but time may well be running out.

1992~~~
I've said before I blame Mourinho, he destroyed the player Chelsea had at his best

1993~~~
Well thats quite depressing. 'Our' Mata hardly does any of the the things in that video that make him look so good. That video was the Mata I seem to remember at Chelsea, and the one I was so excited about signing. Whats happened to his dribbling and passing? He also looks a lot harder to knock off the ball in that video,

Surely its a confidence thing? Either way, its so incredibly frustrating.

1994~~~
No he didn't. He may have affected his confidence a tad, but he did not <i>destroy </i>Mata. If he'd had him rotting in the reserves for 3 years I'd get what you're saying, but we're talking about Mata only playing a bit part role as opposed to being a key player. If that's destroyed Mata mentally, then he's the one with the problem, not Mourinho, LVG, Moyes or anyone else.

1995~~~
They're just highlights to be fair.

And a lot of that work appears to be when he (and his team-mates) have space to run into.
A lot of dribbling over the halfway line into space before passing it, and going forward for a return, which has never been a problem for him.

We don't really play that way.

1996~~~
What's strange is that he looked very good when he first came here. He was often the only player offering any creativity when we were playing dire football under Moyes, someone who actually looked like they had top class ability. I really don't think it's a lingering confidence problem from his time at Chelsea, because he's shown that he can be very good here.

And like I said above, if it was by some chance a confidence problem from his time at Chelsea, it's Mata's who's got the problem.

1997~~~
I would be surprised to see him start vs Chelsea. Probably Fellaini will take his place with Ander behind the strikers.

1998~~~
As poor as he's been, I really don't want to see Fellaini starting ahead of him. I mean, Mata's been fairly anonymous at times and I can sort of see some of the sense in Fellaini playing...but even then, there's just something that doesn't sit right with Fellaini starting ahead of Mata.

Don't think that's a possibility any of us would've even considered back in April even if we'd been told Mata had physically lost his two legs.

1999~~~
True enough, but you'd struggle to cobble together a one-minute based on what he's done this year. And many of those highlights lead to goals, so there is some substance to them. But as I said before, the Mata in those videos, and the Mata we see now barely resemble each other. Blaming it on Mourinho is just ridiculous, as one would presume that Mata would be professional enough to move on from that episode. As well, I don't think formation/playing style is the reason either, as truly class players (as Mata certainly appeared to be while playing for Chelsea,) can adapt to different styles. I'm hoping it's just a case of form being temporary. In any event, I'd love to hear what Chelsea supporters have to say about this.

2000~~~
He's not finding his rhythm but I am fully confident he will eventually. He's a world class player and just a few years ago he would be considered better than the likes of Di Maria (at that time). 

Could be that he is a confidence player but whatever it is, he has a lot of quality to just be "past it"

2001~~~
I don't think this is true at all. I think quite a number of players (even very good players) can look amazing in a certain system and more average-poor in others. For some, it only needs very subtle differences too. 
Some players are very adaptable though.

2002~~~
Arguments for and against, imo he is not at the races, since he has come to us he has shown, in glimpses, an ability to get into the box on the end of moves to score some goals, his weaknesses are obvious and you take the hit for that once he is producing what you know he can on the ball, but he is not producing... he is not having a defining influence on games, he is surprisingly conservative in possession and is getting knocked over like a feather all the time while coming across in several interviews as if he is loving it and things are going well, like he is enjoying where he has got himself to but not maintaining those standards that got him there.  If this is what he has to offer us it is not good enough, not only has he been disappointing, he has been a liability, losing possession in advanced positions with our players on the front foot has put us under pressure time and again.

2003~~~
Perhaps, but even something as being so easy to push off the ball (as we've seen multiple times this season,) should exist (or not,) more or less regardless of system. Again, that's why I'd love to hear from those who watched him regularly: did he have that same issue at Chelsea?

2004~~~
I've always admired him as a player, but at this moment in time, he's looking like a poor buy. I've no idea what's happened to him since leaving Chelsea.

2005~~~
I agree with all that, but I wouldn't hold his positive attitude against him. We'd be criticizing him if he were pouting about (as many felt RVP was doing last season.) My theory is that he's simply going through a rotten spell, and will eventually emerge from it. The question is whether that will happen with us or another team.

2006~~~
One thing I read recently in an article by Sid Lowe back when Mata was at Valencia, is that he was more of a winger there (albeit one who would drift around and make plays.) It's strange, because the word 'winger' has not been one I'd associate with Mata, based on what I've seen.

2007~~~
Yeah, I'd agree. He looked really out of place when he was first put on the wings and was having much more of an impact when we put him in a central role. Of course, being a winger at Valencia could've potentially meant in a drifting role, where he'd start outside and drift in a lot, still playing a fairly central role. Under Moyes, he was being deployed in a way where he had to predominantly play as a more traditional winger, which really limited him and didn't suit his style at all.

2008~~~
I think the bottom line is that he needs to have a long hard look at himself and sort out his form, because right now he looks nothing like the player we were all expecting (or even like the player who was scoring quite regularly for us by the end of last season.)

2009~~~
As I've said, I thought he was excellent towards the end of last season. He was the one player who looked capable of producing a bit of creative magic in a largely dire side with less imagination than the average Adam Sandler movie.

I don't know what's happened to him. You can argue that it's perhaps the system that's affected him, or the newer style of play, but he just seems like a completely different player. He lacks that invention and creativity which we largely bought him for in the first place. It's not that he's been actively poor in most games - it's more that he's just been anonymous and quiet, which is the last thing I was expecting from him.

2010~~~
Yeah, there's nothing about him that screams 'pass me the ball'. It's like Cleverley, minus the obsessive pointing at the ground. Very strange and disheartening.

2011~~~
Yeah, that's exactly what it's like. Not necessarily doing anything wrong, but just not doing too much right either. Obviously he's a far superior player to Cleverley in every single way (minus the point of course!), but I see what you mean.

2012~~~
Tbh I'm just scrabbling around in the dark looking for reasons as to why he's looked, to be perfectly honest, crap this season.

If you'd never seen him play before, and didn't know who he was, you would never in a million years guess this was a player who used to called 'world class' and who most fans would love at their club (I remember numerous posters on here, not all United, who would dream of their team buying him). Which adds to the frustration that we went and did that, and he's playing like this. Its baffling.

2013~~~
I've been going ape shit at the TV in the last few games, at the amount of times theres been a huge space between the oppositions defence and midfield, that Mata could quite easily drop into and pick up a pass from our defenders/midfielders. Yet he tends to just run forward into the box, like a striker. 

Even RVP did a better job in the 20 minutes he was playing that #10 against West Brom, then Mata has managed in the last few games. Its like he doesn't even want the ball atm.

2014~~~
Yeah, completely anonymous. It's funny, people keep mentioning his dropping deep as a reason for being ineffective, but all I can recall from the last game is Mata standing around in the areas you'd expect to find the strikers and basically looking like he'd rather be anywhere else than on the ball. It all screams 'confidence issue.' The question is why.

2015~~~
Because he knows he'll probably get pushed off it.

2016~~~
Probably so, but that's not the Mata I remember, even from last season.

2017~~~
He seems to be either playing far to high, or far too deep imo. Just never in the actual space between the two opposites that I want to see him playing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The most frustrating thing about that video on the last page is the amount of quality through balls he plays, yet I don't think he's played one decent ball behind a defence yet season. His finishing has generally been very good, but everything else about his game has been a real disappointment. 

Its as frustrating as it is bizzare.

2018~~~
The one thing I will add, is that in that video, all of Mata best work tends to be when Chelsea are breaking at pace and Mata is carrying the ball through the centre, with lots of space, and picking out runners ahead. 

Maybe it could just be a case of thats the only kind of football that will truly suit him, and get the best out of him. He doesn't have that guile and strength on the ball like Silva, which I actually thought he did before we signed him (maybe those weeknesses were just hidden by the style of football Chelsea were playing at the time?) So in a team playing possession based football, like we've been trying to this season, and where the final 3rd is very congested, he just simply won't stand out as he doesn't have the physical presence to find the space needed?

I'm kind of hoping that LVG's long term masterplan would include quick counter attacking football, which would then hopefully get the best out of Mata.

2019~~~
100% agree. A lot of it comes down to the space ahead of him, and his lack of ability to hold the ball when things get congested. Hence why he's either too high (attempting to get on the end of things) or too deep.

2020~~~
He looks smaller and smaller each game I see him. Is he shrinking? Literally and metaphorically that is

2021~~~
Confidence really does play a huge part in the games of professional footballers. Especially for ones who don't have any physical attributes that they can use to still have an impact, his actual game has to be pretty much on top form always to have an impact, if it's not, then he's just invisible. Players like Di Maria, Sanchez, Bale, Reus, Ronaldo, etc., all have their pace to turn to and just run at defenders if they aren't having a great game technically, they can still cause a threat because of their physical attributes. Mata with pace would be a tremendous player probably. Sadly, he just doesn't have any and so he goes missing far too often, especially as he's in and out of the team.

2022~~~
Or is the people in the match just all taller than him recently? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2023~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2024~~~
Di maria playing behind him takes the ball away from mata instead of passing to mata as di maria dribbles more than he passes.

2025~~~
What type of reception do you believe he'll get off the Chelsea fans on Sunday if he plays?

2026~~~
Theres a period at chelsea I remember when he was played on the left and was bursting into the box creating alot of goals and assists. I only remember it from the MOTD highlights. Most people say his central role for Rafa were his best performances tho?

2027~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Final proof that MW was no more than a sock puppet for Kagawa. Incapable of letting go or moving on.

2028~~~
He's been banned for a while for seemingly not letting go and bringing Kagawa up relentlessly in Kagawa thread.

2029~~~
Im sure he'll get a fine one, he  didnt really want to leave at all, it was only because of not playing and Jose in the end and there was no way we were turning down that kind of money!

No ill feeling towards him whatsoever, however there may be those pocket of supporters who just boo any ex player randomly anyway.

2030~~~
That's just silly.

2031~~~
Sorry, I got it a bit wrong, it think he was banned on Tuesday and it's temporary.

2032~~~
Ah, right. Poor MW though <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2033~~~
don't feel too sorry for him, Billy. If MW ever got the chance he'd kill you and your whole family.

2034~~~
Its a interesting one at the weekend, as he has a real point to prove. But in our team currently and especially against top sides he's a luxury player. You think we could swap him for Carrick and play Carrick and Blind behind Herrera / Di Maria and have a pretty solid midfield still with attacking options. Even in the diamond you could do something similar. 

It's a hard one to solve with Mata, but if there's any game he should be up for it's Chelsea. 

He has been productive stats wise for us to be fair to him, but in no way has he been the Mata we saw at Chelsea a few yrs ago. You'd think with Spanish contingent they'd be able to gel and enjoy doing so.

2035~~~
I hope we give him a chance on the right side before we give up on him. That's where I thought he'd play when he signed him and I reckon he could do a very job there. He would have a lot more space than he does through the middle and the physical aspect wouldn't matter as much.

2036~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> He is called Mad after all!

2037~~~
He's better off there than in the centre, I think.
But his defensive work leaves a lot to be desired. And even in games when we're camped in the oppositions half, you need to be aware of what's going on the other way.

2038~~~
Save your sympathy for the next user who suffers from blatant mod abuse. I'm thick-skinned by nature<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2039~~~
'kinell, he's back! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2040~~~
Goals wise he's got great stats, but I think he has something like 5 assists for us so far, which is pretty average for a #10.

2041~~~
In fairness I think it's a tactic of Van Gaal's as both Herrera and Fellaini were also randomly charging forward and leaving Blind and the defence isolated when the opposition got the ball. If anything Mata was slightly deeper than Herrera/Fellaini most of the time. 

Can't understand the logic of it in a team with so little confidence defensively and, let's face it, a slight shortage of class there too. But then Van Gaal gets paid the big bucks, not me, and Fellaini certainly caused a lot of trouble in that role when he came on.

2042~~~
Mata fits into the Adebayor, Berbatov, Podolski, Arshavin category.....players that can get you plenty of goals and assists but will be completely invisable for the majority of most games. These types of players don't last long at big clubs

2043~~~
He's probably a bit better than those players you mention (the closest example is maybe Berbatov) but I broadly agree. Another way of looking at it is "stands out in a good but not great team that you don't watch week in, week out but looks too limited when put on the big stage". Before Chelsea fans get offended, by "big stage", I mean a team aspiring to win the league (not the cup side of the AvB/Di Matteo/Rafa era). Mourinho and, it seems, Van Gaal agree.

2044~~~
Has anybody noticed how Mata prominently features on official website interviews or in their initiatives? Either through his weekly blog, or some competition like that FB 60m fans thing or some interviews(today there is his interview of top 5 United players in his opinion), he is always there. I guess being liked by fans and having big player tag is key reason. Wonder if that will play a part if there is a thought of selling him. 
I see him as one of the more 'marketable' players at club along with his abilities. Not that we have any dearth of players in either category, but still...

2045~~~
I agree, and yet if you scroll through this thread, one of the recurring criticisms of Mata is that he lacks pace and slows us down. That video (and again I'm aware of the danger of drawing conclusions from a video,) suggests that he can thrive in a pace-driven attack, the sort of attack we've all been crying out for recently. Maybe it's all RVP's fault <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2046~~~
He lacks pace, but he still thrives in a countering system. His ability to deliver a final pass into space is probably best in the league.
The problem is that he also offers nothing defensively. Which you still need to do in the biggest teams.
A slower possession-based game doesn't suit him.

He's all about space. He has the space to work with on the counter. He doesn't when we're camped in the opposition's half. So he ends up slowing things down too much, playing too safe, and positioning himself badly.

If he was tougher, quicker and could defend, he'd be a terrific counter-attacking option for any side. He'd probably still be at Chelsea.
As it is - he doesn't have the full package for counter-attacking football or possession football in a top team.

2047~~~
Sad that we havent seen the best in him. He is a wonderful player, I just hope he can find his best place or may be a better suite club even. Exchanging him for a fit again vidal or strootman wont be too bad idea.

2048~~~
It's confusing, I expected players like him to excel under LVG, same as RVP, let the shackles off but it is not happening.

On his performances for us I think that is where it is heading, get a more physical all rounder in there to help break stuff up when we over commit and the play breaks down given our gung ho style, we would still have the likes of Di Maria, Rooney, Januzaj and Pereira to play in the same role if he left.  He just is not producing enough to even make LVG's decision difficult.

2049~~~
There just isn't room for Mata when you've someone like Rooney playing the same role as him who offers so much more to the team both attack and defensive.  I really like Mata that's why it'll be terrible when he finally moves on but I'd honestly take a swap deal for him now for a player who would benefit us more.  We're getting nothing near £38 million for him that's for sure, in fact if we just played Kagawa we'd have the exact same player but £38 million richer to spend else where, plain and simple a panic buy to keep the fans happy.

2050~~~
The problem for Mata is that he isn't <i>explosive</i>, he isn't <i>dynamic, </i>and we're a club who tend to only have out and out flair players who are <i>explosive.
</i>
Di Maria fits this bill, Mata doesn't, and I think this is what Gary Neville meant when he kept reiterating that Mata 'wasn't a United player'.

I've long held out hope that Mata would come good and be used properly but I really think in order for it to work he literally needs the <i>whole</i> team built around him and that's never, ever gonna happen at Manchester United (or Chelsea).

I used to think if given the opportunity he'd rise to it but watching him recently I'm starting to agree with Neville.

He'd be great 2nd striker behind Romelu at Everton, and he'd start every match, maybe a move like that is what would be best for him?

Interestingly, what I said about Mata lacking any explosiveness or dynamism has also been true of RvP for the last two seasons now... I think it's very harsh on Mata not to include Van Persie in conversations about players who will score/assist but offer absolutely nothing else!

2051~~~
Will only be effective playing behind 1 striker. And this striker needs to be a hard worker so Rooney. He is small and weak but that's not the whole problem. Park was small and weak but knew how to manipulate his body to not get knocked over all the time and knew when to get stuck in and when to not force the issue. Unfortunately Mata is playing in the wrong league IMO.

I guess LVG should watch tapes of Chelsea's CL win and study the best way to use Mata because he used to be one of the best in the league.

2052~~~
Would be so fun to go back and read this thread after a game that Rooney has played in the 10 role. 3 weeks ago it was about getting Mata into the team, now it's cash in time.

I still think he will play an important role this season and hopefully next season in Europe.

2053~~~
People are just inventing excuses for Mata now. There's nothing to suggest having a team built around him would help him. He's a luxury player. A poor man's version of Ozil, who himself is a luxury player.

2054~~~
All the issues Mata's had with us were present when he was with Chelsea, but the difference is that he had confidence in his skill and was allowed to play with more freedom than under Mourinho and Van Gaal. Because of his deficiencies, I feel he's one of those players who needs a system built around him. And the system you have to build around him isn't one that's going to ensure stability IMO. Benítez's system got the best out of him primarily because he had little defensive work to do off the ball and he was allowed to float about. If there's one GIF that sums up his position of comfort, then it has to be this one:


FWIW, when Benítez took over at Chelsea, he started Oscar in his first two games. Had he been at the club for a longer period, I reckon he would have no longer had Mata as the main man.

Mourinho moved him to the right last season and though his pressing did slightly improve, he still looked uncomfortable. I think that's the best way to utilise him in our system though because he's not going to provide the necessary skills to help our two centre-forwards. I'd love for him to play like the #10 we need him to be, but I doubt his ability to do so. He's slow on the counter; looks uncomfortable when pressed; doesn't link midfield and attack; and slows down our play. The problem is that he doesn't have the control and skill players like Silva and Özil - I'd even argue Kagawa - have which is why he's not a first team player for me. And although Rooney isn't my ideal #10, I'd still have him as first choice because he's well-rounded, which isn't to say he doesn't have his limitations. Both do, but one suits us better.

2055~~~
Still a quality player obviously.

2056~~~
Don't think he's adaptable enough to be a LVG type player. At the moment he looks like another Kagawa who can only play one position, in which he isn't going to be first choice.

2057~~~
Want to see Mata becoming more Influential. Maybe the signings have taken something out of his performance but want to see him being a great alternative to Di Maria with his running and creative output.

2058~~~
Would love him to score against Chelsea and shut the people up who 2 weeks ago were calling for him to be ahead of Rooney but now think he should be off in January.

2059~~~
Sorry but this is insane. He's a top class player. For two seasons he was the best player in arguably the best league in the world. Apart from Berbatov none of those players have that standard.

This just shows how much a bad season can make people forget about your class.

2060~~~
A bad season? I would say it has been a below par 2 weeks.

Everyone was singing his praises a few weeks ago. He was very good for us last season when he arrived, especially under the circumstances. Started this season carrying his fine scoring form over too.

2061~~~
Yeah but I mean I've seen Mata in Chelsea and this player is a top top player. He's on par with DDG, Di Maria, Rooney, RVP when it comes to player caliber. To compare him with the likes of Adebayor......

2062~~~
He can play left and right. Just had some bad games there with Moyes but he did really well for Chelsea on the left

2063~~~
I agree, can't believe the stick he is currently getting. I fully understand peoples view that he might not work out for us in the long run but when people start comparing him to players like that, there is no point debating.

Some of the shit he copped yesterday when Silva scored was laughable. Fans couldn't just enjoy the great goal, it all came back, Mata couldn't do that, we got the shit Spaniard etc.

2064~~~
I agree, I don't want to see him out wide but in the right game, if need be, he can definitely do a good job.

2065~~~
Juan Mata at his best for Chelsea was better than David Silva has ever been. Mata was simply fecking fantastic at Chelsea and for me only Suarez could claim to have been better than him.

2066~~~
On what basis? They do/did completely different jobs.

2067~~~
<b>
</b>

Are you saying Mata has been a better level than Bale, Modric, Rooney, Augero, Ronaldo, Henry etc... If so I'm phoning the men in white coats!!

2068~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> Not Van Persie, Rooney, Ronaldo, Aguero, Toure or anyone else?

2069~~~
I meant the period where he was at this best at Chelsea, so Ronaldo, Henry, Modric etc. weren't in the PL then. During that time Suarez, Mata and Bale were the top 3 players for me and Mata and Bale were very close with Suarez slightly better.

2070~~~
Lol no worries, yes for a short time spell he was one of the best players in the league. Never reached those heights again IMO as needs to have the team built around him a bit like Riquelme and Kagawa.

2071~~~
So between 2011 and 2013? Mata was brilliant, yes, but RvP IMO was easily the best in the league for those years. Suarez wasn't at that level yet, had a great season but wasn't as good as RvP until he surpassed him last season. Van Persie scored 37 goals and 30 goals for those two seasons, was unplayable in those 2 years. Mata was up there in the top 3 though, probably, but I don't think he was ever the best player. 

The type of player he is though you need to build your team around him, having him as the main player, and with Di Maria here he won't be that and so he'll struggle because of his lack of pace/strength.

2072~~~
If he does start against Chelsea i'd love for him to play well against his old team. Hope he is up for it.

2073~~~
The problem is that he's not going to be influential if he doesn't fulfil the role we need him to play, and there's no way he'll be an alternative to Di Maía because he has a completely different skill set. Before Mourinho, he was way too comfortable at Chelsea and was given so much freedom. Take a look at the GIF above of his awful pressing. That's what's best for him, but it's not going to do the team wonders. I'd love for him to prove me wrong though.
Mata was excellent for Chelsea in 12/13, but Silva's influence is greater because he has the necessary skills to dictate play, i.e., play in congested areas between the lines.

Interestingly, for Spain, Silva is picked ahead of Mata because he works hard defensively, is patient, shields the ball very well, and can function easily in tight spaces.

2074~~~
It's also interesting all the revisionism going on; people claiming that it was a stupid transfer and that we never needed him. Now that may be true, but go back to the thread covering his transfer, and you'll struggle to find any dissenting voices amongst all the excitement over his imminent transfer. Is it really so hard to believe that he's just going through a bad patch of form? Does nobody remember Rooney's form for the first half of the 2010-11 season?

2075~~~
You won't find a bigger fan of Rooney than me but just wait until he plays in the 10 role again, 90% on here will be screaming for Mata's ability in that role. I truly believe this phase will blow over and Mata will go on to have a good season for us. In saying that, I don't think he is doing bad, it's just he hasn't been David Silva and for some reason, that is unacceptable to a lot of United fans.

2076~~~
What ability? He's doing exactly what Rooney gets absolutely slaughtered for. Passing the ball wide and then bum rushing into the box except he's worse at it. Rooney at least proved very adept at link up play and building up a very good understanding wih Di Maria and Herrera. He'll never be David SIlva but asking him to be creative is not too much to ask of a supposed #10 is it? Espcially as he doesn't provide anything else to the team.

2077~~~
Yeh you're right now that I think about it, Mata has no ability at all, horrible excuse for a footballer.

It's truly amazing how quick he has gone from a great player to an absolute waste of space. 

I honestly believe he will have a good season and hopefully prove extremely valuable when we have to deal with Europe next season.

What ability?

Genuine question because I can't remember his Chelsea games and have seen nothing at United to make me think he's better suited to playing at 10 than Rooney. What does he bring to the role that Rooney does not?

2079~~~
Strawman argument.

Well done.

2080~~~
Mata deserves to be criticised because he's not performing the basic function of a #10. Rooney did a poor job of playing between the lines last season - and I'm not a fan of him as a #10 anyway - but he's put in better performances this season. And his positioning has a lot to do with that. You can have unreal ability - it still won't stop players like Oscar and Willian from displacing you. He has to adapt to Van Gaal's system which is a pro-active system like Mourinho's.

2081~~~
Mata has better vision, passing, and a better first touch than Rooney, but unless you give him lots of freedom I don't think he's capable of putting in 7/10 performances for us consistently. I think he's too good of a player to have on the bench. He failed under Mourinho in a pro-active systems because it's obviously demanding - his athleticism is something that can be questioned. The same thing is happening under Van Gaal, and it doesn't help that he's not adapting to the changes. I understand it's hard given his deficiencies but surely after last season, he'd try a bit harder to improve his positioning?

This was the type of freedom - awful pressing - that he got at Chelsea pre-Mourinho:

2082~~~
Mata has a more consistent first touch and is more elegant. That's pretty much the only areas Mata is better. I'd have Rooney above him in every other area and people need to stop making excuses for Mata. He's played as a #10 this season and has shown as much vision and creativity as Antonio Valencia. It's baffling that excuses keep being made for Mata while RVP, who had a better season, get's all sorts of abuse.

2083~~~
I don't think he would look half as poor if we didn't insist on playing two or three strikers. 

As we do, it only increases the defensive work Mata has to do because you can't have two strikers plus a number ten with minimal defensive responsibility. I'm not looking for excuses for him but without a doubt it means that he has to put more of a shift in midfield and that just isn't one of his best qualities. 

I'd love to see Mata and Rooney behind Falcao. We all know Rooney puts a shift in and chases back in every game and Falcao is brilliant with his hold-up play, shielding the ball and bringing others into play. 

Mata might be sub-par at the moment, but he hasn't just turned shit. He's still a brilliant little player just maybe needs a bit of confidence.

2084~~~
It's not so much about what does he bring that Rooney doesn't. There is nothing wrong with having two great options in that role. Look at today, Rooney isn't there, what an option to have Mata there. He is a very smart footballer, great technique, a great eye for a pass, can finish too. Nothing of that is a dig at Rooney, he to can have claim to that role but I don't see how people who want Rooney there (fair enough) come to the conclusion that Mata is a waste of space.
No doubt Mata deserves criticism, I never said anything to suggest he doesn't. However, I don't think him being labelled a waste of space and not United quality because David Silva is so good as deserved criticism.

2085~~~
He's out of form. Did you ever see him at Chelsea? In terms of creativity he was the most creative number ten in the PL during that time.

2086~~~
It's not baffling mate. People are making "excuses" because yes he's been a bit shite but he's a top class player and you can't just write of top class players like that.

2087~~~
People really have short term memory, Mata was great in 2012/2013, he was up there with Mesut Ozil, he was the main man, now he has to be the 2nd boy to our strikers who arent doing ****..

2088~~~
There is hardly any player who is not going through a bad spell. A player like Mata can hit his form at any time during this season and all of this will be forgotten. Yes, in rare cases world class players will not reach their full potential in a team. I think it's about finding a harmony in the team at the moment. There are so many players with different types of status and we also happen to change the team around too many times. Perhaps the team would be better off if only Mata and RVP played upfront??? I believe our team is not playing enough games to justify all these players. If we had played in the CL we would probably be able to balance the team in a better way and not need to force a rest on a player like Mata. Now we're happy with red cards and injuries on players to be able to see a more balanced team. That's not an ideal situation.

2089~~~
Mata better stake a claim today, because he didn't impress at all in the last few games. He'll go back to warming the bench, unless he plays a blinder today.

2090~~~
He was good at Chelsea, even brilliant but the fact is he hasn't been very good creatively for over a year now. And I don't think he was as creative as his numbers suggest. About half of his assists were from set pieces, which is not a bad attribute to have but it's not an indicative of how creative a player is. See Ashley Young for prime evidence.

I'm not writing him off by any means. I dont see why people can't just admit he's in poor form instead of spouting  101 reasons why he's not playing well. Basically shifting the blame onto anyone but himself. And someone like RVP, who's actually been brilliant for us is getting no such luxury.

And fwiw, I'd start Mata out wide with Rooney in the hole and one of RVP/Falcao up top. I have a feeling that might get the best out of Mata.

2091~~~
I don't think it's that. I'm obviously a huge fan but know he hasn't been performing to his best but people are criticising him for not being as good as Silva for example and in my opinion, that's just stupid.

2092~~~
This is slowly turning to a certain other thread.

2093~~~
"walking in a Shinji wonderland"

2094~~~
If Falcao is out we have to start Mata.

The ones left simply don't have enough goals in them to warrant starting over him.

2095~~~
Time to shine Hwan.. No other way about it..

2096~~~
That season he got a huge number of assists was grossly padded by the Europa League, the FA and League Cup, in which he got 14 of his 30 or so assists in that year (in 64 games too). He only had 12 in the league in 35 matches and considering he took all their set pieces, that's not very high - "uncreative, touch of a slug..." Rooney often hits same levels. I don't think he's very creative, he's just a very decisive, final third, second-striker type of forward with a very nice first touch and an elegance in the way he plays. His tactical inflexibility and general lack of being able to fully impose himself makes me wonder if he'll be here past January...

2097~~~
As much as a I love him, we'l look a better team with Di Maria as the AM with Carrick Blind and Herrera behind him. Rooney up top.

2098~~~
The Silva comparisons are inevitable, don't you think? Unless someone wants to throw the excuse that he's a different type of player to Mata, that is. For a player with responsibilities to create chances and influence games at a top club, Silva does at least twice as much as Mata having cost at least 10M less.

Anyway, this is a very important chance that he should look to grab before Rooney comes back from suspension, I'd imagine. If he isn't able to, he should just settle for a place in the bench or move to a different league to try his luck there.

2099~~~
I think it's several things:

1. He's just not playing that well. If that old chestnut about form being temporary holds true, then this shouldn't be a big worry.
2. He's guilty by association of being a Moyes transfer.
3. Like you said, he's not David Silva (although a few years ago, when Silva was in a prolonged slump with City and Mata was tearing it up with Chelsea, the debate about who was better was much more balanced.)

The bottom line is that we are pretty lucky to have both him and Rooney in the team.

2100~~~
Spot on.

2101~~~
Need a big performance from him in the second half.

2102~~~
That little disguised dink to Di Maria early on in the first half is exactly the kind of shit I want to see from Mata on a regular basis. He's got it in his locker, so do it more often.

2103~~~
Horrendous miss notwithstanding (and the dodgy nature of my stream,) I think he's looked much better today. Charging forward with purpose and spraying the passes about. Long may it continue (although with Rooney back next week, it may not have the chance...)

2104~~~
Super pass for Di Maria's volley but otherwise fairly quiet so far.

2105~~~
A decent half from him, imo.

2106~~~
He has even helped the team defensive wise, looks more like it.

2107~~~
Yeah, he's been decent. Still quite quiet at times, but as others have pointed out he made that excellent pass to Di Maria. Certainly looking a little bit better than some of his recent games.

2108~~~
Working hard but had a glorious chance to get a shot on target and completely scuffed it.

Still looking like he is out of sync and not in the best form. Needs to really take a hold of this opportunity because Rooney will be back the next match.

2109~~~
Yep, he's had a decent game so far, but not one to the extent where he's going to secure a first team place when Rooney returns.

2110~~~
Went MIA again in the second half. Really disappointing, as I thought he'd had a decent first half.

2111~~~
Had one good pass to Di Maria but that's about it.

2112~~~
Poor again today, just doesn't do enough and he might be on the bench for a while now. He had a couple of good moments but not enough and he deserved to come off.

2113~~~
He'll be sold in January if we can find a buyer for him. He'll probably first go on loan. He's simply not dynamic enough for this level. He looked great in an average Chelsea team but he's been found out when in top teams.

2114~~~
To be fair everyone did. Up until around the 80th min, Chelsea we cruising.

2115~~~
Thought he was alright, tidy on the ball and looked sharper then usual. At the end of the day, he'll still be dropped for Rooney though, or even Herrera, because of their all around work they can put in.

2116~~~
He had a decent first half but he really didn't do enough again. He just doesn't have a big influence on games.

2117~~~
He was too deep today to be very effective in the final third. I would have preferred Fellaini to sit deeper and allow Mata to link up with RVP and bring the wingers in to play around the box.

2118~~~
Juan just doesnt seem to fit for some reason. Its not like he's having terrible games,it just hasnt clicked.

2119~~~
If Angel scored from the fantastic chance Mata created for him near the start he'd be perceived differently.

He's done ok imo, worked harder than usual and kept the ball moving. I think we missed his play through the middle when he went off and were too reliant on wings.

2120~~~
He can't do a thing right for a lot of fans at the moment, just like Fellaini can't do anything wrong at the minute.

He did well, not a poor game, not a great game, just did well. In life you have to accept that sometimes, far too often on here it has to be one of two extremes when it comes to judging a performance.

2121~~~
It wouldn't have told us anything we didn't already know. 
Nobody denies that he can pick a great pass or score goals. 

That's not the issue people have.

2122~~~
We know everything we will ever know about Mata, we have been watching him for a few seasons now. A few weeks ago, everyone accepted his limitations as a player but now, those limitations are unforgivable for some reason.

He was getting high praise at the end of last season and the early part of this season, nothing has changed in his performance (maybe below par but not in a general sense) but now the slightest fault, or another players strength is used a stick to beat him with.

2123~~~
I wouldn't say that the limitations have suddenly become unforgivable. I'd say the limitations have only become apparent to many.
I'd say most people <i>didn't </i>know what sort of player he was. People just saw his goals and assists at Chelsea, and genuinely assumed he was Silva + goals. 

Only in the past few weeks have many started to realise that he's pretty much a second striker. 
He's possibly getting too much criticism, I agree. After all it's not his fault that people thought he was capable of things he isn't capable of.

2124~~~
I guess, maybe it's true that many didn't actually watch him over his time at Chelsea and only saw him on the weekly highlights show but every player, especially a lot of those number 10s have their weaknesses. It's why a squad is so important, you need players who offer different things and Mata gives us a great option.

2125~~~
Had a better game today and showed more strength on the ball. That chance he had from the FK was poor.

2126~~~
Agreed. Plus, some people have realized that we simply have other players who can do his job better, whether it's scoring goals or just contributing to general play, so he's not so important for us as he was considered at the beginning of the season.

2127~~~

2128~~~
That's the clue though, isn't it? The moment these passes and finishes don't come off, Mata becomes an incredibly limited player, who's only really good at keeping possession in the team(which is an important skill, mind you) and set pieces.

This was easy to see, even under Moyes. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how efficient he was. At times, it was as if he stopped time, strolled into position, and tapped the ball into the net. Being in the right place at the right time is a skill in itself, so that is obviously something we should praise Mata for. The thing is, this skillset comes in waves. And when it's gone, it sometimes takes a long time for it to return. And unlike strikers like Rooney and Aguero, Mata doesn't have those extreme individual qualities that decide games, even when the ball isn't rolling his way.

I always knew that this place would turn on Mata the moment the ball isn't rolling his way. It's easy to be "fooled" by a player who often puts his mark on the goal/assist protocol. Hell, I was also fooled to a certain degree. I sure as hell expected a lot more from Mata, even when he's not assisting and scoring goals consistently. The worst part is that there aren't any excuses for him not performing. He's not old, he's playing in his best position consistently, uninterrupted by injuries, supported by a good central midfield, in the same league as always.

2129~~~
Better today than in the West Brom game. Not at his best by any means but did a good job in the midfield.

2130~~~
People are right about many not knowing what kind of player he really was and are only now seeing his limitations hamper our progress. In an ideal world, I would love it if we managed to get our hands on Sterling. Extreme pace, ability to run and cause a defence problems, can pick a pass, and has a penchant for goal scoring.

2131~~~
Good assesment.

2132~~~
He wasn't bad, but not good enough to keep his place once Rooney is back, imo.

2133~~~
I expected better performances from Mata in Rooney's absence, but he's been far from poor.  He's still a very solid option for us.  Let us not judge too harshly simply because he hasn't been amazing.

2134~~~
I wouldn't mind to bench him and play Fellaini instead. I also hope Herrera starts next match.

2135~~~
Several weeks ago, you would have been laughed right outta here.  How quickly opinions change.

2136~~~
I thought he was good. In fact there was a huge gap between our midfield and attack once he went off. Chelsea we always getting the second balls once they defended our attacks when he went off.

2137~~~
That first time pass to Di Maria was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2138~~~
He is not playing his natural game as he played for us up to now. If you look at last season or early this... He chased in everything and get a shot off or score which was(for me) taking up the space of a striker who would hang out as not to crowd the same position. It is a different game than we are used to seeing form Mata that he is now being asked to play. Was good today, largely missing against WBA and i though very understated against Everton but good. 

His ball for Di Maria's goal against Everton i think was so simple and brilliant that most missed it, its like that is too easy to give any credit for. But fact is a few inches off in any direction or short or long and its was blocked or cleared. Hamez did a similarly simple ball for Ronaldos goal the other night and people are raving about it but because Mata's was not as flashy ? Put the ball on a sixpence where your man can hit before the defender can get there... Just class.
Its not his normal game so he's not perfected it and the simple efficiency of it looks ordinary. Thing is, maybe Rooney can do this role better, more flash and high impact passing but will the team benefit more from it? If Rooney can punish the defences himself it will look like it did. But who's to say Rooney scoring a few goals looking better is actually masking the loss to the team this role IF played right can give. Its not always about the assist and the scorer, many times the killer ball is the one before the assist. Look at many goals this weekend. Even ours kinda... The cross was the bit of magic picked out a free header.

Anyhow that's how i asses him, not breaking into the box anymore.

2139~~~
I'm just not feeling that sense of magical danger from him that you would expect from such a talented player.

2140~~~
It was brilliant, but he hasn't really stepped up in Rooney's absence like most of us had hoped he would. Not exactly sure why he isn't working out given he is so talented. Just a shame he looks like a passenger too often.

2141~~~
Indeed. Its that kind of thing I want, and expect, to be seeing from him on a regular basis. 

I think that the first 'special' thing he's done this season.

2142~~~
Anyone else starting to think LVG now considers Januzaj ahead of Mata in the pecking order?

2143~~~
The problem for Mata is that we look more likely to score when he isn't on the pitch.

856 mins total. Mata playing 603 mins 9 goals from 83 attempts (conceded 9). Missing 259 mins 7 goals from 46 attempts (conceded 4).

Given his strengths and weaknesses, Mata needs the team to be more likely to score when he is playing.

On 2nd viewing of the Chelsea match, Mata seemed to work hard off the ball, though his one magical moment didn't look so good, the idea was brilliant but he could have kept the pass along the ground, making the finish so much easier for Di Maria than having to attempt a difficult volley. The other thing I noticed was the number of times he chose a very simple pass rather than a slightly more difficult one that would have improved our chances of launching an attack.

At some stage I think we have to take a serious look at other options for the role. If they don't impress then give Mata another spell in the side.

2144~~~
He did okay. Should be dropped for Rooney for the City game though.

2145~~~
He was fine, but not enough to keep Rooney out imo.

2146~~~
I’m sure the team will benefit from Rooney playing Mata role. You make it sound like he does so many good things that we can’t see. He’s not. He’s doing all the simple stuff- keeping possession, spreading it wide and running into the box (something Rooney was accused of not long ago).

Not sure what role you’re talking about, but Mata has not been a creative force for us. I don’t see a reason why he should play next week to be honest.

I hope so. Offers more, and we are not blessed with wide players so I think he can get more minutes from now on, at the expense of Mata.

2147~~~
Herrera would have been a better option than him yesterday. Had a better game but still not enough imo.

2148~~~
I thought he was better yesterday than in the last couple of games. He wasn't great, or even good, but that's unsurprising given how good Chelsea were defensively. Aside from that skyed shot he didn't do anything noticeably bad. Wish he could put in that kind of work rate in every game though.

At the moment there's nothing that argues for his inclusion over Herrera or Rooney.

2149~~~
If he doesn't score or set up a goal his contribution just isn't good enough and there is a lot of competition for his favourite position, personally I would like to see Januzaj or Herrera given some games there ahead of Mata. What he did at Chelsea shows he has talent but I would swap him for a good winger or another attacking player who can add some more pace and is a bit more dynamic.

2150~~~
He wasnt bad, played quite well if anything and if we were to continue with him i feel he would perform better as the season goes on. if Falcao stays injured he will get another game, otherwise Rooney is back in.

2151~~~
I'm surprised at the stick he's getting for yesterday, I thought he did okay. Nothing special, but hardly worthy of the abuse. Its not easy in that midfield against the Prem's best side

2152~~~
He lacks the final ball imo. I havent seen him creating too many chances or through balls unfortunately

2153~~~
Think currently opposition would be more worried about us having Rooney on the team sheet than Mata. I was really hoping Mata would take his chance and dominate both games, unfortunately he hasn't shown that at all, some nice touches etc but not the impact you'd want from your no10. 

Rooney would have been great in an end to end game like yesterday.

2154~~~
Surely Herrera in for Mata would make more sense. Not sure I'd like to see Rooney played so deep against City if we use this same formation.

2155~~~

2156~~~
you're right but it's just like that, things in football change quickly. I wouldn't mind experimenting with fellaini as CAM last season either as one of few people here. doesn't mean I rate this guy as manunited quality. hes got a lot to prove himself and maybe show that he is not as bad as what other people thought and can do a job for us. I mean having a squad player like Fellaini is always a good thing.

2157~~~
I wonder if Mata knowing he isn't a nailed on starter when everyone is fit is affecting his form?

It must be disheartening to have been told you're surplus to requirements by one big club, only to arrive at another and be considered a back-up as well.

I personally think he's much too talented to be a squad player, and is far better than his recent performances suggest, but is there a place for him here?

2158~~~
He's been a nailed on starter for most of this season hasn't he?

2159~~~
But only because Falcao has been lacking match fitness/injured and Rooney has been suspended. When those two are available for selection, then i'm not sure he is - hence 'when everyone is fit'.

2160~~~
Either way,  he's getting chances. Can't really ask for more. If he was playing brilliantly he'd be first choice.

2161~~~
The weird thing is, at Chelsea it seemed like he could pick a run or pass out of thin air, now he is playing with the blinkers on. What's changed?, I don't think Chelsea's movement is THAT much better than ours, so perhaps he has just lost form?.

Any regular Chelsea watchers over the last few years, what were his assists generally from. Crossing/freekicks?, or defence splitting passes etc.

2162~~~
Another example hysterical twitter era "journalism", a player doesn't perform 10 points on a few games and his future in the club is instantly "doomed". We are just starting the season and players are just fitting in into the new system.

Mata is going to benefit from having Rooney back, still early days to say he doesn't have a future in the club. Mark Ogden is a clown.

2163~~~
He tormented us when we were the leagues best side at Chelsea. He can do a hell of a lot better than what he produced yesterday.

2164~~~
Any Chelsea fans/followers care to explain how Mata was one of your best players for two seasons? Not saying he's shite as he is clearly technically excellent, but I just genuinely don't know he was ever effective in the PL. Was the team built around him to an extent that it simply hasn't been or ever will be at United?

He just looks so ill-suited to English football, with regards to his lack of physicality and pace. It takes a pretty special player (the likes of David Silva) to succeed in the PL without being either quick or strong on the ball. It's frustrating too as he seems like a really likeable bloke and it isn't that he isn't putting in the effort.

2165~~~
So United have just played their best team performance and suddenly Juan Mata is done now.

Am I missing something here other than the fact Ogden and Jackson are turning the Telegraph and Guardian into rag level press?

If this is to be believed I have a few points to make:

Mata vs Chelsea:

1) He had 91% pass completion. The highest of anyone on the pitch. Continuation of possession and is key to Van Gaal's strategy. Pulling opponents side to side and finding openings.
2) He was always available for an outlet ball - left, right or central. Highest pass combinations to him were from ADM, DB, RVP, AJ and R.
3) His passes were mainly to spread the play. Highest combos from him were to ADM, DB, LS and AJ. A clear move and instruction likely given by the coach.

You know sometimes, to perform better in a team you don't always have to stand out as a goal scoring threat or be the man that plays the crucial final pass. He created 3 chances, sometimes it's just unlucky if an assist is registered or not because it relies on the striker finishing the move. All in all he had a solid game and was the fulcrum of our play being neat and precise, keeping the team moving, creating space and relieving pressure. His energy and movement were superb.

In relation to this Ogden nonsense:

1) Falcao is a far greater player than Rooney so he should be the first one to come back, captain or not.
2) With Mata our team performances have been better/good - a widely accredited comment by LVG and press.
3) Wayne Rooney is yet to display a run of form worthy of starting in an AM role. Right now he should only be in contention for a striker role.
4) There's a young Belgian kid that I'm getting sick to death of people giving a free pass too just because he has "hype". Judging him today and this year, Januzaj has not earned a free go in the team. You cannot blindly have faith in a kid that is failing to produce anything of note at this level. He's been poor for 3/4 of this year and nobody questions it, certainly on here. It's baffling, truly baffling.
5) Has Rooney's pre red card form magically been forgotten? He was awful before it. This captain benefit stuff grates me, if he wasn't English he'd have to earn a starting space again.

I imagine I'll be lynched for comment 4 but it's entirely contextual, it's ok for the press to pick Mata apart but Rooney and Januzaj's failings are so blindingly ignored by all media its ridiculous. Annoying Gary Neville is arguably the biggest culprit of this too.

2166~~~
I thought yesterday was his best game of the season when you take the quality of opponent into the equation. He still wasn't great though.

2167~~~
He was at least a 6/10 yesterday. Which was pretty much par for the entire team, Fellaini/Smalling aside (with Di Maria worse).

Not really sure why everyone seems to be turning on him. He's been very similar to the entire team this season in general, a couple of 8/10 performances, a couple of 6 or 7/10 performances and the West Brom 5/10 performance. I thought between him and Fellaini we kept Matic/Fabregas well occupied, which in turn limited their usual build up play. We also kept possession quite well, which Mata was a key part of.

He may be dropped for Rooney who will put in the same cluster of performances in the number 10 position and people will then say that Rooney should be up front, with Mata behind and RVP dropped (as was the general consensus 4 games ago). For some reason this forum has the bizarre belief that everyone who isn't playing is much better than those that are playing. It's some kind of strange nostalgic memory block.

As fans we should be championing the fact that we have quality player's like him that are part of our squad, rather than the previous batch of mediocre squad player's like Young, Kagawa, Valencia, Cleverley etc. The only shame of it is that we don't have 60 odd games this season whereby we can make the most of rotating between our attacking players. If we are where we should be next season player's like Mata will be invaluable.

2168~~~
4) He was taken off with 25 minutes of a delicately poised game remaining, and replaced by a rookie 18 year old. That doesn't exactly suggest a great degree of faith in how he was playing from LvG.

2169~~~
Or we just needed a body further forward and a more direct route given the fact we'd fallen a goal behind in a phase of play where Chelsea simply suffocated our midfield. Tactical in my eyes, apparently not in yours...

2170~~~
Loads of fans trying to defend mata now based on seeing fellaini finally start to turn it around. Mata is a wondeful player but his inability to get involved enough is down to a lack of mobility and players that are not mobile or dynamic enough don't usually last long at the elite clubs

2171~~~
'Tactical' it may have been, but the underlying logic is still that LvG thought we'd have a better chance of scoring with a rookie 18 year old on the pitch than with Mata. Which again, doesn't reflect particularly well on Mata.

2172~~~
Rooney I'll leave aside, but Januzaj is certainly contextual. How can you ignore the context? 

Januzaj is a 19yo with less than 40 senior club appearances to his name. Mata is a £40M, 26 year old Champions League winner with over 360 appearances. What constitutes good enough for one is not what constitutes good enough for the other, simple as. Over the last two games neither produced a MOTM performance, but for which player was that the greater disappointment? Mata, clearly.

2173~~~
Really? I think I missed those.

2174~~~
Despite Januzaj's 'failings' he's done more in 2 starts from a creative point of view than Mata has done in the whole seaon.

2175~~~
What I want from Mata is creativity and control of the game - he offers neither. I'm totally ignoring the rest of his faults like not tracking back, being mobile or whatever. He just doesn't offer us any creativity or control of the tempo and he is practically invisible in most matches even when he scores.

We should just cut our losses and sell him. Take a look what Isco or Silva are doing in their respective teams and compare that to Mata. We paid 40 million, for feck's sake, what do we get from that?

EDIT: Mourinho was just bullshiting us about Mata not being able to track back, he was just not being influential enough. Totally fecked us over.

2176~~~
You can find videos of his assists on <i>Youtube </i>(one below). 
A number were corners and free kicks (Chelsea have obviously always been great in the air), and the majority of the others required a degree of space in behind the opposition defence or an element of counter-attacking - which was how they played during his best period.

The deeper the defence sits, the less likely he is to set up a goal. Whether through running to the byline and cutting it back or dinking it over the top.
We've been gearing towards possession play in the past year and a half. So it follows that he wont look as good.

And if he's not setting up or scoring, he's not doing much else by the way of dictating or controlling.

Great article from Michael Cox on the Guardian Football website about how/why Mata was unable to be as creative yesterday as everyone is seemingly expecting he should have been.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/26/manchester-united-chelsea-jose-mourinho-louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...r-united-chelsea-jose-mourinho-louis-van-gaal</a>

I thought he did his job pretty well yesterday... and I'd say he was the best out of the 3 centrally creative players that were on the field (Him, Fabregas and Oscar) - he kept the ball well, spread the ball nicely - all whilst being effective within the role for the team that he was asked to play. (he also played one of the passes of the game to ADM... beautiful knock that was).

Yeah he didn't set the world on fire, nor was he a creative "force" but part of me things the expectations of people for him in the game, didn't fit the actual characteristics of the game itself.

2178~~~
He was certainly an 8/10 against QPR. He's also played well against Everton & Sunderland. Then there's the games where he's done fine given the context of the game (Chelsea & Swansea). The West Ham game was clearly a stinker.

I'd say it's a pretty standard mixture of performances for that type of player, particularly in a team that has ranged from brilliant to dreadful almost half to half this season. I'd say maybe only Rooney and Di Maria as attackers have been in better form this season?

2179~~~
He wasn’t terrible yesterday but he was our worst player and he hasn’t done enough in Rooney’s absence to keep his place, I agree Januzaj hasn’t been great in the last 2 games but he has outperformed Mata so I don’t see how that supports your argument. I feel a bit sorry for him as he was cast aside by Chelsea and he was a bit of a panic buy for Moyes who was desperate for a big name and didn’t really seem to have a plan for him other than trying to shoe horn him in. If he has a team built around him, takes every free kick, every corner and has players with pace around him he can be a wonderful player but he won’t get that here and he just looks lost at the moment.

If someone offers us £25m or so in January or the summer I think we will sell and replace him with someone a bit more dynamic, and personally I would like to see Januzaj or Herrera play centrally instead of him in future because they deserve a chance to see if they can do better.

2180~~~
Factually, that has to be bollocks.

2181~~~
Nah, Januzaj's not really been all that much better than Mata, who's largely been poor but had a very good game against QPR.

2182~~~
Mata wasn't great against QPR, not for me anyways.

I prefer attacking players who try to make things happen rather than players who are happy enough to go with the flow. Januzaj is the former and so far has been better than Mata despite only starting 2 games.

2183~~~
I guess it depends how you want your AM to play. I would take someone who controls a game and generally makes some impact on the game ahead of the Mata type, who scores a lot, has high passing stats and assists every now and then. You seem to be happy that he makes a lot of simple passes wide or backwards to keep the ball moving, that’s fine. I demand more from Mata, or maybe he’s just not my type of a footballer- anyway, I think we have others in the squad who can do his job.

I admitted before that he was much better against Chelsea. He certainly wasn’t bad. However, he wasn’t that good either. He had a lot of chances this season and I don’t think he’s crucial (or ever will be) in our possession-based system. That’s not exactly his game.  

Regarding point 3 and 5, I have not seen anything from Mata that would suggest he should start ahead of Rooney in the AM role (I suppose you’re talking about the tip of the diamond). Moreover, I really think this role suits Wayne to the ground, especially if we play Falcao plus RVP/Januzaj/Wilson up front. You must really hate Rooney to say he was “awful” before red card.

As far as Januzaj is concerned, he was good yesterday, poor in the previous games. Either way in my opinion he should be getting more time, just because he offers pace and dribbling ability.

2184~~~
I thought about that myself as well and I wonder if he was the focus of Chelsea's attack and everyone was positioning himself to receive a Mata pass (so he played in a system that really suited him perfectly) or if he's just out of form

2185~~~
There was a few times yesterday I actually yelled at my television at Juan because a Chelsea player had the ball and he was the closest player to him and he bascially just jogged along with him and made no effort what so ever to pressure them. No wonder he didn't fit in a Mourinho team
This was his chance to make it difficult for Rooney to come back into the team....... Rooney will start against city.

2186~~~
Maybe not great as such, but it was a fairly good performance.

Januzaj hasn't been particularly great in his two games and hasn't made all that much happen. He was decent yesterday, and poor last Monday.

2187~~~
He managed a 7 or 8 against QPR and Everton - depending who's rating you prefer

Shame he hasnt won more people over in the 3 games when Rooney was suspended, as he'll most certainly end up benched again (perhaps he thought that'd happen regardless of how he played?)

2188~~~
Maybe he's better with more pacey players around him ? (other than Di Maria, we're lacking in that department)

2189~~~
For all those referring to his time at Chelsea, did you really scrutinize him to the same extent that you do now he's at United? Plus that Chelsea team wasn't very good by the standards of the Abramovich era. He looks like a second Berbatov to me. Looked great in a side at a slightly lower level, will come up with moments of pure class and, less tangibly, is the type of player you'd like to see thrive at United given our tradition for flair. But, at the end of the day, he doesn't exercise enough influence on the attack to compensate for a complete absence of defensive presence.

2190~~~
He's not particularly quick and his dribbling ability is vastly overrated. He got dispossed 95% of the time trying to dribble yesterday for instance.

2191~~~
It's starting to feel like the beginning of the end for Mata at United, in my opinion. 

I can see him ending up at Napoli, for about half of what we paid for him.
A Benitez system would suit him to a t, and he'd probably be so useful there that his drawbacks wont be such an issue. 
His numbers alone will benefit them more than his weaknesses will harm them.

2192~~~
Or swapping him with Vidal or Strootman

2193~~~
The thing is we have nobody else who can carry the ball forward like he does, unless we want to play Valencia or Young. My point was that what Januzaj offers is valuable for us right now. What Mata offers we can get from others.

I don’t think that’s true but thank god we don’t play the best team in league week in week out. Anyway I think he did quite well considering how many passing options he had. Don’t expect him to run a show against top clubs.

2194~~~

2195~~~
Rewatched the match yesterday and revised my opinion of his performance up a few notches. He wasn't that bad. If RVP had just seen the easy square pass after Januzaj's brilliant through-ball he'd have scored into an open goal and we'd be having a very different conversation about his performance.

2196~~~
I'm not so sure about that. The whole issue about him has to do with his contribution to overall play, goals and assists notwithstanding. Mata is more of a stats player for us and disappointment is largely our fault for being ignorant as to what type of player he was and Moyes for panic buying. Already the debate over Mata is 101% like the one we had with Kagawa.

2197~~~
Disagree totally. He's already exceeded the contribution and consistency that Kagawa managed, and that's coming from one of those who really wanted Kagawa to work out. Whatever else he does you can rely on Mata's possession play and just generally being an asset when we're on the ball. The difference between his good games and his bad games is whether he looks a threat creatively. He didn't really against Chelsea, although as I say he can blame RVP for not getting his name on the scoreboard.

Matic was clearly tasked with marking him out of the game in exactly the same way Fellaini marked Fabregas out of it. Fabregas was totally ineffective, whereas Mata was only partially limited. It seems unfair to let Fabregas off any criticism by simply crediting Fellaini's man-marking, whilst ignoring the fact that Mata's limitations in the game were down to a similar (though less effective) job by Matic.

2198~~~
Except that I would argue that Mata's passing has been fairly limited for all previous games. There's a reason why we look better with Di Maria centrally; because he adds so much more pace to our attack. Mata slows down our play because he lacks the ability to hold up the ball under close pressure and doesn't have a quick turn to lose a man.

2199~~~
This isn't true. If this was the case, then Mata would have never lost his place to Falcao. This is what Van Gaal did say before the Leicester game:
I want Mata to do well, but he hasn't had a positive impact on our game (bar the QPR game) which tells you everything you need to know about how he's played this season.

Rooney, Van Persie, and Mata were all poor in their first few games of the season, but since the switch to the 4-4-2 diamond, Rooney has put in good/very good performances. Even after Mata's good performance against QPR, Van Gaal wasn't satisfied. Maybe that's to do with him being a problem defensively, not shielding the ball well, and playing the #10 role in a manner that causes problems for the team.

Had Rooney not gone into meltdown mode against Leicester and had he not stupidly got sent off against West Ham, I imagine there wouldn't be a debate over who should play behind the strikers. While he does have his limitations, such as inconsistent first touch, slowing play down, and not having the intelligence of Mata, I feel that Rooney's all-round game fits our system better.

2200~~~
There's some overlap there, insofar as we also didn't seem to buy Mata with a clear vision as how to use him.

However the key difference is that with Kagawa, his lack of goals or assists meant that we were sacrificing a lot more when we were trying him out. 

With Mata there's a question mark about our overall direction and style of play and whether he's contributing to that. But his decent stats for goals and assists means that at least you're getting <i>something</i> while he's on the pitch. That makes it a hell of a lot easier to justify trying him out for a longer period.

2201~~~
We sold the wrong player imo, on the other hand i think we were forced to sell Kagawa as we just spunked 37m on Mata just 6 months ago. The few chances Kagawa got in the middle he was bright for us, he can do everything Mata does and has more pace, skill and can beat a player. 

And people saying Rooney has been poor, what utter bollox he's been one of our best and productive players before the red card.

2202~~~
Kagawa looked good and comfortable as a #10 for us last season, but I don't think he would have pushed for a position in our long-term formation (4-3-3). He has redeeming qualities and excels in areas Mata struggles in, but there's no guarantee that he would have found the levels of productivity Van Gaal wants, even in the diamond we're playing. It does make you question the move though. Maybe he wanted to leave? Although he's not shown it this season, Mata has very good productivity and produces even when he plays poorly, and I think him being direct has a lot to do with that.

2203~~~
I don't really like the idea of a no.10 personally, as you said in a 4-3-3 neither Mata or Kagawa could play effectively in them. I think the circumstances forced Kagawa out more than anything. If we are heading towards a 4-3-3 formation (i hope we are) Mata will be soon out of the door.

2204~~~
Hmm, hard to agree with that to be honest. Its one of those - someone's theoretical ability is meaningless if they can't do it on the pitch. There were more <i>talented</i> right backs than Gary Nev for example, but few can say they were <i>performed</i> better than him during his time. And Mata is hardly as prosaic as Gary Nev was.

Mata's whole career has been outstanding til last season. Before then it was pretty much 7 straight seasons on an upward trajectory in a major league. Kagawa on the other hand had 4 hard to judge seasons in Japan, 18 months good football in Germany either side of a bad injury, then two years unconvincing form in England.

So if both players get to top form I don't see any difference between the two. But if we had to guess who would have more consistent form in the coming years you'd have to say Mata, based on their careers so far. So I think selling Kagawa made sense.

2205~~~
Mata is a better passer, a better finisher, has better movement, has better technique (in short, he's a better footballer), is better in small spaces, can handle the quicker pace of the Premier League and doesn't shirk away from physical side of the game anywhere nearly as badly as Kagawa did.

But yeah, apart from that he can do everything Mata can....

2206~~~
That's a matter of opinion, which i disagree with.

2207~~~
Which is within your right - though surely even if you think Kagawa is a superior footballer - the idea that he clearly struggled with both the pace and power of the Premier League isn't up for that much debate?

2208~~~
Mata has certainly shown a lot more for us than Kagawa did. At least he's capable of contributing when he isn't playing well, as opposed to Kagawa who apparently needed to have the team specifically designed to suit his exact requirements.

2209~~~
Mata has had a good run in the centre in his preferred position i haven't seen him exceed in any of those skills you mentioned, apart for getting into some good positions for the tap ins, but we have other players in the team for that job.

I agree Kagawa struggled physically but that was on the left wing where he was always going to struggle, he's not a left winger. If he was given the luxury of playing in his preferred position as Mata has I'm sure we would see a much improved Kagawa. I remember when he first signed for us he struck up a good partnership with RVP behind him then he got injured and never really got that position back.

I'm sure this has all been discussed to death on the forum and Kagawa is gone so not much point going any further. Imo Mata will be gone in a few years, he doesn't suit any of our preferred systems and LVG doesn't hold on to dead wood. Mata imo is a very good player but he needs to play in a certain system and style.

2210~~~
I don't get this theory either apart for the one game against Sunderland when he scored the first goal he hasn't contributed anything significant.

2211~~~
This guy has not been a £38m player in a United shirt.

2212~~~
The bits in bold are the only bits I disagree with. Mata isn't very comfortable in tight spaces and it's a big reason as to why he's been in poor form for us this season and why he struggles in "progressive" systems. It contributed to Mourinho moving him to the right, which gave him that extra bit of space to work with so he doesn't have to worry about being out-muscled off the ball. Physically there isn't really much between the two, but Kagawa shields the ball better and offers himself as an outlet centrally, whereas Mata tends to drop deep and move away from potential duels because he's uncomfortable in congested space.

2213~~~
See the Leicster game and say Mata doesn't get out-muscled.
Also him being a better passer than Kagawa is debatable IMO I don't see much between the two in that sense.
Mata will get more goals, Kagawa will add more to the play and the team end up creating more.

I'm basing that soley on watching them for United too (not bringing Dortmund or Chelsea form into)
See Kagawa in UCL last season, Mata has not had that level of impact in a game IMO

2214~~~
There is no debate. Mata has offered miles more than Kagawa did for us. Even though he could do more.

2215~~~
I don't think Mata so far hasn't offered much more than Kagawa in his first season (under Fergie).

EDIT:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/player/102139/shinji-kagawa?season=2012#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CompGSSBGASHSGFCFSYCRC</a>

Kagawa: Prem17363211092010

Mata: Prem 14164281172600


So he got one more goal in roughly the same no of apperances, its not miles more at all.

2216~~~
He is more effective in terms of goals and assists and just a more confident and skilful player. Then again Kagawa was never bad for us but just wasn't doing enough, maybe if Mata doesn't step his game up a bit he could head to same way as Kagawa.

2217~~~
It was more comparatively with Kagawa is what I meant - I found Kagawa to be incredibly poor when not given much space, and whilst I agree there isn't much physically between the two, but Kags really did seem to struggle with the overall pace and power of the league - which Mata obviously hasn't as he's been operating in it pretty succesfully for about 4 years now.

2218~~~
EDIT:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/player/102139/shinji-kagawa?season=2012#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Comp GS SB G A SH SG FC FS YC RC</a>

Kagawa: Prem 17 3 6 3 2 1 1 0 9 20 1 0

Mata: Prem 14 1 6 4 2 8 1 1 7 26 0 0


So he got one more goal and the same number of assists in roughly the same no of apperances, its not miles more at all.

2219~~~
Based on their respective performances for us, both he and Kagawa can sod off as far as I'm concerned. Kagawa left because he didn't do it and Mata looks to the going the same way, which would be a real shame.

2220~~~
8 goals in 21 games (Mata) > 6 goals in 57 games (Kagawa)

2221~~~
Those stats you've posted don't make any sense. They have them down as 6 goals each?

2222~~~
Mata and Kagawa? It's like debating who is the better player between Vidal and Strootman. They might be similar in style, but the gap in quality is quite significant. Mata has not shown it for United, but he's a better player than Kagawa is.

2223~~~
I'll remind you what you responded to:

I don't think Mata so far hasn't offered much more than Kagawa in his first season (under Fergie).

He didn't play 57 premier league games under Fergie

2224~~~
Yeah I was talking about Kagawa in his first season vs Mata last season.
The point was:

I don't think Mata so far has offered much more than Kagawa in his first season (under Fergie).

2225~~~
If you're deleting Kagaw's stint under Moyes from history you should do the same for Mata.

Based on the tiny sample of games this season Mata has - despite widespread criticism - been way more productive than Kagawa was at any point in his United career.

2226~~~
That is just not even true.

Also I'm not deleting Kagawa stint under Moyes, I was comparing both of their first seasons at the club.

Anyway point is I don't think Mata has been THAT great for us especially not for £38m. The notion he has been miles better than Kagawa too I think is overstated. 

Its not a I think Kagawa is better debate, its a I think they BOTH have not been good enough for United but Mata seems to be getting some leeway where Kagawa didn't.

Under Moyes Kagawa never played 90 minutes in his preferred position ONCE.

2227~~~
I do agree they've both been a bit crap and I definitely don't think Mata's been miles better than Kagawa. He has been consistently more productive though. Including under Moyes, when he very rarely played as a 10.

2228~~~
I disagree with the consistency bit, he had a few good games last season but not consistently, equally Kagawa had a few good games in the UCL last season.
Anyway point is I don't think there has been much in it between them, however many will say Mata is miles ahead of Kagawa, apart from the price tag and the wave of euphoria Mata came with I tend not to agree.

2229~~~
Re the consistency, I'm talking about creating and scoring goals. Mata's never gone through the same kind of lengthy droughts that Kagawa went through in this regard.

2230~~~
The productivity is one thing you can't criticise mata too much for... Its his overall game which leaves much to be desired. Doesn't get involved enough in games. He was fine against Chelsea and generally better then usual, but this season he's gone hiding in games and just pretty much kept possession, which was all that Kagawa did here last season. Difference is now we have other top class players to replace him so I'm fine with him being dropped, whereas last season the alternatives were Valencia and young of last year, so thats why I was always hoping Kagawa would get a run. They're the type of players who need the team built around them, but when you have players like di maria, rooney, etc, that's never going to happen.

2231~~~
In that sense yeah.
I really do hope we can get more out of Mata, one of my favourite players in the league before he came here, hopefully he can prove his worth.

2232~~~
On the whole Kagawa/Mata thing and what they bring to the role, what's been painfully absent from Mata's game has been the ability to pick a killer pass. The Kagawa debate has been done to death but on his rare good game if he got on the bal in the hole, there'd be a feeling of anticipation because you knew he had it in him to unlock the defence. 

I just don't get that with Mata/ He just seems to dink little lofted passes, usually out wide. The pass to Di Maria early on was superb but what made it really stand out was how rarely he's produced that in his time at United.

2233~~~
It pains me to say it, as I rate this guy immensely, but if we're going to get the best out of Di Maria in the central attacking midfield role and pursue a proper 3 man midfield, then Mata's time here will be limited. He's too good to be a bench option and is fairly restricted in regards to where he can and can't play.

He's been very, very unlucky over the past 12 months and in truth, there isn't a great deal he has done wrong. This is the same guy that was Chelsea's best player two years running before Mourinho arrived with very specific ideas. Had Moyes remained and decided to build around Rooney, with Mata at #10, then things may have worked out differently. As of right now, I'm worried about him.

2234~~~
There is not one United player I can think of that had such a disconnect between their actual performances on the pitch and the level of support they got. Every supporting post you read about Kagawa was couched in terms of his <i>potential</i> ability and what he <i>could do</i> if given the chance.

Rarely did you hear about how his actual performances for us proved his worth in the following game. Which is because, while he had classy moments, the number of times that he turned a game, or bossed decent opposition, or pulled out a MOTM performance can be counted on one hand.

Certainly compare the criticism that Mata's getting now with what little criticism Kagawa got at the end of his first season, despite the gulf in performances of the teams, and I can't help but feel that its Mata who's getting the harder criticism.

2235~~~
Yeah, I know what you mean. Hes shown that ability to pick out great passes at Chelsea like the one for Ba in the fa cup replay in 2013, but at united, he really hasn't produced and splitting passes yet. Hasn't really shown any creativity which we all thought we'd get with him. He has great movement off the ball so finds himself in pockets of space to grab a goal or keep possession, but on the ball, apart from having a good range of passing, hes really lacked something.

2236~~~
On Mata, if he was being used to play a more defensive role in the Chelsea game, that raises the question of whether or not that is the best use of his skill set. Seems you could have a less creative player in that role. Maybe it was the case of LvG adopting more conservative tactics for the Chelsea game, and as others have pointed out , perhaps his ability to play effectively at the top of the box was limited by Chelsea's tactics. 

Still, he hasn't shown much more to me against WBA than he did against Chelsea, so I'm not convinced his underwhelming performance as a creative MF in these past two games can be attributed to tactics.  Would like to see more one-twos that get a runner free in the box, as Chelsea did against us.

2237~~~
There have been moments when Mata has shown great talent for us but to me, they've been too infrequent.  There have been too many games where Mata does little outside of cycling the ball or getting it out wide and he becomes pretty much invisible when he should be using his abilities to make an impact.  I think a large part of this comes from a tendency to take the safer option instead of trying to penetrate the defense or thread a pass into a tight area, both of which he could do with his considerable skills.

I think the match with Chelsea was case in point.  Mata wasn't bad IMO but he really didn't show enough ambition.  When we set up in the final third, Chelsea gave a healthy amount of space in front of him where he could've tried to encroach on the goal or thread a pass to van Persie but he almost always tossed it out to Januzaj or Shaw.  He also offers very little defensively, which is understandable considering he's smaller.

Mata on his day is valuable but in no way does he deserve to start over Rooney.

2238~~~
I guess Mata will be replaced with Rooney today then. Although Rooney was always going to come back in, Mata's not really done enough to convince Van Gaal to keep him in the starting eleven anyway, in my opinion.

2239~~~
Mata to set up or score the winner and make all the feckers eat their words.

Hugs.

2240~~~
One assist or goal wouldn't and shouldn't change anything.

2241~~~
120 minutes has excused Fellaini from every other performance, so you never know.

2242~~~
For some maybe, but Fellaini still has a long way to go IMO and regardless I don't want to see him as a regular starter for us.

2243~~~
Agreed but it just shows how quickly opinion can change.

2244~~~
Depends on the kind of assist. If it is a free kick it wouldn't change much. If it is a nice bit of 'no. 10' play then it most definitely would.

2245~~~
Did himself no favours in the last game. Probably why he's on the bench.

2246~~~
Can't say he was missed today, but on the whole, with Falcao out, I'd rather see Rooney up top with Mata behind him (and RVP on the bench.)

2247~~~
I thought he had a good first half against Chelsea, and according to Michael Cox (who watches out for these kinds of things,) he played is part in shutting down Chelsea's midfield.

2248~~~
Completely agree with both points. The first being especially poignant.

2249~~~
I think he is not part of van Gaal's long term plans. will be surprised if he is here in the summer.

2250~~~
Hope to see him back for the Palace match. At Old Trafford, against a Palace side without Jedinak in the middle, he should find plenty of space to exploit.

2251~~~
With the 433 LVG is playing, if Rooney stay fit for the rest of the season and is available to play  every game, where does Mata fit in?

2252~~~
He doesn't, especially since we also need to get Di Maria back central as well.

2253~~~
Yeah, he doesn't really fit a 433. He also doesn't really work as a number 10 in a high-line, possession based system.

He's a nice guy and all that, and if he's happy to be a versatile rotational option, then great. Otherwise I don't see where he fits in really, and it'll probably be best to move him on, and use the money to get in somebody who fits better.

2254~~~
<i>IF </i>he was to leave, where can people see him going? Another team in England or maybe back to Spain?

2255~~~
Of the Spanish teams who'd have him, almost none can afford him. I don't see Simeone valuing him any more than Mourinho did.
We wouldn't sell to Liverpool. Tottenham don't really need him, but I think he'd be a decent at both. I think the PSG ship has sailed.

Maybe Napoli? Maybe cut price to Valencia?

2256~~~
Back to Valencia maybe now that they're out of their financial woes?

2257~~~
Yeah I was struggling to think of any real options. If Napoli or an Italian team is his only options then he would probably like to stay and try and work himself into the team in some way. Although maybe he would happily go to Juventus out of all the Italian sides.

2258~~~
Yeah, I could see a move to Juventus happening.

2259~~~
Is it just me or do we play more fluid football when Mata is in the side? Think he facilitates free flowing football better as a 10 than Rooney but the latter offers a better workrate and more defensive cover which we sorely need.

2260~~~
Probably just you.

2261~~~
I think Januzaj, Di Maria and Rooney all have a lot similar qualities. I'd like to see a more composed presence, like Mata, in the final third to balance that out.

2262~~~
The backlash against Mata has been a bit extreme. Its like he has been awful for ages. OK so he hasnt reached the heights he showed at Chelsea for us yet but only a month ago he was generally regarded as our best number 10, I dont see why a few poor games should change that so fundamentally. It is unfortunate he wasnt in the form to capitalise on the opportunity Rooney's absence presented him, but it doesnt prove he wont make it here. Id still like to see him get games in his preferred position with Rooney ahead of him. He can also play in wide areas cant he? I know it isnt his preferred position but given Rooney's undroppable status and the quality of our options up front (assuming Falcao comes back at some point and delivers in line with expectations) he might have to seize his chances when they come out wide.

2263~~~
Problem is that while he's perhaps more composed, it's not worth anything if he isn't using that composure to deliver anything at all.

2264~~~
Juve or Valencia or even Atletico IMO, and probably January since he isnt cup tied, as right now he will only devalue.

Dont think it'll be for anything like the fee we got though, probably around the  mid 20's.

2265~~~
Ah cheers for clearing that up mate.

2266~~~
That was one of those situations where the stock of a player rises the longer and longer he's not played in his position of choice. Almost as though every poor to middling display when slightly out of position is evidence of how awesome he would be if only he could occupy a different area of the pitch. Never really bought into that logic myself.

2267~~~
The collection of forwards at United is not the most ideal.

Rooney is and isn't a CF...whereas Mata is not the typical no.10 but he can score plenty of goals.

Fitting everyone into the team is not easy by any means.

2268~~~
Kagawitis? I had a bastard case of that myself some time ago.

2269~~~
Yeah. Horrible dose, isn't it?

I'm just hoping we're not about to witness an endemic of Angelitis.

2270~~~
True, but the quality of our passing in the attacking third was shite against City. There's no sense in building a squad of different types of players if you're only going to use the same kinds all the time. A bit like LvG's epiphany that Fellaini can add something to the team merely by having a contrasting style to his teammates. Mata can add something, despite not playing particularly well as an individual. I thought the most telling thing about our last game was the fact we had about equal possession to City, but almost none of the passes came in the final third. That includes the time when we had 11 men and also the last 15 minutes. At the very least, Mata could have helped to recycle possession high up the pitch, rather than running straight into the nearest defender like Rooney/AdM/Januzaj were doing all game.

I know this is slightly off topic, but look at the number of passes from DdG, for crying out loud!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s29.postimg.org/uh1l3cryd/05_11_2014_16_02_42.png" src="http://s29.postimg.org/uh1l3cryd/05_11_2014_16_02_42.png"/>

2271~~~
That seems to imply our passing in the attacking third was better against Chelsea. Which is not how I remember it. Safer, yes. Better, no.

2272~~~
But we've got so much attacking talent that keeping the ball somewhere in the vicinity of the opposition's 'keeper is the best way to score and also to keep them away from our own defence. Rooney/AdM/Januzaj are all highly capable players on their day, but making them responsible for possession in the final third plays on their weaknesses rather than their strengths.

And we did create a lot more against Chelsea than City from what I remember. Both safer and better, imo.

2273~~~
He was deservedly left out of the city game and we didn't miss him, he did nothing against chelsea or west brom and he is never going to be the playmaker or pacey wide player we are crying out for. I rate him as a player but I don't see where he fits in, we need to start finding a starting eleven who can perform week in week out and get us back at the top end of the table, we need to stop having to change formation every game to try and accomodate players and I don't see who mata will play in place of on a regular basis.

I don't see LVG dispensing with RVP or Rooney unless Mata and Falcao force them out of the team and so far there is no sign of that, I think there is a good chance neither will be here next season if they don't change that pretty soon as it doesn't make sense having players like that on the bench when you can't field a decent defence or properly balanced midfield and attack.

2274~~~
Pretty sure a fit Falcao can displace one of Rooney/RVP

2275~~~
A fully fit and in form Falcao yes but he doesn't look like that yet and post injury there is no guarantee he ever will so I would question if we will pay 40m plus for him.

2276~~~
I don't think he'll still be here in 18 months time tbh. Sorry Juan <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2277~~~
From what I have seen of him this season in his limited time in a United shirt and also playing for Columbia he has looked better than RVP at least. He actually looks very sharp to me.

2278~~~
Not really, we all know Fellaini has been very poor before this 3 game run he's had.

2279~~~
I know I'll be firmly in the minority here but I am praying Mata starts against Palace. People can talk about different attributes others have or don't have, fact is, Mata is a great number 10 and would tear Palace (without their captain in the middle) a new one.

And <i>if</i> he is not in van Gaal's plans, what better game to give him a run in the rotation, just like with Wilson seemingly coming in for RVP.

2280~~~
I agree, and I'd love to see Rooney up top.

2281~~~
He will be gone in the summer.

2282~~~
Yeah, almost certainly.

2283~~~
Just a squad player, they're good to have.

2284~~~
If we qualify for Europe we'll need Mata next season

2285~~~
Certain players make good squad players, and I don't think Mata's one of them.
Plus we could make decent money from his sale and wages.

He's a very good player, but he has weaknesses that make it hard to accommodate him week in week out. And he's not the type of player you build a top team around. 
He'll do well and score/assist goals wherever he ends up, if he goes - as I expect.

2286~~~
It's quite depressing that Kagawa and now Mata look to have completely failed here. We should just stop signing those type of players now.

2287~~~
Should be: we should stop signing players that can play in Rooney's position.

This is pretty ridiculous. I'm not really convinced that midfield trio of Rooney, Fellaini and Carrick is the thing. It begs for either Mata or Herrera to be thrown in for better ball circulation. We should just drop RVP, move Rooney there and get Mata behind Rooney if we insist on that fecking 4-1-4-1 stupid formation.

It's not like either ADM or Januzaj guaranteed themselves a place in the starting XI, di Maria looked off form when on wing, Januzaj looked off form too.

2288~~~
I think he's finished here sadly he doesn't even get a look in now. LVG just doesn't seem too fond of him. 

Juve has being mentioned ALOT as a possible destination so I hope we can use him as a bargaining tool for Vidal or marchisio or something maybe even bonucci as decent CB

2289~~~
This is the type of game Mata at Chelsea would kill in.

2290~~~
Chelsea rarely (if ever) played like this while Mata was there...

2291~~~
What? Against a stubborn team defending? He was there to break those teams down all the time.

2292~~~
Chelsea rarely had such emphasis on ball retention. Neither did they rack up these sort of possession statistics, while playing so slowly, against opposition this deep. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's not how I remember it.

Again - he had his uses at Chelsea. He scored goals and assisted goals (a good number being set pieces), but he didn't consistently demonstrate that he could do a great job in this type of game.

Mata today <i>may </i>have played a nice ball, but <i>certainly </i>would have dropped deep, played safe, and struggled to hold the ball in the key areas under pressure.

2293~~~
I fecking told y'all.

2294~~~
Lucky we have "squad players" like Mata, eh?

2295~~~
I did make a post some time back saying he should be playing wide right<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2296~~~
Yes, get in Juan !! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2297~~~
He's quality.  Hope he plays in every game going forward.

2298~~~
Has to be rewarded for that. In place of Januzaj?

2299~~~
He's done more in 20 minutes than all of our attacking players put together did in fecking 70 today.

2300~~~
Was not hard though.
I still agree. No idea why Adnan is getting game time atm. Woefully out of form.
Put Mata in the team again and go with the diamond.

2301~~~
Great cameo from him, good dribbling and very direct, this is what we expect from him.

2302~~~
He looked a notch above when he came on today. Wasn't taking an age to do what he wanted.

2303~~~
Really good game. Good on him.

2304~~~
Good cameo but he needs to do that when he starts and consistently, we arent good enough to have luxury squad players we need people doing it week in week out. He should start against arsenal instead of januzaj now, RVP should also be dropped for Herrera and put Rooney up front.

2305~~~
I think he played himself back in the starting eleven today.

2306~~~
Our top goalscorer this season.........

2307~~~
Nah, Januzaj did.

2308~~~
Against minnows like this they definitely had the possession and had to break teams down. He was instrumental in them winning these types of games. I saw it with my own two eyes enough.

2309~~~
Happy for him, think we should play him in the 10 next game. Start Rooney and Falcao or van Persie if he's not fit up front.

2310~~~
I thought we will revert back to the diamond once i saw he's coming on but when i realized he is playing on the right i died inside a little. Still a well taken goal and hopefully he plays against Arsenal and LvG ends this 4-3-3/Fellaini experiment.

2311~~~
I shared your dissapointment, I thought Van Gaal was going to try and give us more bodies in the middle so there'd be angles for triangles and one-two's (one of which led to Mata's goal). Shame it didn't happen.

Glad that Mata showed his mettle today. He was one of the few willing to be positive and test the keeper and he got his reward. Showed his quality with the few chances around the box that fell to him. Still don't think he's well served playing wide right.

2312~~~
Shame he didn't play more like that while Rooney was suspended.

2313~~~
Hint of frustration with his celebration?

2314~~~
I was critical of Moyes for signing and then playing him there but now I'm in agreement he should be allowed to roam from wide especially in this set up because of our dominance in possession against sides that will park the bus we won't have many counter attacking opportunities therefore his creativity could be valuable, also by dominating the ball it's not like he will have to do a lot of work defending.

2315~~~
He was played deeper, I think he needs to be much further up.

2316~~~
Very happy for him to play well after an average few games for us. Let's just hope he continues to improve.

2317~~~
He was being played wider today right? Coming on to replace Januzaj. It didn't work last season, but if he could get into some form wide of a forward 3 alongside Rooney, that would be... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2318~~~
I thought so as well.

2319~~~
Got us the 3 points and I don't think I've seen him look angry before. Didn't do a lot else then popped up and almost got a second, enigma.

2320~~~
Someone like Mata deserves moments like that. Love rooting for him. Our #1 scorer in the league too. Yes he should have done more while Rooney was out but Rooney hasn't exactly been captain fantastic this season.

2321~~~
He was wide right and so much higher up, I don't have a clue how to use him though other than almost like a second striker but that's Louis van Gaal's problem, I'm sure he will experiment.

2322~~~
To be fair, Mata being our top scorer so far doesn't particularly reflect well on our forwards. But still, very good for him to get his goal today nevertheless. Some have been citing confidence as one of his problems, so hopefully that'll begin to improve after this.

2323~~~
Well he's joint top with Rooney, RVP and Di Maria.

Also interview:
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mz1RvTOeyeY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2324~~~
In these sorts of games where team park the bus, Mata is gage solution to break them down. I think he should have started today with Rooney upfront instead of the weakening RVP...

2325~~~
He should be frustrated with the way he played while Rooney was out. I certainly am after that.

2326~~~
Herrera should play central with Mata and Di Maria either side of him and Rooney uptop. We should give that a shot for a couple of games and see how we do.

2327~~~
We need to play players in their strongest position and based on who we are playing. Against Chelsea we were lacking height and physical presence so Fellaini playing made sense.

Today, Palace played with one up top and had their captain missing in an away match. Mata, Herrera (obviously when fit) should be playing these games. If were going to play a slow pace, its ok as long as you have somebody like Mata who can feed the runners or get into the position as second striker.

2328~~~
Thought he come on and did really well today, cutting in from the right flank, and scored a great goal from exactly that situation. 

I think if Di Maria is told to keep the width on the left (although it doesn't seem to suit him), we can get away with playing Mata on the right, allowing him the freedom to cut in and influence the game from the middle - similar to Silva at City. 

If we continue to play 4141, I just don't think he has the engine to play in centre midfield.

2329~~~
If we're playing 4-1-4-1 against Arsenal, I'd like to have him instead of Januzaj. Preferably with him taking the sort of positions he was in today because he looked our best attacking player.

2330~~~
I'd rather a midfield three with Blind completing it and sitting deeper instead of Mata if we're playing like that. I think Mata should be further up the field, and a midfield three with those three in particular is probably a bit too attacking.

2331~~~
That's the attacking 3rd. Blind and Carrick behind them.

2332~~~
He looked frustrated ad that's good because he was hungrier than he's been at any moment with us, didn't look to play the safe ball too much. I agree with the poster who said that we should try Herrera in the middle with Mata and Di Maria flanking him behind room.

2333~~~
Could work, although I'd like to see us reverting back to what we had before with Di Maria, Blind and Herrera as the midfield three, although Carrick's return does give us more options and your idea could work. Would mean dropping one of Rooney/Falcao though.

2334~~~
He's a goalscorer, and an excellent one.

2335~~~
He's narrowed the formation, basically cut the wing in half, was the one who was positionally unshackled if you will.

This allowed us to play through the middle, short 1-2s which got people into positions, it's something we haven't seen when he/Herrera are not on the pitch.

2336~~~
<i>LvG: Mata has played a lot of matches. I've given him the chance, I give other players the chance and at the end we shall see who plays more</i>

Doesn't sound great in all honesty.

2337~~~
Interesting indeed. I also think we will eventually have to try again with those 3 players in the middle; I'm confident they can build a very quick understanding of each other if given the chance.

2338~~~
What I love about this situation, is that Mata and Rooney essentially are the same player in the sense that they can get away with murder because of the fact that they have good goal/assist stats. Mata is better at passing and keeping the ball under pressure, and when the attacks flow well, he's unquestionably a better no.10 than Rooney. The latter on the other hand, is more direct and versatile, which is more useful on a rainy day. He's also a striker at heart, which gives him a natural boost of individualism when needed.

Neither are ideal no.10's for our team. Mata because we lack quality on the wings. Rooney because he's not a no.10, and never will be. 

Right now, I'd play Mata in the no.10 position, with Rooney up front. And don't care who the second striker is. Januzaj/RVP/Falcao/Wilson. Whoever is in the better form will start.

2339~~~
We'll have to disagree.

He was at his best under Benitez, who was all about getting the ball from back to front quickly, and not heavy possession.
Under Di Matteo - when he was also good - they were average and, again, didn't consistently dominate possession anything like we did today (70% ish in the first half)

I agree that he played a big part in the games they won, but they weren't a slow-paced possession team.

2340~~~
At least you know that Rooney will run off the ball and with those three behind him we could cut defences open which we have struggled to do i the last few matches.

2341~~~
I'm really pleased for him, he was excellent after coming on. Never should he be below Felliani or Januzaj in the pecking order. He has consistantly contributed with goals and assists since he arrived, more than those two combined in the same time frame.

2342~~~
Mata should definitely be in the team with Di Maria and Herrera with Rooney playing as a striker until Falcao or RvP shows any sort of form. Carrick and the excellent Blind can be holding players.

2343~~~
The thing is, he does tend to perform against the likes of Palace. It's the bigger games that he's been terrible in.

2344~~~
We seem to have a knack of breeding top class players who are incredibly frustrating or a slight notch below brilliant. Rooney, Mata and now RVP fall into this category and Di Maria these last few games looks similar. 

It's a great problem to have though. Particularly as we aspire to a 60 game season.

2345~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Was the smile I had when he came on, you can only imagine what it went to when he scored.

2346~~~
Glad to hear he scored. When he came on he played wide right?

2347~~~
Think that we looked to him last season and this season we've not and he's not done enough to influence the game. He still have moments in him and he was good when he came on. Hopefully, he can build on this

2348~~~
Certainly showed more than Januzaj. Wouldn't mind seeing him start ahead of him.

2349~~~
Played right but his touch was always inside. Not as in cutting inside but just drifting into the centre of the park, it really opened the space for Valencia too (not that he made use of it).
Not getting carried away but for games like that at home, it's why I don't mind Mata in a wide position if van Gaal plays Rooney at 10. When we dominate possession, he can come in a link everything. Especially with Rafael out there, he would take advantage of that space.

Wearing my Mata shirt to the pub today.

2350~~~
I absolutely agree, I think our strongest midfield is blind and carrick in the cm with mata just ahead of them.
I think Wilson would have more impact that rvp at this point and his speed and fearlessness always make him a threat.

2351~~~
I have a sneaking suspicion that we're both Mata fans, so I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did!

2352~~~
Didn't see the game but on MOTD they said he had 9 goals in his last 15 games. That's really quite good, even for a striker those numbers would be nothing to scoff at. I know we all want him to be more than a goalscorer and he has that ability, but even if he's not doing a lot else he's clearly been effective. It's just impossible to fit all the players we want to play into one team though.

2353~~~
When he scored, I jumped up went across to the laptop which was off (3.30am at the time here) and started pointing at it telling the caf to say sorry to Mata lol (like that Italian commentator who supports AC Milan telling everyone to say sorry to Balotelli).

He copped needless criticism over the past few games and I still believe that he will be a vital player for us this season. He needs to improve, no doubt about that but he is such a great player.

But yeh, I have a dangerous man crush on him.

2354~~~
Yeah I jumped around too and celebrated with my somewhat bemused 4-year old son. I've questioned his form recently but always loved the player (and person.)

2355~~~
No doubt his form has to be questioned, like any player but I just found the only reasons he was heavily criticized is because he isn't David Silva.

2356~~~
IMO our best player. Drop RVP play rooney up top and play mata as number 10.

2357~~~
Yep RVP has looked laboured so he needs to be shown he is not an automatic choice if this form continues (Arsenal game I can't see this happening)

2358~~~
Juan saved us today. I wont be suprised though if he is frustrating next time out.

2359~~~
Im not impressed with this 4-3-3. Go back to 4-4-2 diamond.

2360~~~
Its a squad game, Fellaini got his chance and he took it, now Mata will get his and it depends upon what he does with it. Van Gaal said as much in his post game comments that even he wants to see who ends up cementing themselves in the squad by the end of the season.

2361~~~
I wouldn't mind seeing a 2013 City formation applied on United. with Mata and Di Maria playing as wide cams and not wingers.

2362~~~
How about trying a diamond with Mata <i>properly</i> up front with ADM through the middle and Herrera in Fellaini's place. McNair at the back and Blind as DM...

----------------------DDG----------------------
Rafael------Jones----------McNair------Shaw
----------------------Blind----------------------
------Carrick---------------------Herrera------
-----------------------ADM----------------------
-----------Rooney--------------Mata-----------

2363~~~
I think Mata should be used sorely in attacking areas where his movement and goalscoring will be most dangerous. I agree with people who are suggesting Mata as one of the two forwards with Rooney deeper. The no.10 in the diamond has too much defensive responsibility for his skillset. That said I think a lack of balls is what has held him back in his poor outings before. The Mata that played during Rooney's suspension wouldn't have hit those two shots, one that hit the post and the goal, that had nothing to do with his position.

2364~~~
His goal record for us is very good, for me he should be starting every match as he's too good to be left out.

2365~~~
Agreed, I'm also happy that Blind is getting the recognition for his solid displays so far.

2366~~~
What was so different yesterday was the clear effort he was making to directly affect the game. Off the ball as well you could see him busting a gut to close people down and track back. He really tried hard to have a positive impact on the game, which was good to see as we have seen him coasting by a bit, in recent games.

2367~~~
Class. So far he's my favorite new signing. Love understated players like that.

2368~~~
Yeah, that was definitely the biggest difference and yesterday showed the type of player he was for Chelsea, actually having an impact in games. For us for the most part, it was scoring a few taps ins, free kicks and just coasting through games doing little simple passes but not really busting a gut to make a real impact ever. Everyone knows he has it in him to be a class player, he just wasn't doing enough to warrant a spot. If he shows the desire he had yesterday to get on the ball, make things happen, then he'll very quickly become a key player and be seen as a world class player again. Very encouraging. 

Hopefully he keeps his spot vs Arsenal now, even if it is on the right or left of a 4-1-4-1. He lacks pace, but if he plays out wide he basically adds another man in the middle by drifting inwards, and would give us more control on the ball and just more quality overall, as well as combining with Di maria. I criticized him a lot this season for basically going hiding in every game, even the QPR game he didn't do much, and I had the opinion that he was going to be sold in January or next summer. If he continues in the same vein as his sub appearance then there's no reason why he won't be a key player.

2369~~~
He definitely looked like he had a point to prove yesterday, he was a lot more proactive then we've seen for a while. Hope it continues.

2370~~~
Mata had a good cameo against Crystal Palace and made us more fluid in possession. I think the fact that he played out on the right meant that he didn't need to drop deep into midfield like he did against Chelsea and West Brom. Also, this match clearly demonstrated that, whenever he plays higher up the pitch, he is much more effective than playing deeper. By playing on the right against Crystal Palace, the attacking freedom he had allowed us to play at a better tempo than we did in the first half. Plus, he's done very well in tracking back as well.

I think it's pretty obvious by now that he's at his best when playing an attacking role high up the pitch. He was always at his best for Chelsea whenever he was in and around the final third whilst circulating possession in deeper areas. I don't think he can ever be a playmaker who can dictate our pace, tempo, and rhythm along with providing passes to players in dangerous areas. However, by playing him in the final third, his creativity, directness, and technique can be great at breaking down teams and getting goals. Still, though, he will need movement around him to open up spaces for him to be effective in. Unlike Silva, he's not that great at playing in tight spaces.

2371~~~
I agree. He played a lot on the right of a front three during his best season with Chelsea. It allows him more space and freedom when he roams inside.

2372~~~
Not only that, but he wasn't required to dictate play as well. It allowed him to put more focus on being effective in the final third than deeper in midfield.

2373~~~
I still think his best position at Chelsea was through the middle and playing in a floating position. This allowed him to pop up everywhere in the final third (and attack the space <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>), whether be it right or left. It was just that the players at Chelsea at that time kept on pulling an attacker with them which allowed Mata to show up near the penalty box with the ball and that's where he did his thing and hurt the opposition more. Our problem with the Diamond is that we have Rooney-RvP, both of whom are keen on dropping deep.

It's amazing that we have an attacking talent consisting of di Maria, Rooney, RvP, Mata but can't accommodate all of them together.

2374~~~
Forgot Falcao too. It really is as if a 7 year old was playing Football Manager, just buying his random favorite players but still losing every game.

2375~~~
I intentionally left him out as he still hasn't played as many games/settled in the side.

Also, we aren't losing. We are just finding our way. Still.

2376~~~
Express saying we are looking to sell Mata in January...

....well..it s the Express!

2377~~~
For 20m!

2378~~~
If he goes we won't get anything like £37m, that's for sure.

2379~~~
it's not like he's not still playing quite a bit, though. One of our strikers will inevitably always be injured and I'd certainly take him over RvP anyway, doesn't make much sense to sell him.

2380~~~
Unfortunately, Mata, just like Kagawa have been subdued because of Rooney. For some reason, we refuse to play Rooney as a no. 9, therefore players like Kagawa/Mata are benched, they lose their swag and confidence and look like shadows of the players they once were.

2381~~~
Given the teams that'd most likely be in for him - the likes of Valencia and Atletico most likely - I'd expect a €20m price tag. I'd expect him to be back to world class level at Atletico.

2382~~~
Yeah I'd say probably around the £20-23m ish mark will be about it. As usual we're making it pretty obvious we want to sell.

2383~~~
Chelsea made it fairly obvious too yet look what we paid them. We're just a bit rubbish at this whole selling players thing. If multiple clubs are interested in him we should really be pushing for higher than that.

I wouldn't be surprised if we just loaned him to Valencia instead, just in case we need him next season or anything. We seem to love doing that.

2384~~~
So Rooney alone in the Number 10 position? Yeah, that bodes well.

2385~~~
We're not too clever when it comes to buying either.

2386~~~
What we should be doing is playing Di Maria or Herrera behind Rooney, actually. LvG should grow some balls and drop both Mata and RvP.

2387~~~
Chelsea sold him to rivals when he was still coming from the best season of his career that ended just 6 months before. Now he's had 18 average months and we won't be selling to a rival. £37m was a decent price BTW, it's a going rate for top players plus tax for him crossing between one rival to another.

2388~~~
Dunno about that, wouldn't be surprised if we gave him to Arsenal 'out of respect' right as we're in the middle of fighting for fourth place with them.

2389~~~
Yeah in a one horse race for a player who couldn't get a sniff of Chelsea's team we managed to overpay massively. That's what desperation does.

2390~~~
Arsenal don't need him at all, they have Ozil and Cazorla who occupy the same places. The ship has sailed when Ozil moved to them unless they sell Ozil somewhere (Bayern?).

2391~~~
We absoutely didn't need him at the time too and Moyes had no idea where to fit him, just like van Gaal currently. Rooney plays where he wants to play and if that's the space Mata is supposed to occupy then we'll just drop Mata like we dropped Kagawa. Not that I'm impressed with Mata's performances here, he's been effective at best.

2392~~~
Ummm, in the midfield Diamond? I'm not sure whether either of them would fit in there, and Herrera is better used beside Blind/in front of him the way we played during September.

2393~~~
It was a joke Sarni, the Welbeck thing etc.
Herrera mostly played as a #10 for Athletic and he was excellent there. We'd also be far more defensively solid with Blind and Carrick behind him and Di Maria than we were previously when we played the diamond.

2394~~~
You're right Herrera is good there, but he did play as a no10 last season.

2395~~~
He was bought to be the player he was at Chelsea but I don’t see it happening here for one reason or another and he doesn’t really fit into the system so it makes sense to sell him and bring in someone that does. £20m is about all I would expect to get for him as he is likely to be sold to a team in Italy or Span (not Real or Barca though) so they can’t afford to splash out big fees.

Feel sorry for him because he is a good player, he would have been better off seeing out the season with Chelsea and then moving in the summer, I still think he was a bit of a panic buy for Moyes and Woodward and I don’t think he is a player LVG would have bought either.

2396~~~
You mean like this?
That would leave our 2-3 strikers on the bench and would leave a lot of onus on di Maria/Adnan/Herrera to score when Rooney would have his off days. Also, I don't think we have the time and patience currently to shuffle up the pack one again and see how the team performs.

2397~~~
Yeah, but I only saw a little of him last season. Mostly I remember him playing as a CM, and in the diamond that we played, where we actually looked like having our midfield back after an age.

2398~~~
that was my point. grow some balls etc.

2399~~~
Seeing our defense, I would say we need as many strikers on the pitch as possible.

2400~~~
Thought you were serious because Arsenal once wanted him.

2401~~~
How does that make sense? I'd say it's far more important to have a steady midfield to protect them.

2402~~~
Well, if we can't stop them, it'd be better if we score more than the opposition. As stable a midfield would be, there would be some errors as shown by Smalling/against Leicester.

2403~~~
Leicester is a great example of why having a stable midfield in front of the defense is better than just overloading the first XI with attacking players.

2404~~~
You won't score without a solid midfield.

2405~~~
Blind and Carrick there will help the defence, the main problem with the defence is actually the lack of protection they get.

2406~~~
I know we've all accepted that Mata can't play wide, but should we? He's only 26, and he played well there for Valencia. We really need wide production and he can still shoot and pass from there as it's an off-wing.

2407~~~
I wouldn't mind. I don't like Januzaj there right now. He isn't that great at cutting in and shooting and his right foot delivery is non existent.

Mata has excellent delivery and he wouldn't be required to beat his man if Rafael is there to help.

I'd have Mata play on the right or behind 1 striker. Ideally supporting Rooney or Falcao but that probably won't happen.

2408~~~
Eh? He's spent most of his career playing from wide positions so not sure why anyone would accept he can't play there.

2409~~~
I was happy to see Mata score in the last game, but i couldn't help thinking...if he'd played with a bit more urgency in his previous outings then he wouldn't have been left out of the starting eleven in the first place.

Doing the 'whats my name' celebration, just made me question why footballers need some kind of drama for them to actually be bothered.

Another example of this will be when Welbeck scores against Utd in the next game! air shots galore every week from Danny in an Arsenal shirt but when Utd turn up he will become a killing machine.

2410~~~
His best position is as a number 10 but he has done well playing out wide during his career but you need the right players around him to compensate for his lack of pace, I don’t think we would get enough out of him by sticking him on the right wing against Arsenal (not with Fellaini and Rooney as the cm’s) and he is a liability defensively so I would still use him off the bench unless Herrera comes into the side.

2411~~~
I'd play him as the #10 against Arsenal. Whoever plays deep for them isn't that great defensively so he'll get plenty of space.

2412~~~
Neither of Arteta /Flamini / Wilsherer are particularly quick or physically strong either, so less chance he will get bullied out the game. He also had a decent record against Arsenal too if I remember.

2413~~~

2414~~~
Hopefully this will put all speculation of him leaving to bed which was ridiculous in the 1st place.

2415~~~
3rd in shirt sales. 32% increase in google searches. Twitter followers doubled. Who gives a flying shit about any of this?

2416~~~
It's called marketing.

2417~~~
Players, agents and shareholders.

2418~~~
Mata vs Arsenal:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/my3SiopaZac?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlUftwoJ0Ws?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2419~~~
It would most likely have been 4 out of 9 games if Rooney didn't get that red card, though... Kagawa was also third in shirt sales for quite a while. Shirt sales will not keep a player around.

I can believe that Mata doesn't want to leave and that Van Gaal wants to keep him. Having a player like Mata as a <i>backup, </i>is a luxury few other teams can enjoy. As for Mata, I don't think he's ready to give up and go to a weaker club just to get more playtime. Kagawa was lucky in the sense that he had the opportunity to go to a better team and be guaranteed to start in his favored position. Mata doesn't have the same luxury. Chelsea wont take him back now.

2420~~~
That's true, Dortmund are absolutely flying this year.

2421~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 15th place, isn't it? Makes it seem like we're having a dynamite season by comparison.

Kudos to him for crow-barring Kagawa into a discussion he doesn't belong though. He's got it down to a fine art.

2422~~~
He should start instead of Januzaj vs Arsenal, imo.

2423~~~
We should rename him to Mad Whinger.

Or Mad Whiner.

<a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a>

2424~~~
Yeah, IMO2.

2425~~~
Mata is on something like 150, 000 quid a week....Valencia and Atletico wouldn't be able to offer him half that amount....Mata is not going anywhere anytime soon but I get the feeling LVG doesn't want him here but he will be a useful player to bring off the bench

2426~~~
I also dont get why the press constantly talks about Mata leaving, we need more world class players, theres no point on selling the ones we already have. He has been good for us, not excellent, but who has been in the past one year or so?

2427~~~
Valencia are quite rich right now, they might not be able to offer the exact same amount but could be thereabouts (say £100k a week).

2428~~~
The hivemind mentality of this forum strikes again<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1. At the moment of Kagawa's departure, Dortmund was quite easily considered a better team(not in terms of big name or money, mind you). Where they are now is irrelevant.
2. Dortmund will still quite comfortably finish top 4, all while setting records in the CL, a tournament we're not even qualified for.

How is this crow-barring? Their situations are eerily similar: they are no.10's who were(arguably) world class for their respective clubs, who struggle when played out of position, aren't/weren't favored by their manager, and sold a shitload of shirts in their first season.

You're talking as if Kagawa left 2-3 seasons ago. He left in august this year, and our current no.10 is suffering from pretty much the same things as Kagawa suffered from, and now there are even rumours of him wanting to leave(not that I believe them). Of course Kagawa will be mentioned! Anything else would be weird.

2429~~~
From now on I'm just going to threadban you from every thread you mention Kagawa in that isn't to do with Dortmund or Kagawa, starting with this one.

2430~~~
We do need more quality but we need players that fit into a system and compliment each other, at this moment in time Mata doesn’t meet those requirements and if that is still the case at the end of the season I think he will be on his way. There are only so many high earners you can have and any who aren’t in the team are going to be vulnerable as we might need to get rid in order to bring in those new players we need.

If Rooney starts in midfield again I wouldn’t play Mata because I think it will put too much onus on Rooney to defend and cover for Mata otherwise we will be leaving whoever is playing at RB too exposed.

2431~~~
I'm not gay, but when you talk like this I get really hot inside. I just melt.

2432~~~
Mad Winger brings Kagawa out of nothing again? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He will shine in zweite Bundesliga next season I'm sure. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2433~~~
Horse, stable door...

2434~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2435~~~
Despite Balague becoming a Caf favourite since breaking the Di Maria story, I still think Mata will be off in the summer.

2436~~~
That might've just been your coming of age moment.

2437~~~
If he's happy here there'd be no point in selling him, and I do think he is happy here.

2438~~~
I agree with the first bit. Not so sure about the second bit, though. It must sting like hell to go from being one of the best players in the league to warming the bench in your mid-twenties.

Having said that, I don't think he wants to leave. I mean, where would he go? There's no way for him to get consistent playtime for an equally good or better team than us. He'd have to go a level below. I don't think he wants that.

I hope he starts vs Arsenal.

2439~~~
We need diferent players for different roles in what it is a long season. I don't understand this system talk since I haven't seen what it is our famous system.

2440~~~
No we don’t have a system, we keep trying different ones and as yet he doesn’t fit in to any of them and we have an abundance of players who lack pace and or physicality and he needs that around him. First and foremost we need a strong, competitive team, anyone who doesn’t fit into that is going to have serious doubts against their future especially if they cost a big fee and are on big wages. He was bought to be the player he was at Chelsea, not a rotation option or to have good cameos, anything less isn’t good enough.

There isn’t much point having players who are a plan B or can be different options if you don’t have the right options in the first place, someone like Mata will have to make way if LVG wants to bring in other attacking players because there isn’t a bottomless pit of money and wage bill has to be managed. We didn’t need him the day we signed him, don’t need him now so he is gone unless he changes that by the summer or possibly even January.

2441~~~
I think he will come out good during the rest of the season, for me he has not been "that" bad to sell him already.

2442~~~
If we are going to drop RvP (with Falcao injured), LvG should quietly put Rooney up as a lone striker and start Mata behind him, flanked by di Maria and Adnan. No point faffing about now by playing Rooney deeper alongside Fellaini.

2443~~~
No he hasn't been that bad and he is a very good player but he hasn't been very good either and is effectively a £37.5m squad player in a struggling team so selling him to fund new signings makes sense as things stand.

2444~~~
It seems like his days at United are numbered. Expecting a transfer to Spain come the summer.

2445~~~
Most likely, but I don't think today really proved that. With the defense we had LVG was always going to play harder working and defensively astute players. After we got the goal there was no way someone like Mata would be coming on.

2446~~~
I think Mata will come in for the Hull match.

If van Gaal can't drop RVP for that match, he really needs someone to talk to him.

2447~~~
Play him behind Rooney next match please.

2448~~~
Carrick
Ander - Di Maria
Mata
Rooney - Wilson

Wouldn't mind seeing us go with that and then taking one of the high-paced, energetic midfield duo's or even Wilson off for Fellaini/Fletcher if we need to get a bit gritty once we've killed the game off.

2449~~~
He must surely come in for RVP now. Surely?!

2450~~~
It's disappointing to see Mata on the bench when 1) he was the outright game-changer against Palace and deserved to start today and 2) RVP is doing feck ALL in 80 minutes and should've come off earlier.

Time for van Gaal to be proactive.  Put RVP on the bench, Rooney and Wilson as the two up front with Mata as the #10.

2451~~~
Yep has to play against Hull, did very well against Chelsea then got dropped for City then scored the winner against Palace after being dropped for that one and then dropped again today <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2452~~~
I think he'll play against Hull. He'll probably bag a goal too. RVP is lucky to be playing ahead of him right now.

2453~~~
Was right not to play him today he would not have been any use as he couldn't have contributed defensively in midfield and doesn't have a the pace to play on the counter. He might come in against Hull but wouldn't be surprised to see him on the bench a again.

2454~~~
We will most likely have to play the 3-5-2-1 again against Hull given our lack of LB options, and I doubt Mata will come in. If there is any change it might be pushing Rooney up next to Di Maria and bringing Ander in, or just playing Wilson instead of RvP.

2455~~~
Praying he comes back in, his patience and quality on the ball will guarantee chances against a side like Hull at home.

2456~~~
I've been fairly critical of him this season since I think he's often been anonymous, but I kind of hope we switch it up tomorrow and play him since RVP looks more and more hopeless each time he plays.

2457~~~
I wonder if we may revert back to 4-3-1-2 as Hull often deploy a 3 at the back system themselves against big teams. This presents us with an opportunity to control the game, dictate play, dominate possession and thus need a player to carve openings out for runners. 

De Gea
Rafael Smalling McNair Blackett
Fellaini Carrick Di Maria
Mata
RVP Rooney

2458~~~
If Mata misses out because of RVP, I think I'll cry.

2459~~~
Is he down with injury or something?

2460~~~
Don't say that! why would you say that?

2461~~~
Starting today! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Hopefully he has a great game!

2462~~~
Common Juan!

2463~~~
I very nearly called it but for the defensive swaps.

2464~~~
Happy for him, hope he grabs his chance.

2465~~~
One "runner" in the team (Di Maria) and fullbacks. This is going to be a difficult game for Mata.

2466~~~
Valencia and Young should have ample opportunities to press Elmohammady and Robertson. Fellaini will do his usual drift to the edge of play waiting for a cross trick too. There will be options for him however your point is a valid one, it may be that our best chances come on the counter when Hull aren't drilled into position quite so much.

2467~~~
Do me proud son!

2468~~~
One of his last chances I think, has regressed into a squad player with potential to be a key player. Not performed this season.

2469~~~
Am I the only one who thinks he should been offering more, he is constantly passing it backwards, and hardly takes a player on, it's not bad what he is showing, but he is playing like a ball retention player.

2470~~~
What are you talking about?

2471~~~
Huh ?

2472~~~
I think he is playing well, but I see him passing the ball backwards to often, just to keep possession, but as one of the creative players, I think he should think forward more often, and try to break the game open with his class.

2473~~~
He's been ok. Nothing out of the ordinary.

2474~~~
He's been making many driving runs forward and through balls, what are you on about?

2475~~~
This is not even his game.

2476~~~
Hull hasn't exactly been pressuring him though have they?

2477~~~
Many? I know Herrera and Mata look alike.. He is doing well, but I just too often see him giving back the ball to Carrick, or Herrera, while I know he can offer more.

2478~~~
More this "last chance" business. He's been here less than a year. People get far too hyperbolic about the short term. Like when Januzaj didn't start for the first 4 games and everyone threw a wobbly and decided he was going to leave. Then he started 3 and everyone wanted him dropped. Chill the feck out man.

2479~~~
And your point is?

2480~~~
Performed really well so far.Especially since it is his first start in a long time.

2481~~~
It's so easy to see how much he loves playing with Herrera. Our team looks so fluid with those two on the field together.

2482~~~
So you dont think he has been underperforming, especially this season? Through injuries he has had a couple of chances from LVG, but he hasnt taken them yet has he? He wont get chances endless I think, especially with players coming back (Falcao, Herrera)

2483~~~
Anyone else feel Mata is more at ease playing off Hererra rather than Fellaini or carrick.

2484~~~
I wish he'd play more of those little balls over the top, like for the goal. He's constantly looking for it, then playing the easy pass instead of pulling the trigger.

I know the success rate of those passes probably isn't all that high, but in a game like this where we have so much possession I'd like to see him try some more risky passes, he's got the talent.

2485~~~
We're 12 games into the season and he's played in 10 and scored 3.

I repeat. Chill the feck out man.

2486~~~
Yep. Ander and Juan offer a lot of intelligent movement in space and feed odd each other. The other two are a bit less mobile in comparison.

2487~~~
He's quite good today, but there are acres of space and I do expect him to do more in those circumstances.

2488~~~
His best performance of the season, looks motivated to run harder than in some of our previous games.

2489~~~
Yep, their working wavelength seems to be perfect at times, given their close experience with Spanish U-level teams. Ander and Juan offer a lot of intelligent movement and passing in space to feed off each other. The other two are a bit less mobile in comparison.

2490~~~
Yes, but given they've been playing with each other since they were kids in the Spanish youth set up that's understandable. Carrick is more direct, Fellaini more muscular, Mata's 'cute' touches suit Herrera's way of playing the game but they grew up playing tiki taka so that's no shock.

2491~~~
Different kind of role for him today. He's playing as a wide playmaker, but one thing I'm impressed with is his work rate, usually that's the part of his game that's lacking but his worked extremely hard today.

2492~~~
And assisted? And created? Main reason why we got him. If he doesnt step up to his normal level, I doubt LVG will be waiting for him to get there. We got Rooney for his position, and Herrera who could be playing there too, if he doesnt grab his chance, I wouldnt be surprised if LVG moves him on.

2493~~~
There was a stat early in the season that showed Mata had been involved in half of all our goals since he signed. His stats/productivity are amazingly good, regardless of what armchair managers think of his influence. Just going by goals alone he's got 9 in 21 games for us, so forgive me if I don't think a few quiet games early in a season is proof our manager wants rid of him. If Caf logic is anything to go by, we're selling half our squad every week.

Sack Van Gaal. Sell Mata

2494~~~
Mata needs to have a good look at Herrera. Needs to be quicker and more incisive with his passing.

2495~~~
I feel mata is one of the best when it comes to picking out a pass or playing a through ball.It is just that we don't play in a style that allows more of that.

2496~~~
Trying to set up Falcao rather then score himself. I really liked that, very unselfish.

2497~~~
Well done and good link between midfield and attack. Not amazing today but justified his starting place

2498~~~
Good game. Thought he could have been more riskier with his passing but good nonetheless.

2499~~~
If he wasn't amazing he was close too it... was an excellent performance.

2500~~~
Good game, especially in the first half. He probably played better today than in the games he has scored or assisted.

2501~~~
I thought was very very good. Looked more mobile than usual, was stronger on the ball and linked very well in the middle with Carrick and Herrera.

Should have been more selfish and taken a shot instead of passing to Falcao.

2502~~~
Compared to his very best form, there is still room for improvement but yes, he did really well and should have got an assist

2503~~~
Way too good to be sitting on the bench.

2504~~~
Good positive performance. Shame he didn't get that assist or a goal but it was a good display.

2505~~~
Was great this game and linked up well.

2506~~~
Thought he was class today, could have had a few assists if people took their chances. This is a lot more like it, today and his last game, compared to the start of the season when he just went missing in games.

2507~~~
Hardly put a foot wrong today and was involved in a lot of what we did good as in an attacking sense. He still needs to step it up against the better opposition though.

2508~~~
I didn't understand his position today. Was it a 4-1-4-1 with him one of the rotating 4?

2509~~~
When we play at home against teams who will try to defend only I think he should be one of the first names on the pitch

2510~~~
And to think there were people posting in the game thread that they hadn't even noticed him until he gave away a foul in the second half. I honestly think comments like "Is so-and-so even playing?" and "I haven't even noticed so-and-so," are more an indictment of the poster than the player. Try actually watching the game rather than obsessively posting on the Caf!

2511~~~
Great performance from him today. Him and Herrera create so much space in attack it's just brilliant to watch. At least one of them needs to play almost every week. They are both too good too be sat on the bench.

2512~~~
Should've got one at the end there, great play to set Falcao up.

2513~~~
I thought today was one of his best performances for us, he looked stronger and a bit quicker in general play and more definite in the final 3rd.

2514~~~
Good to hear that he's had a good game today. Will have to watch the game when I can

2515~~~
I wonder how much ground he covered. Seemed to run like crazy all game

2516~~~
He's a different class when we have possession. Once we start keeping possession this way throughout the season, he'll play even more.

2517~~~
Good game, although his final pass at times was a little overhit. Lovely cut back for Falcao at the end, shame Falcao couldn't finish it.

2518~~~
Very good. This was more of the Mata of Chelsea in getting the ball often and looking to dictate and create.

2519~~~
I think he performed very well and at times it looked like a midfield trio of sorts with Carrick just in front of the defense, Mata being the main passing outlet of the team occasionally driving forward and Herrera being the more adventurous one linking midfield and attack. Fellaini did a good job providing some bite in duels and held up the ball, retaining possesion extremely well.

Tbf Hull were woeful and didn't apply too much pressure and let us play our game. Anyway if LVG wants to move towards a possession based philosophy, there is none better than Mata in our team bar Herrera who can be sloppy with his passing at times.

Was it just me or did Mata look faster, more direct and less tentative on the ball? Something to build on for the next game and hopefully he isn't dropped.

2520~~~
Helps when our team has more than 70% possession in their half!

2521~~~
He's a big reason why we had that possession though.

2522~~~
The whole team did very well to keep possession so it's obvious players like Mata will benefit. Still, you have to do something with the ball with so many defenders and he did well

2523~~~
Thought he played really well. Best game of the season by a margin. Should definitely start v Stoke.

2524~~~
Agreed

I do want to see him in the side, even though his performances haven't reslly deserved it. But I would love to have a fully firing mata every week. What an assett

He was always looking to create today.

2525~~~
I was impressed. More creative than we've seen in other games. Linked well with Herrera. Unlucky with Falcao's chance.

2526~~~
If he were to be allowed to take free kicks for us his stats would be even better. He's a more productive taker than Wayne but they just don't look as spectacular.

2527~~~
I thought he was good, like most of the team. Definitely helped contribute to our possession dominance. He seemed to cover a lot of ground too, saw him popping up all over the place.

2528~~~
Actually I think I saw somewhere recently that Rooney has by far the highest scored:taken ratio in our team over the last few years, even though you'd think Mata would be the more consistent. I can't remember where that's from though so don't quote me on it.

But it's nice to have a left-footer and a right-footer who both excel from the same sort of short-to-middle distances. Keeps the keeper guessing and gives you a greater set of options from any one set piece.

2529~~~
Always get a bit nervous when he comes under pressure in possession deep in midfield, we've seen him give it away too many times to dangerous effect this season. Seemed much better today though, a combination of Hull's midfield not being particularly incisive and Mata laying it off to teammates sooner. I hope the latter is a sign of the 'philosophy' taking shape and our lads getting better at making themselves available for quicker passes.

2530~~~

2531~~~
He's got one of the best touches I've ever seen. Silva has too. 

The ball gets thumped at them from every angle and it's just killed under their feet every single time. 

Berba's was special in that he could pluck absolutely the most difficult ball out the air but Mata just kills everything.

2532~~~
At Old Trafford he should start more games than not. When United have some much of the ball like they did against Hull, then you need players who can use it, Mata is perfect for those games.

2533~~~
Yes you're probably right but I was thinking more about his free kick taking with Chelsea. Do we know how many free kicks Mata has taken for us?

2534~~~
It was nice of him to give the ball to Falcao to try and get him to score, but I think he should have been more selfish. He was coming inside nicely onto his left foot. Should have just lashed it. Looked an easy finish for him from there.

2535~~~
One of the best at killing the ball I've ever seen. No matter the angle or bounce his touch is immaculate.

2536~~~
Yeah I don't mind this idea either. His lack of mobility and athleticism hurts him when we don't have the ball as much so he can be an issue in away matches.

2537~~~
There was another time during the match yesterday when he just took a tricky ball down and put in a cross. He did really well to turn it into anything i thought.

2538~~~
I remember exactly the one, on the right wing coming from high in the air towards the corner flag. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2539~~~
When I saw him race to try and control that ball near the goal line I was saying to myself don't try and control that at pace but he still managed to take enough off the ball to be able to get his foot around it for quite a good cross.

2540~~~
Only just noticed the player performance bar. Have to say, it's brilliant. 
Although it makes Mata look kind of shit.

2541~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Nobody has an average rating higher than 7 so far this season! They're all shit <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2542~~~
IMO, that was his role, it helps us to have someone far up who can either slow or speed the game up.

2543~~~
Would it be unfair to say he's the kind of player that looks great when the whole team is playing well and clicking, but goes missing somewhat when things get difficult?

2544~~~
The numbers guy, simple as that.

2545~~~
Second half he's been our best player by some way for me.

2546~~~
He sure does produce a lot for a guy who has apparently been well off his best since arriving here. I wish all our signings did this....

2547~~~
Thought he was brilliant today. His best game this season for us.

2548~~~
Smart player, sometimes lacks pace and confidence but in particular moments he's the creative part of United.

2549~~~
Fantastic second half, he drove us on and was brilliant on the ball. Great free kick too

2550~~~
Very good at finding space in middle, knows when to pass as well, very good at keeping ball under pressure, plus his touch is brilliant

Also goal was his, if it touched rojo, it must have brushed of spikes on his head, it was all matas goal, rojo didn't change direction of ball

2551~~~
He was excellent in the second half when he moved a bit further up.

2552~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2553~~~
Thought he was good today. I would still prefer him further up the pitch though.

2554~~~
Was pleased with his performance.

2555~~~
Another very good game. Needs to play every time, the guy is class.

2556~~~
There goes the 'he's a second striker' theory. He's a baller, but he does lose the ball far too easily sometimes. Shame he's such a little (beautiful) man.

Some of his touches late on were just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2557~~~
Drifted in and out of the game but looked our most creative player in his best patches.

2558~~~
Thought he played well again. As a playmaker, though, his passing is just a wee bit off. He had a great chance to slide one through to RvP, under no pressure, but got the weight all wrong. Would have fancied Herrera to get it right in the same situation.

Still a great asset, though. Really safe in possession, works his bollox off and extremely productive. Well worth his place in the team.

2559~~~
Thought he played well. Was always available for the pass when the play was in transition. Final ball was a little off today but he tracked back every time and worked hard for the ball.

2560~~~
Good match from him, everything I want to say is above but I think he could do the Herrera role more, Herrera is giving those through balls, but I know Mata is also capable of doing that, hope that comes in time.

2561~~~
I'm a little surprised by how positive some of these posts are. I thought he was ok. Other than the goal he had a fairly unremarkable game though.

Lost the ball a number of times and misplaced a few passes. Perhaps I'm being overly critical and just expect too much from him. There was one pass where he could have played a through ball to RVP (I think) and completely under-hit it. Chelsea Mata would have played that every day of the week.

2562~~~
His ability to pop up with a goal/assist despite playing poorly is really quite incredible.

His lack of physically really does limit him though. Surely he could bulk up a bit? (to coin a famous cafe phrase)

2563~~~
But he was brilliant today? Well in that second half... best player on the pitch.

2564~~~
He's very good. And there's no knocking his numbers.

2565~~~
He was good but there were times where he looked off the pace during the game. Was he being played on the right side of the diamond with Herrera as the #10 for a while? Mata looked a lot better as the #10.

2566~~~
I thought his all round game was pretty average. Got bullied off the ball way too much.

2567~~~
I can't help but think his goals/assists stats skew the fact that he really hasn't been that good for us, though. Obviously they're extremely important but I'd take a Silva (who doesn't have nearly the goals/assists output Mata does) who can influence and boss the game for 90 minutes over a Mata, who seems to play poor for large portions and pop up with the goods every now and again.

2568~~~
To anyone that still criticises him, I actually don't know what you are expecting from him. Most games he is the product of something positive whether it be a goal or an assist. He also keeps the ball ticking nicely. I think he has been excellent the last few weeks. He is a different player to the likes of Silva, that has always been obvious though, has it?

2569~~~
Love him, doesn't get enough credit. He always contributes.

2570~~~
He just is twice the player when moved higher up the pitch. He seems uncomfortable deeper in midfield, usually choses the simple pass.

I still prefer Herrera at the tip of the diamond.

2571~~~
Can't remember him losing it that much in the second. Might just be my view from the stand (though people next to me seemed in agreement)... he was the main reason we started the second half well, and why it continued until injury time. There was no space in the middle in that first half, yet in the second, with him in there he used his intelligence to find space and would then drive us forward. He used the ball very smartly and his quality particularly showed in tight spaces.

2572~~~
We all want him to succeed and create chances for the team but I think that leads to games where people see what they want to see rather than whats happening. He was average yesterday for the most part. Slightly better in the 2nd half but nothing out of the ordinary. Still wouldn't be in my first choice XI when everyone's fit but as that never happens he's a great player to have in the squad.

2573~~~
Don't think he was as poor as many think. I thought he had a good game and again, a direct impact on us getting a result. Such a clever player.

2574~~~
Is doing well on the left side of the midfield, another decent outing. It's easy to see that he excels when the game opens up.

2575~~~
It's not a popular opinion but I feel the same, I'd personally replace him with a conductor like Pjanic/Gundogan or a blisteringly quick attacker like Reus if we can in the summer.

2576~~~
I thought he was the spark last night - he was very involved, rarely makes a bad pass and has been pretty creative in going forward. I think Mata is coming into form and he'll be a difference maker for us in the weeks to come.

2577~~~
Some of his touches were a class above anyone on the pitch.

2578~~~
That's the thing with Mata I guess. He can be invisible in first half, then improve his game in the second, and it seems to be enough to make him MotM. Well I don't get this, I thought there was quite a few players better than him overall. In first half Stoke was quite compact and all he did was play an easy pass back. In the second the game opened up a bit, and he loved it. He has fantastic ability to keep the ball in play, something we could use especially in the latter stages where we often lose shape and panic.

2579~~~
Don't think he deserved to be MOTM but actually really pleased he got it. Will hopefully be a big confidence boost for him, which he really needs. I think he's playing within himself a bit, not taking enough risks. Hopefully this will put a bit of swagger back into his game.

2580~~~
Apart for the goal he didn't contribute anything meaningful which pretty much summarises his career in a United shirt. Did all the basics well but you don't pay 37m for a player just to do the basics.

2581~~~
Too weak and too slow for my liking. He has impressive numbers, but I don't see him in our best XI right now if everyone is fit.

Of yesterday's midfield, I think he would be my choice to drop out when Angel returns.

2582~~~
Agree, would really like to see a Carrick, Fellaini, Di Maria and Herrera at the tip.

2583~~~
I can't believe some people aren't happy with him last night, I thought it was beautiful performance, his best one this year and one of our best midfield performances in general this season for me. 
I wasn't pleased with him so far this season, but thought he was excellent last night, was involved in pretty much everything, showed some nice flicks, and was very good defensively too. Last night's game showed that people were going over the top saying that there is big difference defensively wise in the team when he starts over Rooney - Stoke had one shot in about 85 minutes or so while he was on the pitch, and they hardly created anything through his side.

I hope he keeps the place in the team.

2584~~~
Hugs <a class="username" data-user="54956, @Amar__" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54956/">@Amar__</a>

2585~~~
Took pretty big part in the first goal, got the second goal, opened Wilson for his run when he fluffed it, generally been creating some chances for us despite not playing as the #10.

Really hard to understand what people expect from him, another player to get unwarranted criticism. Also finished the game with 63 passes with 94% accuracy.

2586~~~
I think people have some unfair/unrealistic expectations from Mata. On the one hand they want him to create and score a-plenty like he did for Chelsea, he did have 8 goals in 10 games at one point, but that wasn't enough. Then his defending is criticised (despite his size, speed and it not being natural to him) then when he does defend well, it goes unnoticed or is dismissed.

I think the price tag raises some expectations and some fans expect him to perform almost like Ronaldo or Messi on a weekly basis. He has been in and out of the side, hasn't really had a settled position (like many of our players this year) and is pretty much knocked whenever he plays. The fact is he is not playing for Chelsea, nor is he always in his favoured or best position, yet he still manages to score and set up goals and at the same time always has a smile on his face and something positive to say after games. He is not a complainer or trouble maker and he seems to be universally liked throughout the team.

Anyone else also notice that RvP seems to have his best games when Mata and Herrera are playing?

The lad is class both on and off the pitch and I think not only does he deserve his chance and his place in the team, he deserves a break from some of the more critical fans.

2587~~~
I get your point and I love Silva as a player but in our case given we have other players who can influence the game (Rooney and Di Maria mainly, Carrick from lower on the field), I think productivity shouldn't be taken for granted. His goals against Palace and Stoke have effectively won us 4 points just recently.

2588~~~
Nah, I think people just want to see him controlling the games more and providing creativity because we lack that aside from Di Maria. Mata doesn't offer that. Yes, he scores a lot of goals and can give an assist, but creativity? Since Moyes brought him, I seriously haven't seen more than 3 cutting passes from him.

2589~~~
I don’t think one game makes Mata good defensively. It’s just we have been much better in defense and with Fellaini our midfield is looking much stronger.  

It’s not criticism towards him- the thing is, we have other players who will do what he does, only better. Di Maria is better at left midfield than Mata. Herrera is, in my opinion, better at the tip of the diamond than Mata. So is Rooney.

On the other hand, Juan is by far the best pure number 10 in our team. The thing is, we don’t play that way.

I am still of the opinion he is much better player than what he is showing for us, the problem IMO is that he is being praised for what he can do instead for what he actually does. But fair play to him, he scores a lot.

2590~~~
I know, but like I said, I'm far more of an admirer of a #10 who can constantly influence games across the 90 minutes, someone like Silva or Iniesta, obviously they're extreme examples but even at the weekend I felt Herrera was far more influential overall as a #10 than Mata has ever been for us there. I do definitely think his stats are misguiding, you have to consider the amount of chances that would be created from the overall better level of play we'd have with someone of the Silva ilk in our team, too.

2591~~~
When did he ever control a game at Chelsea? That's not the type of player he is. We all know that, it's unrealistic to expect him to do that here. If giving assists isn't creativity then i don't know what is. Unless you would much rather see Di Maria whip 100 crosses into the box and only a handful of them reach a United player. Di Maria offers pace and the ability to go past his man with ease, Mata is more intelligent on the ball and doesn't give it away very often. Play them both together and we would have a deadly combination.

2592~~~
IF only he had just a little bit better acceleration it could make him so much better. He is just so slow at a stand still that he finds it hard to beat a marker when closed down. When moving though he can twist and turn well and use the ball to get out of situations. 

Don't think he was the MOM but he had a good/decent game.

2593~~~
Forget controlling the game like Silva then, he rarely does that "killer pass". Most of the times he simply plays it safe which is not what we want, do we? From a N10 player you expect creativity and the ability to split defences. Mata, unfortunately, hasn't offered any of that. Maybe it's just me though.

2594~~~
10 goals in 26 matches is very good..........but i still expect he plays better in most matches (like against Hull)

2595~~~
Numbers are what win games. I don't understand. It's like saying - I don't care if he scores goals, he should be  out of the team.. Well goals and assists win games. If he keeps providing them, why would you drop him?

2596~~~
The only midfielder we had yesterday who would drop deep to link up the play, especially in the second half. Some sublime balls to switch the play as well. Him and Herrera really do link up well.

2597~~~
Definitely his goal, no doubt about that. Rojo didn't even touch the ball.

2598~~~
Yeah thats great stats, like striker quality 1 in 2 almost. And thats pretty much 20 a season which would be a phenomenal return. But there is something he doesnt offer. He's a luxury player as he's not always in the game and at times isnt doing much. But stats and productivity wise maybe he should start. He also definitely suits LVG's tactic of possession and links well with his pal Herrera.

2599~~~
Not one usually for hypotheticals, but say Sevilla came in for him in January with a £25m bid, would you take the £10m loss and accept? I'm not so sure I would.

2600~~~
Of course not. Even if he's not automatic first choice he'll get more than enough games to keep him happy. And let's face it, half our players are injured at any given point in time, so he might as well be first choice.

2601~~~
Couldn't believe it when I saw him (Rojo) trying to claim it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2602~~~
Might have scraped his quiff <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> To be fair he probably has a nice goal bonus in his contract, so I am not surprised <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2603~~~
This place is insane.

6 months ago, Ashley Young was the scapegoat.

People want to sell Mata and buy the next flavour of the month who has never played in England.

Mata has done well, at least in comparison to other attacking players.

2604~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/03/23ADF98900000578-0-image-2_1417601348970.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/03/23ADF98900000578-0-image-2_1417601348970.jpg"/>

2605~~~
I think we'll always see Mata as a luxuary player.  Lets be honest he's only playing because of other injuries.  But really happy for him to be scoring and contributing.  There's nothing worse then seeing injuries to our starting XI but it makes it much sweeter seeing someone like Mata stepping up to fill in.

2606~~~
This is a good point in my opinion.

I personally want to see Mata start every week, I rate him extremely higher but I understand and accept the view that people rate other players higher or that the system is better without Mata, it's a never ending debate. However, if Mata wasn't a regular starter, if we want to be the best again, this is the type of quality that we need coming in when needed. The best teams in the world bring top quality off the bench, we need to be able to do the same, especially with (hopefully) Europe next season.

So I can't understand the people wanting Mata sold.

2607~~~
I like Mata - he's a really intelligent and likable character, but I just don't feel he'll ever fit. He's a very talented and technically gifted #10, who is more than capable of scoring goals and getting assists, but that's all. I feel he's too rigid tactically to be of major use for van Gaal going forward - especially with his competition. It's a shame, because on current form van Persie should be dropped and Mata should start behind Rooney, but I don't think it'll ever happen. Once everyone is fully fit and we have our full side he'll drop back down the pecking order. It's actually pretty similar to the scenario at Chelsea, whilst being their best player for a good few years, and still being one of the best at the club, he simply didn't fit what Mourinho seeked to implement. The same is happening here. We seem to be (whilst it doesn't seem so now) be moving toward a 4-3-3 as our actual, true formation, and Mata just wouldn't fit that.

2608~~~
He's just a complete passenger in games like these.

Offers nothing defensively, and gets bullied off the ball going forward. Herrera has shown more in 5 minutes, then Mata did in the previous 40.

2609~~~
How many forward passes has he given? He has become a ball retention player on the no 10 position, tactical mistake.

2610~~~
Improves the minute that Ander comes on the pitch. Before that was invisible.

2611~~~
Pathetic first half. Out of position or not, one thing I hate is hiding. Push on and man up second half, please.

2612~~~
Completely invisible which is a recurring theme in matches like tonight. He should be the player providing the others an option and bringing a bit of composure. Instead he avoids taking any responsibility and shifts the ball on as quickly as possible inevitably in the direction towards our goal.

2613~~~
His lack of athleticism is a huge problem in our team.

2614~~~
Passenger once again as he is in too many games, looks lost and his lack of pace and strength makes him useless on the counter.

2615~~~
He's shite in CM.

2616~~~
Awful. Every one of our midfielders was gash tonight. Worrying stuff.

2617~~~
Our worst performer tonight IMO. Some may say Fellaini through individual mistakes but at least he looked for the ball. Mata goes into hiding any time the team needs him.

A luxury player & nothing else.

2618~~~
Decent squad player, who can score a goal occasionally.

2619~~~
Anonymous tonight. We certainly don't play to his strengths.

2620~~~
Rooney's been just as bad as him, as have a lot of the rest of the team. No point singling him out.

2621~~~
Worrying thing is, it's unlikely that's going to change.

2622~~~
Aye, I see Mata moving on as opposed to it changing.

2623~~~
Yeah, he's an excellent player but I don't see LVG changing things up to accommodate him with the other stars we have in the side.

2624~~~
It's a shame that it'll probably come to him leaving. He's the kind of player that I looked at with envy when he was scoring and assisting likes there was no tomorrow, while at Chelsea.

2625~~~
Exactly. Imagine people saying 8 months ago back in April that they didn't expect him to last here. They'd have been laughed at.

2626~~~
He wasn't particularly sloppy but he just didn't do anything. If we're going to continue playing him so deep we should really look for alternatives.

2627~~~
Can argue we don't play to his strengths but he certainly needs to put in more of a shift for the team when their backs are against the wall. 

Now becoming clear why Mourinho didn't bat an eyelid in selling him to a rival 2 years back.

2628~~~
Needs to be played further forward. Wasted so deep.

2629~~~
Just not his position. Was anonymous today. Most of our players were terrible apart from RVP and De Gea.

2630~~~
When the things are going well he can be fantastic, but when it gets tougher he’s not only invisible, but also doing the simplest things only.  We can't afford to play him in games like that, he is a passenger. I hope he finds himself in the bench for the next few games.

He has been jogging for the 90 minutes. I don’t think I like him, word “soft” comes to my mind.

2631~~~
Mourinho feels Oscar suits his system better and you can't argue with that. You also can't argue with Mata's numbers while at Chelsea. He is playing in a system that doesn't accommodate him at all and thus looks like a luxury player.

2632~~~
Another ghost like performance. If your not on the ball and playing well he is a nothing player.

2633~~~
This in a nutshell.

2634~~~
A ball retention player who struggles to retain the ball under any sort of physical pressure.

He has the physical strength of a 10 year old boy.

2635~~~
Awful from start to finish, pointless playing him there especially alongside fellaini.

2636~~~
Would you play him over Herrera at the tip of the diamond though? It's clear he won't be playing in his favoured no10 position, because we always play 2 strikers up front.

2637~~~
Sell him, I've seen enough.

2638~~~
He was completely anonymous, a waste of a shirt. I think he only stayed on so long because we'd used 2 of our subs in the first half.

2639~~~
I thought he was one of our better players on the night tbh

2640~~~
I was thinking the same throughout the match, thought LVG could have switched him with Rooney but then we also needed pace.

2641~~~
He's a luxury this team can ill afford at the moment. He'll be good when we're dominating but when you need to dig in he's going to jog around like a lost puppy.

2642~~~
Why does he play so deep? He and Herrera should change positions. Not sure he'd be much better though

2643~~~
While others were all misplacing passes and getting caught on the ball, Mata kept it simple. And that was the problem. He wasn't offering himself for the pass often, he wasn't trying to create. In the first half when there was such a gaping gap with the 3-5-2 rather than as the playmaker try and get control of the game he scuttled on the periphery. I'm a big Mata fan but he's fair-weather. Like Mesut Ozil. Like Shinji Kagawa. These players aren't dynamic enough off the ball, or even in attack with the ball and disclipined, deep defences will nullify them. 

He's played his way out of the lineup for Sunday.

2644~~~
️Love mata, but am starting to fear for his future here. As others have posted he's a luxury player. He's no good when on the back foot and playing deep.

2645~~~
I sometimes forget he exists.

2646~~~
Strange from Mata, in that he didn't do too much wrong but he didn't do too much right either. Had some decent moments after Herrera came on when he had someone to play off of but he was pretty unambitious in his passing on the whole. I can't really criticise him for anything major, just I would like to see him show his class in matches like today's.

2647~~~
People's reactions in this thread are almost as knee jerk as the RvP ones. 

Mata is a superb footballer.

2648~~~
Captain invisible, great if your side is dominant in midfield and he's able to get on the ball often, waste of time if your midfield is up against it, you can see why Mourinho didn't like him.

2649~~~
A nothing performance. Almost completely invisible until he was subbed. Fannied around in the middle and didn't offer anything defensively or offensively. Just stood about and observed things.

2650~~~
With Rooney dropping deep all game, it was hard to see Mata doing much as a #10.  Did some decent work defending-but can't figure out how he can disappear in a game like this.

2651~~~
That's it really, he only shows up when the team is dominating play. Away from home he is one of our biggest problems.

2652~~~
Nothing performance has something to do with being played so deep. He is totally unsuited to that role, needs to be more offensive to affect the game. Still an absolutely fabulous footballer.

2653~~~
He was well and truly invisible tonight. In our original midfield setup of Carrick/Fellaini/Mata (and even after Herrera came on), he should have been the one showing for the ball and giving the other players an option. He didnt do this when he was playing as #10 and he didnt do it after dropping deeper. Really just added nothing to the team unfortunately.

2654~~~
Glad I'm not the only one? One of the only players who didn't make a mistake. He was quiet yes, but when the team struggles to hold the ball in possession, which is the last thing he needs, then he will look anonymous.

2655~~~
I hardly noticed him. no pace no power. great player but only good for teams who dont press.

2656~~~
Will end up on the bench because he is a luxury player and one we don't really need, I don't see how he fits in unless he plays as a number ten which isn't going to happen or when we are at home against weak sides. Not worth the money we paid and we would be better off replacing him with a different player.

2657~~~
Pass on what you were smoking mate, he did absolutely nothing.

2658~~~
Genuinely awful. I still rate him, but I'd like to see Herrera behind Rooney and RVP next week. Or, if Di Maria is back, Herrera next to Carrick and Fellaini, and Angel #10.

2659~~~
Another 3 tackles and 2 interceptions. Good work Juan, but remember that you're paid to be our creative player and you haven't been for a while now... So wake up

2660~~~
He was kind of shit but not Fellaini and Hererra shit. Our least wasteful player, by a margin and saw more of the ball than any other midfielder. Faint praise though. Did very little of note.

2661~~~
I feel he was a victim their tactics tonight. They were pressing us quite intensely when we had the ball and we were more or less struggling with possession as a result.

2662~~~
Herrera shit?

2663~~~
If you keep chucking in anonymous performances like that you'll eventually fall out of the first team or get sold. When everyone is fit he has the first one cracked. The latter is not far off at this rate. 

It'll be a shame if he goes and I certainly think he's been hard done by at times in that we don't play to his strengths at all but there you go. Life is tough and all that.

2664~~~
Most of the team was a victim of the tactics.

2665~~~
Definition of homer. Useless in big away games.

2666~~~
Complete and utter passenger in games like this. Doesn't do enough on the ball to make up for how frail and immobile he is.

2667~~~
The reactions on here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He grew into the game and relieved the pressure in that 2nd half. I watched him quite closely in the first half and he wasn't hiding from the ball, he actually got through a heap of work when we had the ball but when you have colour blind Fellaini on the ball, it's always hard to receive the ball.

Not saying he was great but the reactions in here are unbelievable.

Hugs.

2668~~~
He has very little influence in away games. We should just start him in home games.

2669~~~
That's how I saw it too. He has good technical ability so he doesn't make the obvious errors with poor passes like the other two but in reality he was probably just as poor as them because he was so invisible.

2670~~~
He's such a graceful and talented player on form. He failed to make any significant contribution today. Most of his passes were sideways or backwards. He never dealt with Southampton's pressing game.

2671~~~
Everyone seems to over react when it comes to Mata. No need to sell him- he is very good against teams we are expected to have the majority of the ball against. Games like tonight don't suit him. I'm sure when LVG has all the squad to choose from Mata will not play in tough away fixtures.

2672~~~
He is just too slow, too small and defensively not good enough to start away games. He is left chasing shadows when he is the slowest and weakest player on the pitch. We can start Mata at OT against teams such as Hull when we have a lot of the ball and need to unlock tight defences.

He is a very likable character but he has been a bit of a disappointment after signing for us, and it is easy to see why Mou couldn't resist the tempatation of getting 37m in return for Mata who is a bit of luxury player ill suited to the modern pacy game that football has become. I know that he was great while at Chelsea but he is better suited to Spanish football. Silva is such an imperior player to Mata. Silva can dominate games and create chances, Mata is a pale shadow of the player that he was while at Chelsea and not everything is down to the way we are set up and how we play.

2673~~~
The problem is, he never does.

2674~~~
He is a good player no doubt about it but you either play him in his correct position and get quick players around him or you sell him and bring in someone else. Since we signed him we have shoe horned him into the team and asked him to play roles which he just isn't equipped to do, he has a great left foot and his goals and assists often paper over very poor all round performances.

2675~~~
He was playing way too deep today, he offers very little around the centre circle. His strengths are in the final third, on the edge of the box creating spaces. He was virtually never there today but he'll do better in other games.

2676~~~
The removal van full of our money he'll take with him may be some consolation.

2677~~~
I'm starting to think that Mourinho may have just known what he was doing! I love Mata, but in games like tonight, he's a passenger. I just don't see how we can fit him and Rooney in the same side.

2678~~~
He's supposed to be the sort of player that alleviates the sort of pressure those tactics impose on us. Did not offer an outlet and was extremely uninvolved and absent for the most part. Sorry but he's nowhere near good enough. Kagawa wouldve been crucified for a performance like that.

2679~~~
That would work if our broader tactics were to mitigate their pressure with counters. Unfortunately we were too nervy in the first half for players like Mata to be effective with the system.

2680~~~
It's rare that you'll see Mata put in a shift against a top 6 teams as he simply isn't dynamic enough for the top teams but he still will pop up with a few lovely touches in a game like this but the game mostly passed him by

2681~~~
Yea fair enough mate. But we need someone in that positiom who doesn't go missing in high intensity games and who doesn't quail under pressing. You don't see Eriksen or Silva doing that. His lack of pace is painful too.

2682~~~
I agree. But it is strange, two/three seasons ago he was a real big game player for Chelsea. I guess his lack of confidence just dropped his level down a whole tier.

2683~~~
I really like Mata but his he was completely anonymous today.

2684~~~
I think some of the reactions to him and his future are slightly knee jerk but I do tend to agree in that he does appear invisible in some games, away games in particular for some reason. Also I just for the life of me cannot remember him being as slow on the ball for Chelsea as he is for us, granted he was never the quickest but cannot remember him being this slow. Going to be interesting to see how the next few months pan out for him that's for sure.

2685~~~
Can see him being sacrificed in the summer if i'm honest.

2686~~~
I reckon he would struggle to bench press a box of cornflakes.

2687~~~
In the first 30 minutes I didn't see him at all. He's a great guy and has some nice touches and he does bag his fair share of goals, but I'd love to get a player with real pace that can carry the ball in his role, Sanchez would have been perfect.

2688~~~
Mata was the main man at Chelsea a few seasons ago especially when Benitez came in and built the team around him. Mata is a fine player, but is a luxury at the moment as we don't have a strong enough midfield to let him do whatever he likes.

2689~~~
He's not anything close to the dangerous little menace we seen at Chelsea. It's very disappointing, as he was lethal.

2690~~~
I love the guy but he's absolutely useless in games like this. He makes a few nice touches and passes but his lack of pace and mobility is ridiculous. He's a good player to have when you've got most of the ball but a waste of time when your pegged back as much as we were.

2691~~~
Too slow IMO. We need pace upfront.

2692~~~
Have some cojones Juan please. The amount of back passes when a little turn or even sideways pass was better really infuriated me. He's way way too secure with his passing. To be honest, I just wonder if it's not a LVG's order to do so because it made no sense at times.

2693~~~
Mata is a good player, but has he turned up for us in a single big game?

2694~~~
Did you not watch him at Chelsea? Scored match winners vs us, Arsenal and Spurs that I recall. 

I just feel with that lineup he was always going to struggle. He needs Herrera and Di Maria next to him. And I don't think he's been effective for us in away games.

2695~~~
Love him but I think he'll be gone in the summer. He just doesn't fit any part of Van Gaal's formation.

2696~~~
Mata was completely invisible. Problem is we are making him run for the ball. It's always the same problem with the many of our players. We are making Mata work hard when he should be continuously be getting service from the defensive mids. I do not agree with him not helping out in winning the ball back. He does work hard and puts in a shift. But his quality is wasted. He's improved his defensive side since last year. He will only shine when we have majority of the possession. Once we start struggling in keeping the ball, mata's performances go down. This is the main problem whenever Fellaini starts.Put Daley Blind/Carrick along with Herrera and Mata will start playing better. Carrick was shunted to CB and our midfield quality reduced. To make matters worse, Young and Valencia just dont provide enough support from the flanks. He's a fecking great player and we need to put some better players alongside him. He will get into good positions when we have a fully fit starting XI (if that's ever possible)

2697~~~
Agree totally about Mata but a tad harsh on Fellaini. Our centre backs were shocking at playing out from the back last night. McNair and Evans looked a bag of nerves.

2698~~~
Should play as a number ten or not at all imo. Shouldn't be anywhere near a midfield three for us.

2699~~~
He's just so slow, how can a little feller like Mata look so cumbersome ? He's got little to no acceleration and turns like the titanic, when he's pressed he's just not got that little turn of pace to wriggle out of a situation, we're much better with Herrera at the point of the midfield. 
Sadly I also see him being sacrificed in the Summer, if we are to play the diamond we need everybody able to press, that's one of the reasons I think we see the 3-5-2 against teams with pacey wide players.

2700~~~
It's just a shame how we shit our pants against good pressing sides and in tight spaces. The 3 at the back system, the contagious nerviness of the defense spilling over to the entire team and our best passer, Carrick, playing in defense didn't help tbf.

Still we had more than enough players with good ball control and passing skills to do better at least on paper but we didn't in reality. This is an aspect which LVG really needs the team to improve and I'm sure he will make them better in this department in the future be it new personnel or developing the current players.

2701~~~
Mata has a place at United - his excellent goalscoring and assist rate since joining the club proves this. But he's physically limited, which means we have to help him and ourselves out by picking him in the right positions and for the right games.

He was pretty anonymous yesterday, but CM away to Southampton was never going to be his fixture. Bemused as to why Hererra didn't start.

2702~~~
I want to say that he is a player who would only excel only when the the team is playing well, but that is not true as he looked good for a very medicore Chelsea side. I don't think we are using him right. He needs to spend majority of his time in the final third to excel. Not strong enough in the central midfield areas that he has been asked to occupy. More so, against teams with stronger midfielders like Wanyama last night.

2703~~~
The more time passes, the more it seems like Jose knew exactly what he was doing in terms of selling Mata at the right time for the right price. I can see him going back to Spain next summer for about £20m

2704~~~
That was a normal Mata performance minus the customary goal. Not bad or awful by any means but completely invisible and safe.

 Not sure why people are surprised. He's our version of Mesut Ozil.

2705~~~
He needs to play higher up the pitch. The only way he can excel from a deeper position is in games when the opposition sits back and allows us to dominate the ball.

2706~~~
Can't wait for him to shut the mouths after a nicely slotted goal against the scousers.

2707~~~
We need a more dynamic technician in the side.

2708~~~
This is true, so disappointing as he was awesome for Chelsea.

2709~~~
I keep reading that Mata is too slow but he has never needed to be a fast player. Just a player with a more positive touch and courage to play adventurous football with his passing. Crazy thing is that he was that kinda player at Chelsea.

2710~~~
Went disappearing again yesterday

2711~~~
Did not even know he was playing until i checked the lineup 30 mins in.

2712~~~
It's funny when people say he went hiding or disappeared. If that was Carrick or Cleverley last season, instead of saying hiding or disappeared, they would be labelled as a coward.

2713~~~
The most disappointing thing about him for me is that he si always looking to keep it safe. When we bought him I thought he is teh guy who can unlock defenses with his passing, but so far this season it looks like he is just trying to keep it safe and not miss a pass.

We have players with fantastic movement up front, but they are useless if nobody from teh midfield has the balls to try anything else than simple passes.

2714~~~
I'd like to see him try some more expansive passing. There are rumours flying around about his future though so he probably doesn't have the confidence to try it in case it doesn't come off.

2715~~~
In Chelsea, he was often at his best as he spent quite a lot of his time in the final third, regardless of whether he was out wide or in the middle. In this sense, he's like an old-school #10. Whenever he drops deeper, he plays more safely and doesn't play like he normally would, which is good to see as playing adventurously in deeper areas can result in us being open on the counter.

What makes Mata look bad is that he drops deep too often. He needs to be more involved in the final third or be in more space in order to play more adventurously. We saw how well he did against Hull and Stoke; in both matches, he was more frequently involved in the final third/had more space to work in. Whenever he plays a deeper central midfield role, he struggles as he doesn't have the passing range and self-belief to pick out players from deeper areas.

I sometimes wonder that, if Mata was playing in Man. City in place of Silva or Nasri in the wide attacking midfield role, would he be better than he would here, where he plays this deeper, more reserved role for us in matches like these? He certainly revelled playing in the left central midfield role where he spent less time playing deeper in midfield and was more comfortable in the channels and closer to the final third.

2716~~~
He has those expansive passes in him as well. I remember him playing some very good diagonals to Young in his debut for us against Cardiff at Old Trafford last season. However, he did have quite a bit of space, and Young wasn't really closed down on the left wing in that match. Still, though, Mata can develop a good passing range, but I doubt he can do them like Modric can.

2717~~~
He just seems slow, seems to be playing too deep, as doesnt influence in the right areas because he starts the move little link up but then doesnt have the pace to then find himself on the end or then creating near the box. Just seems to play the simple pass, keep the ball ticking (Which is all good) but then not clinical at the end of the move as he's still 40 yrds from goal. 

I like him and still want him to be a success, but with dynamic players around him (Di Maria, Herrera, Rooney at times) He lacks this. Some would argue it gives us variation. He should suit LVG's style of possession football. But just not quite working still. Think he'll get more time, as he is productive it's just finding him in the right areas which is required.

2718~~~
Got him down to score today.

2719~~~
The thing with Mata is that he can be invisible most of the match but pops up with a goal or assist.

2720~~~
I honestly forgot he was playing until he scored. Not even joking

2721~~~
He's at his best when we are dominant and he is getting the ball in attacking areas. 
The way we set up, we arent playing to his strengths. 

incredibly productive though. Insanely so. If there is one player worth carrying, its him.

2722~~~
Yeah, even though he needs to contribute more overall, he's still getting a decent number of goals/assists. Rare to see him get a headed goal, too.

2723~~~
Exactly, but his style isn't beneficial for the team. He's always looking to move forward instead of drop back and link play, and you can see what kind of effect that has on the rest of the team. Very disappointing half, but he scored a crucial goal.

2724~~~
Bang on. For a creative player, he spends way too much time ahead of the ball.

2725~~~
Great movement and finishing from him for the goal, that's the thing with him, he'll get you an assist, he'll get you a goal.

2726~~~
Thank you Mr Linesman

2727~~~
He really really needs to start getting more involved.

2728~~~
He scored but honestly he's just an average player. No creativity, no risks taken with his passing. RVP made some good movements but not once did he try to pass it to him. It's just sideways passing with him.

2729~~~
Yeah and that's an issue with most our players. 1 quick sideway pass and they run towards goal.

2730~~~
He's far from an average player. As others have said, he needs to drop deeper and get more involved rather than rushing towards the goal every given chance.

2731~~~
He said before that he's trying to get in the box more, which as you said, isn't beneficial especially in this current formation. The ideal is a Silva type player.

2732~~~
I actually think he's been better today. Still not involved enough or taking enough risks with his passing but he has been a lot quicker moving the ball when he has got it and not been caught on the ball yet.

2733~~~
He is for me, the only thing he hasn't lost since arriving at Utd, it's this great knack for scoring goals and finding himself in the right spots. Other than that, he adds next to nothing to the team.

2734~~~
When we have the ball he plays higher up than Wilson. Don't get his position and what he should play hence he's been invisible except the goal

2735~~~
Ghosted in, in more ways than one. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2736~~~
It looks like he's been hiding from the ball almost. You could see Evans having a go at him at one point for not giving support.

2737~~~
He scores/assists pretty much every game he plays. That's great for an attacking player. The only criticism I have of him is his unwillingness to get deep and get more involved in the build up. But for an attacking player, you can't fault his numbers. An average player doesnt get those many goals/assists so regularly.

2738~~~
He's a second striker.

2739~~~
Why does he not try to create anything? Wouldn't mind if he gave the ball away trying to do something but he just does....nothing.

2740~~~
He's got an impressive goals record: 11 goals in his last 18 games. I just think that having him in the #10 role hinders our team, and he's playing it no differently to how Rooney played it last season. You leave a big gap between midfield and attack, and when you're playing a 3-5-2 you're more or less increasing pressure on the rest of your team.

I agree with you on the Silva comment. I even think that Herrera is a better fit for the role because he links play well, operates better in tight spaces, and tries to advance play.

2741~~~
I'm gonna stick up for him again

I love the way he never loses the ball and keeps it simple. It actually helps the whole side

But sometimes it would be nice if he took a risk or two and tried to split them open

2742~~~
I've been saying this for a while.

2743~~~
He's almost 100% end product <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2744~~~
Think Mata was arguably our best player in the second half of last season. He's far from an average player - he's a player that will guarantee you very good productivity. But the problem is, you need to build a system around him to get the best out of him, and we're not going to do that hence he's looked average.

2745~~~
He's average in relation to how good he can be from an individual POV obviously.

I kinda meant that.

2746~~~
Yep, that's the complain I have regarding him too. With his passing ability, should take more risks specially as he plays that further up where it isnt really a problem if we lose the ball.

2747~~~
He's not been hiding, he's been moving. He's always asking for the ball. The rest of the play is just so static and predictable. CB-CB-wing back-midfield again or up the flank or back. Repeat. Him and Rooney are our only hope of playing a decent football passing game within that system as it's being used.

2748~~~
You're probably right to be fair. Seen him repeatedly making an overlap run after laying it off to someone on the wing (on both side - further suggesting he's not hiding) but he's not getting the return ball. He thrives off that sort of stuff.

2749~~~
Agree on average. Utd got absolutely conned. 42m for this player is insane.

2750~~~
That's Ozil. Don't blame you for getting confused. Both masters of being invisible.

2751~~~
It was £37m.

2752~~~
I think Ozil is better. Ozil's a bottler but has good creativity. Mata's just a sideways passing 2nd striker.

2753~~~
Anyone who thinks he's an average footballer in general probably didn't see him a lot in his early Chelsea days. He's obviously got a lot of technical ability and is an excellent footballer. It's more that he's been playing average for us lately as opposed to not being a good footballer.

2754~~~
Great pass to Rooney first of all, before the nice slot through to RVP for the goal. Excellent.

2755~~~
I think he has had a very nice game today

2756~~~
Mata at his best for the third goal.
The type of goal/assist he constantly got at Chelsea. On the break with nobody to beat and space to play into.

.

2757~~~
Get in!!!!!!!!!!

2758~~~
Posters here are so fecking fickle. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2759~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2760~~~
Great composure. Very well played.

2761~~~
More of that please!

2762~~~
Bullshit.

2763~~~
I love him. He might be a bit of a "luxury" player at times.. but he is worth carrying. He is terrific.

2764~~~
I feel like he's been anonymous for large parts, but he's contributed when it matters. His weighted pass to Rooney and the assist to RVP is exactly what I expect him to be doing for us.

2765~~~
An absolutely fantastic footballer.

2766~~~
Fantastic composure and unselfishness, just as you expect from him.

2767~~~
Love him

2768~~~
He plays like a passenger, but his productivity is terms of his output makes him hard to drop. Hopefully, Van Gaal reward his noteworthy output by giving him consistent game time.

2769~~~
Invisible for almost the whole match, but his output is just phenomenal.

2770~~~
Typical Mata performance until his goal, then started getting space and hurting them on the half turn. That's what we expect from him every game.

2771~~~
Was fantastic in the second half.

2772~~~
Played well in the 2nd half although he had more space with us 2-0 up.

2773~~~
Now THAT is the Juan Mata I want to see. The weight of pass for the 3rd goal where he first played Rooney in was perfect, then the vision and execution of the pass to RVP was just brilliant.

Thats what he can do, and thats why its so frustrating when he plays the easy options 9/10.

2774~~~
He's great.

2775~~~
He has always been brilliant in and around the opposition penalty area.

My issue with Mata is that he just doesnt contribute enough elsewhere - he is very much like a trequartista who simply doesnt add anything defensively. That is fine, but when he is playing in midfield, or with Rooney as a midfielder, he needs to work a bit harder.

Personally, if we are starting Mata I would rather see him basically up front behind the main striker. It is hard to fit him and two strikers into a team without it being lacking defensively - although when RVP puts in the sort of shift he did today, it alleviates it substantially.

2776~~~
Incredibly cool head for the third, great header for the second, great match overall.

2777~~~
Hugs for Juan!! Fantastic, that second half performance was top class.

2778~~~
Much much better second half. That pass for Rooney for the third is the sort of pass he should attempt more.

2779~~~
Like Rooney, he can do little in the game then pop up and score/ assist. That is what we need in the team, because as we can see from Liverpool, these guys have that finishing ability.

2780~~~
He just clicks with Herrera and they elevate each other.

2781~~~
He needs a proper midfield behind him and he himself isn't a midfielder

2782~~~
Hugs xxx

2783~~~
That's the problem. We don't get into enough counter attacking positions like that. That's his bread and butter. Playing into space. 
It's 75% of the time, when we're camped in the other team's half and he needs to ride a challenge when he struggles.

2784~~~
You're right, just think that if he still doesn't attempt them enough even if it's not a counter attacking situation.

2785~~~
We need to start playing more with Herrera and Mata together. It's clear both of them have a very good understanding and read each other's game.

2786~~~
He was great, shame we probably won't see many games where both him and Herrera start.

2787~~~
MOTM today with De Gea for me. Excellent at keeping possession and in the final third.

2788~~~
Just play Mata, Herrera and Di Maria in the middle and we are good.

2789~~~
Almost like having Berba still. I really like mata but you do have to compensate for him

2790~~~
Excellent

2791~~~
Had it not been for De Gea he'd of been my MOTM, outstanding in the second half. I didn't think he played bad in the first half, he kept us ticking over after Liverpool stepped off.

2792~~~
This is where we will see him at his best when he plays with those two. Mata works best when he has good movement and quick passers around him, and Di Maria & Herrera are the two best that we have to work with him.

2793~~~
Rooney up front with RvP (going out wide to stretch the play). Possible?

2794~~~
Felt he was poor first half, but ended up with a goal. Much better second half, and that lookaway assist was lovely; Scholes like assist.

2795~~~
I liked his performance today.

2796~~~
Entirely possible. Di Maria and Herrera work hard defensively, and we have played our best games in a 4-4-2 diamond.

2797~~~
That midfield is way to "nice" they would be handing out greetings card during the Christmas period! For the Premiership you need some ugly players in the middle i'm afraid.

2798~~~
Nah, if you can get a collection of top quality players with great technique, it's much better to take them than dirty players. I'd only prefer an <i>ugly </i>player in there if they had the technical ability required as well. There's a reason Spanish sides have often run rings round English clubs.

2799~~~
I'd play Mata every Home game tbh, he is perfect for Old Trafford and helps gel the forward line together, even if he is not glaringly obvious while he is doing it.

Glad for all the scorers today. All three are players who play better when they are scoring.

2800~~~
If we get some pretty football going on, this wouldn't matter. And we can easily stick in Fellaini when we want some physicality in the team. Otherwise these players seem to be on the same wavelength wrt passing, making the runs, etc. and hence would complement each other.

2801~~~
Confuses me how Mata's average rating on here is 5.8 and Fellaini is 6.2. Mata contributes assists and goals consistently yet is held to some ridiculous standard, Felliani just has to not be shit and he gets praise.

2802~~~
I've been disappointed in him recently but I thought he played well today.

2803~~~
When we won the title in 06/07 what ugly players did we have? Giggs, Scholes, Carrick and Ronaldo played almost every game. Even in 07/08 the only ugly players we had (Fletcher) started in 1/3 of our games in midfield at most.

2804~~~
I still think the guy has become somewhat under appreciated since he joined us. It's a drum i've been banging on and off for a while, but remember how highly rated he was in 2011/12 and 2012/13?

I'm personally always pleased to see him in the XI, because he's like Rooney in that he'll get you loads of goals and assists, even if he's not playing to his full potential.

2805~~~
Also, he keeps possession in midfield unlike the likes of Fellaini, which is a huge plus. Passes the ball well even under pressure.

Still can't understand why Herrera doesn't start alongside him and Carrick as long as Di Maria's out.

2806~~~
Very good game from him today, he was offside obviously but he's great at ghosting in unnoticed in positions like that.

2807~~~
He played well today, and dovetailed nicely with Herrera when he came on (who should really be starting ahead of Fellaini if Van Gaal is serious about implementing a flowing, possession-based style).

2808~~~
That optajoe is really running out of words to put at the end of his tweets Isn't he

2809~~~
He looked a lot better when Herrera came on.

Love is obviously in the air lads.

2810~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2811~~~
Because Herrera moves and gives it quickly. Simples.

2812~~~
Did well today. For the most part I wasnt sure about how he was playing, I felt like he was trying to be a mini Xavi and just play high percentage passes to a teammate. But as the game went on he got forward for a goal (even though it was offside) which is what you want from your central midfielder on the day and he had the class to play RVP in for his goal when it counted. So those 2 contributions convinced me of his performance. Without them I'd have just said meh

2813~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2814~~~
The problem has been that he hasnt been getting the assists. And hasnt looked like making them. The goals continue to come and thats great, but ideally its strikers you want who are quiet and then pop up with a goal. Not your creative hub. He's supposed to be involved as much as possible

So it was good for Mata to show his class again today in the final third setting up his teammate. But we know he can do more than the 2 chances he created today

2815~~~
I feel like he's been a passenger in some games recently, and even in large portions of this game. However when you pop up and make the difference in the vital moments, then all else is forgiven. I'd just like to see him involved more and more of those magical moments he's capable of.

2816~~~
He's an enigma, for a creative fulcrum he's indivisible, but he got a goal and an assist.

2817~~~
Better from Mata today. Played higher up today, with Rooney and Felliani deeper, which give him a bit more freedom. Bagged a great goal and assist.

2818~~~
I think today showed he can perform in the big games when required.

2819~~~
You can say what you like about his performances but his stats for us are incredible 11 goals and 6 assists since joining and all in the league.

2820~~~
I thought he was good today.
Kept the ball well, dont recall him wasting it when others were quite often.
His pass to rooney that lead to the third goal was brilliant. 
He took up good positions and was pretty good at making himself available.
Nicked the ball off henderson a few times and helped keep him quiet.
Wasn't a masterful defensive display but it was decent which is a big improvement.

I think hes been showing signs of improving his all round game in recent weeks, often playing quite deep
and he looks like theres still room to grow for him.

2821~~~
His goal output is fantastic, but he needs more assists. 6 in nearly a year isn't all that impressive in all honesty. 

What he did today for the 3rd goal is the kind of stuff I was expecting on a weekly basis when we signed him. He's got the ability.

2822~~~
I thought it was a good all round performance from Mata (I see he was getting a bit of criticism in here before the assist). I might need to watch the game back but at th time I definitely felt he generally played well.

2823~~~
He definitely wasn’t good in the first half, but he was more than good in the second. I still think he shouldn’t be starting games, because when the game is tight we could use Herrera a bit more (just tell him to keep it simple like Mata does in midfield if he’s being too adventurous). Juan looks much much better when the game becomes more loose.

His positioning in the final third is exceptional.

2824~~~
Lampard Mk. II, for me.

EDIT: Although not as good, but still great.

2825~~~
That is not a bad thing, though he won't take penalties for us.

That is assuming we get any of course.

2826~~~
For a little guy he knows exactly where to be for a goal.

2827~~~
I thought he played well today and has done for the most part in recent weeks.

His goal record has been decent since joining but the ones in recent weeks have been vital. Winner against Palace, winner against Stoke, crucial second goal today.

Good stuff.

2828~~~
Exactly what you want in a sexual partner tbh

2829~~~
I don't get the hate Mata gets sometimes on here. He's doing what he used to do at Chelsea and he was regarded as a top class player there, one of the best in the league. He's doing the same stuff for us, what changed? Why was it spectacular for Chelsea but now that he's doing the same for us, suddenly it's average?

He's always been a final ball or final finish type of player, not the type of player to control the game or contribute much when he doesn't have the ball. He never possessed any exceptional physical characteristic. He's a very intelligent, technical player and being the only attributes he has, uses them to the maximum of his ability.

I really don't know what people expected when we signed Mata.  For me, he's playing the same way he used to play for Chelsea.

2830~~~
Did good today, I'm very happy for him!

2831~~~
Great awareness for RvP's goal. Was screaming at the tv to hit it first time.

2832~~~
Brilliant posts to read after the game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2833~~~
------------Rooney------
--DiMaria--Mata-----WF
-------------Herrera--------
-------Blind/Carrick--------
Shaw----------------Rafael
-------Rojo-----Smalling-----
------------De Gea------------

You could see on the RVP goal (and from years at Chelsea) that this would suit him best. If we sign Robben, Reus or another pacey and dangerous WF who can get in behind, I see this as our main lineup next year. Di Maria can switch sides, too.

2834~~~
He was very good today I thought, hopefully he will keep it up. Excellent assist as well.

2835~~~
I don't think he's quite at the same level he was at Chelsea where he was, for a time, the best player in the league IMO.

I love having him here but I reckon he can be even better. He has the talent to totally run a game from midfield. Still yet to see that consistently.

Can't fault his numbers though.

2836~~~
He's getting better as is the team and I hope with the right set up and position we can finally get the best out of him again

2837~~~
RVP is a way better striker than Rooney (Rooney is brilliant btw), have no idea why you've left him out. Also no way is Rojo in that lineup next season, we will get a better centre back in for sure, Also expect Strootman to be signed up soon as well.

2838~~~
He was invisable up until his goal which seems to a trend of him starting matches very poorly.As others have siad though, he grabs loads of goals and assists and grew in to the game.

I do feel we need to get him more involved in our play.Balls that should have been going to Mata kept being played to Fellaini in the firsr half whicg caused a lotbof our problems.

I think having the likes of Herrera and Di Maria back in team will help to up his influence.

2839~~~
Made a point of watching Mata today and his work off the ball at times was superb. He was constantly pointing for players to move into channels and was doing the same himself. Played a big part in today's win and worth his place.

2840~~~
The reason is he is not performing corners.

And his free kicks are a bit meh this season.

2841~~~
Hull?

I think the problem has been his form - he's racked up some good goal stats but generally his form hasnt been great - I actually can't think of any game where he has really dominated

played well today though he lacks the workrate and physicality of Rooney - I think the 3-5-2 suits him as it does off that extra protection

some lovely pace to his passes today and found space well but I'd like to see more from him - still hasn't shown his Chelsea form but he is improving

2842~~~
Those two passes in the lead up to our third were what's been missing from his game for a while now, despite being generally neat and tidy (and surprisingly productive). Perfectly weighted, really hurtful passed. More of the same please. The type of footballer I really enjoy watching. Be such a shame if he doesn't kick on from here.  Been playing within himself a bit, so we might see a bit more swagger in the coming weeks. Lovely.

2843~~~

Mata to RVP to finish off Liverpool. Still don't quite believe it. 

From London with love

2845~~~
I remember though, Mata, herrera, and di maria when they played I think it was one match together when they were all fit, the passing between the 3 was a joy to behold

I`d love when they`re all fit, to see them play again, there all on same wavelength and know how to play football the "proper" way

2846~~~
Thats honestly better then sex <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2847~~~
Only criticism I have of him is not kissing the camera when he ran towards it in his goal celebration earlier. Giggsy must have left that out of the presentation he gave last week.

2848~~~
It was a great little pass to RVP, he sold three defenders and the keeper the wrong direction.

2849~~~
Another very good game by Mata. The debate will continue on his actual overall game but at the end of the day, he is having direct impacts on games and that is more important in my opinion.

Great to see him score even better that he was offside. That pass also to RVP, to throw the keeper with a pass is absolutely amazing.

2850~~~
Beautiful disguise on that pass.

2851~~~
That surely can't be all we expect of him in the red shirt.

2852~~~
I think you might be doing it wrong.

2853~~~
His passing was better. He really is a final third/centre forward player, but he also showed some of the killer passing we expect of him. I think he's fine playing in home games, but away we need more from him.

2854~~~
Thats what they all say <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2855~~~
He gets goals and assists, doesn't do a lot else, and is not a good midfielder.

2856~~~
Actually I think that might work for some must win games against very tough opposition - Chelsea, City, etc. when on one hand we must go for the win, but on the other we should be careful not to get punished by them. Play 4-2-3-1 - something like this:

-------Rooney/RVP/Falcao------
Di Maria--------Mata--------Herrera
-----Fellaini/Blind-----Carrick------
Shaw----Rojo-----Smalling---Rafael
---------------DDG---------------

The two DMs in front of the back 4 would make us very solid and also help keep possession, while Mata, Herrera and Di Maria would create a ton of chances for our striker, plus they are quire able to score too. Probably Falcao with his movement and physicality would work best for this formation.

2857~~~
have to agree that Mata isn't doing enough in his all around play for me.  Yes, he has some sublime moments, but for large spells of most matches he is in you can forget he is playing.

2858~~~
I like the way he plays in this system, but I'd like to see him popping the ball off more often.

MOTD showed that we attacked 51% of the time down the right today, and I think it was 26% down the left. I don't think those kind of stats are exclusive to today's game either because it's not like Moreno and Lovren were an easier target than Henderson and Johnson/Kolo. Don't think that helps Mata's involvement...and he's never going to do a Di Maria and run through teams when he does get his opportunities.

2859~~~
Mata's passing accuracy this season is 92.2% which is second only to Flamini in the entire league (the latter of whom obviously plays it much simpler).

Having an incredibly reliable passer is vital to LvG's passing philsophy, especially when at least one of our other midfielders every game is going to be Herrera, Fellaini or Di Maria.

You could argue that Mata's form has been a little off but I, for one, breathe a sigh of relief whenever I see him on the ball as opposed to some of our more wasteful passers. The rest of the squad is still Fergie's in a lot of ways, so it's been built for directness rather than ball retention. Given the current state of the defence, it needs someone it can pass out to without fearing that the ball is gonna come straight back.

2860~~~
I thought he was good. First half he was anonymous until the goal but in the 2nd I thought he got involved and did very well.

2861~~~
Doesn't have the pace to break like Di Maria can during transition but I thought he was very good in transition, was more direct and clear in what he wanted to do. There were many times, we were able to pass through their midfield to Mata and he was able to continue to forward movement and got us on the front foot.

2862~~~
That assist was class. Destroyed the Liverpool defense with a look of his eyes.

2863~~~
He hoodwinked their entire defense, keeper included <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

IMO he's been very good this season. Hope he keeps racking up the goals and assists. Can't ask for more

2864~~~
Take a bow son. Superb yesterday against LFC. At his creative best and nicked in for a goal too. Excellent

2865~~~
Just seen the average positions on the BBC and his average position is ahead of Wilson and level with RVP. Thhat's a bit too advanced for my liking especially when the two other options in midfield were Fellaini and Rooney.

2866~~~
Not surprising. He's essentially a tidy second striker with added ball-retention.
Quite concerning though. It wont always pay off like it did today.

It's just part of his game, and I can't see that being taken away. In fact, if it was taken away, he'd be half the player. And it's why I still don't see him having a long-term future here as a starter.

2867~~~
Sums it up. The average position map (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30472067" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30472067</a> about halfway down) shows Mata to be alongside RVP as our most advanced player. Whilst yesterday he did obviously end up scoring and assisting one, his overall game still concerns me. We all know that Mata is excellent in and around the opponent penalty area, but he goes invisible for the rest of the game. This is OK for a striker, but less so for a midfielder/#10 who really needs to be contributing more in an all-round sense.

Mata is a player who will undoubtedly produce decent numbers for goals/assists over the course of a season, but every time he starts for us we seem to get overrun in midfield and I dont think this is a coincidence.

<a class="username" data-user="77194, @Borys" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77194/">@Borys</a>

2868~~~
It's a bit of a conundrum. Like you say, he's just not guaranteed to get involved from game to game. 
Even if we were to go 4-3-3/4-2-3-1, not sign Falcao and use that money on a different player:

While you could argue it would suit Mata to play in that advanced midfield role behind one striker, that would mean Di Maria wide.
You have to wonder whether that's better than us buying someone like Depay and playing Di Maria in that advanced midfield role instead.

Mata would make a cracking squad/impact option though. Essentially doing what Lampard is doing for City, and if Depay or Di Maria are out, he's a great replacement. But I'm struggling to see a system that fits him in and still gets the best out of everybody else.

2869~~~
Could you post a photo? I thought in 3-5-2 both Rooney and RvP stay wide (yesterday Wilson and RvP) and he plays as a striker, very high starting position. Don't think that suits us as I would rather Roo/Di Maria to occupy that position.

The two DMs will be asked to do a lot of running with those three ahead of them. Carrick is definitely not suited to midfield two. Herrera is no right winger, and we need Rooney to drop deeper.

That might be the best setup to get the most out of Mata, but IMO it's far from our best team.

2870~~~
I'm not sure about the last point. If he played a tad deeper it shouldn't make much of a difference to his overall game. Having 3 players that advanced and basically playing as strikers while another striker/#10 plays as a CM is not the best of ideas. Ideally, he and Rooney should be level with each other and taking turns to go forward.

2871~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> 

Yeah it is a difficult one. I like everyone else love seeing Mata play when he is on song, but it is basically like playing another striker. Heck, I think RVP probably made far more defensive contributions yesterday than Mata did.
He is very, very much a luxury player and someone who we have to carry, with the hope that he will - like yesterday - pop up at some point and provide the goods.

For me, I would be playing Mata against the lesser teams as a #10 behind two strikers, but against the big teams I just think we sacrifice too much defensively to do that.

2872~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30472067" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30472067</a>

2873~~~
But why wouldn't that role suit Di Maria more?

2874~~~
He was really good yesterday. Kept finding that space behind Liverpool's midfield allowing us to push right up. Whether he'll continue to do that against midfields that offer some protection is another thing.

2875~~~
I forgot Di Maria existed for a minute<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think it would suit both Herrera and Di Maria better I seem to be in the minority.

IMO, only two of Rooney, RVP and Mata should ever start.

2876~~~
I agree with that tbh

2877~~~
I actually don't think it's the worst idea to try Mata up top with Rooney or van Persie as a striker.
With Di Maria in behind.

I'd love to see Mata actually played as a striker a couple of times. Especially at Old Trafford.

2878~~~
I didnt say that it wouldnt <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Agreed. He practically plays that role anyway. Only thing would be whether we can still carry enough offensive threat - Mata is at his best when he has options available around him, thus he works very well with two strikers up there. Having only one other striker means one less option for him to pass to.

2879~~~
Agreed with everything quoted. Thanks for the pic <a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a>

2880~~~
I actually think his finishing is a stronger attribute for him than his passing. I don't think he's much (if at all) off our natural strikers in terms of his finishing. While he's an accurate passer, I don't actually think he's amazing at cutting through teams at will.
I think his best passes come when he's high up the field. Putting in the final touches to moves with accuracy and perfect weight.
He's capable of through balls from deep, but his assists come more often from little lay-offs and cut backs.

I think it could work if Di Maria played as an advanced midfielder, and was given freedom to roam a bit. Mata wouldn't have to stay up top as a number 9 type striker. He'd have licence to drop deeper, but he wouldn't be required to dictate or defend quite as much. Basically playing as a sort of striker-number 10 hybrid, and getting the best out of his skills.

Could see him possibly getting lost a bit in some away games. But even then, I think he'd look better up top than he often has in midfield.

2881~~~
Fair play to him, yesterday's game didn't suit him at all yet he managed to score a goal and provide an assist. We didn't enjoy any quality possession in the final third and when that happens he usually is anonymous. Mata flourishes when he gets time on the ball up front with his teammates providing the right off the ball movement. LvG has made us considerably better on the ball but the whole team's off the ball movement, both offensively and defensively, still remains an issue. And as long as this happens Mata will be struggling on the pitch, as did Kagawa last season.

He is not playing as a second striker right now and i wouldn't want him to play there because Rooney is doing a fine job in that role and there is no need to change that. We have problems to solve as a team and there is simply no need to start experimenting on things that are working well for us. Mata is attempting a run towards the far post, whenever Rooney, as a second striker, drifts on the edge of the box in order to stir the defense and create pockets of space. Most of the time Mata's job is to ensure quantity and quality of possession in the opponents half. 

He is also not physical enough to track back and close down opponents. Plus he is quite uncomfortable when he has to drop deeper, in our own half, and play a part in the midfield battle. That's why Wilson did this job for him yesterday. It's also the reason why Mourinho couldn't find a place for him at Chelsea. There are two ways for Mata to prove useful, either by having lots of possession in the opponents half and many players going forward or by trying to regain possession in advanced positions with him being ready to get on the ball and pick the right pass like City do with Silva.

We don't have the players to do the latter, it's not what van Gaal wants to achieve here anyway. We have had good possession against lesser opponents at OT but if we don't start doing the same against better opposition and away from home i don't see him having a future here either.

2882~~~
I dont doubt his finishing. My point was more that Mata thrives when he is in an attacking position with other players around him, as evidenced by the third goal yesterday. His decision making in the final third is generally spot on. If you play Mata as a striker it means one less person in attack with him, most likely, and therefore less options for him.

I wouldnt be averse to trying him up top though, but I do think that playing Mata plus two strikers leaves us unbalanced and overrun in midfield.

2883~~~
Become a right little tap in master hasn't he

2884~~~
More productive than RedCafe's best player in the world ever...
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B49Tv8MIgAAbpVR.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B49Tv8MIgAAbpVR.jpg:large"/>

2885~~~
Those stats don't really mean anything, especially when most people will agree that Hazard's end product needs to improve hugely.

2886~~~
Errm, excuse me, where is the stat for 'making proper runs and doing take-on's to give everyone else the space'?

2887~~~
Those stats mean Mata has been more productive that Hazard since joining us, so yeah.

2888~~~
That doesn't tell anywhere near the whole story though.

2889~~~
What's the whole story then? That Hazard gets completely overrated?

2890~~~
Essentially the reason why you can't trust JUST stats.

2891~~~
Why not? All these particular stats prove is that Mata has assisted more goals and scored just as many as someone praised as the best player in the league. 

I shouldn't be surprised that RedCafe discredits anything belittling Hazard though.

2892~~~
Why would redcafe be more biased towards Hazard than United's own? Or maybe it's as simple as the fact that Hazard is the better player.

2893~~~
Hazard gets ridiculously overrated on RedCafe. Right now, he's not among the top players in the league, yet some would argue he is the best. He's a fantastic talent, don't get me wrong, but he hasn't done anything to be labeled as he is sometimes. Just a pet peeve of mine.

2894~~~
I'd say Fabregas is outshining Hazard at Chelsea this season.

2895~~~
He is.

2896~~~
Not sure why you would generalize the whole forum to suit your needs. Or maybe you are right, I usually avoid when the hazard love flows.

2897~~~
Cow in a field and all that.

Must say i was surprised when i read them.

2898~~~
I don't know about others but I rate him as a great talent and a very good player already but someone who still has parts of his game that can be really improved on. He's not the best player in the league but I'd have him in the top five.

2899~~~
Fair enough.

Bias aside, do you think Mata is better than Hazard?

2900~~~
I would agree with this. If he stopped fannying around a bit he could easily become the best player in the league. As it is, he's a still a complete menace to any defense.

2901~~~
How can anyone not want Mata in the team if he keeps scoring and assisting?  We need strength in depth and we're lucky to have him.  Granted he isn't gurenteed a starting role when everyone is fit but during the course of a season where we have injuries and suspensions it's a blessing to have him.

2902~~~
Do I think Mata is better than Hazard? No. But I don't think either are all that important to their teams, great players but we'd both survive without them.

2903~~~
I suspect Chelsea fans will disagree with that. Hazard is far more important for Chelsea than Mata is for us.

<a class="username" data-user="83245, @TheShedEnd" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83245/">@TheShedEnd</a>

2904~~~
I'd disagree with that too. Fabregas and Costa have been more impressive than him for Chelsea this season but Hazard is still a huge part of the reason they're doing so well. Put in Schurrle or Salah instead of him for the full season and I don't think they'd be top of the table.

2905~~~
Well Salah is shite, so there'd obviously be a difference. The same way if we replaced Mata with Anderson. If Schurrle played? Yeah, they'd still be top.

2906~~~
Whilst he hasn't been their best player, that is a statement too far. He has 6 goals and 3 assists this season in the EPL.
Infact they may not have beaten Hull at the weekend without his performance.

2907~~~
Hazard creates a lot of space when attacking for his team to move into, I'm fairly sure he's involved in  a lot more goals too apart from his own and assists.

2908~~~
Impressive productivity from our wee man.

2909~~~
I like Mata very much but those statistics highlight just why we should all be cautious when dissecting them. Just watch the game, the difference in play style and overall contribution is abundantly clear.

2910~~~
Does Hazard take set-pieces? If we took away Mata's set-piece goals and assists, it would put a big dent in his stats.

Mind you, we'd also have to delete Hazard's penalties...

2911~~~
I think we'll see him play in his best position when we line up with Carrick and Blind in the middle. Its obvious he's spent the majority of his United career to date playing a little bit too deep. It'll also take the pressure off him in terms of backtracking and work rate.

2912~~~
Also haven't seen this in a while <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/4fPqJpY.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/4fPqJpY.gif"/>

2913~~~
To be fair, a penalty is pretty much a guaranteed goal whereas free kicks most definitely aren't. We shouldn't take Mata's ability for granted in these situations.

2914~~~
Outrageous!

2915~~~
I'd forgotten that was Mata and he plays for us now.

2916~~~
Play style doesn't win you games. Goals do. He scores and supplies them. I don't understand what some posters want?

2917~~~
Hazard contributes more in other areas of the pitch. He presses more, he creates more space and his movement is a nightmare for defenders to deal with. Mata is a brilliant player but he doesn't pose that kind of aggressive threat to opposition defenders. 

I like Mata a lot, as I've said. I also think if you were to play him at #10 with Rooney ahead of him we would see some excellent results. But the crux of my original point is that numbers don't tell the full story. While Mata may be more productive I think Hazard makes for a better football team.

2918~~~
This

2919~~~
Mata reminds me of Rooney from the last 2 years or so. Rarely does anything spectacular and can be in and out of games, but somehow keeps making that key pass or being in the right place to score. 

I must admit I didn't realize he had such an eye for goal, he really is a second striker in that sense. Whether we really need a player like that though rather than a creative type is debatable, but so far you cannot deny his goals/assists have been quite impressive since he joined us. 

If only his pace was a little bit better it could really take him to the next level, but you can't have it all I suppose.

2920~~~
Absolute bullshit, Hazard would have triple those stats if he wanted to. Quadruple even.

2921~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Very few (if any) on here have stated Hazard is the best in the league.

2922~~~
Only TheShedEnd did and he's a moron who was subsequently banned.

2923~~~
I think there are too many class players in this league to define the best of them all, over the course of a season there will be a few players who could claim that title based on current form.

However, I think Hazard is clearly up there among some others including Di Maria, Agüero, Rooney, Silva, Sanchez, Costa and maybe Mata too.

I don't think he's that overrated by anyone on here, he's brilliant, especially for his 23 years of age and we missed a great deal back then.

2924~~~
Now <i>that</i> is really fecking impressive. Thanks for posting it.

I love Mata, he's great. I loved seeing him, RvP and Wayne celebrating together after RvP's goal on Sunday.

2925~~~
Hazard is definitely a level below Aguero, Di Maria, and Silva. You could argue the others (bar maybe Mata) are better too.

2926~~~
I think in his first season for Chelsea and partly in his second too he was even two levels below them, but now I'm just totally impressed most times I see him. Definitely up there for me.

I'm really unsure about Mata, probably because we haven't been playing consistent football in his time here and he wasn't consistently used in the same position.

2927~~~
Silva, Aguero, Di Maria, Sanchez, Hazard. That would be my current top five. Rooney and Fabregas just miss out.

2928~~~
Whut? Fabregas has been better than Hazard this season.

I swear Hazard gets overrated on here too much because he looks so good on the pitch. He's definitely potentially as good as these players (only 23, after all), but certainly isn't yet.

2929~~~
I only have Hazard ahead of Fabregas because Fabregas is easier to mark out of games than Hazard is. A few teams have put a player on Fabregas in games and he's been invisible while Hazard nearly always manages to do something in games even when man marked.

2930~~~
His stats say otherwise.

2931~~~
True but the stats don't really tell the whole story. Although I definitely agree that his end product needs to be improved.

2932~~~
I'd say stats don't tell the story for a player like Silva (for me, the best natural #10 in the game), who runs the game when he's on the pitch. Hazard though is far more direct and as such you'd expect more end product from him, but it's definitely not good enough yet. Still, he's only 23, it will improve.

Anyway, off topic.

2933~~~
I thought he was absolutely awful in the first half today.

2934~~~
Like a kid against men. Bullied.

2935~~~
Wasn't awful. Just invisible...as always. Hope he pops with the goal like he always does though.

2936~~~
#passitbackwards #playitsafe

2937~~~
His usual disappearing act away from home. Its becoming a habit now.

2938~~~
Needs to grow a pair and try some trough balls for a change. I'm very disappointed to see him choose the easy pass over and over again, especially when we have strikers with great movement playing.

2939~~~
Another anonymous Mata performance. He does very little apart from pop up with a goal every second game.

2940~~~
Worst half in a United shirt. Not only anonymous, he threw the ball away numerous times.

2941~~~
I think he was. Terrible decision making, giving the ball away repeatedly etc. Had a simple enough pass to put rvp through at one point, managed to hit defender 3 yards away After scuffing the pass

2942~~~
Through balls to what?

2943~~~
We seem to never try and give him the ball in tight spaces. He is capable of doing damage in between the lines but our midfielders and defenders are too afraid to pass it into him.

Leads to more zombie passing and a lack of penetration.

2944~~~
Well Rooney's played a couple of balls over the top to Robin. Some have reached, some have not, but sometimes it'd be nice to see Mat try more adventurous passes.

2945~~~
Our worst player today.

2946~~~
Could do with the fact that he never fecking shows for it. Also has never ever done well playmaking in tight spaces. Sorry but he's not the player we need.

2947~~~
Why did Ashley Cole not look for him when he was free. instead of putting those stupid crosses...

2948~~~
How did he survive the 90 mins? Di Maria should have come on for him

2949~~~
Hardly through balls when they are away from the goal. He also passed the ball when a striker made a run and wasn't marked. You can't pull it out of thin air. Defense has to screw up in order to pull off a through ball.

2950~~~
Has become a nothing player. No tap in to mask his non-presence.

2951~~~
When we do he tends to lose it.

2952~~~
Too many games where he is just meh. Sell him he doesn't suit us.

2953~~~
Pointless. Why the feck is he so afraid of playing a through ball?

2954~~~
He's not affecting games enough full stop, it's been an entire year and when the game is he tough he is nowhere to be seen. I would see him moved on and replaced with someone of similar 'stature' but probably better effect. So many talented 10s out there that we could bring in

2955~~~
You obviously don't know the balls over the top i'm talking about. The one when Van Persie had a volley, and there was another occasion. Nevertheless, it's very rare Mata will try and play a ball over the top.

2956~~~
Mata described in a few words. Cannot keep the ball under pressure and cannot play dangerous passes.

2957~~~
He's been playing like this all season but didn't manage to mask it with a goal/assists today. Too lightweight and offered absolutely nothing, RVP should of stayed on not this guy.

2958~~~
As I said in the post match thread, he was a passenger and not for the first time. The difference being that in recent games he's contributed a vital goal or assist and been a passenger for the rest of the game. When he doesn't pop up with one of those vital contributions, then you barely notice he was on the pitch.

2959~~~
I was surprised when RVP got subbed for Di Maria. Seemed a no brainer to take Mata off and push Rooney into the no. 10 role, since Rooney had actually done something and Mata was useless.

2960~~~
I was surprised van Persie came off instead of Mata tbh

2961~~~
This is the most annoying thing about him recently considering it's pretty pointless him playing at all if he isn't playing through balls, he seems to be contributing feck all otherwise.

2962~~~
Goal and assist stats are looking good for him since joining, but I had so much more hope of him here. He's been a bad signing I must admit despite being a huge fan of him.

2963~~~
Think he just gets lost a bit when he's playing alongside the rest of the attacking talent. He needs the game to go through him like how it was at Chelsea. And that isn't ever going to happen here.

2964~~~
Another poor away performance. Almost invisible today.

2965~~~
Just does not seem to fit into our team. No matter how hard we try to accommodate him.

I honestly don't remember him being so slow and easy to dispossess on the turn when he was at chelski.

2966~~~
Pretty hard to find him from Rome.

2967~~~
He does nothing. Nothing at all.

2968~~~
I obviously don't know? Of course I know. That ball to RvP was a very low percentage ball. Good pass but very doubtful it was going to amount to anything. Through balls via air are easier to execute but harder to put away. Mata plays more with the back to the goal than Rooney because in this formation he's supposed to move across the midfield, not control play. One of many reasons it's such a poor tactic for United.

2969~~~
He never does anything.

2970~~~
...

2971~~~
Where is his through balls? Falcao was making runs, so was RvP, but he never even tried to send them a pass. He's been a big disappointment. All he does it passes sideways most games. His stats are good, but looking at him with your own eyes he could do far more.

2972~~~
I'm really surprised by this too. Have absolutely no confidence when the ball is played to him and he's turning trying to get away from his marker. The way Sanchez won the ball off him towards the end happens far too often.

2973~~~
Unlucky not to get on the pitch today.

2974~~~
RVP had a shot on goal, so it did amount to something. Rooney also made a great reverse pass to RVP in the second half that forced a great save from Guzan. I just don't see Mata doing that. 

You can make up all the excuses you want, but the fact is, although neat and tidy with the ball, Mata doesn't take risks, because it seems he's scared of losing the ball, whereas Rooney will try those passes, even when he plays as a number 10 with his back to goal.

2975~~~
That's not a through ball.

You're being too simple with this. Doesn't take risks is just bullshit. He doesn't do things with the ball that are more likely to result in lost possession than not. Especially with through balls when our strikers are RvP and Falcao with no space behind defense because the defense is sitting so deep. Only example you can count is that Rooney pass and that resulted in a volley from a very tight angle with the weaker foot. It's a poor chance. Goals from that are goal of the year contenders. Mata isn't scared of anything. He's sensible. Rooney isn't any different. He just likes his long balls more. What can you in this formation. You got the two in the middle, the two strikers in front and Valencia and Young to the sides with Fletcher next to you. What kind of passes are you going to make with that against a team that plays with a tight 5 man backline and two deep midfielders? The only space is wide and we got wide plenty. Unlike the Moyes instructions we just didn't mindlessly cross it.

When Carrick came on we got an extra body in attack and a quicker passing game. That's about it. The main outlet was still out wide, just a tad quicker.

Really, the only players that were really poor in the game where Evans and Fletcher. The others played like the system allowed them too.

2976~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2977~~~
I'd relegate him to bench warmer to be honest. Mourinho did well to sell him off for so much.

2978~~~
He's really good at keeping possession but he just isn't a creative player for us at all. He had that great pass to RvP last weekend but that's about the most creative thing he's done during his time here at United.

2979~~~
Mourinho coned us proper. To think I was excited for the signing

2980~~~
I was very happy when we signed him but right now I'll sell him in the summer if it was up to me. I know he's fantastic, but he hasn't done it since he moved to United. He's not a go to guy, the one you can call upon when things aren't going too well, he goes missing always in these kind of high tempo away games.

2981~~~
These kind of games.. and every other type of game.

2982~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2983~~~
Thanks for the £37.1m <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2984~~~
Was he this bad at times at Chelsea too?

2985~~~
The thing is he is has dropped in form since moving to us. He was a genuine world class player during his two seasons at Chelsea and didn't have as many bad games for you as he has for us now. Right now he is a passenger even against weak opposition which shows how much he has dropped

2986~~~
He's world class when everything goes through him, he's the key man and team mates bounce off that. 

When that doesn't happen he goes too much on the periphery. I get he may not be the central playmaker but that doesn't mean he loses creative responsibility. Need to see more from Mata in games like this where we have lots of possession. Ironically his best performances have been when we're counter attacking. I don't think it's a question of his mobility.

2987~~~
We had most of the ball. He had plenty of the ball to dictate the play.

2988~~~
I want him to start taking more responsibility that he did at Chelsea. Rooney does it for us where he's always making himself available for the pass and trying to start moves. Mata is symbolic of this 3-5-2 as he gets the ball and the first thought is to retain the ball, rather than try to attack.

2989~~~
Zero creativity this season, frustrates the shit out of me. I wonder if he is asked to keep it simple or he just doesn't have the confidence to try something else than sideways and back passes.

It's very disappointing because he's probably one of the players I want the most to do well.

2990~~~
He does, but only when the team is clicking attacking wise. Against packed defences he struggles. The pace of the passes needs to be faster for Juan to show up.

2991~~~
Won player of the year at Chelsea for years running, now according to a couple of keyboard warriors he provides absolutely 'nothing'. Shocking stuff today on the cafe.

2992~~~
I like Juan, but the midfield did him no favours today. The ball was going sideways all the time and when he ran into areas nobody had the courage to risk the pass. That is where Herrera helps him and why he says he enjoys playing with him.

2993~~~
Agreed, maybe he offered little today but the performance overall wasn't anything to write home about. With the right combinations he provides productivity that our other midfielders don't. But the cafe has spoken, flog him because he is useless.

2994~~~
Oh yeah, it's just the Cafe talking nonsense, he's been absolutely flawless.

2995~~~
It doesn't matter if he won the bloody ballon d'or for Chelsea. He brings nothing to the team as it is. If Herrera is fit and not in prison he should replace Mata.

2996~~~
I said it when LVG arrived and see no reason to change my mind, he won't survive at United. He's not dynamic enough or able to play multiple positions. That's the type LVG likes. Mata needs a team built around him. 
shame because he seems like a nice guy who loves being at United

2997~~~
My thoughts exactly...

2998~~~
Not flawless, but since we're speaking in hyperboles then the cafe is a total pinnacle of football intelligence, and we should judge players only on the opinions of those here. He is our 3rd highest scorer, but clearly that doesn't matter.

2999~~~
He brings nothing to the team, except 5 goals and 2 assists in 14 appearances, the 3rd best for our whole team.

3000~~~
It doesn't, it really doesn't, as all it does is mask his glaring deficiencies when he plays as an attacking midfielder.

3001~~~
You have to take the good and the bad with Juan. He's delightful or frustrating. A luxury player really. You love him when he's good but you hate when he's not.

3002~~~
We'd be several points worse off without his contribution statistically.

3003~~~
No, apparently you don't. Based on the evidence here he is a useless piece of shit who never did anything of merit and we should tear his contract up. The cafe has spoken.

3004~~~
Most of his assists since he has joined have been half assists ( as in the ball is passed to someone then a goal is scored rather than him 'setting up' the goal ). His goals have been handy but when you're playing as a no10 his primary role is to create and Mata has been<b> extremeley </b>disappointing in this regard. We have Rooney , RVP and Falcao all of which are more than capable of scoring 20+ goals a season but in order for them to do that they need the service and creativity and this should be coming pre-dominantly from Mata. On the contrary, most of it is coming from Di Maria, Rooney and even Valencia. Yes Di Maria is a better creator but he has only played a few games in the position which he creates most effectively and yet tops our assists charts.

Mata has generally done absolutely feck all in terms of creativity this season ( He was infact better in that regard last season ) and we really don't need him in terms of goals as I've already mentioned so why have him on the pitch ? On top of this when we don't have the ball, he's a complete and utter passenger which wouldn't be as much of a problem if he actually did something when we do have the ball.

Basically, IMO, his all round game has become quite atrocious. We might as well play him as one of the strikers and stick Di Maria in the hole because Mata offers nothing there anymore. I know he is capable of a lot more but the fact is he is not showing it and he hasn't showed it for a length of time now. His goals have really papered over the cracks.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I would happily sacrifice Mata's productivity for someone who actually gets the game flowing in the final third like Silva for City where although his productivity is not that impressive, he brings out the best in the players around him and his primary focus is to create chances, which he does several times a game. If we had someone in this mould that we could focus our play around in the final third, I think our attacking play would improve exponentially. Mata's game has been reduced to passing the ball sideways, backwards, or to the wing and then making a run into the box looking to poach a goal. It seems he is no longer capable of threading through a penetrating pass in the final third and this is arguably the most important aspect to a number 10's game.

I don't give a flying feck what he has done for Chelsea. He's not doing the same for United and should be benched based on his recent performances.

3005~~~
Ok, so first of all, do "half assists" not count? Does the goal at the end of them not count?

Second, Rooney Falcao and RvP have not shown this season that 20 points is a realistic target for any of them. Its not Mata's fault that they've all been pretty average in front of net. I agree that Mata is not at his best currently but the state of the witch hunt he's getting this season is absolutely over the top. he is an excellent player that would make it into the squad for most of the best teams in the world.

3006~~~
We shouldn't have to take anything. We bought him £37.1m, and he isn't performing anywhere near that standard.

3007~~~
Anonymous once again today, he is a luxury player who in most games contributes very little to the team in general, if he scores a goal or gets an assist it's worth it but when he doesn't it's easy to forget he is playing. Even worse when he is playing with Falcao and RVP because you have three players who are basically goal scorers.

3008~~~
Juan didnt set that price! This is what we got okay. Get back to me when he saves our bacon with another of his goals or assists. It just it what it is man.

3009~~~
Shouldn't start away games. Does nothing at all.

Home games is a different matter.

3010~~~
As of right now, I think thats a pretty fair assessment.

3011~~~
No half assists do not really count as assists in my book. Playmakers like Mata should be able to pick out <b>penetrating</b> passes at least a couple of times a game. Look at practically every other playmaker in every other top team there is around.  I can't even remember the last time Mata picked out a player in the final third to set him up on goal. Don't mention Rvp's goal in the last game because my 10 year old brother could have made that same pass to set him up.

Also, did you not read my post? If Mata was doing his job properly(you know, things like creating chances which he has been unable to do well for a while now) then Rooney, RVP and Falcao would all look a lot more like reaching that 20 goal target. Strikers tend to benefit from good service which again, as I've already said should be coming pre dominantly from Mata, unless we're playing a crossing or hoof ball game which I think most people would agree is not what we want to be aiming for.

Instead, he dilly dallies on the ball, passes it backwards, sideways, or to either wing with no penetration or conviction whatsoever. Oh but he is pretty good at making runs into the box and finishing chances which ironically is what he should look to provide in the first place... As I said we might as well play him as a striker because he is not doing what a no10 should be doing.

Don't even get me started on his defensive contribution. No matter how much any body loves Mata, the one thing that can be agreed upon is that he is a complete passenger when the other team have the ball. As I said before, I personally wouldn't mind this if he was playing well when he do have the ball.

And yes, although he might make it into the squads of most top teams, I very much doubt he would be a starter for any of them. Literally any of them.

3012~~~
Poor visibility. Cloudy over the Med and the English Channel.

I never understood why Cazorla got the pick over Mata at Spain, nothing is more clear to me than this right now.

3014~~~
We could apply for some day release passes.

3015~~~
He isn't performing anywhere near the standard he was when he was at Chelsea. The problem then was that he was a passenger in terms of working to win the ball back and defend, which is dangerous in big games. The problem with us is that he still does that, but he is becoming stale in his attacking abilities too. Must be dropped for the next game

3016~~~
I expect to see him returned to bench duty with di Maria back and Rooney, van Persie and Falcao all available. He may come up with a goal or assist now and again but so could those 4 and, beyond that, he brings very little. The lesson is - don't buy players Mourinho is happy to let go.

3017~~~
That might be a good shout actually. We need fighters in the away games and he really is not that. He can be brilliant at home though.

At the minute our best front three is Rooney, RVP and Falcao. I am fed up of having Rooney in MF. He is too good to be wasted there. 

When everyone is fit, Mata may not be starting every game.

3018~~~
That’s not the case. He is not the player who dictates the game and influences general team play. His positioning in the final third is world class, but the rest of his game is really average really. Mind you I’m talking about what he does for us, not what he used to do at Chelsea or what he’s capable of (and we know it’s a lot more than he’s showing).
<b>Exactly.</b>

Probably most here would disagree but I say we would be better off with him not starting games, in terms of goals scored and conceded. Put him on for the final 20 mins when the game is more loose and let him play his game.  

I wouldn’t complain for their efficiency in front of the goal. What I do complain about is the number of chances we create, what is Mata’s job, isn’t it?

You’re probably one of the last here to name him a midfielder. He is a very good second striker but as we don’t play in 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1, he shouldn’t be starting games.

Sorry to quote in you in another thread but I have a feeling that’s what has been happening with Mata. I don’t think he is happy with Mata’s performances.

3019~~~
Rooney should start instead of him in the next game although he looks a bit better at home. Rooney is wasted in the midfield and Mata isnt offering enough at AM right now.

3020~~~
The thing I hate the most is is inability to hold onto the ball when under pressure. If he has his back to an opponent they seem to rob him way too easily. He needs to learn how Silva / Nasri and the like shield the ball.

3021~~~
Thats just not true. Mata never was that bad defensively, but more importantly during his run of games as a CM for us he's won the ball as much as almost anyone else. Its a good improvement, its just one thats going unnoticed because he isnt as big as Fellaini

And unfortunately he isnt in the team to win the ball, hes in the team to play teammates in on goal and thats where he hasnt been doing enough except against Liverpool

3022~~~
Looks a bit like him, too, oddly enough.

Wouldn't be surprised to see sneijder come in to take his place

3025~~~
Sneijder? Really? 
I thought that story was dead and buried as it should be.

3026~~~
He's the reason we didn't win today.

He should've been removed sometime in the game, he was being absolutely bullied on the ball. He doesn't have the physical capabilities to influence himself on the game. His complete silencing by the opponents was the reason we were bottlenecked in possession, we didn't have the confidence to pass the ball into the hole to start our next phase of attack and found ourselves keeping the ball at half line and between our back 3 for the whole game. Nothing you can really blame on him personally, apart from not being physically capable, but Van gaal should know his limitations as a player in the hole against big teams. Villa set up with 5 at the back with Vlaar in the middle to solely shit on Mata, and that's all they had to do to make our possession completely futile. Don't understand the reasoning behind Van gaal's substitutions and tactical changes made to the top 2 strikers, the midfield pair and our defence. He addressed everything but the problem and I'm sure he'll learn from that in his post match analysis; Mata's abilities can only be used when allowed the freedom to express them at home games. We were lucky not to lose really.

3027~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How come I didn't notice that earlier!

3028~~~
Mata has been anything but convincing however lets keep in mind that bar DDG no other player has played well consistently this season. Or last season for that matter. One good game followed by two anonymous ones. Same goes for Rooney, RVP, Fellaini etc etc. The team as a unit is yet to gell properly.

Atm this team is set up to bring out the best of De Gea(non existent midfield, shoddy defense). Everyone else seems confused about their role and position.

3029~~~
What would you call it then?

And you're going on as if I'm just talking about this game. My view is not just based off one game. Playing safe and being antonymous seems to be a constant feature in Mata's game nowadays, unfortunately, regardless of what formation we play.

3030~~~
Call it the same as you did.

I'm going on about this game and others featuring that system. I don't think anyone plays good apart from Young and Valencia too an extent. Some play worse but no one is doing really well apart from the wing backs and that's largely due to the fact that they don't get challenged much defensively and have a lot of space on the wings.

You can call it playing it safe. I call it sensible. It seems frustrating because we aren't creating anything and I put that solely down to the system. It's been way different in a diamond or a 4-3-3.

3031~~~
Mata needs players around him who are also technically good and looking to play the quick, sharp passing game. Herrera aside, and occasionally Rooney, he doesn't have anyone around him. When he plays with Herrera, his game goes up a level. 

I was disappointed he didn't provide us with that special bit of quality today, considering we had so much of the ball. With Villa happy to sit back, we needed a bit of quality from Juan.

3032~~~
A through ball is a type of pass, so we'll stick with through ball then, eh?

Rooney was excellent against Arsenal (no.10) and Liverpool (no.8), when playing a 352. 

You keep going back to the system, and yes, the system isn't the best, but regardless of what formation we play, Mata can often go hiding in games.

3033~~~
Another match where he doesn't do anything. He struggles to fit in with the team a lot of the time I think. Would be definitely re-considering his place in the squad at the end of the season.

3034~~~
mata is completely ineffective in build up play.  i would only use mata as a super sub.  if a game plan didn't work out and we need to shake things up, then probably mata is the first person to think about.

3035~~~
Even when he's not creating you can't say he's not moving the ball round and spreading play. 

A massive part of Matas game is manipulating the space. Today with both teams adopting a 352 it just looked completely cramped in the middle. Persie, Falcao, Rooney and Mata - they were all treading on eachothers toes.

Our most obvious route was to just spread the ball wide and cross. No one else managed to create through the middle either.

3036~~~
He's linked up well with Herrera this season, and Kagawa last season. Mata is the kind of guy who thrives on movement and quick passes.

3037~~~
He looks completely lost this season when Herrara isn't playing. Awfully disappointed in him today - we had two strikers that are known to make great runs on the pitch and he was barely able to spot them.

3038~~~
I believe the criticism of his performances are over the top but this I totally agree with.

I'd like to see him atleast try to put them through even if it doesnt come off. I just dont remember him trying any passes behind the defence.

3039~~~
He's a second striker and sadly in football that position is something that's misunderstood and basically coming to an end. He's never been a playmaker and most of the time we play him there. If we continue to do that then he'll never be a success here and should basically get sold.

3040~~~
I think he's a world class player, but he does seem to go missing in the away games. Whether he's being played out of position or not, I don't know, but his contribution yesterday was terrible.

3041~~~
I have the feeling Mata is too limited in his creativity with no creative players around him. Without Di Maria or Hererra to link up with, Mata seems a bit lost...

3042~~~
It's like he looks up and sees the pass but prefers the safer side or back option. I think it must be a clear instruction from LVG (something like if you aren't 100% sure, do not attempt the pass). However he was doing more or less the same shit under Moyes.

3043~~~
He's been disappointing for sure, but I think we play to slow and it effects him.

We are letting the opposition retreat and get in defensive positions before we go forward with the ball.
This leaves us with very little room to work with, and passing with so many players around is much more difficult.

Look at the match against Liverpool as an example. When Liverpool where trying to get bodies forward, we hit them on the break. The pass he made to RVP was excellent. He had space, and where most people expected a shot, he passed an excellent ball to RVP in lots of space.

3044~~~
I think people are over-thinking things and blaming the rest of the team for Mata being shit..

3045~~~
He needs to play with a strong defensive midfield base behind him and pacey wingers creating space ahead of him to get the best out of him, if not he just seems a passenger for most of the game and not worth having an 37m player play like that.
Hes too much of a luxury when Rooney, RVP are undroppable. The only way i see him shoed in his best position is if Rooney plays as a left/right forward,   which wont be too bad if he given a Ronaldo free role with DiMaria moonlighting when he make runs into the box.

edit: still too weak, think he will be gone tbh, replaced by Vidal or Strootman

         .... Carrick.....Di Maria
          ..............Mata
     Januzaj........RVP........Rooney

3046~~~
Yup, I agree.

3047~~~
He simply hasn't done it for us. As <a class="username" data-user="17825, @zing" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/17825/">@zing</a> said, people are over thinking things here. I've never finished watching a United game and felt "wow" what an amazing performance by Mata, not once and that's saying a lot. I think summer is the time to part ways. A genuinely nice bloke, but if he's not doing it on the field of play, then what's the point?

3048~~~
If he was English and named John, he'd be worth about 3 million.

3049~~~
His stats are good but I think that glosses over his play. He had a huge opportunity when Rooney was out and didnt take it.

I do agree, he looks better when he has somebody like Herrera to help with the quick one touch stuff. I think with Di Maria and Herrera in the team it will allow him more time / space to create.

3050~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> John Bush

3051~~~
Yeah, wont blame the instructions. It was the same under Moyes. Its weird, has the ability, plays so far upfront that losing the ball wont even be a big deal but just doesnt fancy it.

3052~~~
So fecking intelligent.
Spots the right pass.. and executes it.

3053~~~
What a ball from Mata!

3054~~~
Again.

3055~~~
Lots of criticism of his general play not applicable today, his passing has been superb.

3056~~~
The ball control during that little run and pass was Iniesta like.

3057~~~
Has he been reading the Caf?

3058~~~
He's Veron. Good or very good home games and not that good away games.

3059~~~
Absolute metronome.

3060~~~
When everyone is fit, will we see the ultimate shoehorning?
Carrick
Rooney - Di Maria
Mata
Van Persie - Falcao
I might be currently blinded by mata performance, but at the moment, I do not believe he deserve to be drop for the sake of squad balance.

3061~~~
Feels good to not be one of his haters today. Faith will be rewarded.

3062~~~
He has looked a different man with Falcao and RVP on sync making runs, pulling defenders out of their positions etc. He has the ball control to make runs in tight space, he doesn't have the dribbling to break down opponents who are organized.

3063~~~
Mata Young and Rooney best players so far

3064~~~
Lovely bit of football today playing perfectly weighted balls for the goals.

3065~~~
Really great performance by him, 2 great passes at the goals. He has to continue this.

3066~~~
Well its a home game, so he was bound to be fantastic. He's like clockwork. You can almost guarantee he'll be pants against Spurs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

When he plays like this though, he's absolutely beautiful to watch.

3067~~~
Brilliant half from Juan, plenty of hugs.

Gets unfairly criticised too much.

3068~~~
Best I've seen him play for a while. Great half from Juan.

3069~~~
Pulling the strings like how we envisioned he would. Its no coincidence he seems to be finding players left right and centre with the addition of Falcao to the frontline. Falcao has brought a lot of movement and power which is causing their defence all sorts of problems. Mata is simply just picking his spots where Falcao/RVP have dragged defenders away.

3070~~~
Looking very good today. Very tidy, very involved, and making great assists and key passes.

3071~~~
This is the player we all believed we were buying and if he performed consistently at this level or close to this from early o in the season then you'd have to be mad to hate on him. Same with every other player, play to your standards and you'll get the praise.

3072~~~
Beautiful from him today.

3073~~~
Yes looking better - doing his job for the first time in a while. Good movement around him. Hope we see more this half

3074~~~
Completely different player home and away. He's a luxury we can afford at home but we need more of a defensive presence away.

3075~~~
The confidence of being first choice at the moment is doing wonders for him

3076~~~
Another very good home performance against average opposition. Not taking anything away from him, but would like him to start doing it in the bigger games.

3077~~~
Can't believe the hate he gets here. With a steady midfield behind him, he's fecking brilliant

3078~~~
Keep Juan deeper as part of the midfield three. ADM can play further forward

3079~~~
If you win the ball and give him space in the final third then he'll pick out a pass.

We don't do that enough with him. Too often he finds himself with 2 banks of four and having to pick a pass from there.

3080~~~
Would be interesting to see someone compile his stats and performances at home compared to away.

3081~~~
At Old Trafford : 

Appearances : 8 (9)
Minutes played : ~700
Goals : 4
Assists : 2 (3)

Away :

Appearances : 6
Minutes played : ~450
Goals : 1
Assists : 0

3082~~~
Fantastic today, especially the first half.

3083~~~
Very pleased. Great overall performance. Was also overlooked a couple of times from our defenders who shat their pants again everytime they had the ball on their feet.

3084~~~
His touch really is exquisite.

3085~~~
Proves yet again that he can be majestic at home.

3086~~~
Really improved performance from him this game. Willingness to be involved and more importantly taking ownership of carrying the ball forward and playmaking was extremely pleasing. Well involved for the first two goals! Hope he keeps it up.

3087~~~
Played like a proper 10 today, linking the midfield with the strikers. 

He benefits having a Rooney or Herrera in the midfield. At times he has looked lost when he's playing in the hole and the midfield is too deep for him to actually work with. When he has a midfielder pushing up with him he clicks into action.

3088~~~
Loved seeing him try tougher passes rather than keeping it ticking over. He has it in him to make those passes so should be trying them regularly. Great performance.

3089~~~
Exactly my thoughts on his performance, he's good enough to create some dangerous situations with his passing. Whether it's by playing it through, crossing it or just combining with others.

3090~~~
Thought he was good today. Space + quality players around him = hurting teams.

3091~~~
Was good today,will be average another day. Thats just Juan.

3092~~~
I gave him 8 and thought he played well today, but long term I think he is too slow and lacks strength to play in there with Rooney as the other #8, we wont stretch teams that are more compact and powerful than the likes of Hull and Newcastle without some added dimensions in the attacking set-up.

3093~~~
Fair play to him, i've been criticising him all season but deserves praise today, still remains to be seen if he can do it away from home, he also benefited from Newcastle's lackluster play the amount of space he found himself in won't happen often.

3094~~~
He was very good today. Very positive in his runs and passing. He's been too timid at times but today was what you would expect from a player of his ability.

3095~~~
He'll always play well in home games like these where he has acres of room. He's a great option to have in any squad.

3096~~~
I agree, and I'd rather see us lose possession because Mata tried to be dangerous and direct, than because he pottered about with the ball to long around and got barged out of the way with ease.

3097~~~
It's interesting to see him and Rooney adapt to basically both playing as advanced centre mids. Rooney provides the legs when Carrick gets overrun and Mata has the ability to play some exquisite passes as we saw today. I actually thought that some of his best touches and passes came when he was under more pressure from Newcastle which is odd because he is quite susceptible to being pushed off the ball quite easily.

In a system I hate, I like the balance that Mata and Rooney have finally found - but they need Carrick in there. Carrick himself doesn't have to be majestically brilliant to tie it together, but he's a different animal to a Fellaini and of course Fletcher when it comes to bringing the pair of them into the game.

3098~~~
With time and space his delivery is impeccable. A great player but squad player for us. I'm OK with that.

3099~~~
Helps when he has people running and moving for him so he can pick them out. His pass to Rooney was obviously the pick.

3100~~~
There was a fair bit of space out there but we know Mata is a final third type of player. He is wasted deeper. Great vision for Rooneys second goal. There was speculation about his future earlier in the season so it's good that he's had a lot of football recently.

3101~~~
Helped that there was a blast crater of space between Newcastle's midfield and defense. Mata, like may of our midfielders can look like world beaters when given time and space to collect the ball, turn and spray passes, which he did quite well today. If Newcastle had a semi functioning midfielder like Tiote, it would probably have been a bit of a challenge. I hope his form improves but today did not reveal anything we didn't already know about him.

3102~~~
He was immense in the first half, him and Rooney were a joy to watch in midfield.

3103~~~
He's world class at old trafford but often goes missing away from home....delighted for him that he is looking like first team material now after a very slow start....a very useful player to have

3104~~~
He was phenomenal today, really pleased with him. I think this was one of the his best performances of the season.

3105~~~
I was thinking this while I was at the game. He wasn't anonymous and influenced the game a fair bit today. 
Hope he has a good away performance next. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3106~~~
Damn...I knew he perfomred better at Old Trafford but that's alot more stark than I thought it would be. Anyway, he's a joy to watch when he's on form.

3107~~~
Absolutely, he was immense today. It was his best performance of the season. Rooney, Falcao and Jones were also very good.

3108~~~
Looked like the player he was at Chelsea today; really pleased to see him come back into form.

Having Rooney, Falcao and RVP in front of him must be a dream situation

3109~~~
Great seeing Mata play well. I still see people giving praise but making sure they get their criticisms in there at the same time. Fact is though, he impacts the results of games as much as anyone.

He is a pleasure to watch, especially in that kind of form.

We are coming up to him being at the club for year and while the price tag will influence judgement, I think he has done very well. Obvious room for improvement but very happy with how he has played for us.

3110~~~
Forward passes? Surprising. Solid performance.

3111~~~
Again, can only play at home. He doesn't have the physical capabilities to hold his own to express his technical abilities in away games. I say this over and over again. I'm still confused as to why we bother with him away from home.

3112~~~
Lovely little run and pass to Rooney for the second goal.

3113~~~
I've been saying it all season, it's about what you put in front of him. Falcao might not have scored the goals but his energy, movement and aggression were the difference between this Mata, finding spaces and providing assists, and the Mata who was playing behind an out of form and virtually stationary RVP earlier in the season.

3114~~~
Still a shadow of the player he were at Chelsea but a very, very good game from him today. Him and Rooney ran the game until late on when we took our foot off the gas.

3115~~~
Good performance. Seems he really is the 'home game specialist' at the moment though. Will be interesting to see how he goes against Spurs now, if he is picked.

3116~~~
You think teams are more physical at home than they are away from home? It's still the same group of players with the same "physical capabilities" regardless of what pitch they're playing on...

3117~~~
People need a stick to use, let them use it.

3118~~~
....

Even without those stats, its quite clear that Mata plays better at home, for whatever reason.

3119~~~
No doubt stats show stuff like that and I'm not arguing that.

However, it's just a case of people needing a reason for the sake of having one. Sometimes things just happen, whether it be coincidence, luck or by design. The same players take the field home and away, the home players don't take the field with an extra 3kgs each week. He has performed away from home before for us and Chelsea.

Would love a strong performance against Spurs and see what the reaction is.

3120~~~
He could get 2 goals and an assist against Spurs and those stats would look pretty much the same for home vs away. That's how small the sample size is.

3121~~~
Very naive way of looking at it. It's obvious teams don't press us at Old trafford like they do away. Mata has a lot more time and space to work on the ball at home as a result of how teams set up against us at home. Away he gets bullied and thrown around like a rag doll. The stats someone posted in this thread are not that surprising

3122~~~
In this 8 game run of ours he scored the winner from the bench vs Palace, winner against Stoke, goal +assist vs Liverpool and another superb performance yesterday. I think if he starts consistently he will reach reach numbers like 10 goals plus more than 10 assists which is not bad at all

3123~~~
mata was too focus in decorating his own statistics as shown in too many games earlier of the season.  what he needs to do is exactly the same what he has just done in this newcastle game, dedicated himself to the team play:

linked up the play in midfield;
dragged up opp defenders, looked for our runner and sent out a killing pass;
explored the hole appeared in opp defense and made selective run to charge into the box looking for a goal, just like what rooney did.

then i'll be fine with him.  otherwise...

3124~~~
He should start every single home game, if fit. As for the away games, I'm not convinced. He seems to drop a level or two beyond what you'd expect to the point where he's almost a non-entity and we're playing with 9 outfield players. Contrast that with the fact that he's often our best player when we play at home, and I don't know what the feck to make of it. It's bizarre.

3125~~~
Mata at home, Herrera away?

3126~~~
I have given him plenty of stick for doing nothing in games but this was a welcome change. His best overall performance for United so far imo. More of this please.

3127~~~
mata is more discipline when he plays in ot, and he more tends to play his own game when away

3128~~~
I forget the overall details of his performance against Newcastle where he scored 2 last season (obvious the goals make it stand out) but I think that was a similar performance from memory (OMG it was an away game too <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>). Must be a Newcastle thing, think he scored a few against them for Chelsea too.

3129~~~
Yup. Seems to be getting his swagger back. Such a classy player when he's on his game. More of the same please.

3130~~~
Last season he got two goals and an assist away from home against Newcastle, and his record home and away was identical - 3 goals, 2 assists. This season he's been significantly more productive at home, we can all see that. That said if you take a look at the two half-seasons together the most obvious underlying trend is that Mata plays well when we play well. Mata hasn't been as productive away from home this year because we haven't played as well away from home this year.

We've played 9 away games; lost 3, drawn 4 and won 2 including the losses against MK Dons and City, neither of which Mata played in. So I'd say his away form is reflective of our away form this season and the reason he was equally productive home or away last season is because we were equally inconsistent home or away last season.

Some players are more comfortable, confident and composed playing at home and that may well be the case with Mata, but teams being more physical? Come on. That's the kind of rubbish Paul Merson comes out with.

3131~~~
Actually, we were quite good away last season.

But I do think that our tactics away are the problem, especially as we played some strong teams away. And also, it's the start of the season, where we were not good at all which makes it look worse, then it really is.

This 3-5-2 tactics doesn't really suit a number ten, as they have a lot of work to do, especially if the WBs are not doing their job properly and attacking wise our fullbacks are just average (Valencia almost not existent, while Young is giving something, especially in the last games), which puts even more pressure on the number then, who also has to be a proper CM and it just doesn't work that well and it won't till our WBs and CMs start playing really good.

3132~~~
Good to see he finally grew some balls. His best performance this season by far.

3133~~~
the perfect home player imo. would not mind to see this falcao-rvp-mata-rooney-di maria- carrick front 6 at OT, as gung ho as it sounds.

3134~~~
I think he's more effective at home because teams tend to defend deeper at OT unlike when away from home when they push higher up and restrict those pockets of space that Mata loves

3135~~~
Probably his best performance of the season yesterday. He played some very important passes into the strikers. The combination of him, Rooney, RVP and Falcao is mouth watering.

3136~~~
My thoughts exactly. He was excellent yesterday but I want to see him doing this kind of stuff on regular basis and not only every now and then, when the opposition gives him acres of space. But there is clear improvement- he wasn’t afraid to run with the ball towards the goal and tried some difficult passes. I don’t care if it doesn’t work every time, he has to take some risks- he did that against Newcastle and it was probably one of his better games for us.

I am probably one of his biggest critics but fair play to him, if he plays like that I will be very happy. However, the comments about him recovering good form are a bit exaggerated, as he was poor against Villa (see the comments). Play to your standards and you will get the deserved praise.

True.

This is a very bad idea IMO, as he is twice the player when played up front behind the striker(s). Why would you do that, considering Di Maria best games were as a midfielder? It’s should be the other way around.

3137~~~
I don't buy into this stuff about Mata being too physically weak to play as a 10 for us. I think it's the job of the midfield to control the game and feed Mata, instead of Mata having to control stuff whilst being the creative outlet. Against Newcastle, Rooney pretty much had the middle on lockdown which allowed Mata to stay high up the pitch and thus when he got the ball he didn't have to negotiate the ball around 10 oppositions players which meant he could pick out runs without playing perfect balls every time. Too many times do I see Mata dropping the deepest to pick the ball up because nobody else is and as a result the opposition end up being sat behind the ball whenever Mata gets into a decent position, but yesterday it was refreshing to see that Rooney was making himself available for a pass when the defenders had the ball and playing an early ball into Mata.

3138~~~
More of the same today Juan! He was quality against Newcastle.

3139~~~
His best game in a United shirt ever today

3140~~~
But, but he can't play away from home.

3141~~~
Talk about pulling the strings.

3142~~~
To think people wanted him out just a few weeks ago. Class.

3143~~~
He is having a great game, now if only our strikers can learn to finish.

3144~~~
Absolute class so far. Much more of this please!

3145~~~
Yeah he has been class

3146~~~
what a performance, absolutely class every time he has the ball

3147~~~
Great game so far-slick passing.  Guess he can play away against a pressing team.

3148~~~
Great first half, no criticism from me whatsoever. Creating chances after chances, retaining the ball so well, linking up.

3149~~~
Magical Mata. The player we all admired at Chelsea has arrived!

3150~~~
Absolute class, this is the Mata I know from Chelsea. Let it continue.

3151~~~
Him and Young best players by far

3152~~~
Been excellent so far, think his free kick was goal bound before the little deflection. More of the same please.

3153~~~
He's been nifty and useful today. Searched space wider than usual but it has been important for us.

3154~~~
Has been very good when given the ball. Starting to gain confidence and is really pulling the strings. His defensive work has also improved where he is no longer a liability.

3155~~~
Best player on the pitch and easily at that

3156~~~
He's absolutly brimming with confidence, God knows what we'll do when Di Maria is fit

3157~~~
He has created two or three clear goal chances through the middle too.

3158~~~
Best United performance I've seen from him.

3159~~~
Prepare ourselves for Rooney's inevitable ankle injury?

3160~~~
Great to see on the ball. Really pulling the strings for us in midfield

3161~~~
Sublime! Give him some movement in and around him, he'll pick the passes.

3162~~~
He's been immense, our strikers need to fecking finish properly now.

3163~~~
Brilliant alongside rooney and Carrick in midfield. Long may it continue.

3164~~~
This is the Mata who we used to see at Chelsea.

3165~~~
This kind of Mata we waited. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3166~~~
Probably MOTM today, shame he's fecked up that shot from Rafael's cross.

3167~~~
Other than the miss, he was the only one who really did pretty much everything right. Everyone else's touch went to shit and diverted backwards when possible.

3168~~~
Really good performance. Should've had a couple of assists and scored himself.

3169~~~
Gaffed the best chance of the match. Was not to be today I suppose. Both sides missed a few but Mata had a wide open look at the goal from Rafael's cross and somehow skied it from 6 yards out.

Other than that he was good today. Did not shirk from his defensive duties and a big part of why we kept a clean sheet.

3170~~~
Id say RVP clean through was a better chance...

3171~~~
Good attacking first half. Still feel he's way too lackadaisical when we're defending. A few times he allowed people to pass him way too easily. Last two games an improvement though.

3172~~~
Finally playing like we all hoped he will. Very pleased for him.

3173~~~
He shouldn't be used as a midfielder. He looked really dangerous today when he turned around with the ball a couple of times. Before he set the ball up for RVP, he showed a nice piece of stop and run - the one when it looked like as if he stood offside.

3174~~~
Missed chance aside, thought he was very good today. Played some great passes, was creating space by going past people, and just generally looked a threat. Getting back to the Mata who was so highly rated a couple of seasons ago.

3175~~~
Finally has a good away performance. Didn't look as good in the 2nd half (no one did in fairness) but he was scintillating in the first half.

3176~~~
Another good performance, our best player today. Shame the appalling finishing disease which was afflicting our entire forward line also spread to him.

3177~~~
One of his best games for us but missed a great chance, he also seems to look twice as weak and slow when tracking back in comparison to going forward which he needs to work on when we have two up front.

3178~~~
He was excellent today. Probably his best game in a United shirt.

3179~~~
Joy to watch these last couple of games, more like we saw at Chelsea.

3180~~~
Yeah that's the best he's played. He was actually involved in the match for once.

3181~~~
Mata was excellent today, he played some quality balls into our forwards but unfortunately nothing came from them. Another very good performance and he's looking like a £37M player now.

3182~~~
Excellent today, came to the top in a tough away game.

3183~~~
His best game in a Unite shirt, shame none of our forwards felt like putting icing on his cakes!

3184~~~
Decent today. Shocked how he fluffed that chance created by Rafael.

3185~~~
He played very well. My only criticism which might be harsh on him is the lack of forward balls in the second half. A lot of time he was forced to play it back or out wide as the centre was just packed.

3186~~~
He's matastic today. Our strikers horible finishing shouldn't hide his brilliant chances-created.

3187~~~
Great close control and vision. He's becoming a big player for us.

3188~~~
Had almost forgotten just how magical his first touch is at times.

3189~~~
Very impressive game. Even performed pretty well in the second half considering we went to shit.

Shame he skied his chance as that would have topped his performance. Apparently we didn't want to score today though...

3190~~~
We're really starting to see the best of him here. di Maria doesn't deserve to displace him once fit.

3191~~~
Played really well. Should keep his place in the team and either one of RVP or Falcao should be dropped when ADM returns.

3192~~~
He's certainly a long way down the list of players DiMaria should displace.

3193~~~
A rare sighting of the Mata I expected to see when we signed him, rather than the goalscorer who doesn't appear particularly creative.

3194~~~
In the last couple of games he's really started to look good. He's started making riskier passes, and he's standing out more. Thought he was fantastic in the first half, but understandably died down in the second.

3195~~~
I'm really happy to see him finding his groove again with such accurate passes and creativity. I hope to see him taking corners more often soon.

3196~~~
He's our Pirlo when he's on form. when he gets involved in tough games he can really create a chance for a striker out of nothing....Id still like to see Di Maria sometime though in Matas central role

3197~~~
He has been brilliant the last couple of games. More like the Mata we know he is capable of.

3198~~~
Was brilliant today. At HT I was all ready to give him a 10, a quite second half and that miss brought it down to an 8.5, so I rounded up.

3199~~~
Really pleased for him as he finally looks like he's enjoying playing and without the pressure of his position being in doubt. 

He's coped so much unnecessary stick on here at times.

3200~~~
He scores that chance if it's on his left.

3201~~~
Sorry man but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3202~~~
Good game overall today, but he is sooo weak, around the box he get's bullied so easily, especially on second balls. Also should have scored, squandered a similar chance against Burnely.

Type of football LVG wants to play requires physical players, I just don't see him having a long term future here unfortunately.

3203~~~
I thought his composure would have enabled him to bury it, even with his right boot.

3204~~~
He was great and more like his best. Getting on the ball in deeper position and not just picking out the safe passes, but dribbling with it and looking for the openings to exploit.

3205~~~
Love Juan. Had a couple of decent performances now. Will be gutted if he's sold in the near future

3206~~~
Two of his best games for United in the last 2 games. Finally getting involved in our play.

3207~~~
He was brilliant today - too bad no one could capitalize on those chances.

3208~~~
Agreed. I've been quite critical of his overall contribution to our play, but that was more like it from him. Was nice to see him retain possession even when under pressure and use the ball purposefully.

3209~~~
Over 90mins he certainly was not brilliant. Plus one of the biggest chances he missed himself

3210~~~
Refreshing to see him these last few games. Taking people on and running games from midfield. Much more like his Chelsea days. A lot of people (me included) feel like he won't be here long term but if he keeps playing like this then he'll be a starter for sure. Always had the ability, just for us he's often gone missing in games or kept it too simple when he can do so much more and play riskier passes.

3211~~~
Like with all of our better players - Rooney, RvP, Falcao, Di Maria as well - it's just a question of having a bit of faith. Remembering back to what we've seen them do in the past, and believing they can do it again in the future, even if they go into a period of bad form (and all of them have at one point or another).

Said it before, but 2 years ago, quite a lot of people were seriously arguing that Mata is better than Silva. I'm not saying he is, but if we can get him performing to his potential, then he's undoubtedly a huge asset.

3212~~~
2-3 years ago he was arguably the best player in the league and was dominating games on a regular basis like the first half today, and had loads of goals and assists. Doesn't have that consistency yet for us but hopefully he gets it.

If this is Mata at a brilliant level... I don't see why we payed that much. He looked average most of the game and then missed a big chance when we needed a goal. I still don't see any intensity in his game. He's classy and skilled that's undeniable, but when the pace increases he looks lost and overwhelmed.

3214~~~
Either your standards are ridiculously high or that's a ridiculous assertion... either way, there's something ridiculous about it.

3215~~~
Pirlo? strange comparison. Anyway, he was excellent today.. for the first time i felt like he was playing like our David Silva, driving the game and looking strong on the ball, some brilliant first touches plucking difficult balls out of the air and allowing us to counter.. he was running at players and he just had a verve to his game that has been missing for years. I hope it is not a one off because it would really lift our game to a higher level if he was capable of this standard of performance on a weekly basis.

3216~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> 

Lay off the Super Boc!!!!

3217~~~
There were plenty of examples of him being strong on the ball today - in fact, he was probably our best player at keeping the ball under pressure.

I swear some people are just never happy.

3218~~~
yep. He had 2-3 good situations where he used his body well. One situation where he gets half fouled and half loses balance against Eriksen, it is immediately he gets bullied and isnt strong enough...

3219~~~
You're right, there's nothing ridiculous about saying a player was brilliant when in 90 minutes he creates one chance in a set play and smashes a great one 10 meters over the bar. If Mata was brilliant what do you say when someone scores a hat trick or even a brace? Call it standards if you like, but he was solid but not great today. That's how I saw it.

3220~~~
You need to watch the game again if you think all he did was create one chance and there too you mention a set play. The Freekick that hit the bar?

Players can be brilliant without being the ones that score goals.

3221~~~
Fair enough, he had a couple of long balls into Falcao and Van Persie, but nothing fantastic. Yes, that's the set piece I was talking about.

Players can absolutely be brilliant without scoring, but I'm sorry to say I didn't think that was the case today.

3222~~~
Did you miss the lovely through ball to Falcao which he should have buried. And those were not long hoofs which he played. They were perfectly weighted passes over the top since spurs were playing a high line. He used to do this all the time at Chelsea. It's poor to way those were just long balls from him.

3223~~~
He was easily our best player today, even with the botched chance, he completely ran our attack (especially in the first half). As far as his 'influential' or involved play goes, this might actually be his best showing as a United player yet. It sucks that he couldn't convert the chance in the second half, because it would have really topped off his great play today. He has been great form lately (other than the Villa match) and I hope he isn't dropped to make way for Di Maria.

3224~~~
Better today but should have scored. Wasnt the only one mind you

3225~~~
He's just a great player, and an asset to the team, when Di Maria returns we either need to drop the 3-5-2, or drop one of the strikers.

3226~~~
What are we going to do when everybody is fit? Carrick, Blind, Fellaini, Herrera, di Maria, Mata, Rooney, RVP, Falcao (some even want to buy Strootman in) for six positions, that's crazy.

3227~~~
Don't worry, they'll never all be fit at the same time.

3228~~~
Had a great game today. I was one of the people getting on his back for his poor all round game since joining but as others have said in these last couple of games he has looked a lot more like the player we expected when we signed him.

3229~~~
We'll have CL football to think about next season <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3230~~~
In the past couple of games we haven't really had a bench that could change the game. I suspect long term only one of RVP and Falcao will start, the other can impact things from the bench. Same goes for Fellaini, Blind and Herrera, they'll have to get used to rotation.

3231~~~
So basically you have a different opinion as opposed to 90 percent of Caf. Fair enough but you're wrong, he was our best player today.

3232~~~
It's amazing how his first touch is so perfect almost 100% of the time.

3233~~~
The thing I love about his first touch is that he doesn't just do the bare minimum to bring the ball down and then deal with it with a second touch like the majority of players do. 

He has a really difficult ball coming his way and then decides to immaculately pluck it out of the air into the perfect direction to give himself time and space to then do something with it.

3234~~~
Yeah he always takes it away from his marker perfectly.

3235~~~
Bench Falcao.

3236~~~
Great performance. Where are those who said we shouldn't play him away from home? What a load of shit that is.

Really deserved a few assists, really provided that penetration through the middle. No hiding though that he should have scored but it shouldn't take away from a very good performance. Great to see.

Hugs.

3237~~~
Agreed.

Today was my first United match in person, and what struck me is how incredible he is on the ball. It's incredible... He's a fantastic talent who was perhaps only outplayed by Rooney today.

3238~~~
Was the best I've seen him for united hopefully this is him staring to pull the strings like he did with Chelsea.

3239~~~
He has such an amazing touch when receiving tricky balls, whether coming to him in the air, or running to meet a ball with spin on it etc, he is so clever with his first touch and when he is in this form, he is the 10 that we need.

3240~~~
What is that based on? He always talks about his "philosophy" and it how it has remained consistent throughout his career and in practically every team he played at he had a player like Mata who wasn't remotely physical. Sneijder at the World Cup, Perez for Alkmaar, Rivaldo for Barcelona and Litmanen for Ajax were all players who didn't exactly relish a physical battle and yet they all played very prominent roles for van Gaal's teams, so I'm not sure what makes you think he requires a team full of physical players. It seems like you just prefer physical players yourself.

3241~~~
Was thinking today how perfect Di Maria would have been if given a free role up top next to one of the strikers. The trio behind the strikers really should remain for the time being, be it a 3 man back line or 4 man.

3242~~~
Most wanted rid a week ago <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3243~~~
I'm loving the U-turn. As a guy with an unhealthy man crush on Mata, I know my judgement is clouded but it was hilarious seeing people say he can't play away from home.

3244~~~
Was wonderful. Play a diamond with him at the tip and we have a winner.

3245~~~
He was good, but was he that good?

I mean, he should've won us the match (like many others) but obviously created a couple of huge chances.

He didn't really help us play out from the back at all though, in the second half both he and Rooney disappeared.

I still think he should start in our strongest XI but I'm not sure how I'd fit him in.

3246~~~
Well considering he was playing in a more advanced role than Rooney and Carrick, so I don't think it was his responsibility to help get the ball off the defenders. I thought he made him self available very well and constantly turned their midfield around and put their back four on the back foot.

I don't think it was his best display but he was our best on the day in my opinion.

3247~~~
I don't get people thinking that LVG wants rid of him because he is a little too slow or is too weak. The same manager favors Sneijder who is far from a rocket himself, although probably a little stronger. Mata isn't slow either; he's pretty nippy off the mark, but lacks outright pace down the wing, but he isn't a winger. His passing is sublime, he can dribble and his runs are very well timed. He's definitely the kind of player our squad needs, but he needs the striker to be making runs, like they did today in the first half. On another day, he could have had two assists and a goal.

3248~~~
Not saying he is fast but I thought he showed a few good glimpses of pace against Spurs. Chased a few balls down that really surprised me.

3249~~~
Work rate has certainly improved.  I think he has realised that in order to make it here that a bit of graft is needed.

3250~~~
Maybe I worded it wrong but When I say physical I don't mean 6ft 4 mean machines, just players who track back, keep the ball under pressure and latch onto second balls. Mata pretty much does none of these things and is only in the team right now due to Di Maria being injured. LVG has no choice but to play him really.

Yeah I do prefer physical players in the United team tbf, you can't really win the league with a weak team(Look at Arsenal)

3251~~~
Welcome to redcafe. First DDG during early season, then RvP.
I reckon the next big star on the shooting list might be Di Maria. If you are an experienced Caf reader you can sense the ominous atmosphere in that thread and already hear them pitchforks being sharpened once he adds another one or two average performances after his pelvis injury.

3252~~~
He did against Newcastle too, and he's no slouch when we are counter attacking.

His first touch is invariably beautiful. I could watch Mata (and Isco) pluck the ball our of the air and gently bring it down, all day.
I love how he's been playing lately. Our selections have been quite attacking which has helped. 

Regardless of whether he scored or not, I just knew he was going to have a good away performance after the comments about him only playing well at OT. It's funny how the narrative always has to shift. First he's anonymous, doesn't influence the game, and then pops up with a goal or assist then disappears again. Then when he's influential over 90 minutes the excuse is that he only plays well at Old Trafford. What will it be next?!

3253~~~
Rojo ,Falcao and Herrera are above Di Maria, but we will come to him, he is one injury away.

About Mata he was very good, and i feel that he is better after each games, i'm curious to see what Van Gaal will do with him, when everyone is injury free and after the buy of a couple of midfielders.

3254~~~
I think there is something in that. Not that he can't play away but we have been very poor away, and I do think Mata generally needs to be in a team who are moving well, making runs, passing quickly etc. to flourish. Something we haven't been doing away this season.

More explosive or physical players won't suffer to the same detriment likely as they can atleast 'get stuck in' which is something the fans take note of and put huge stock into.

3255~~~
There's every chance that LVG might fancy sacraficing Mata in the summer seem as we have Di Maria and Rooney already who can play a similar role but with added pace......but mata when on form can make things happen when nothing looks on and we've not had a player that can do that for a while and we look outstanding in attack when mata hits form

3256~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fP_pNFJgGQE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

We have a brilliant player on our hands here. Spurs' despite their pressing and constantly fouling couldn't do anything to stop him. Shame it took so long for people to realise this. 

Now he handed over the torch to Herrara. He's safe for now.

3257~~~
the little mystro is back!!!!

3258~~~
To be fair, all the  shift in opinions after his last two or three performances really only confirms he hadn't been up to scratch before then. All the praise in the more recent pages in this thread proves that nobody is blind to his positive contributions now that he's started making them. 

To me, the really big difference is the penetrative passing, which just hasn't happened before. The little jinks and tricks we're all seeing are part of the same pattern. Somebody who is finally taking risks and playing with the sort of swagger you need from someone playing a position that should be the team's creative hub.

3259~~~
Thank you Pogue. There seems to be a bunch of people who think they are some kind of Superposters because they always knew how good Mata is. Guess what, we all knew that. He’s been playing much, much better now and deserves the praise. Before that he was quite poor in some games, therefore the criticism was justified. Not really hard to understand.

I think this was his best performance since joining us, all things considered. I can’t recall any other game when he created so many chances.

3260~~~
Hopefully we can keep him on this form, he was brilliant and exactly what we've been missing lately (a creator).   Still love to see a diamond of Carrick, Herrera, Di Mara, Mata and two strikers of Rooney and RVP.

3261~~~
Glad he's upped his game, he can be a wonderful player to watch.

I also think it benefits him when he is no longer directly compared to rooney, and now playing alongside him instead.

3262~~~
I think his top speed is actually not that bad, but he has shocking acceleration and turning speed. When somebody is tight and about to tackle he really struggles to get away.

3263~~~
This is the thing we know what he's capable of doing but have not seen enough of that from him. But now he is starting to kick on and make a real difference. What I love about him is his vision and intelligence, his uncanny ability to pick out defence-splitting passes. As you said, he's playing with a certain swagger and that all comes about from renewed confidence. I hope he gains a little bit of consistency from now because on his game, he's an absolute asset.

3264~~~
Get away maybe but he a fantastic ability of creating space for himself when it looks like there isn't any.

3265~~~
Definitely, where he lacks pace he makes up with his clever Movement. Just wish he learnt to shield the ball a bit better like silva. He certainly has looked better for us in the last few games though.

3266~~~
Mata's inability to withstand heavy pressure in midfield is one of the reasons we found it so difficult to play it out of defence in the second half against Spurs. To be fair, Carrick's lack of pace and Rooney's high positioning didn't help either. Blind and Herrera will help when they come back. At the moment, we're a little too easy to nullify.

I love Mata, but he shouldn't be played in the middle against teams that are capable of pressing high and causing us problems.

3267~~~
Also, his legs are so short, he just doesn't have the stride over that first 5 metres to burst away.

3268~~~
I sort of agree but think he can definitely play as the 10 in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-2-1-3 or whatever you want to call it. 

Our squad is just sort of all over the place and makes no sense. But if he was the 10 at a club with 2 solid CM's behind him and at least 2 of the front 3 ahead looking to get in behind often, he'd thrive playing balls over the top. We just don't really have anyone who makes runs in behind except the litany of number 9's we have and playing them all together causes the problem you would expect it too.

3269~~~
I think he's struggled at times, but I assume the lack of penetrative passing is more a result of a lack of quality runs up top and time and space to hit the pass, some of which might be partly Mata's fault.

I don't think he's Carrick, who seems to go through spells (in one now) where he can pick out dangerous balls over the top but stops doing that when he lacks confidence or whatever happens to him. If there's a penetrative pass, Mata will make it. His problem is the physical work needed to get in position to do that (he's not Silva in terms of getting open), his teammates, our lack of runners from midfield or wide (save Rooney when he plays deep) and the lack of defensive help he provides.

3270~~~
Anyone else smile a little every time he delivers a pin point crossfield pass from the right to switch play to Young with his left foot and Rooney do the same to switch play from the left to Valencia with his right? The quality in midfield with those two dropping back is ridiculously good.

3271~~~
Well I just smile when I see him but yes, he has been switching the play quite well in recent weeks. Not only with long cross field balls but his ability to carry the ball across the field and spread it out wide before he gets forward. Just like his goal against Liverpool.

3272~~~
I wonder where he will play once we have some midfielders back. I assume Rooney will then play either upfront or in Mata's current position just behind the strikers

3273~~~
the players who have to start as a part of the front six when everyone is fit:
Carrick, Di Maria, Rooney, one out of Rvp/Falcao
Players whom I would want to join these four: Herrera(based on the fact that he has played as a slightly defensive CM too), Mata. 

Considering these six players, I would like to see the following formation:
------carrick---herrera-----
--mata----rooney----di maria
-----------rvp/falcao----------

this can also change to:
-------carrick------rooney------
-herrera----mata----di maria---
----------rvp/falcao--------------

We can lack width on the right in both these formation. But with Di Maria+Shaw on the left and Rafael providing attacking support on the right, we should not become too narrow.
In some tough away games, Fellaini/blind can replace Herrera and Valencia can replace Mata. Making the following formation:

-----carrick---fellaini/blind---------
valencia----rooney-----di maria---
----------rvp/falcao----------------

3274~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3275~~~
Go on Juan, show the haters you can do it away in a physical type of game! Love to see him score. Feel a free kick going in for him today.

Hugs.

3276~~~
Thats not really impressive to be fair, nor by him, nor by playmakers in the PL. Fabregas alone has like 12 assists in the PL already, he'll probably end up with 20 assists in the PL in one season. 8 Assists per season is not really special for a #10.

3277~~~
Doesn't get the ball enough to be fair.

Sometimes we seem to bypass him. Not sure whether its just a lack of vision from our makeshift midfield or that we don't have the confidence to play a short ball to him under pressure.

3278~~~
Come alive in the second half.

3279~~~
Good stats, appalling performances like today

3280~~~
Did not notice he was playing against stoke until I saw this thread pop up on Redcafe

3281~~~
Expected performance vs stoke so far

3282~~~
Think he's been v good to be honest

3283~~~
Very good for Stoke

3284~~~
When people say they cant understand why Rooney plays deeper than him you just have to show them what Mata has done in his last few games. I like Rooney a lot and think he is our best player but i would rather have Mata support our strikers

Been our best player by far

3285~~~
Odd player to criticize today. I think he's been our most involved player going forward.

3286~~~
Exactly.

3287~~~
An invisible passenger, as expected in this fixture. The mind boggles that he stayed on for 90 minutes. LvG made odd decisions today.

3288~~~
I agree. One of the rare players whose the touch wasn't pure shit.

3289~~~
Slow as a donkey in transitioning defence into attack. But still one of our better players today

3290~~~
Ding!

To be fair. Lack of movement in our midfield (Rooney) and RVP and Falcao dropping deep without any interchange between them made it harder for him. Definitely got better when Ander came on.

3291~~~
Must have a good second half I guess as he was invisible in the first.

3292~~~
That's what I felt.

3293~~~
Thought he was very good today. Linked up play and used the ball well. Rooney, on the other hand, was gash and offer no support at all.

3294~~~
I don't think he did much at all, really. He forgot to pass forward again. Rooney of course didn't do much, but he was the central midfielder, Mata was the #10. The duty to create openings lies with him. It was just another cute and tidy touches and good retention match that we're used to seeing from Mata, and nothing like how he played against Newcastle or Spurs.

3295~~~
Those 4 seasons also include the last season where he did absolutely nothing.

3296~~~
He was one of the better performers out there today. Quiet in the first half but had much more of an impact in the second half.

3297~~~
He was one of our better players today, although that's not really saying much, everyone else was mediocre. I thought our team and particularly Mata (and Rooney) suffered a lot because of the crappy conditions today. They couldn't really get their long passing going. It was hard to get a short passing game going with the way Stoke were defending, all men behind the ball. Basically, the shitty conditions today ruined our game IMO. Mata couldn't even take a corner without the ball moving from the wind.

3298~~~
He did OK but the whole team apart for Falcao were mediocre at best. Still question marks over his away form.

3299~~~
Whoa !
He looks super fit ! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3300~~~
Our best player today, and the only player who looked like he wanted to do anything offensively. 

I'd love to see him now at the head of the diamond with Di Maria, Herrera and Carrick behind. Some serious creativity there.

3301~~~
He's been our best player over the Xmas period, was happy with him again today. Played a couple of great balls into RVP.

3302~~~
Thought h was very good again. Not the game or conditions for a technical player like Mata but he dealt with it well and put a good game together.

3303~~~
Another average performance against Stoke but he wasn't alone, would still look to off load him in the summer not because he is a bad player but because we blatantly need an injection of pace and team still needs a lot of work in other departments so someone has to be sacrificed.

3304~~~
Why does somebody need to be sacrificed? It's brilliant having a player like him as a rotation option, will always get plenty of games and on his day is world class. Having players like him just increase the quality of the squad.

3305~~~
Because we already have Rooney, januzaj and Herrera so that's plenty, swapping mata for an attacking player with some pace who can beat a man would make us a better team. We also need new additions elsewhere and budget isn't limitless so if we spend a sizeable chunk on falcao we will need to sell.

Mata also left Chelsea because he didn't want to be a rotation option so I don't see him being happy here if that is his role.

3306~~~
What have Januzaj or Herrera done to warrant a place ahead of Mata? Only Rooney from those you've mentioned deserves to be played ahead of him to be fair.

3307~~~
Mata has shown far more then the others apart from Rooney, and Januzaj is more of a winger anyways, while Herrera is more of a central midfielder but can equally player as an attacking midfielder. We need a winger, yes, but we definitely don't need to change our attacking midfield group, as next season we'll probably have an extra 10-15 games added on compared to this season, with us being in the champions league and almost definitely going further in the capital one cup. There will be a lot more chances for others to get games, and it's not as if he's been starved of games so far, in fact he has the 4th most minutes played so far this season, after De Gea, RvP and Rooney. 

Our budget isn't limitless but we're probably as far as it gets from needing to sell in order to spend, so I wouldn't worry about that. Even if we were to sell people, I doubt we'd sell someone with Mata's quality. He's been here for just under a year and has been inconsistent but there have been plenty of class performances. If he gets the consistency which I'm sure he can, then he would be a key player, let alone just a squad player.

3308~~~
He has great skills and can pop up out of nowhere for a goal but his lack of size and pace is really killing our attack in Di Maria's absence.  There was a perfect example in the last minutes on Thursday where he was on a break with Rooney, got confronted by one of the Stoke defenders, and stopped cold.  Killed the entire attack because of his small size and an unwillingness to take defenders 1 v. 1.  While he is a valuable player to have, especially for set pieces, he is just not getting it done in open play.

3309~~~
Saturday is tomorrow, the Stoke game was yesterday.

3310~~~
I am not saying they deserve a place ahead of him but when di Maria is back and if/when we bring in another quick attacker that we are crying out for I don't see how he fits into the starting eleven, he will block januzaj's development so I would sell him in the summer. 

Mata has also been given a lot more opportunities in comparison to the other two, has been very inconsistent and may well lose his place to di Maria this season so he could be on the bench very soon. I like him as a player but he is someone we don't really need and I see him as being much more likely to be deemed surplus to requirements than any of the other big names.

3311~~~
I dont ever see him being a key player, too slow and dependent on movement of others, he needs to be played in a different role in a different formation and if that happens he will struggle to get in the team even without any new additions.

3312~~~
Is it just my opinion, or do some people seem to have entrenched views that nothing will change, whether because of stubbornness, or a totally misplaced view.

Mata has been one of our better players in the past few games, and he may not be 100% in every game - but who has been?

3313~~~
Isn't Saturday before Friday?

3314~~~
There's definitely space for both. Just drop one of the strikers which I'm sure is what will happen eventually with them aging. 

Also with the januzaj thing.. If he's good enough, he'll force himself into the team like any other youngster does. Nobody gets their spot handed to them, definitely not at a team as big as United. There's nobody blocking his development and nobody who will stop him from reaching his potential but himself.

3315~~~
If LvG intends to move to 4-3-3 and doesn't want to play Rooney in the front 3 I don't see much of a future for Mata at United.

3316~~~
When di Maria is back mata will be on the bench, if we sign the additional attacking players we need he will be on the bench or sold, he isn't good enough to be first choice and if he stays at the club it limits januzaj's opportunities. Januzaj shouldn't have anything handed to him but he is young and if he doesn't play it will limit his development and he will end up leaving instead.

If we continue with mata, Rooney, RVP anda falcao we won't compete for the title, we are too slow and one dimensional, if we bring players in we can't keep them all it's as simple as that.

3317~~~
When once it looked that he had no place in the team, he's now played himself into it, because of that others will now to have up their performances. IMO, he's one of only three players who are guaranteed a start at the moment.

3318~~~
He's been very good recently. Not sure why some are still complaining.

3319~~~
He's only playing because LVG has got no one else he trusts to select. Once Di Maria is back then Mata will be relegated back to the bench. He was bought in to provide assists and create chances for the team, he doesn't do that efficiently enough, he also let's players just walk through him which is annoying to watch as I've seen smaller players than Mata get stuck in. 

For £37million I want an Aguero type player not a passenger which unfortunately all Mata has been in the last 12 months especially in the big games. Yes he has improved and played well over the last 3 games but not to the extent in which he has won us games single handily which is what you would expect from someone with his price tag.

3320~~~
What did you want for di Maria's price? Messi? What did you want for Herrera's price? Scholes to return to football and become 24 years of age? 

Agree with the other part for the most, Mata hasnt been good enough at all generally.

3321~~~
He was very good in the last games, I don't see how he could be dropped.

3322~~~
Di Maria's price I wanted Di Maria or Reus 
Herrera's Price I wanted Kroos or Fabregas

We always get ripped off on transfers usually anyway but for Mata we look like we got absolutely conned.

3323~~~
He's been our best player over Xmas and should be one of the first names on the team sheet. 

When Di Maria returns RVP or Falcao should be relegated to the bench and it should be the most out of form of the 4 of them  that sits out. Currently that's Falcao I'd say. 

That's if we go on the premise that Rooney starts 100%.

3324~~~
Mata is a 30m player without a doubt, though we did pay that extra 7m over the odds but it's not a big deal, considering the 2 years prior he was amongst the best players in the league and Chelsea's 2 time player of the year. He just needs time as there has been so much change at United in his year here. He has consistently been getting better recently and hopefully it's not just a spurt of good form, and he'll keep progressing as he can be world class as he was for Chelsea. It's harsh to make your mind up on him because of 5 months with Moyes then the first half of this season where we've had so many changes with Van Gaal in, and a half season where everyone has been inconsistent. He has a pretty decent goal and assist record as it is, but that will no doubt improve this next year. 

Also, I'm not sure why so many people care so much about the price. He's a class player obviously so it's better to have him in the squad then not, and it's not like we spent a feck load on a player who isn't good enough long term. He just needs to find some consistency.

3325~~~
Great half from him, been comfortably our best player.

3326~~~
He just knows how to play pretty football. Love him.

3327~~~
His introduction changed our play, the only player that seemed to know what to do with the ball.

3328~~~
Huge reason we played better after half time. Glad he's starting to come into form, the biggest problem with him before was he just went hiding and didn't look to get that involved while now he's always on the ball, and on the ball he's brilliant and always picks out the right option.

3329~~~
Just put him on the pitch alongside Herrera and Di Maria and we will be winning matches.

3330~~~
Had a calming influence on the hyper Herrera and angry Rooney and brought some control to our possession.

3331~~~
Was really good again today! Seems like he's settled and playing his best football again. 

So happy for him.

3332~~~
I am loving his recent turnaround, he and Herrera need to start more games together.

3333~~~
A lovely player to watch when he is on form.

3334~~~
He played well today, I thought.

3335~~~
Getting all the credit for the turnaround by MOTD pundits. I agree. Had a really positive impact when he came on.

3336~~~
He gets accused of being too slow time and time again yet he moves quicker than anyone else off the ball. 

If all our players made themselves available like he does we'd dominate for 90mins.

3337~~~
How bad were we in the first half?

I only managed to catch the second half and while I thought he was one of our better performers I still didn't think he was all that good.

3338~~~
From the very few highlights I've seen of the game it looks as though he was our best player and changed the game for us. Maybe if he had started it would've been more comfortable.

3339~~~
Been class these last few weeks. Fighting for every ball too and working hard off the ball.

3340~~~
Really good 45 minutes. When Di Maria came on he was playing some beautiful football.

3341~~~
Was pretty poor at the start of the season but he has been getting better and better as the season has progressed and on current form he should be one of the first names on the team sheet.

3342~~~
Horrendous. Only reason we weren't behind was because Yeovil didn't capitalize while they were on top.

Mata did well when he came on.

3343~~~
I really hope that he keeps his place in the team regardless of most of the attack and midfield returning now.

Earlier in the season he seemed to fall out of favour when everyone was fit to play, but you'd have to say at this moment in time there isn't an outfield player playing better than he is for us, so he definitely merits a place.

3344~~~
Anyone think he is running with the ball a lot more in central areas? He almost wasn't doing that at all until now.

3345~~~
Hopefully. At the start though he didn't deserve his place in the starting 11, this past month for the most part though he's been doing a lot more in games and trying to make an impact and control games, and hes done really well, so he should definitely keep his spot. I think he will, too, as Van Gaal rested him today when he could have easily started him if he didn't plan on using him next weekend.

3346~~~
Wasn't able to see the game but good to read about him playing well.

Feels good after being one of the few defending him a month ago.

Again, have not seen it but not surprised to hear him do well with Herrera and Di Maria on the pitch together.

3347~~~
Our best player in these last 2 weeks. Great to see him do well!

3348~~~
Class player if him and Di Maria play every week we will win a lot of games.

3349~~~
He's been consistently one of our most productive players since the day he joined, but I'm glad a 0-0 against Spurs and a decent half against Yeovil have convinced the masses he's worth keeping.

He <i>has</i> been performing better of late, no doubt, but the criticism was always as daft as Christmas. The Caf is usually OTT about poor performers, but rarely have I seen it so OTT about obviously useful ones. Even the media bought into this "disappointing" narrative, despite the fact his stats have remained perfectly consistent with his time at Chelsea, in a far less consistent team. In fact he's already only 7 goals shy of besting his total league tally over 3 years at Stamford Bridge (18) in 50 less games!...Read that again...<b>50 less games!</b>

But stats don't tell the whole story, obviously. I agree. Yet he's been pillored for everything from only playing well when the team plays well to <i>only</i> contributing goals and assists when we're not. Now, call me weird, but surely these are the ideal returns for such scenarios? Every player plays well when their team does, and if Mata's best performances have genuinely been his last few, then logically that surely means he's been pulling a goal or assist out of his arse every 1.5 games whilst playing dogshit? And call me weird again, but that's precisely the kind of player I want in a team that's playing dogshit. As dogshit goes, that's some neat and tidy easily bagable dogshit. Great when we're great, productive when we're not. Isn't that the definition of a great attacking player?

I'm not claiming he's been amazing or anything, he can clearly improve, but by every measurable standard bar "I've watched the game and wasn't impressed" he's been a very succcesful signing. Seemingly one of the few players who've helped to drag us through a notoriously low and lackluster period. A period where pretty much everyone has been struggling with form and confidence. And after years of defending players like Kagawa and Welbeck for their intangible contributions in every department but productivity, to have written off a player like Mata, a new player, with an unusually good return, to the extent some had only a couple of weeks ago, or even to claim that he's only now becoming useful, is frankly bum clenchingly, dick punchingly bonkers.

3350~~~
Van Gaal obviously wasn't happy with his performances earlier in the season too so there's clearly more to it than you're suggesting. You can say all that about spoilt/impatient/stupid fans but it's different when even the manager openly criticises him.

3351~~~
Yeah, those 4 games he didn't play in the 22 we've had this season certainly proves a years worth of fan overreaction is justified.

De Gea aside, who hasn't underwhelmied at times this season (or last)..And of those, how many have the return/criticism juxtaposition Mata has? I'm not talking about "should do better" either. I'm talking "He'll be off in the summer/no place for him/flop" type bollocks.

3352~~~
A year's worth of fan overreaction...right. This '"disappointing" narrative' came straight from the horse's mouth which echoed the thoughts of the fans and the murmurs in the media - it wasn't just temporarily dropping him, it was openly saying he wasn't doing the job asked of him. Since then he's been asked to do a different job and over time he's adjusted to it well.

3353~~~
lol.


Good luck with that nowadays.

3354~~~
No it didn't, it started as early as late Moyes-era. Where he wasn't fitting in/was a luxury buy/struggling to impose himself etc. All whilst contributing to 50% of all our goals in his first 8 months.

Spoilt/impatient/stupid fans, and headline junkies in the media, yes. 

And yet these other roles which he so spectacularly failed in still yeilded more goals than in his first year at Chelsea, and more assits and Januzaj's miraculous break through season. But you're right, the critics were grounded to feck.

I'm not talking sensible, considered "well he could do better" criticism here Brwned. I'm talking "Sell him/redundant/he's off in Jan" type stuff. Which you only need to look back a few pages to see.

The fact even you think a 4 game period during a unianimously poor start to the season is a reasonable prism through which to see his first year here through is silly enough. Apply that logic to shitter posters and you'll see where my annoyance comes from.

3355~~~
Currently, we seemingly play much better football with him in the team... largely because he can do things like control a football, and pass.

3356~~~
That is just beautifully put.

3357~~~
He didn't do anything really when he came on at Yeovil.

3358~~~
For me it's simple, playing Mata equates to goals and assists.

3359~~~
He was somewhat muted I thought, but he did bring a measure of composure that was largely missing in the first half.

3360~~~
His ball control and technique are miles ahead of everyone in the team. The ball just sticks to his foot and he barely loses posession. Just love Mata, has his best period at the club atm

3361~~~
I'd like to see Juan, Wayne and Ander in front of Michael and Angel and behind Robin.  With a solid back four, whoever that might be.

Do that and maybe, just maybe, we can close the gap on Chelsea and City.

Continue to feck around with a 352 and we'll have to settle for fourth place, perhaps third if we're fortunate.

3362~~~
you mean Angel, Wayne and Juan in front of Michael and Ander.

3363~~~
I did mean that. Thanks!

Ander doesn't get enough credit here for his tackling. The dude has a little shitbag streak in him.

3364~~~
Got him down to score today.

3365~~~
Think he was our best player that half.

3366~~~
He had one good piece of play right before half time. Other than that, completely ineffective

3367~~~
I agree. His technique was sometimes as good as it can get on top level. He's a gift from god.

3368~~~
Yep.

3369~~~
No idea how often it happens, but he does lose the ball in situations that I find annoying whenever I've watched him with us. He's clearly not strong enough to hold off shoulder/body challenges when he's on the ball, so why try to hang onto it - pass it quicker.

3370~~~
How dare you praise Mata

3371~~~
Di Maria should be the one you tell that to. Mata did some really decent stuff out there apart from the defending.

3372~~~
Looks like he'll be the one to provide something for us.

3373~~~
That last attack from him was beautiful.

3374~~~
Looks sharp. I just love the way he always seems to play the right pass rather than the most difficult pass.

3375~~~
That was a sexual way to end the half. He's a great player to watch when he takes control and shows some balls.

3376~~~
His first touch is closest I've seen to Berbatov in our team that is the compliment he is getting from me.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3377~~~
Still needs to do a whole lot more for me.

3378~~~
I've noticed Di Maria trying risky passes a bit too much, but not overdribbling in the middle for no particular reason and getting dispossessed. Do you mean ADM does this?

3379~~~
I agree that he wasn't too impressive(he had better games just recently), but he looks miles better than his teammates upfront today.

3380~~~
Rooney and Di Maria have been a little bit too wasteful, but Mata not creating more than 1 thing in the half is part of the reason for that - the other half is Di Maria and Rooney being a bit careless or unlucky in different situations

3381~~~
He was a bit sloppy at times as well, mostly because he can't seem to make up his mind. Stod still a couple of times and got dispossessed white trying to figure out what to do with the ball. Horrible cross to Mata that went straight into the arms of the keeper. He should be the one getting the ball from Mata, not the other way around.

3382~~~
Yup, think he dribbled around 4 or 5 players there with that huge half circle he did. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3383~~~
Our best player so far, and his technique is fantastic. Just a shame he isn't a bit faster.

3384~~~
He's doing well imo our best player so far.

3385~~~
Looks like if we are to get something it'll be through him.

3386~~~
He's definitely not sharp, poor first touch a couple of times and some very poor passes. But he does have the skill and pace to dribble past players so I wouldn't have a problem with him trying it. With Mata sometimes, it's clear he's going to get outmuscled by an opponent and yet he fails to lay the ball off to someone else and gets dispossessed. As I said though, could just be an impression based on few observations, was curious to see if others had the same impression or  not.

3387~~~
If Rooney needs to stay in midfield than switch him with Di Maria.

3388~~~
He's looking more and more like the excellent little player we knew he could be when we bought him, pleased with how he's played for most of this game.

3389~~~
Absolutely had to take one of those chances.

3390~~~
Think he's been excellent again today but boy should he have scored by now.

3391~~~
Ok I mean-had to take one of those 3 chances!

3392~~~
3 chances now.

3393~~~
Meh. Sometimes players miss, it happens. He's actually quite a good goal scorer generally.

Looked the most likely to do something.

3394~~~
It's kind of strange actually. For parts of the season, he'd been fairly anonymous and average in his overall performance, but he was still delivering by getting goals/assists and his productivity was quite good.

Today, his overall performance has been very good, more like what you'd expect from him, but his finishing has been woeful.

3395~~~
Can't believe he didn't get any of them on target...never mind scoring. But it speaks volumes that our only clear chances have come to Mata in a game where Di Maria, Rooney and van Persie have played as out and out forwards at some point.

3396~~~
Our best player by a big margin, should have scored. Only player that looks capable of producing something.

3397~~~
Shame because people will probably blame him for our loss today even though we were average once again.

3398~~~
They were all tough but he should've really taken the second chance. Apart from that he was the one attacking player who played well today, he's so much more involved than he was previously. It's just a shame that the system and the players around him were so poor.

3399~~~
It was uncharacteristic for him to miss all those chances,despite that he was the only player who looked to make something happen. I've been criticising him a lot but he deserves credit he's playing with confidence and it's great to watch.

3400~~~
Should have scored, but some good movement to get into scoring positions.

Got better in the 2nd half, having not done enough in the first. Dissappointing that he was just looking to keep the ball rather than play people in. We have Carrick and Blind in the team to keep the ball, we need Rooney, Mata, Di Maria and Van Persie trying things to affect the scoreline.

3401~~~
Couldn't finish, but still the best of the very poor bunch of attackers we had out there.

3402~~~
Missed our best 3 chances, including an absolute sitter. Yet was still, by a mile, our MOTM.

Shows just how utterly shite everyone else was.

3403~~~
Tough chances but would've expected him to get one of the first two. Only player that looked like scoring though.

3404~~~
Best attacking outlet today, but his finishing really let him down. He should've buried at least 2 of those 3 chances.

3405~~~
He was fine. Him and Valencia were threatening but they had no support. Should have buried the second chance. 1st and 3rd were hard to be fair. The 1st would have been better if he steered it towards Rooney/Fellaini for a tap in.

3406~~~
It's a shame he missed those chances but he was showing for every ball and not hiding like the rest of them. Probably our most creative player which doesn't say a lot.

3407~~~
Team needs to be built around him and AdM. The only players who look like doing something half the time!

3408~~~
Yeah nothing came off for him but at least he never hid and kept trying.

3409~~~
Easily the MOTM. Felt like he's the only one who could play football today.

3410~~~
Best offensive player today. I've said it before but he's been far more involved in our build up play which is very good to see. Crying shame about those chances he missed but we really should be creating far more than that.

3411~~~
You kidding right? If I could give him a negative rating I would. Couldn't even put on target the two best chances we had all game long. When he's not adding goals, he's useless.

3412~~~
Gave the ball away too many times to even think he was something remote to class today.

Not his day, not his everything today.

3413~~~
Not sure about the praise here. He was ok at best and if anyone else had missed those chances they would get plenty of grief.

Valencia was our best attacking player and he was bang average himself.

3414~~~
Christ he's slow, it all slows down around him, starting to realise why he's not a Mourinho player.

3415~~~
Voted him MOTM.

He carried the ball forward, played with urgency, passed well and got into good positions. Really should have taken one of the three chances though, especially the second one. 

Our best player the last 4-6 weeks.

3416~~~
He is slow, he falls down the moment someone touches him, he misses our best chances. If he is one of our best players ... we are in trouble!

3417~~~
Very slow player and he had a bit of a shocker in front of goal today.

In my opinion he should be played on the wing (yes he CAN play there) or dropped for Herrera.

3418~~~
Looses the ball the minute someone brushes him with a feather, turns like an ocean liner and runs like he's got a couch on his back. 
How is a small technically gifted spaniard even remotely guilty of the above. 
It's not normal.

3419~~~
Basically flicked/dinked the ball to the left back 50 times in an aesthetically pleasing way.
Well done Juan!

3420~~~
Slow on the ball, missed sitters and went missing for long spells but was still one of our better players. So limited physically and with our current group of players that is a real problem.

3421~~~
Should have scored! Otherwise good performance but should really have done better with the chances he had today.

3422~~~
His performances are starting to get much better, not just all statistics now which is good, if we could just now move Rooney far away from him so he can become more dominant in that position.

3423~~~
Played well again. Shame he missed the chances though, the first was a bit difficult to control really, even if the keeper was down, still should've scored. The second where he hit it over was a sitter though.

3424~~~
He's been very very good for us recently, but feck me he should have scored.

3425~~~
Bar the misses, he was our best attacking player. Gutted he missed those three chances.

3426~~~
He was quite good, I thought. He's missed a lot of easy chances - by his standards - this season, though, weirdly.

3427~~~
Can't wait for his blog tonight....

But, I thought he did OK. Far from the worst

3428~~~
Better than Di Maria and Rooney today but that isn't saying much, all the same old circular arguments surrounding him as usual so I'm not gonna bother getting involved in it, just not the type of player I want to see in that role at United.

3429~~~
Why people believe that he did well today?

He missed three good chances. He gave zero assists. He never defends. 

What does it mean to "do well"? He seemed useless to me.

3430~~~
Felt ADM should have played in his position, I'm not a Mata fan,
his characteristics are better suited to as a 2nd forward rather than what we need.

3431~~~
I noticed one good moment from Mata when he surged up the pitch but otherwise I thought he was rubbish.

3432~~~
I thought he was probably our best player. He should've tucked one of those chances away though.

3433~~~
Looked our most talented player today. Will be disappointed with his finishing though.

3434~~~
Looked like he actually wanted to score. Shame nothing went for him today. Makes better attacking movement than any of our forwards, and he's not even a striker.

3435~~~
A little anonymous and clueless when in position at times in the first half, but he was fine otherwise. His chances if taken would make differences in games like this and I wish he'd taken one of them at least. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3436~~~
Weird game. In terms of his general play, he was our best player going forward, however, missing though 3 big chances is criminal and all that matters at the end of the day

3437~~~
MOTM? No way. He hid away for most of the game and missed three very easy chances.

3438~~~
Thought he was good today but that miss from point blank unfortunately cost us.

3439~~~
The finishing wasn't there...but when you've had Di Maria, Rooney and RVP playing as forwards, why is Mata on the end of the 3 most notable chances? I thought generally he was fine, he drove us forward more than anyone else, he got past Soton's midfield more than Rooney did and he recycled possession very well.

One goal and he's player of the year on here...or he misses the chances and he's hidden away and done nothing good.

3440~~~
Three very easy chances? Sure, that volley from the edge of the box was a piece of piss. Jesus.

3441~~~
Welbz would have buried it, that's how easy it was.

3442~~~
Not sure what are you implying. He’s been doing that all season, he’s closer to a second striker than anything and his positioning is very good. He’s not really a creative force.

He did drove us forward, just to pass it to Valencia in most cases. He was probably the best of our attackers (together with Valencia) but he wasn’t very good.

3443~~~
Mental, absolutely mental, to say that he was rubbish when literally, and I mean literally, he was involved in every single one of our few good moments in the game.

Yeah he should have scored, and I'm fecked off that he didn't... But I'm equally fecked off that he's the only fecker who looked like he wanted to score a sodding goal.

3444~~~
You clearly are seeing what you want to see then.

3445~~~
I'm implying that you've got 3 supposedly world class players who also couldn't muster a shot on target between them despite playing as forwards, not to mention the fact Rooney and Di Maria could barely control the ball and generally looked clumsy.

You've only got to have eyes to know that Mata was actually not bad at all today. It wasn't a 9 or 10/10 performance, but it was acceptable. In an ideal world, your best chance doesn't fall to Mata so you can hold the miss against him because top players should bury one of the two 'clear' chances he had, but as I say in the context of the players around him who weren't pulling their weight at all - you've got to say he did well. The attackers were the real problem today, no desire to get ahead of defenders, poor first touches under pressure and some woeful passing. Di Maria's decision making in particular was painful to watch.

3446~~~
Yeah, he missed the 2 great chances. He also was the only one committing players and making things happen apart from Valencia and actually doing something useful with it. Him, Valencia and Blind were easily and by far our best players today.

3447~~~
Exactly. None of the usual criticism applied to him today. He was involved, mostly positive in his passing and generally didn't go hiding. What did go very wrong was his finishing, but to use that as a bat to beat him with (in terms of his overall worth to the team,) would be like writing off Paul Scholes after one of the very rare games in which his passing was off.

3448~~~
This is just moronic. You are obviously just seeing what you want to see. As for the misses, I'd say only the second one was a true howler, and I'm not too worried about him missing such chances in the future.

3449~~~
I thought he did well but unfortunately couldn't finish on the day. It's worrying for the other players when Mata is the only one to create stuff AND be on the end of chances.

3450~~~
he is a good poacher and productive player but I don't believe he is the right player what we need. If it was him/herrera I would go for Herrera. We need legs in midfield and aggression. Of course this stupid system makes everyone Mata included look worse than they are but I don't believe Mata would play for us in any formation if we wanted to get rid of this boring old-fashioned anti-football.. He could best play as 10 in 4-2-3-1 but still I can imagine better palyers in that position to make us look better overall. Once again, gret business for Chelsea. They look lightning quick now and great team unit.. Players like Willian or Oscar fits better in their system. I think we should be looking for such players also. We have got too many indynamic players even creative enough - Carrick, Mata, Blind, RVP, Rooney isn't any fast either.. We can cope with 1 or 2 in the side not with 4 or 5 and in this awkward system of course.. 

I believe we need apart changing the system strong aggresive midifelder to shield the defense. No need for playmaker like Carrick who lost his legs years ago and often struggles with high tempo and pacy players, Blind is little bit better, can actually run but is also very slow and at times struggles with physicality. I would love to have someone like Wanyama. He is underated imo, no yaya of course but great defensive midfielder of the mould we need

3451~~~
He was put in place to see majority of the possession, as with Rooney because of how Southampton played. If either of his chances had fallen to Rooney, our predicament would be a lot less severe than it ended up being. Him receiving the ball has never been a problem but he's an attacking midfielder that needs to create chances, which he fails at because he's not moving the ball quickly like he is capable of and he's certainly not beating his man with pace, so he needs to convert the chances he has.

This has been our formula the whole season, we do not create many chances but we have been extremely efficient off the ones we do end up creating, so we play 3 forwards close the box.

3452~~~
I could criticise him for missing a couple of chances, but that would be harsh considering he was fantastic today, our best player who pretty much single handedly created the chances he missed anyway. Infact I would go as far to say that was one of if not the best I've seen him for us.

3453~~~
Thought he was decent today. Was unlucky not to bag a goal.

3454~~~
You can not be worried all you please, but he had three attempts to gain the side points and missed all three. As for the 'seeing what I want to see', we had 61% possession. How many times did Mata drive forward with the ball? How many times did he play van Persie or Di Maria in? He was more than content to sideways pass and delegate the ball despite being our main [alleged] creative hub.

3455~~~
Results matter. An attacker's job is to get goals. Or assists. He didn't do either. He didn't do his job. On the contrary, he missed three chances. It was easy chances, especially for a 37 million player. How can anyone consider this "adequate"? (never mind MOM...)

3456~~~
Performance-wise he was one of our better players, but unfortunately he was the difference today. He had three very good chances; if he takes two of them then its 3 great points for United, and he really should've scored at least one.

3457~~~
He was in the right positions, and tbf to him he would usually score at least one of those chances, he was the best of a bad bunch as I can't think of any player that did better, so MOM yes, but on a day when this award shouldn't have been given out.

3458~~~
Well I'm not sure I'd give him MOM; probably go for Blind or even Valencia. But the strange thing is, had he not even been in a position to miss those chances, then people would likely have a more positive view of his performance today. That being said, how did he miss that second on?!

3459~~~
Dunno the second one is a bit of mystery, the other two are fairly forgivable, but that one was shocker, but his performance compared with Di Maria, Rooney, or RvP was so much better, Valencia did his usual bit of kick the ball past players, run fast, then cross terribly, Blind was ok for his first game back, Mata is quality but missed a sitter so the knives are out for him a bit.

3460~~~
I would give him a 'rest' our play is very laboured and slow in the last third, he's one of the reasons.
Herrera would be a better option to give some pace to attacks.
Can't believe I'm thinking/saying this but he just doesn't fit, he's a luxury player and for us to succeed we need a high press. 
His mobility is fcking shocking for a man of his size and stature and he offers nothing in terms of pressing and defending. 
If he's done anything to deserve starts its goal getting but today he had a shocker in that regard. 
Sit it out a while Juan.

3461~~~
The overtop criticism has to be coming from school kids. Yes, he missed golden chances, no doubt should have scored or at least hit the target but shit happens. He was there to get the opportunity, something other players were not doing.

I thought he had a decent enough game in what was an all-round poor performance, he was trying to make things happen.

3462~~~
Shame he missed those chances, he deserved a goal, he was the only one who looked up to it when we were behind. Our best player in this game, but that doesn't say much, to be honest.

3463~~~
Hes a second striker (off the striker) more than a midfielder. I wish we would start playing him there. Its so obvious he plays better up there rather than in midfield.

Dont think we would see City play Silva in midfield.

3464~~~
Missed three easy chances in a row that could have easily won the game for us. I think I've seen Mata play well once this season, against Stoke. Other than that I fail to see what he brings to the team apart from popping up unmarked in the box and getting a goal. Our best XI for me wouldn't have him in it.

3465~~~
He's bordering on donkey.

I don't get it with him, his ability is outstanding, but the bloke moves like an elephant.
His scoring record is great though and I think it's his saving grace with fans so far, had that been Falcao today the knives would have been out, but a striker would have buried one of those. 
Too immobile to be anywhere near midfield and not near clinical enough today.
The criticism is just to a degree as his ability to retain possession under pressure is shocking, should never have been cast into a fray with Schneiderlin and Wanayama. 
The defensive performance from Southampton was excellent today and it all came from their midfield and while I agree Mata tried to make things happen, sadly for us he was easily controlled.

3466~~~
Mata and Valencia were easily our best players today. I get the impression some of our fans only ever watch highlights.

3467~~~
Mata had a good game yesterday. Missed chances happen, it's part and parcel of the game. What isn't acceptable is the lack of chances created, something Mata, on the whole, has to do more to change. Like all, however, he's slightly hampered by playing out of position inside a disjointed system.

3468~~~
So you missed our games against QPR/Spurs/Newcastle and Liverpool then? And that's matches listed off the top of my head.

3469~~~
Had a decent game but with poor finishing. I thought he was our second best player behind Valencia though.

3470~~~
I'd say this is a pretty fair assessment of Mata. He's been growing into the side over the last month or so, so hopefully he becomes even more assertive (and doesn't miss any more sitters.) I would like to see him taking all our corners and free-kicks as well.

3471~~~
Good game from him but his poor finishing makes people believe he had a bad one. Should have put one of those chances away though.

3472~~~
What a silly point. School kids?

Are we really going to praise a player for missing chances becuse he was there to miss them? I certainly didn't see people queuing up to praise RVP when he was missing chances early on in the season or Welbeck before that.

3473~~~
This league is too phisically for him

3474~~~
Great first half. Poor finishing.

3475~~~
He's quite different to what I thought of him at his chelsea days. I expected his work in the buildup to be a lot better. He is actually very reliant on everything around unlike someone like silva who actively looks to create openings. I think we should play one of him and rooney rather than both. Building our whole buildip around two second strikers a bit odd.

3476~~~
Too physical yet at one point he was the best player in the league behind only Suarez and Bale? Nah.

3477~~~
Can't believe people are criticizing him after yesterday. Not a brilliant display by any means, and he should have scored, but he was the best of a bad bunch (except maybe Blind). This 352 nonsense is not working for anyone, Mata included. Stick him at the tip of a diamond, with Herrera and ADM behind him, and he will shine.

Mata is the kind of player who can massively improve a side if he has the right players around him, but will look invisible in a poorly composed side

3478~~~
I'd rather have a player there missing the chances than getting no chances at all. He did alright, on anothr day he'd have equalised.

3479~~~
Agreed. 

Dunno about people watching highlights but I've often thought that poor quality streams play a big part in the weird opinions you read on here. I reckon a lot of posters are watching the game in such poor quality footage that they're not even sure which player is on the ball at any given moment. Would explain a lot.

3480~~~
Yea I agree that Mata was one of our best attacking players yesterday, alongside Valencia, but I see where people are coming from. Come to think about it, yesterday's game was a bit of a mirror of the SOTON away game, we've had like 2-3 chances overall (none on target) that could've been converted and <b>were</b> converted against SOTON away by RVP. Mata scores those two chances and it's 2-1.

Thing is though, when he's had those chances iirc he was already playing another #9 alongside Rooney, imo it should've been RVP playing there so first and foremost he shouldn't have been taken off for Herrera but yea, that's for another thread and it's been said plenty times already. I was watching the match with my family and told them after that second volley that he isn't going to score today, it was painted on his face and seconds later commentator said the same thing.

3481~~~
I never praised him for the missed chances, I criticized him for it, bloody hell.

I said his all round play was good. New age fans and kids though will just look at key moments and throw their toys out of the pram blaming a loss on things like the misses, not seeing the bigger picture.

3482~~~
I actually think <a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> is wrong and Mata deserves praise for getting in those positions. I'd rather him miss the chances than have no chances at all.

World class strikers have rates of 30-50% when it comes to converting clear cut chances and Mata isn't even a striker. His scoring rate for us has been very good, so there's no reason to show anything more than slight frustration here after him doing so well to offer up those opportunities.

That Mata was the only one who had any chances of note yesterday says a lot when you had Van Persie, Di Maria and Rooney all playing upfront for atleast a good chunk of the game each. And it's definitely worth noting and praising. 

If it was a common theme with Mata then fair enough.. but it's not.

3483~~~
Wanyama was pushing the great Barca midfield about a few seasons ago, when playing for Celtic.

He was decent. RVP, Rooney and Di Maria were the biggest culprits the other day.

3484~~~
The worrying thing is, Mata gets into good position better than our strikers does. His finishing was bad on that day, but he go into the correct spaces therefore get his chances.

3485~~~
Mata was a sensation when he first signed for Chelsea. Player of the year two-years running whilst he was there says it all.

Granted Chelsea weren't at their best during those two seasons, but he was still a top player none-the-less.

3486~~~
He has proved himself in the premier league, 12 goals and 12 assists in 2012/13 prl season is pretty damn good. He has also raked up a good number for us, if we use him he is going to produce.
Not the biggest fan myself, but he is a class player no doubt.

3487~~~
He was totally different at Chelsea. Now he is a shadow of his former self. The only thing that he kept is his goal scoring, the rest changed. His confidence is low, he doesnt run with the ball much, doesnt take players on and his creativity is near zero. At Chelsea he was phenomenal in every aspect, now he plays like he was injured for half a year. Maybe i am a bit exaggerating, but he was a top top player, at the moment just a good player. I dont know if we are restricting him and arent using him to his strenghts, but he isnt the same player anymore

3488~~~
This is exactly the problem, Moyes was putting him out wide which limits him alot. LvG has not been showing great confidence in him, he has played alot - but a player like Mata should play all the time. Also he needs movement around him like many have said. I think there is a good chance he is being sold this summer, doesn't fit the philosophy.

3489~~~
He needs runners around him and pace in front of him. He thrives on movement and ours has been atrocious.

3490~~~
What part of the philosophy does he not fit?

3491~~~
Okay, i said it the wrong way. What i meant is he doesn't fit Van Gaals profile of a player, atleast that is what i think. Not good enough defensively and not robust enough. Playmaking wise he isn't a player that dictates a game either, which i think is what LvG are looking for and therefore he is playing Rooney in midfield.

3492~~~
His role isn't to be defensive, he is just as defensive as Di Maria. Not everyone needs to be robust. He was at the heart of everything against Southampton and has done similar in most matches lately, especially when teamed with someone who likes to pass quickly like Ander. Rooney is playing as a #8 because Mata isn't a #8 and never has been one. I fail to see this constant Mata doesn't fit in stuff, he has played 90 minutes in the last 9 league matches for a reason and I don't think it is because van Gaal wants to sell him.

3493~~~
Maybe your right, i do hope he goes on to have a great future here. I personally can't see him being a regular starter next year, especially if Di Maria is going to play CM in a 4-3-3 and i doubt he would be happy sitting on the bench.

3494~~~
What exactly is the bigger picture here? His all round play was no better than the rest, the difference being he does things in a more aesthetically pleasing way when comared to some of the team which seems to con some people on how he really played. Mata went with the general flow of the game and did practically nothing of note. 

And for the record, I'm not criticizing him for the missed chances. One of them could barely be called a chance in any case. What I don't get is the praise for missing them (maybe not you).

What it says is that Mata plays and thinks like a striker. The fact that Rooney, RVP and Di Maria didn't have a single chance between them for 90 minutes does not really reflect well on Mata to be honest and that has been a big problem in his United career.

3495~~~
People aren't pleased with Mata even now? He is probably our best player in last month or so. Attacking wise, he is much better than anyone else recently. I have no idea what people expect from him, to make 15 dribbles per game and create everything by himself? He was involved in pretty much everything we created against Southampton. But yeah, blame him because he is the only player in the team who should be creating chances.

3496~~~
Mata needs to be played as the 10 in a 4-2-3-1 or similar team. He worked well for Chelsea because he had willing runners in Oscar, Hazard, Willian,Schurrle that allowed him to keep the ball moving quickly, while using his best attributes (movement, positioning) to keep away from defenders. 

In a slow tempo like we play, it allows their markers to get much tighter to our players which limits their space. Mata when closed down can be negated too easily, as he doesn't have the acceleration to get away. This is probably a reason he has excelled for teams like Valencia/Chelsea and not been so great for Spain.

3497~~~
The bigger picture was is the formation, the system and for me on the day, the complete lack of urgency. Mistakes, poor decisions and all that, I can accept that, I couldn't accept the lack of desire to win that match.

It's not praise for him missing the chances, it's praise (more acknowledgment) that he got into those positions, things our strikers are struggling to do at the moment.

3498~~~
Willian and Schurrle signed when Mata wasn't getting in the team. Hence why he left.

3499~~~
He missed chances but was the only way who came close.  He's been one of our best players this season.

I have far more belief than I had last year, but am a bit confused by some of VG's substitutions - and would hope there was a good reason for not using Falcao on Sunday, as RVP has been generally pretty dire.

3500~~~
He's technically in the top 3 players in the league. But he'll 100% be sold at the end of the season if we can find a buyer as his lack of pace means he does not get involved enough which puts too much pressure on rvp and rooney and wrecks the balance of the team

3501~~~
That's a weird thing to say - he's probably been the most involved in our attacking player in our last few weeks then any other player?

From our front 4 on Saturday, he made the most passes, did more dribbles, had more shots (obviously) and, along with Rooney, touched the ball the most... I know stats don't say everything, but yeah, he's been more involved then anyone.

3502~~~
It's called the berbatov effect. A luxury player that will get you tons of goals and assists but who weakens the team as a whole in the process

3503~~~
If anything, the likes of RVP do not get involved enough. Mata's been very good the past few games when it comes to actually getting involved and not just scoring.

The balance of our team is getting wrecked because of the formation which suits no one.

3504~~~
Ironically, I think if he were back in this current Chesea side he'd be putting up monster stats again. Mourinho sold him because he was a liability in terms of workrate and defensively, but now that they have Matić in midfield I think he'd thrive there. He needs movement and pace in front of him and is best as the #10. With the pace of Hazard and Willian on the flanks and Diego Costa's excellent movement in front of him he'd look world class.

This is the kind of setup we need in order to see the best of Mata. We need top class, pacey wide players and a shield behind him in the middle of the park to make up for his weaknesses.

3505~~~
Nope. They all put a shift in. That's why the system works. Mata would detract from that. Matic or no Matic.

3506~~~
Apart from his misses, I actually thought he was good.

3507~~~
Maybe. If they hadn't signed Fabregas and had a central midfield pairing of Matić and Mikel I think there would be enough of a screen behind Mata for the "Mourinho style" to work well.

I think he'd have similar statistical output to Cesc, anyways. The team may not be as good.

3508~~~
Great guy, our Mata

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2911712/Manchester-United-star-Juan-Mata-surprises-children-one-city-s-toughest-primary-schools-delivering-presents.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...hest-primary-schools-delivering-presents.html</a>

3509~~~
Christ he's such a class man.

3510~~~
Genuinely thought he was one of our better players in that half. Made a great chance for Falcao. feck knows why he came off.

3511~~~
Yep. Bringing on Fellaini obviously worked but I think Mata is our best attacker atm, he didn't deserve to be taken off....

3512~~~
Poor again today but playing out of position, he really shouldn't be playing so deep especially away from home.

3513~~~
Think he was injured. He was limping a bit. 

Don't think he was good today but he's been one of our best performers lately. Was due a bad one.

3514~~~
I thought him and Di Maria should have switched roles in the first half if LvG felt Rooney's physicality as needed in midfield.

3515~~~
I Don't think he played well at all.  Says it all that Fellaini came on for him and made an immediate impact.  Most matches he plays in I forget he is on the pitch.  You don't think Mourinho sold him because he was so great, do you?

3516~~~
Was he injured?

3517~~~
Mata has been our best player arguably this last month or 2, and today was the only one making chances in the first half. As for Fellaini's "immediate" impact, it happened after 15 minutes when we changed our formation. Nothing changed with him on while it was a 3 at the back.

3518~~~
Didn't agree with him coming off but it turned out to be a good move.

3519~~~
He's fine. I think he's what we need through the middle to allow our wide players to cause havoc. A player with composure, good vision and class on the ball. He gets nudged off the ball but often he's ended up in that state due to taking extra touches because of the lack of movement. He'd have a lot more assists had our players - mainly Falcao and RvP not missed some sitters. He has a good understanding between Rooney and I believe we can get the best out of both if Rooney goes up front.

3520~~~
Thought he was decent again today, the only one who looked like doing much in the first half. Let him play with the back 4 when everyone else actually does something and he might look even better.

3521~~~
I cannot disagree more.  I guess the massive differences in perception, not just in football, but in everything in life is why there are markets.  For someone to buy and make good, someone had to sell thinking there was nothing there.

3522~~~
I don't agree with the last comment, but I agree that he was poor today. Pleased LvG took action already at half time.

3523~~~
He played quite well when judged in isolation but the team is lopsided with so many attackers, which is why Fellaini made a difference. Van Gaal needs to make some tough decisions about which big name forward players to leave out.

3524~~~
Would've looked better in the diamond.

3525~~~
Was pretty good today, and it was a shame he was sacrificed, but Van Gaal obviously felt we needed a bit more height and physical presence. Still think he should play as a number 10, with Di Maria, Fellaini and Carrick/Blind in a diamond, though.

3526~~~
My stream was a bit off during the first half, but this was a worrying reminder of the Mata from earlier this season. I love the guy, but I sometimes wonder where he fits in, especially how much better Di Maria looks in the middle of the park (and the fact that Rooney won't be dropped.)

3527~~~
Spot on.

3528~~~
Mata should start the home games and be locked up for the away games.

3529~~~
He did very little at home to Southampton last week despite having one or two scoring chances. You should rephraze that to - Mata should start against non top 6 sides in home games and locked up for away games

3530~~~
Yes, and you want a bit more than that from your second highest record signing.

3531~~~
Thought he was fine.

3532~~~
He's been okay at best and on average he's been invisible, he's a nice lad but it's just not good enough for us, just look at the difference between him and Silva/Fabregas, it's really baffling. I think we should get a no 10 who is really creative in the final third, Eriksen/Firmino, players like that.

3533~~~
With our system there is no number ten which would do a good job. For Mata to play well, the midfield HAS to help, and the midfield isn't, which again isn't their fault, we just don't have the numbers.

We should play with 5 midfielders, one striker and than we will see his creativity. 

How is it that NONE of our attacking players plays well, none, when we play in this set up?

3534~~~
Pretty much.

3535~~~
Was our best player on the night along with Valencia and blind, he just had a couple of misses. Mata gets criticized way too much, he was far from the worst player out there in the first half, created a great chance, but was unlucky to get subbed I felt.

3536~~~
Scary thing is, people actually believe stupid ideas like this.

3537~~~
The funny thing is, although he's performing at a decent level now, you feel that if he was sold to a team that suits his way of playing, he'd tear shit up again like the Mata we witnessed at Chelsea.

3538~~~
I would just like to ask this question. In the last 2 games, which of our players was better than him attacking wise? 

Don't say Fellaini, as we changed the way we started playing with him, but so long players follows LVG's instructions none of our players plays well, and when we actually do it's mostly because of Mata.

3539~~~
None, but that's hardly the point, everybody can see that none of our attacking players have been good enough, we had zero shots on target vs Southampton and created close to nothing vs Stoke, nobody is bringing that extra's, if Mata can only play well if it's all going well and rosy, and with the right conditions, it's not worth it. He does very little with the ball, and he has been here a year now. He's alright in terms of scoring, but even when we played 4231 or the diamond, it just wasnt good enough.

3540~~~
Yep. Some team playing 4-2-1-3 with Mata as the one, protected by good midfielders and with 2 pacey wide players and a 9 trying to get in behind and feast on his passes. Southampton maybe, if they can keep Schneiderlin (and Wanyama) with some combo of Tadic, Mane, Rodriguez, Elia, Long and Pelle as the front 3 in front of Mane.

3541~~~
You can say he plays well when everything goes well, or that he is a reason because it goes well (one of the reasons), depends how you look at it. 

As you said, none of are attacking players is playing well and look at these names. So is it really them, or something else?

When they play well is it because of the system, or despite the system (because then you have to give them even more credit).

Fact is, whoever plays, plays mostly badly, so I do think that the conclusion should be quite clear.

3542~~~
Obvious this system is shit, agree with you on that, but earlier in the season when we played the diamond, he wasnt impressinf either, even when Rooney was suspended, so dont think it's fully on to that. Since he's here, he has scored a fair amount of goals, but the chances he creates as a no 10, its just not enough.

3543~~~
Spot on. None of our attacking players seem to play well with this formation. Personally think he was the easy choice to sacrifice today, Rooney was awful on the ball, Falcao wasn't involved in the game and Di Maria was having a shocker. But i guess Mata is the easiest player to drop.

3544~~~
Oh, don't get me wrong, he isn't playing great, I can see that, but I have a feeling that he improved actually, but the system now is holding everyone back.

3545~~~
I think the same, he has been better since the Liverpool match, but I dont think its enough, based on what I've seen from him in our red shirt.

3546~~~
I actually think he's been our best outfield player in the last month or so.

3547~~~
The pass he played to Falcao was fantastic, but I felt he didn't do much other than that so I agree with the substitution for Fellaini. He even gave away the ball a couple of times. I think he was played too deep today to have much effect.

3548~~~
Aside from that lovely pass to Falcao he was pretty poor. However, he was no worse than Rooney when it came to giving the ball away. In hindsight it was a good substitution though.

3549~~~
I'm beginning to think that signing him was a mistake. He and rooney seem to have become similar players. Mata is the technically sounder player with a better passing range and rooney with more drive and goalscoring but they're both fairly static players who dont dynamically make things happen. Having both of them just seems like overkill. 

When we signed him I thought he was capable of picking up the ball and making things happen on his own unlike kagawa who seemed reliant on his surroundings completely but mata seems to be the same. Right now he's all about keeping it tidy and making one or two things happen in the final third. Not enough imo. Id play adm in his current position.

3550~~~
He was poor, except those harmless passes are something good for some of you, he's the one that is supposed to be knitting things in the attacking third, is he doing that? No. Going forward, I don't think we should keep him.

3551~~~
Mourinho was right about his lack of physicality/waste of time off the ball, though how he treated him was appalling, Gary Neville was also correct from the start.
I like the guy off the pitch, he really is a loveable bloke but we should try and recoup some of our money on him this summer.

3552~~~
Sadly I'm beginning to see mourinho's logic now. Mata doesn't run. He's certainly not compensating for it rhe way ozil did at madrid either.

3553~~~
Put yourself in our (hopefully) position next season with Champions League football. Juan Mata is a player I want in the squad every day of the week. He is still relatively young, hasn't even been at the club a year, it's way too early to be pulling the plug on a player with so much ability that we need next season.

3554~~~
Ridiculous people want to sell him.

He's playing in a static team, where the play revolves around none other than Antonio Valencia. 

Valencia had chances before to make passes like the one he made to Fellaini. But he instead did his usual try to drill the cross into the shins of the defender.

Rooney and Carrick have been worse than him in the past month. 

I don't get why when we play 3 at the back, Van Gaal insists on two strikers always. If he doesn't want to play Rooney striker. Di Maria is certainly not a striker. Then why not have Mata off the front guy. Most of his goals have come, when he is ghosting into the box. This current position doesn't allow him much.

3555~~~
I fully agree. I think he's lacking a lot of love from the fans on this board. If you look at how he's handling the ball nowdays he's the only one who comes close to being Barca-like.

3556~~~
He will back on the bench for a while now I would imagine, isn't doing enough to be the luxury player in midfield, the formation and the players around him don't suit him but I still think he will be in the summer. Changes have to be made to add some balance and pace to the side and I think he will be sacrificed.

3557~~~
good player but not right for this side.

3558~~~
I was one of the posters that was most on his back earlier this season, but in the last month or so he's really upped his game to the level I expect of him. Dare I say he's been showing his 'Chelsea form'. He's been far more involved, losing the ball a lot less, and most importantly, he's been taking risks with his passing and trying to make things happen.

One bad 45 minutes, where he was still better then Rooney/Di Maria/Carrick anyway and was the only one that created a chance (that beautiful ball for the Falcao shot) and people want him sold again? Ridiculous hyperbole.

3559~~~
LvG will never be able to play his preferred 4-3-3 with Mata as a starter, which is why I still imagine he'll end up sold in the summer.

3560~~~
Our problems with regards to how we get the best from him stems from our decision to banish Rooney from playing as striker. Imagine if we had a player like him in 2010 with Nani and Valencia flanking him behind Rooney. He is the player we though we were getting when we signed Kagawa but then we went on to sign RVP and now it's even more messed up because we now have Falcao in addition to Wayne and Robin and no one has any pace of note. I think Mata would be lethal in the United sides of 2010-12, especially the 2010 one with Fletcher and Carrick behind him.

3561~~~
I don't see the point of Mata. I just don't think he is title winning quality; not enough skill given his lack of pace and height. He came to a team that was playing rubbish and a year later he has made no impact on our scoring rate; we score at the same rate with Mata on the pitch as we did under Moyes prior to his arrival. Indeed we seem to score at a slightly higher rate when Mata is sat on the bench.

Mata 0.31 goals per 90 mins + 0.19 assists per 90 mins. Herrera 0.27 goals + 0.41 assists. Di Maria 0.26 goals + 0.53 assists. Rooney 0.46 goals + 0.23 assists.

Quite how Mata gets into the team ahead of Herrera is beyond me. Herrera even outperforms him on net goals + assists per 90 mins, nevermind tackles and interceptions.

If anyone offered us £20m, I'd happily accept.

3562~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mata-named-most-deadly-premier-8482163" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadliest free kick taker in the PL</a>

3563~~~
Fellaini should be starting instead of him... its almost too obvious at this point.

Who would have said that 1 calendar year ago

3564~~~
I also don't get the Herrera hate being shown my LVG... worrying.
To be fair to Mata though, hes been playing well lately, and earlier in the season, he was indeed warming the bench.

3565~~~
It's like playing with 10 players with Mata, he offers nothing defensively and pretty much nout offensively as well.

We got well and truly ripped off imo.

Edit- His output is decent but he should be creating so much more.

3566~~~
Fellaini looks the far more dangerous threat up top right now for sure. Big, physical presence in the box and always has a goal in him.

3567~~~
One alarming bit is how he rarely seems to take the ball on the half turn anymore. Most good #10s at the peak of their form like Silva, Kagawa of his early Dortmund days do that so frequently and once they create that space, they can deliver those killer passes. I'm not sure if he is being asked to play more like a CM than a #10 in the current formation but the number of safe passes he's been playing is quite strange.

3568~~~
Fellaini should be starting ahead Rooney. Who should not be playing in central midfield every single game.

Now that is something you <i>really</i> wouldn't have heard a year ago!

3569~~~
You'll get far more goals from Mata than you will from Fellaini.

3570~~~
Of all the stats in all of football, the one about how many goals teams do/don't score with/without individual players has to be the most useless.

3571~~~
Good player, just not the one we need.  The formation doesn't suit him and he is getting gradually worse and worse.  His three horror misses against Southampton really sum up how low he has fallen since his Chelsea days.  Let him go back to Spain/Italy perhaps a swap with Roma for Strootman.

3572~~~
You'd expect that, but I haven't seen enough of a goal threat from him at United. At Chelsea he was lethal at times.

3573~~~
That's nonsense. Just over three weeks back he put in two of his best performances since he joined us, against Newcastle and Spurs.

He was manna from heaven about 3 games ago. Now we're back to "sell him"

He's our 3rd highest top scorer. FFS thread.

3575~~~
Neither Rooney or Mata should be playing in midfield in this formation especially when we have actual midfielders who can play there instead. I like Mata but ever since we signed him we don’t seem to have a clue how to use him and he just cannot cope physically at times and disappears too often when he has to play deeper. If the future formation is 3-5-2 I don’t see how he fits into the starting 11 unless Rooney and/or Di Maria aren’t going to play and I don’t see a place for him in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 either unless we are sidelining RVP and not signing Falcao.

If he can be sold in the summer and replaced with someone who can offer some more pace and width I think it would be the best move for everyone involved, either that or we play him in his best position week in week out but I don’t see that happening. It all comes back to the same problem we have too many similar players or players who have to be shoe horned in.

3576~~~
Likewise global warming is caused by a decrease in the number of pirates in the world.

Correlation does not equal causation. It's obvious to anyone that as a team at the moment we're sacrificing goals in order to stop conceding, everyone is being affected by this change, not just Mata. I'm sure if you did the defensive stats you'd also come to the conclusion that Mata is keeping our defence together, which would be equally ridiculous.

I'd say the main stat that is potentially relevant is points per game with Mata starting in the team versus without him: Since he arrived here our average PPG with him is <b>1.81</b>. Since the start of last season without him it's <b>1.62</b>. This season without him starting it's <b>1.4</b>, with him it's <b>1.82</b>.

He's been our best attacking player over the last 10 games and the sooner we realise the system is choking the majority of our attackers the better.

3577~~~
I've probably been too harsh on the guy but there are so many games in which he is anonymous hence he is bound to get some stick due to his price tag.            I think he would shine in a 4-5-1 formation playing just behind the striker with two holding midfielders covering the defence but can't see LVG using this formation.

3578~~~
Mata hasn't been near as good for us as he was at Chelsea.

He has still been one of our best attacking players this season though and deserves to start ahead of both Falcao and RvP based on what they've done this season.

With that in mind you'd think the obvious solution would be to leave both RVP and Falcao on the bench, play Rooney as a striker and bring in another midfielder that way.

I also like how quick people are to dismiss Mata's actual output at a time when we're struggling to score at all....

3579~~~
A guy can dream, right?

3580~~~
Mata has played quite a few games now without much output. For all the talk about how many goals and assists he gets - that stat at the top doesn't look too appealing.

3581~~~
How many games is that then, two? He changed the game when he came on against Yeovil, and was MOTM a week earlier against Spurs.

Glad we're not jumping to knee-jerk conclusions or anything.

3582~~~
it's funny how the mood turns isn't it.

When he was at Chelsea people thought of him as their best player, and couldn't believe we'd ever get him.

Now, he feels like a massive luxury player, that is hard to fit in, bearing in mind we want to play Rooney and 2 strikers!

Chelsea was built to suit him, 1 striker, then Mata, and proper midfield behind him

3583~~~
Knee-jerk? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
He has played 10 games; 2nd December, 8th December, 14th, 20th, 26th, 28th, and then the 1st January, 4th, 11th and 17th, scoring twice with two assists in that time frame. That's constant game time. Out of a possible 900 minutes, he has played 778 minutes, finishing a full 90 minutes for 7 of those games, and having one with 89 minutes, and two with 44 and 45. 

Poor Juan, though. Always the scapegoat. Hugs.

3584~~~
i hate this place sometimes.

3585~~~
You might want to recheck your maths.

Mata didn't start against City, Arsenal, Leic, West Ham or Palace. We won 3 of those games, losing two. That's 9 points from 5 games. So the comparison for this season is 1.8 without him starting to 1.82 with him starting. Last season we had 37 points from 22 games (1.68 PPG) before his arrival. We got 21 points from the 14 games he started and 6 points from the 2 games (Norwich and Hull) he didn't start under Giggs. So last season we did slightly better without Mata (1.79 PPG) than when he started (1.5). We have 1.68 PPG with Mata starting since his arrival, the same as our PPG under Moyes prior to his arrival. Games he has been a sub (used and unused) or missed (not sure if he has) we have 15 points in 7 games, though too small a sample to mean much.

Points gained when a player starts a match is vulnerable to changes that occurred when he got substituted. We were losing against West Brom when Mata got substituted (-1). We were losing against Chelsea when Mata got substituted (-1). We were drawing against QPR when Mata got substituted (-2). The other side of the coin is games that changed once he arrived as a late sub. In this case he got the winner against Palace (+2) but we went from drawing against Leicester to losing (-1).

Mata has played under three United managers and several systems. He started 2 games under Giggs and one sub. It is not as though he made a huge impact on our scoring rate or results under Moyes or Giggs. I agree that LVG's systems seem to be doing us more damage than good.

Personally I am far more willing to give the benefit of the doubt to players who don't get much playing time than to those who have started the vast majority of the games over the last 12 months. Mata isn't the only star attacking player I'd happily sell. RVP would be first on my list to go.

By the way, I still think Mata is a good player, just not a title winning standard player. I wouldn't be bothered about him being a squad player. I've been slightly surprised by the number of goals he has scored though anyone who takes free-kicks should score a few.

3586~~~
Football fans really are idiots.

3587~~~
What's the hate with Mata today all about?

Did we play?

3588~~~
Idiots

3589~~~
And of those games, how many of his teammates racked up mad Fantasy league points with their performances? And how many of our good performances featured Mata in a staring role? And in an underperforming team, struggling for goals, is creating 4 in 7 really a bad record? And if it is, considering it's probably his worst return of the year (and we haven't even reached the anniversary of his debut yet) isn't that pretty respectable for someone in a slump?

I remember Cantona performing like plastic cat poo for ages after his famous Liverpool return. He didn't score from open play for 9 games in fact. In probably his greatest ever season too! Imagine what the Caf would've been like if it was around then? You'd have been listing a fair bunch of dates to reach that 4 in 7 disappointment threshold. And Eric played in a free scoring, well balanced side.

Look, I'm not saying he's PFA material or anything. He's clearly not been as good as he was at Chelsea so far, but he's also clearly been a satisfactory signing at the very, very least. In fact he's easily been the most influential of all our new signings, even if you just compare their first 6 months. So why the mentalism? Well, no one gave a shit about Kagawa's ghost-like existence in Fergie's last year. There was a lot more patience and optimism. Probably because we were comfortably successful. Yet after replacing him with a better player, who's scored 8 more goals in less than half the time (and 7 less than in his entire Chelsea career in almost 50 less games) we've got people calling for him to be sold...WHAT!?

So yes, it's knee-jerk. It's Post Fergmatic Stress Disorder. The marquee players we'd be worshiping in a settled team are suddenly failures for not winning tough games single handed (despite the fact Mata's done this at least 3 times this season)... We know Mata isn't the reason for our poor performances, because most of our good performances have prominently featured Mata. And we also know that <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/juan-mata-2014-2015-performances.394002/page-80">10 pages</a> ago he was the answer to our prayers, and that he will be again in 10 pages time, before inevitably being the luxury wrench in our spluttering engine a fortnight later.

That's football. But even in the insta-instant, multi-broadcast, tweety-vine world, we can surely wait more than 2 half seasons, let alone 2 consecutive games before brining the Wolverine claws out?

Aaaanyway. Here's an official club video celebrating the little munchin's first year at the club. If you don't wanna ruffle his hair and rub his belly, you have no soul.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/United-Uncovered/News/2015/Jan/Issue-102/video-watch-juan-mata-documentary-celebrating-his-first-year-at-united.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...ary-celebrating-his-first-year-at-united.aspx</a>

3590~~~
He was probably the best player in the league over the two seasons before we bought him, when at Chelsea with the team built to suit him. You don't take a player like that, who's that good when the formation suits him, and just feck him in the middle of random lineups, formations, under performing players and managers, and expect him to still be a world beater.

Who knows, maybe, just maybe, if we actually played in a way that suits his style, like that, he'd be one of the best players in the league again, but maybe that's just me being crazy, because van Gaal probably won't do that.

3591~~~
No he hasn't, for near £40million you want more, much more from him. We all know he is a quality player but he can do a lot better,  he isn't exactly pulling his weight around and goes missing in a lot of games.

3592~~~
I'd say over the last shitty year since he joined he's been one of our best performers, overall. I don't think that's bad for a player coming into a struggling team and not playing in the position he's best in for large portions of that. So far he's definitely been 'satisfactory', what we want him to be from this point (or at least next season) onwards is a great signing.

You can't judge someone on their price tag based on their first year. Just look at Fellaini right now compared to his first season.

3593~~~
This is how I feel reading this thread as well. Look at how much people were over-reacting when Fellaini was having a bad season. Mata is quality; I hope he stays with us one more season.

3594~~~
Yeah you're right about him not playing in his best position often but do you think he's better than Rooney in the no10 role?, Also can you see a place for him in the starting 11 over the next 12 months, assuming we inject another £100million or so into our squad?

3595~~~
If we buy properly and stop buying players we don't need, then yes, absolutely. If we continue to buy players we don't need and overloading the team with defenders and strikers, probably not.

is he better than Rooney in the 10? Hard to say, they're different players there. I could bet you money that if you put him in the 10 role and Rooney in front of him, and stopped this RvP and Falcao up front with Rooney in midfield nonsense, we'd be better, and so would him and Rooney.

3596~~~
By what measure is he not? Even if we ignore everything about his performances and pretend he's been an invisible jellyfish for 12 months worth of matches (which a lot of posters in here seem to be doing anyway) his goals alone have been a satisfactory return for his services. He's only been here a year, and we didn't pay £40m for two half seasons of struggling transition. I said he's been satisfactory, not brilliant, which he clearly has. If your definition of satisfactory is lower than Mata's first year return, then I can't imagine what your definition of good is, let alone great. Which signings lived up to these first year standards of yours? How many of Fergie's swoops pulled their weight to your satisfaction?

3597~~~
He's certainly more deserving of a place than either Falcao or RvP. Any talent we bring in up front would be more likely to replace them I'd have thought....

3598~~~
Tevez, Carrick, Ruud, RVP, Hernandez and Jones are some recent stand outs, there are more further back which I can't think of right now.

3599~~~
I'd say that Mata has had as good an individual first year here as Tevez did. I think people romanticize the Tevez-Rooney-Ronaldo attack a bit tbh.

3600~~~
Without a doubt. On his day he's a world class attacking midfielder, he just joined United at a time where there has been a feck load of uncertainties about us. Even so, he's probably been one of our best players over the last year, nothing great but not bad either. Yes, he goes invisible at times, but he started improving that these last few months by playing deeper and getting more involved in games. He's shown his class (albeit inconsistently) on plenty of occasions and just needs to appear in a more settled side. All these excuses are made for so many players but then certain other players get thrown under the bus right away. 

If we do inject a lot of money in the squad, it'll mostly be in defensive positions and probably one winger with pace. No reason why he shouldn't play, as he is as talented as anyone and a brilliant passer.

3601~~~
Ruud and RVP I'll give you, they were exceptional. Hernandez was unexpectedly good, and Tevez was pretty good at slotting into an already well oiled an established team. But are these people you consider merely satisfactory to good? Cos I'd consider most of them exceptional debutants.

3602~~~
Also worth pointing out that at 26 he should still have his best years ahead of him and, unlikely most of our squad, he has no real injury issues to hamper him either.

3603~~~
He's a player I've no concerns about to be honest, and that's saying something with our current squad.

3604~~~
He's suited to being a 2nd forward in a system that plays 2 up top, say.. a 4-2-3-1, two holders behind him, and 2 fast wingers flanking him... is where I personally see him fitting best, I don't see us changing to anything approaching that considering we have sparingly few wingers (Di Maria twice the player inside).
His flaws are the fact he's not particuarly creative for someone playing the no.10 role, he has no physical presence... at all, he doesn't really know how to make use of himself when we're not in possession, lack of speed and so on.

In our current system he's a tidy passer (when our midfield is dominating) and brings an eye for goal, thats really about it, oh and he's a good injury record,
Depending on how LvG sees us progressing next year with further signings will dictate if he's still here next year, personally wouldn't mind recouping some of our money on him and going for a fast/creative type who can beat a man instead. (oddly enough what Neville was saying we should do when we purchased him.) but thats just me.

3605~~~
Some man love is brewing amongst the ranks.

3606~~~
I've been very critical of him but he's been our best player over the last couple of games.

3607~~~
The state of this thread. I swear some of you must be blind.

3608~~~
Consider me soulless. 

 The point about Cantona can't really apply here, Mata doesn't have the luxury of playing under Sir Alex, he doesn't have the luxury of being in an already free flowing side, he doesn't have the luxury of being a side already at the top - not a side going through huge changes in personnel both on and off the field, with other rich clubs leaving us behind. 

It's partly the reason I'm so hostile towards Mata; we need players to be consistently performing, and for me the role he plays is the most instrumental for attacks, so I do have a high expectancy. I take on board your point about others doing feck all in that time period, but, bar De Gea, there's only two players I expect to be playing to a higher standard; Rooney and Di Maria. Rooney has had patches where he has looked brilliant this season, but since playing in CM has nullified a bit, and Di Maria has just returned from injury and is playing in a position that he has no ability to play as. Mata needs to step it up in their stead. The defence of Mata being Chelsea's PFA player is another one that irks me a bit. He was very good, pretty fecking good, so why are we accepting his current standard? Do we just wait it out, a player we spent a whole lot of money on, who isn't the most flexible tactical, keep him in the side even if he's only at 60% of his best level just in the hopes he can make it back? 

Also, I think in general there's just a style of football Mata plays that makes me go to his goals and assists when looking at the player. He's a very clever footballer, but he's not like his fellow Spaniards in the league, unlike Silva or Nasri he doesn't like to dribble and weave past, or control the tenacity of the game, he likes to position himself in killer positions - react to a loose ball, or be in a position to make the final pass to assist or take a shot. It's almost second-striker like, and for a player whose game is very reliant on that, I would expect goals and assist to be his main outlet. And when you consider his time here, it basically is what we look to, to prove he hasn't been half bad.

3609~~~
He's been our best player in the last month or so. Some people need to take their head out of their asses when they watch the games.

3610~~~
Definitely agreed. After that rough patch, he came back swinging and has been the one player who actually looks like he can create a chance for us.

3611~~~
----------------------------De Gea------------------------
Raf-------Smalling/Jones------------Rojo----------Shaw
--------------Carrick------Herrera/Blind-----------------
Di Maria---------------Mata----------------------Januzaj
---------------------Falcao/Rooney-----------------------

Sell RVP. Get Depay in as an alternative for Januzaj. Buy a hardnut defender like Schar and maybe a RB. Rotate Mata, Falcao and Rooney a bit. More solid, more pace, more creativity, better passing etc.

3612~~~
He's been very average this past month, his couple of good games came at the end of last year

3613~~~
Couple of good games? That's not right!

3614~~~
Spurs and Newcastle

3615~~~
He was our best player against Southampton and Yeovil too.

Why are you 'so hostile' to any of our players? Especially good ones?

Which they have.

3616~~~
Even if that were true, that doesn't mean he wasnt average.

Blind and Valencia had more motm votes on here for Southampton, Ander and Di Maria for Yeovil

3617~~~
Yes but the Caf is full of idiots, I tend not to take that as lore. As evidence by voting for the goal scorers like 14 year olds. Anyone with actual eyes could tell Mata changed that game.

3618~~~
Rather than the guy who passed sideways all afternoon and then missed the goal 3 times from decent oppertunities? Nobody scored against Southampton so they didnt just pick the goalscorers. Even if that performance against Southampton was enough to say he was our best player (which again, the man of the match ratings dont agree with at all) it doesnt mean he wasn't average. He should have scored and created almost nothing.

3619~~~
Imagine a pacy 4-2-3-1 with di Maria and Bale either side of Mata? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> With Pogba and Blind sat behind? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3620~~~
Because he hasn't been to the standard we require? It is his job to be a good player, you know.
Not in the last 10 fixtures, as I just pointed out.

3621~~~
One can only dream...

3622~~~
Clearly. That's why we won a Champions League with Tevez-Rooney-Ronaldo up front and played some of the worst football in recent memory with Mata and the current setup. People romanticize about Mourinho's brilliance too. Moyes at Everton and United: now there is a true genious.

3623~~~
Considering he scored 6 goals in our last 6 games at the end of last season, and 5 in our first 13 this, I think 'a couple of good games' is clearly underestimating it.

3624~~~
It was in reference to the past month I believe.

3625~~~
Easily the best player vs Southampton and Yoevil as well.

3626~~~
If by best player you mean having little actual impact in the game and missing chances that could have won the game, then yes he was by far the MOTM. Where are the guys that criticized Kagawa for defending poorly and disapearing?

3627~~~
Please don't bring up Kagawa, this will just start a very loooooooong debate.

3628~~~
How anyone could watch the game and criticize Mata for not having an impact is beyond me. Yeah, he missed 2 chances though, but he was the only one that even looked like scoring which is weird when you consider the names we had on the pitch.

3629~~~
Unfortunately Mata has taken many steps towards playing like Kagawa did last season. He's still scoring at a fairly good rate which is the only difference

3630~~~
I know, I know. Just can't help it some times.
We played Di Maria and Fellaini up front at one time, Rooney in midfield. Who else could provide any finishing other than RVP? Mata gets such a consistent run, he obviously will get into scoring positions. The problem is the lack of pace to his game. He favours a slow passing game, where he can switch up the tempo with long passes to the strikers. That's not the best fit for Rooney, Di Maria, Falcao, Wilson, Januzaj, Valencia, Young, Rafael, Shaw... RVP is an ok fit because he's getting older. Chelsea got much better without Mata, and I believe we could too if we could get a more agressive player for the CAM role. Or play Herrera more consistently.

3631~~~
Chelsea got better because they heavily invested in other players and Mata wasn't given the chance as first choice to build a relationship with those new players. They obviously didnt improve just because they took Mata out. And the guy who replaced him is only doing a bit better himself

3632~~~
Chelsea got better, because they bought better players, it wasn't just Mata leaving. I'm sure if he was still there he would be performing as that team has a lot of pace and movement in it, which Mata loves.

Anyway I really like Mata, but our team isn't right for him at the moment, not enough pace around him.
Also Mata and Rooney in midfield isn't right, either Rooney needs to play up top, or one of Mata/Rooney needs to be on the bench.

3633~~~
Which he is. He's been a perfectly good signing by any normal appraisal.

For which 4 of those he was our best, or amongst our best performers. And that's his worst run of his entire year here. It feels like you're dismissive of his stats because you don't think he's performing well, but when he performs well without accumulating stats, that doesn't count either. It's a bizarre, skewed way of looking at one of our own players.

3634~~~
Fellaini only came on with 10mins to go and Di Maria had already gone off by then if memory serves me right. 

The rest of your post I simply cant agree with. The only player who actually looks like he prefers to play at a higher tempo is Di Maria. The likes of Rooney, and Januzaj dwell on the ball far too long to be classified as people that play at a higher tempo. Mata actually plays it faster than them which is why I actually want to see him, Di Maria and Herrera play together so that we can up the tempo.  I'm just leaving out the 4 defensive options and Wilson. Falcao could do with a higher tempo I agree, but simply replacing Mata will Herrera there will achieve nothing as 1 player cannot simply raise up the tempo of the team as its painfully obvious with Di Maria.

3635~~~
How does missing chances count as being one of our best players? It's like people praising Falcao for missing sitters. Mata was bang average against Southampton like the rest of the team. Valencia was our only attacking player that stood out that day. He was as shit as everyone else against Yeovil.

He was good against Liverpool in the 2nd half, full game vs Newcastle and then the first half against Spurs.

3636~~~
Herrera can and has done so already this season. He brings quicker passing and tempo to our team. Yes, he misplaces a few more passes that Mata might not but there's an urgency to his game that Mata does not have.

3637~~~
Do you really think attacking players just stroll round the final third until, by complete chance, a sitter falls at their feet?

Of course credit is due for getting into scoring positions. Whether the chances is taken or not.

3638~~~
He was very good vs Southampton. Looked like the only one who'd make anything happen. He did miss 2 chances though, no excuse. Vs Yoevil, he came on and changed the game in the 2nd half.

3639~~~
Falcao's main duty is to score goals, though. Mata's isn't, strictly speaking.

Yeah, he missed quite a few chances against Southampton and he shouldn't be excused for that, but there were parts of the game where he looked like the only player who was capable of making something happen or creating chances. I was quite critical of him early in the season where his overall game was average and he was anonymous, but he's actually contributed a decent amount in some of our recent games.

3640~~~
Are you seriously suggesting that Juan Mata was worth every penny we paid for him?

Look at the likes of Sanchez, thats what you want when you're spending over £35 million on a player

3641~~~
He has urgency to his game, agreed, but with the way Van Gaal has us playing, simply playing him will not change anything especially as the ones around him are used to playing much slower and the system encourages that too. You can see how Di Maria struggles when he tries to up the pace as the guy he passes to either just takes 5 touches or passes it out wide killing the tempo.

3642~~~
You must be <i>seriously </i>disappointed with Di Maria, right?

3643~~~
It's not something I'd praise him for either. And he he absolutely nothing for the rest of the game. That's not my definition of a good performance.

And Mata's job is to create then? Which he never look like doing. Twist it how you want, but that's was a bog standard average performance. If that had been Tom Cleverley...

3644~~~
Yes

3645~~~
Tom Cleverley was an average, sideways passer. Mata actually was being quite dangerous in that game, taking it past players, playing some good balls.

3646~~~
That's not really true. When Herrera plays there's a notable increase in tempo more often than not. Take the Hull game for instance where we picke up after he came on.

3647~~~
Alright then.

Me too. If he'd been as productive as Mata has - in terms of goals/assists per game - I probably wouldn't be criticising him at all, mind you.

3648~~~
What good balls? The only good attacking progress came from Valencia. Mata was playing it safe as always and doing nothng with it.

3649~~~
I think he has more goals+assist than Mata though hasn't he?
EDIT: Played less minutes too. So that would make him more productive.

3650~~~
Can't recall much specifically from the game since it was a couple of weeks ago, but I do remember Mata being quite dangerous at times through the middle, causing some problems for the Southampton defence. Granted, his end product was terrible, although his productivity on the whole has been decent this season, especially since his overall game was quite poor in the early stages.

3651~~~
Di Maria had a good start, looked like he might be worth somewhere near what we paid but then got injured and we moved away from the midfield we were using, with Blind and Ander supporting him. I've been dissappointed with him since his return yes.

He still looks far more dangerous than Mata ever has though

3652~~~
You've missed my point completely. I meant that because the team was so successful and we hammered a few teams throughout the season, people seem to think that all the attack was great all that season when imo only Ronaldo was great, while Tevez and Rooney were good but nothing spectacular. Kinda like Mata has been in his year here, which was my main point all along.

3653~~~
Is that right? Presumably this season's data?

3654~~~
Well:

Di Maria has played in 14 games, scoring 3 goals and assisting 6 goals.

Mata has played in 19 games, scoring 5 goals and assisting 3 more.

3655~~~
Mata's apparent  productivity vs other attacking mids: (Based on this seasons EPL data)

I always thought Mata was very productive vs our other attacking midfield players, so I decided to check with interesting results:

Mata Productivity vs other attacking mids

Player:        Mins    Goals    Assists    Goals+Assists    G+A Per 90

Di Maria-----1204-----3 -----6      -----9             -----0.79
Mata    -----1455-----5 -----3      -----8             -----0.49
Herrera -----656  -----2 -----3      -----5             -----0.69
Rooney -----1575 ----8  -----4     -----12            -----0.69
Fellaini  -----865  -----3 -----1     -----4              -----0.42

Looks like Mata should actually be benced for Herrera, at least he can also contribute defensively.

3656~~~
Yes based on this season of course, but obv Di Maria was also more productive last season too.

3657~~~
I suspect its because he was so lacklustre up until a few months ago and now he's trying to repair the damage. He's definitely got better since then and I'm guessing his productivity increased the same way

3658~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> In Spain!

The reason I ask is I remember Mata coming very close to a goal or assist per game earlier on this season and didn't think Di Maria had been anything like as prolific. If has, then fair play to him. I'm doing him a disservice.

3659~~~
Di Maria was pratically scoring or assisting in every game when he first came into the team, his productivity dipped when he moved out wide.

3660~~~
I actually think the opposite has happened. From memory, he seemed much more productive at the beginning of this season. The biggest drop-off would be in goals. Was a regular goal-scorer last season but much less prolific this time round.

3661~~~
Just make him exchange more passes with Herrera and Di Maria in a midfield area and he'll be a feckin king of creativity.

3662~~~
Except in the last 6 EPL games he has 1 assist and 0 goals.
In the 6 before that he had 3 goals and an assist (this is when people started to talk about him as productive)
In the 6 before that again he had 1 goals and 1 assist.

3663~~~
So what if in Spain? Champions League too. Or are you one of the people who think La Liga is crap and Premier League is awesome?

3664~~~
Yeah just looking now and he got his 3 assists and 5 goals in his first 15 games this season, since 28th of December 2014 and the match with Spurs (included) he's had a run of 5 games with no goals or assists which has been the only time he's gone more than 2 games without either

3665~~~
Being the player behind 2 strikers, he really should be creating more chances and have more the 3 assists. Might be a slight lack of agility is hurting him in the teams set up as theirs nothing wrong with his passing ability.

3666~~~
Mata has been having a decent season and has chipped in with his fair share but just doesn't look like a Man Utd player long term. Di Maria in his first few games looked like he was going to become player of the season but has been extremely poor ever since. When comparing the two it's obvious that if Di Maria can maintain a high standard here then he has a bright future here. Mata will come in very handy and he can see and make a pass that no one else can on his day but in most games apart from when we are spanking other teams - he just looks off the pace despite always creating a goalscoring chance or two out of nothing in every game. I don't see him having a long term future here unfortunately but hope he proves me wrong

3667~~~
No, I'm one of those people who've watched a host of La Liga (and other big European leagues) stars fail to replicate the form they showed in their domestic league after moving to the UK.

Do you really need me to start naming names? How's about you start with former Madrid team-mates of Di Maria?

3668~~~
Mata, Di Maria, Rooney, Falcao and RVP can’t be accommodated into the same side, 3 of them is about the limit and as none are likely to be subs given their wages and stature 2 need to be moved on. Falcao and Mata look the most likely to me, Falcao we just don’t sign and Mata has a sell on value and is less likely to stay in place of Rooney or Di Maria.

LVG’s comments since he took over show he isn’t happy with the lack of pace and the lack of wingers so I think that spells the end for Mata, his performances have been up and down recently, good against Spurs and Yeovil but that’s about it, not sure if we will ever get to see the player he was at Chelsea because of a combination of his form, limitations and the fact we don’t/won’t play to his strengths.

3669~~~
Even at his peak for Chelsea, in a system that suited his strengths, Mata's output in terms of goals + assists, don't match Nani's productivity for United at his peak.

Mata 2011-12 and 2012-13 in the PL 47 goals + assists (according to transfermarket) in 60 starts + 9 sub. Nani 2010-11 and 2011-12 in the PL: 48 goals and assists in 55 starts + 7 sub

3670~~~
Well, going by this you'll need a complete overhaul of the team.

Sell everyone (except DDG), sack LVG.

3671~~~
His stats are mint, though.

3672~~~
As you and Pogue have already asserted, he was close to a goal or assit every game in his first 5 months (in fact he was involved in 50% of all our goals - way more productive than Di Maria for example) and involved in 8 in his first 13 this. So yes, I think that's perfectly acceptable for a £40m player. Especially one in an underperforming side. The fact people are losing their minds over his recent form (which has still, even by your standards, included at least 2 great performances) is precisely the point.

Worth every penny? Who knows, he's only been here a year. Satisfactory by any reasonable standard? Easily.

Comparissons with Kagawa for example, are ludicrous. Despite being more than twice as productive in less than half the time, he's even ahead of Kagawa <i>this</i> season at Dortmund.

3673~~~
That's an interesting paradox actually. Statistically, you'd have him on a decline over the last couple of months but I think those two games against Newcastle and Spurs were arguably his best in a United shirt so far. Particularly that first 45 against Spurs, the week before they rogered Chelsea. You can add to that the game changing impact he had off the bench vs Yeovil.

I've been a fairly vocal critic of the lovable wee scamp and watching those games was the first time I could really see him as the player I hoped he'd be when we signed him.

3674~~~
Read up, they're not THAT mint.

3675~~~
There are plenty of players who are scoring or creating a goal every 2 games that dont cost anywhere near £37 million

This suggests the fee was way too much for that kind of service

Also, I have by no means said that he had 2 great performances. They were just 2 performances that were above the "average" performances he's had this past month and the rest of the season, good days against decent opposition

3676~~~
That's actually a lie.
Can people check facts first before they speak.

Di Maria had 6 assist and 3 goals in his first 10 games for United. In the same 10 game period Mata had 2 goals and 1 assist.

Di Maria hasn't even been playing for a while, and Mata was at his most productive when Di Maria wasn't in the team 3 goals and 2 assists. Still at a rate lower than Di Maria prior to his injury.

3677~~~
I dunno, can they?

No he didn't.

Considering his first goal was followed immediately by 2 at Newcstle, he can't possibly have had 2, unless your cut off point was half time at St James.

But if he genuinely had 1 assist, I'll take your point. But going on that, I'm not too confident in your stat gathering abilities.

In their first 5 months though, Mata easily wins. But obviously if you want to chose arbitrary cut off points, meh. We can all do that. I chose a half season, you chose 10 games. Nananananana.

3678~~~
Completely agree. I was quite critical about him at the start of the season when he was being pretty productive, but he's shown the last couple of months how good and important he can be for us given a proper role where he can influence games. Before he was essentially a poacher for us, but recently hes been showing his creativity and ability on the ball to run games which is why we bought him. I have no doubt that he'll be even better and more consistent once the rest of our team settles and we start stretching teams more so he can actually use his skills and pick out passes. Think its pretty harsh to judge any of our new signings properly since Fergie retired because of all the question marks over our team in the last year and a half.

3679~~~
He had 3 goals and 6 assists, he got that mixed up. Either way I think he has a better rate then mata does, completely guessing though.
Just checked, mata has 5 goals and 3 assists in 1459 minutes this season, 6 goals and 4 assists in 1231 minutes last season, di maria with 4 goals and 6 assists in 1030 minutes.

3680~~~
Ill post it again just for clarification. At no point this season has Mata been more productive than Di Maria:

Mata's apparent productivity vs other attacking mids: (Based on this seasons EPL data)

I always thought Mata was very productive vs our other attacking midfield players, so I decided to check with interesting results:

Mata Productivity vs other attacking mids

Player: Mins Goals Assists Goals+Assists G+A Per 90

Di Maria-----1204-----3 -----6 -----9 -----0.79
Mata -----1455-----5 -----3 -----8 -----0.49
Herrera -----656 -----2 -----3 -----5 -----0.69
Rooney -----1575 ----8 -----4 -----12 -----0.69
Fellaini -----865 -----3 -----1 -----4 -----0.42

Looks like Mata should actually be benced for Herrera, at least he can also contribute defensively.

3681~~~
Well, then you have players like Sanchez, Fabregas, Silva, Toure and Aguero who have been much better in England than Spain. I actually cannot think of many top class players who would go from Spain to England and fail.

3682~~~
I increasingly think Mata is causing some of our problems. Stick him at number 10 in a diamond and you <i>need</i> two hard workers behind him. You just cannot have him at number 10 and ADM on the left CM positon or you'll have any old jokers waltzing past the pair of them.

Trouble is he's probably the player that keeps possession the best from our attackers, so I think LVG quite likes him. But he's a bit of an odd fit right now.

3683~~~
Yeah I got goals and assists mixed up. 6 assists and 3 goals.
He didn't score against Newcastle, Rooney got 2 and RVP 1. Mata got one assist. Infact Mata hasn't scored 2 goals in a game all season.

My stats are acurrate based on the EPL this season. They're easy to get if you play fantasy football, and the reason I know Di Maria was more productive is that I had both in my team.

3684~~~
I was comparing their first half seasons respectively. Mata's first vs Di Maria's first.

3685~~~
Is there a point in keeping possession the way Mata does though? He's supposed to be our main creative outlet and he never forces the game enough playing there. I'd rather have Herrera in that role.

3686~~~
Well <i>someone</i> needs to take a risk, that's for sure.

3687~~~
I agree, although I do like Mata and would like him in the team. Put Rooney up top and let Di Maria Mata and Herrera play behind him.
With Blind and Carrick holding, job done.

3688~~~
I see, I was going on this season (since they are both here). He was incredibally productive last season, but tbh so was Di Maria, who knows how productive he would have been for us last season given his form.

3689~~~
When you have a Carrick or Blind in the team, the answer is no.

Thats what they are there for, to keep the ball moving and safely find teammates

Mata at Chelsea and in his first season at United, was in there to create.

Now he's in there to pass for the sake of passing

3690~~~
Isn't Di Maria actually supposed to be a better player than Mata though? I mean that's presumably why we payed significantly more for him. Why wouldn't we expect him to post better stats?

Also, Mata was initially thrown in to a United team in chaos under Moyes and still managed to produce. Circumstances haven't been perfect for Di Maria by any means but they're not near as bad as they were when Mata arrived. 

Fact is Mata has been one of our best attacking players since he arrived last year. That might not be a particularly high standard given how underwhelming others have been but it's certainly enough to make selling him seem like a very stupid move.

3691~~~
I think people mistake pace as just running with the ball. Quick thinking can add pace and tempo as well. Too many players doing exactly what they were doing last season, getting the ball, standing still, looking round and passing it sideways and backwards not forwards.

3692~~~
Mata last season had the same stats as di maria this season, just the goals and assists are flipped. Either way, they both have decent outputs and definitely have the ability to do way better and I'm sure they will once the rest of the team settles. Its not like its one or the other in the team, both can benefit from the other.

3693~~~
Sounds exactly like Mata

3694~~~
Like Carrick did last season, backwards and sideways between them, why don't they try to pass it forwards for a change. They are good players, but must be the most boring players on the team.

3695~~~
Both Carrick and Blind pass the ball forwards, when its not too risky as they should do as the more risk aververse holding midfielder.
Infact Blind was the one who put Wilson through in the last game was he not?

3696~~~
They play well when they are all in the side, pinging passes round the oppositions box. It is all pass and move. The tean are playing scared at the moment and that is coming from the management.

3697~~~
You mean when he actually changed the formation?

3698~~~
TBH I think its the obsession with having 2 (or even 3) of RVP Falcao and Rooney on the pitch at them same time which is causing the problem.

If we had one of those 3 (preferably Rooney) based on form with Herrera Di Maria and Mata supporting we'd be a lot better.

3699~~~
It not the first game or time Blind has done similar, whilst playing as the defensive/holding midfielder.
He did it vs Westham and vs Westbrom too. Great passes to start attacks which lead to a goal.

3700~~~
As Blind said in his most recent interview, he's following LVG's instructions. Patiently maintaining possession is exactly what they're supposed to do, boring or not.

3701~~~
Blind and Mata both seem like very intelligent footballers too. So if anyone is following the gaffer's instructions to the letter, they are.

3702~~~
Pardon... ?

Are you serious?  With Chelsea he won two EPL titles, a FA cup which he was man of the match, Europa League title and the CL.... and during this title run he was Chelsea's Player of the Year... twice. 

Now if you do not like his style of play no worries that is your call, but to say he is not "title winning quality" is hard to support based on what he has actually done.

^ This...

Put Rooney up front and Mata in the hole.  Play a 4-2-3-1 and let's really have players earn starts and quit starting players because of their price tags.

3703~~~
Tried to stay away today but have people started blaming Mata for not doing enough in an away game again?

3704~~~
When did that happen? They finished outside of the top 4 with him. Don't rewrite history.

3705~~~
He was invisible last night. Sell the fecker.

3706~~~
Brain fart, my bad on the EL titles. The rest stands.

3707~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Safe to say I was baffled too

3708~~~
I made a mistake... my apologies.  

My main point still stands.  With Chelsea he was Player of the year twice and won a fair bit of silver ware (a CL, Europa, and FA Cup).  

That is not bad.

3709~~~

3710~~~
not worth the money spent on him.

3711~~~
He definitely is a 30mill player in today's market but he was never the player we needed or fitted into our traditional style of play. 

I still enjoy watching him play though and he is quality!

3712~~~
like i said not worth the money - he is at united and we paid 37m. no other club would or will pay 30m for him. we got done.

3713~~~
Dont know about that. I doubt Atletico would pay £25 million for him for example. I think we'd be looking at a few million under that if we sold him

3714~~~
If you go back to the start of the 13/14 season he'd be valued at like 50 million, he was amazing for his entire stay at Chelsea bar the half season he hardly played in. Since then his price has dropped, but he is very clearly a £30m player. Its just the teams that don't have a player like him couldn't really afford him and those who could don't need him really. 

We didn't get done, we paid £37m for a player who was up there with the top 3 players for the few years he's been in the premier league, buying from a premier league rival team which also increases the price.

3715~~~
Since then he's gone from being a high impact final third player, to one who just wants to pass the ball sideways. He's playing the least key passes of his career this season and that was his main asset at Chelsea. At Valencia, until the final season his main asset was making runs off the left side past the strikers and he's not doing that either.

Something interesting that I just noticed was that Mata's stats this season are very similar to his stats in his final half season at Chelsea

Averaging 46 passes and 89% accuracy this season with 1.5 key passes

At Chelsea he averaged 41 passes and 88% in his final season, but with 2.5 key passes a game.

So he's averaging 5 more passes but being a lot less creative than his worst time at Chelsea

3716~~~
Well wouldn't that be down to how he's been instructed to play? He's playing very deep, as a central midfielder for us pretty much and we have very little action going on in the final third of the pitch anyways so it's not surprising he has less key passes. We don't stretch teams and take an age to get the ball forward, and when Mata does get it in areas he can hurt teams, they've already got 10 men behind the ball and are all camped out. Play him in the right system and he'll flourish, and you can say that for many of our players. Van Gaal's style is one that doesn't take any risks with the ball, so a lot of it will be sideways passing and not trying creative things until the opposition have a defensive feck up.

3717~~~
What's his average position like? I remember he was playing pretty much right up top vs Liverpool ahead of one of our strikers.

3718~~~
You play Mata for that final third action. Thats why we bought him. He's always been good at keeping the ball so there was no need to go ultra-safe with his approach. He has had a single season in his career where he was less than 85% pass accuracy and thats obviously enough. But now he's been blunted and isnt a creative force.

Yes we lack creativity, and thats what we paid near £40 million for. In his best 2 seasons at Chelsea he averaged more key passes than David Silva, who is known as the best creator in the league at the time. Its what the team is crying out for and yet he's in the team...

3719~~~
The last 2 months he's played a lot deeper, almost as a central midfielder, while the opening 2 or 3 months he played pretty much as a poacher. Was right behind the forwards when we had the ball but then he'd push forward and the forwards would help out defensively when we lost it.

3720~~~
Yeah I think that's true. I have no problem over the price we paid for him at the time. He was top top player in the league.


It didn’t work out for us though.

3721~~~
I completely agree, the thing is I don't think it's down to him, I think he's just carrying out LvG's instructions rather then him just "losing it". We desperately lack that creativity but all Van Gaal talks about is the balance and control of games through dominating the possession. He's never really said it was a problem that we aren't being very creative. Mata has shown glimpses of that class and creativity, but for the most part, he has just been keeping possession. It could be either, but I definitely think that's down to the way he's being instructed to play.

3722~~~
So a year since I fell in love.....

So much has been made of his performances, especially this season but I think from the moment he arrived, he has been very good. Ok, he hasn't replicated his player of the season performances at Chelsea but that was always going to be a tough ask. Him being the record signing at the time, has never helped him in regards to the way some fans view his performances, some are just not happy with anything less than 10 created chances and a goal each game.

But if you sit back and look at his general play and contribution, he has been very good. Obvious room for improvement (along with every player) but it has been a pleasure watching him, he is just a different class at times. Some of the things, people wouldn't realise but those who understand the game at a good level will realise just how good some of his touches and awareness in certain areas is.

Also, being a beautiful man inside and out doesn't hurt either. It's great to have people like that at the club in the modern game when so many in his position can be real dicks.

Hugs.

3723~~~
We need a gif of that little run on his knees <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3724~~~
Loved that.  Looked like a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

3725~~~
Will probably start the game on Tuesday, didn't really do much today when he came on but that knee run <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Would like to see that type of formation that we finished the game with from the start though, with Mata, Di Maria and Januzaj behind the striker. Think it'd potentially be brilliant. Put Herrera in midfield next to Blind and Rooney up top too. Seems perfectly balanced.

3726~~~
So, after being our probably best player in last 6-7 games he is rewarded with bench.

3727~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Absolutely loved that when I saw it

3728~~~
I thought we looked more balanced as a team without him even though he has done really well for us in some games......he's a great asset still to have

3729~~~
Hardly a shock though. An indication that he hasn't played nearly as well as some make it out to be. Still, perhaps a bit unlucky to be dropped given that Falcao still starts.

Didn't miss him today mind.

3730~~~
Even if you don't think he played that good, he was still much much better than pretty much anyone who fights with him for the position so he was unfairly dropped when there are other players who are in shit form. Btw, you could imply the same logic for why he played, because during those games van Gaal rarely subbed him off once - he was playing all the time which could mean that van Gaal was happy with his performances.

3731~~~
he's been great but we lack pace, width and penetration with him in the team. Something we seemed to have a little more of than usual today

3732~~~
Like I said, he's perhaps a bit unlucky given that he's not been any worse than the rest. Thing is, he hasn't really done anything to make himself undroppable either. The last good game he had from a creative stand point was the first half against Spurs. And he was subbed off at HT against QPR. Nd we looked better today with Di Maria in there.

3733~~~
I'd play him and only one of Falcao/RvP if we were to play the midfield we played today again.

3734~~~

3745~~~
I'll give the little man's thread a bump - good performance, well taken goal. Lovely stuff.

So we'll be on to not selling him this week then? I think maybe - just maybe we can all come to the conclusion that he's worth having in our squad - whether you think he's a starter or not.

3746~~~
He's really very good.

3747~~~
This thread is too quiet. One of our best players tonight. Still racking up the numbers, too.

3748~~~
It baffles me that anybody would want to get rid of him. He's blown hot and cold at times, but the class is there for all to see.

3749~~~
Yeah, I've never really got it either - I get arguments as to why he shouldn't start, but yeah... not starting a player doesn't mean we HAVE to flog him... that's not what having a squad of players is about (though it does feel like that is the way of things on the Caf these days).

Ultimately - he's really fecking good at Football... and, in general, players who are really good at Football are worth having.

3750~~~
The question is wether it is fine for him not to be a starter, which i doubt it is.

3751~~~
Of course it is. In a regular season at United (i.e not this one) with the number of games and injuries etc. not starting every game will still mean you can play in 30+.

Besides, I'm not wedded to the idea that you have one starting XI and that's it... your squad should have a range of excellent players, that have different traits, that you can use in different games/scenarios.

3752~~~
Nah. I mean, sometimes he has games where he doesn't score a goal. And he might not be in the starting XI 100% of the time. In my book, that makes him a failure who we should sell asap. <span style="color: #ffffff">Yup.</span>

3753~~~
He's an excellent footballer who is showing his class in the last 6 weeks. Passing and composure is on a different level to a lot of our players but he's got real creativity and urgency back to his game. Players like Di Maria and Falcao will thrive with him. Januzaj too. Forward thinking like minded players.

3754~~~
I agree we should have competition on all positions, but i would like to think that we have a mostly consistent XI NeXT year like Chelsea and i just doubt he is seen as the main #10 at that time.
Could be wrong though, i would like to see Mata keep playing for us. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3755~~~
Well he's hardly been causing any problems has he? He strikes me as the ultimate team player, so I'm not too worried on that front.

3756~~~
He was good tonight and did the business. Want to see more performances like that from him.

3757~~~
Didn't deserve to get dropped for the Leicester game, proved it tonight that he should start.

3758~~~
I liked his link ups and interchanges of position with Di Maria, it was seamless.

3759~~~
My complaint with him is that he's bullied by big players, not that it's his fault.  Still very valuable and can do real damage with the right players around him.

Why is he not taking our freekicks lately, BTW?  He is a much better kicker than Rooney.

3760~~~
A very good display yet again.

A great goal too, took McNair's ball down really well, moved it quick and got in the box, it's a great number 10's goal.

3761~~~
Did well today. Mourinho seemed to not be a fan of this idea, but you wonder what our ceiling would be if we just don't sign Falcao permanently and spend everything on a goalscoring wide player and play:

------Rooney-----     (RVP, Wilson)
-------Mata-Winger  (Rooney, Di Maria, Fellaini)   
DiMaria-------------  (Januzaj)
----------Herrera---  (Signing)
-------Blind--------- (Carrick)

Is that good enough?

3762~~~
When given the freedom to play in the final third, he really is quite dangerous. I'd love to see him play this role more often than a more disciplined, deeper midfield role that he's played too often this season.

His vision is quite immaculate, and it becomes noticeable when he's in the final third playing through players to goal. His close control and balance is also very useful in the tight spaces of the final third where he can make a quick turn before releasing a through pass or take a shot on goal. This match also demonstrated his great movement and positioning inside the box for the first goal, further reinforcing the fact that he's perfectly suited to a role in the final attacking third rather than as a deeper central midfielder.

3763~~~
He needs quick players around him though, as naturally his lack of pace slows our game down a bit. Hence why Di Maria near him works well, as Di Maria turns and runs and creates the pockets for Mata to play in.

3764~~~
He has played enough games this season already and we aren't even in Europe. He will get enough games then next season as well (I am assuming we'll get Europe).

He might not be a perfect fit at times but when we are looking for a Goal / break down defences I'd much rather have him on the pitch than not.

3765~~~
Always arriving in the box right time right place.  If his finishing was better he could easily have scored several more this season.

3766~~~
Something like 20 goals and 26 assists during his best season at Chelsea? This guy will contribute a lot if we use him properly...

3767~~~
In the 12/13 season, 19 goals and 35 assists.

3768~~~
Yeah exactly, he should be used in advanced positions only. Good game from him.

Pass, move into the box, score. Most typical Mata goal I can think of.

3769~~~
Can't really think of anyone apart from De Gea and Blind who have been better than him all season on the whole. Apart from a brief spell of about 4 games he has been consistently a 7/10.

3770~~~
In all competitions, yeah. His league standing was 12 goals 12 assists, which is still pretty good.

3771~~~
Of course. He won't be as effective if his teammates aren't stretching the opposition defences.

3772~~~
He scores a lot of goals. Seems to have good instincts for a striker.  I just wanna echo what someone above said in that he should be taking our set pieces.

3773~~~
He does take free kicks from the right I believe. Not sure why van Gaal doesn't try him on corners.

3774~~~
Because then we would lose his aerial threat.

3775~~~
Agree, think he has excellent stats from free kicks.

3776~~~
Because as good as Mata is, he's no Phil Jones.

3777~~~
Didn't he take the corner Drogba scored from in Chelsea's European Cup win?

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3778~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3779~~~
Someone recently posted the table where he's the top free kick taker in the history of Premier League.

3780~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the thought of Jones taking the corner, while Mata stand in the box!

is it a foul if he jump & piggyback Fellaini to head the ball?

3781~~~
I think he'll be sold in the summer, because good as he is, he hasn't really hit the heights he did for Chelsea. And if LVG plans to move us to his preferred 1-4-3-3 then there's no way he'll be part of the set-up.

3782~~~
What does his Chelsea form have to do with his future here? We have to look at what he is producing now and what he offers us. And he is playing well and impacting games as much as anyone in our side.

In regards to 433, van Gaal has played him in a midfield role this season, not saying it's his ideal role but if we are in Europe next season, we will need around 6 or 7 options in that midfield, there is definitely room for Mata.

3783~~~
Because he was at his absolute best playing for Chelsea in that 4-2-3-1 formation, so, it might help to look at how he was used there and the conditions that made him flourish. He has good stats here, but he's not shown anything like that form. And if we prefer 4-3-3 then midfield is not the place for him, he's a big player that has to play, I don't think he'll be happy sitting on the bench. If we sell him and replace him with someone like Reus, I will absolutely have no problem with that.

3784~~~
You're missing the issue though. You are saying get rid of because he isn't as good as he was at Chelsea, whilst that is true (not all his fault) he is still a benefit to United. If we were to bring in Messi, and he only scored 40 goals a season, would we say well he isn't as good as he was at Barca, lets sell him? No, you have to look at what he is currently doing and if it's helping the team. This is just an example to make a point and in no way my view on it but lets say his performances at Chelsea were 9/10 every week, his performances at United are now a 6 or 7 out of 10. Yes, there is a drop but that 6 or 7/10 is still good enough here at the moment. He has been one of our better performers this season.

I don't want this to turn into a ratings match but just used that as an example. Of course, new arrivals will create a new outlook on every player, not just Mata. And if we were to bring in players and the squad would benefit from selling Mata, as much as I love the guy, I would be glad to move him on but at the moment, I can't see the logic behind wanting to sell him. Until we are in a position that he is no longer needed (please don't let that day come), he is a valuable asset here.

3785~~~
He did. And one year later the corner too from which Ivanovic scored the winner in the EL final

3786~~~
So why doesn't he take our corners when he is playing? You would think our coaches and all their stats would know this.

3787~~~
Because good corner takers generally turn to shite when we sign them. See, Ashley Young for example.

3788~~~
When you have phil jones..stats dont really mata.

3789~~~
I would definitely class Mata as a forward rather than a midfielder. He isn't the type to dictate play from midfield, but he will usually pop up with a goal when needed or play the final pass. Playing him as an 8 just won't work as he isn't dynamic or battling enough for that position.

I think as others have stated, if LVG does really want to play 4-3-3 he won't be around much longer.

3790~~~
I hope he remains and we play 4-2-3-1. Mata would be ridiculously productive as a #10, if we had players with pace making runs in behind.

Imagine next season a front four of Rooney, Mata, di Maria + Bale. We'd be laughing.

3791~~~
I hope we keep him and play 4-5-1, this would be sex!
------Blind-Herrera------
New-----Mata-------ADM

3792~~~
This man should be playing every game

Our best goal threat and always keeps it nice and simple

3793~~~
Him and Herrera should be in the team.

3794~~~
He needs to be inserted back into the starting lineup. He has been one of our best attacking players recently (not saying much) and was unfairly dropped. He needs to play as the number 10 behind Rooney and one of Falcao/RVP. Rooney at CM needs to stop. 

Not sure how Di Maria would fit in, maybe both Falcao and RVP would need to be dropped. But Mata deserves his place as a starter right now.

3795~~~
Aye, he's probably been our best attacking player this season. Weird not to play him.

3796~~~
couldnt agree more.  until "new" is sourced i would play rooney there to start with and Falcao up top.  If Falcao still doesnt start firing.....rooney up top and wilson in the "new position".  Away to Chelsea etc you might replace Herrera with Carrick

3797~~~
I think he has been average this season and is being left out because he is too slow and lightweight but given the performances of Falcao and RVP he is unlucky not to be playing which sums up why we look so poor going forward. He could well be on his way in the summer and I don't think it would be a great loss given his form since he signed and his limitations but I would at least like to see him given a chance playing behind Rooney with 4 from Di Maria, Januzaj, Carrick, Blind, Herrrera or Fellaini making up the midfield.

Away from home in particular I think we would be much better off with that kind of line compared to watching RVP and Falcao get in each other's way and offer virtually nothing.

3798~~~
Don't see why he would be sold. LVG has said he rates him, he's picked him in the vast majority of games and hardly has reason to get rid of him if we have more games next season.

Also, how many of our attackers have been better than Mata since he signed? If he's been one of our best then he would indeed be a loss....

3799~~~
He's definitely benefiting from the redcafe phenomenon of becoming better and better with each game he doesn't play. 

He did hit a decent run of form over Christmas though, peaking with an exceptional game against Spurs. Went off the boil since, so probbaly fair enough to give Januzaj a crack. He hasn't really taken his chance so Mata should start the next game IMO.

3800~~~
The way I see it, we've signed so many shiny new toys in the summer that Mata is now getting let off the hook despite what we expected of him when we forked out £37m for his services. Not saying he's been anywhere close to bad this season, but I'm still underwhelmed.

3801~~~
Actions speak louder than words and when the other attacking players are fit, Mata is one of first to make way so that indicates he isn’t rated that highly and has only played so much because of injuries. LVG clearly doesn’t think he is one of our best players so that puts question marks against his future.

None of our attacking players have been very good for a while but fact that is best defence for him shows he hasn’t been good enough, we didn’t need him when we bought him and we don’t need him now. He is a good player but wrong player for us, better to accept that, move on and bring in someone else unless LVG is going to start dropping 2 of Falcao/Rooney/RVP but he doesn’t seem to be interested in even dropping 1 so I can’t see that happening.

3802~~~
Which one of our attacking players has been better than Mata over the last couple of months?

3803~~~
He shouldn't have played against West Ham. He would have been bullied physically and not impacted a whole lot. However I'd bring him in for Januzaj for Burnley, and I expect LvG will do just that.

3804~~~
If we switch to 4-3-3 next season I don't see where he fits in at all, maybe in 4-2-3-1 but even then I think LvG would use him as Rooney's back up.

3805~~~
Mata has never been given a run of games in his actual position.

It's absurd how we waste one of the best #10s in the league.

3806~~~
Didn't he get like 7-8 games in a row at #10 more than once this season? He's just not the player we expected when we signed him.

3807~~~
Possibly but in a diamond which is so far off the 4231 second striker he was at Chelsea.

Why do we keep signing brilliant players and not play them properly

3808~~~
If he doesn't come back in against Burnley, I might cry.

He would have an absolute field day against them, I would back him to be involved in a few goals.

3809~~~
Hugs for you <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3810~~~
This is a really pertinent question and one I have alluded to a few times in recent days. I think the answer is because our transfer activity is not being overseen by a manager with intimate knowledge of the squad and a clear plan of what he wants. Last summer we had Van Gaal coming in at the 11th hour and doing the best that he could without really knowing what we had or what we needed in any great detail, and before that we had Moyes who should have had a bit more of an idea, but clearly didnt, or wasnt willing to make any decisions with the level of knowledge he had. 

We've had a magpie approach to our transfer activity since SAF left, buying anything shiny that catches our eye without any great consideration of where it fit into the squad, how it would be used, what implications it would have on the other players or anything else as far as I can see. Its been about muscle flexing, rather than strengthening; perception rather than building. 

That's why, regardless of how Van Gaal does this season (and even of his own transfer record in the past, which as I understand it is pretty sketchy) I think itll be fatal to go into the summer without him in charge. We cant afford to leave the buying to a manager who doesnt know us and a CEO who doesnt know football. we need someone with a strategy - almost regardless of what the strategy actually is - so we can buy players that fit into some sort of system. Or else we're going to end up buying more quality players who dont fit into any coherent shape.

3811~~~
Disappointed not to see him start today. It's not like the strikers are in undroppable form. I think he's gone in the summer sadly.

3812~~~
Most of the attention is going to the strikers all playing and Herrera being left out again but Mata is even more strange to me. He's been good whenever he's played and has pretty decent returns in goals/assists yet he gets dropped for two severely underperforming strikers. Fellaini has a case as well, I may not like how the team plays when he's in but he's turned plenty of games around this season yet still finds himself on the bench.

3813~~~
Thought he deserved to play. He should be ahead of Di Maria, imo.

3814~~~
He should be one of the first names on the team sheet. Even at his worst he still contributes and is always making himself available. From October to January he was a regular starter and did well and at the end was fantastic. Why is he out now?

3815~~~
One of the things that is most annoying me about van Gaal now. His run in the side coincided with our good run pre xmas, and hasn't stood out as being poor since September yet he still finds a place for RvP and Falcao.

3816~~~
Mata in for Falcao, Herrera in for Januzaj.

3817~~~
Quite obvious, can't see why LvG doesn't see it.

3818~~~
His kind of game tonight. The more blindingly obvious the decision, the less chance we appear to have of it actually happening.

3819~~~
Depressing not to see this guy play. Has bags of quality and doesn't deserve to be on the bench. Especially after good displays and has to make way for names, not performance levels.

3820~~~
In the diamond off the striker he works, but playing him four on one in a three is costing us thrust.

3821~~~
It seems like our more productive players in Mata and Herrera are needed on the bench instead of the pitch. Philosophy.

3822~~~

3823~~~
would fit in there

3824~~~
His problem is that he's physically feeble, which is strange because I don't remember thinking that about him when he was at Chelsea.

The likes of Silva and Cazorla both have a deceptive amount of strength and a turn of pace, which marks them apart from Mata.

I feel a bit for him though, because he's never played in the position that he was ridiculously productive in for Chelsea.

3825~~~
I don't see it as a positional issue. I think it's a tactical issue. Despite being technically sound and very tidy, he's not a possession player. Slower possession-based systems detract from his game. 

I don't know if that's what you meant by 'position' though.

3826~~~
How? His game focuses on positioning himself in killer positions to compensate for his lack of pace. He has the passing range and first touch but his inflexibility and lack of defensive abilities would nullify any chance of starting there.
<a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a>'s post also gives solid reasoning.

3827~~~
was meant more sarcastically <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3828~~~
Ah, my bad. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Sarcasm never resonates well through the net, anyways.

3829~~~
Hopefully he gets a start against preston move di Maria back to CM where he actually plays very well, move rooney to striker where he actually plays very well and play mata behind Rooney and hopefully wilson.

3830~~~
Now linked with Atletico today (not sure which paper though)

3831~~~
Very talented but unable or unwilling to do the dirty work that top teams require of all of their players.

3832~~~
2 of Mata, RvP and Falcao should leave in the summer (in Falcao's case, not be signed), IMO. 

I hope Mata stays, and we add another pacey attacker to the team, but unless we move Rooney up top, we'll never get the best out of Mata, and at 37m, it's a real (expensive) shame.

A swop for Koke will do nicely.

3833~~~
As much as I like him, we appear to be going through a spell of getting shot of players LVG doesn't rate as capable of playing out the finer details of his fabled "philosophy".

Wouldn't surprise me to see the club make a huge loss on him this summer on that basis. Happened to play his best football for us when the likes of Di Maria, van Persie and Falcao were playing like donkeys.

3834~~~
I don't get it. This lad is absolute quality. LVG is over complicating things for me, Mata should play 10 and Rooney up front on his own.

3835~~~
He's been a massive flop under 2 managers here. Jose knew what he was doing. Mata is a wonderful player but I just don't think he is cut out to play for the very biggest teams. If he goes to Barca then they'd probably use him as a super sub. If Atletico are willing to pay 20 million for him then we should snap their hands off and reinvest that money into getting a pacey winger or a top central midfielder

3836~~~
Are we already back to wanting to sell our best attacking player this season?

3837~~~
The frustrating thing is it appears he was bought without any thought to where he would play initially and in the long term.

Then last summer even more players were bought making it impossible to actually get the best out of Mata in his preferred position.

When you consider the total cost of Mata, Herrera and Fellaini it is absurd to see them sitting on the bench most weeks.

3838~~~
Best attacking player this season? Di Maria, Rooney, Herrera and arguably RVP have all been better.

3839~~~
Just wait till he scores a few and it'l all be rosy again.

3840~~~
I can't see Simeone wanting Mata, he likes grinders, Mata doesn't work nearly hard enough for his Atleti set up.

3841~~~
Rooney's been poor and in midfield most of the time, Herrera has barely played & RVP has had maybe 5 good games. Di Maria has been exceptionally hit and miss also (which is somewhat expected given new League etc). I certainly wouldn't say any have been better than Mata. 

Fellaini bizarrely enough would probably the only shout; but again he's been injured or on the bench more often than not.

3842~~~
Rooney, from deeper positions has more goals and assists. Di Maria despite being inconsistent has been by far and away our most creative player and the stats reinforce that view. Herrera hasn't played all that much but when he has, he's been everything Mata should have been. Quick incisive passing and someone who looks to create. Funnily enough, both Di Maria and Herrera have more percentage of forward passes than Mata does. On the other hand, more than half of his passes are backwards which is not ideal for your creative player. RVP has also been better and is our top scorer. Mata has a better pass completion rate than all of them but that's not too surprising given the safe nature of most of his passes. By no metric has Mata been our best attacking player. Not by watching games and not with stats either. Di Maria would win that award quite easily.

3843~~~
Yeah, it would be an odd move for a side like Simeone's.
Mata's got a relatively good reputation, so if he does leave here he may get a good move. But I still think he needs to go down a club level to be at his most effective - in a team that can afford to be built around him.

3844~~~
Are people back to criticising him? He's been largely class every time he has been on the pitch the last couple of months and should be starting. Not his fault van Gaal has a shite selection policy. He's a class player and can be a key player for us going forward if used correctly, without compromising us defensively too.

3845~~~
I disagree with most of that but we'll just have to leave it at that.

3846~~~
I agree that he needs a Club where he is first on the team sheet, while we have Rooney that's going to happen at United

3847~~~
NOT going to happen

3848~~~
I'd have to agree with <a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a>. I don't think Mata has been anywhere close to our best attacker. He's been fine in a few games, but nothing standout, and in a lot of games I've thought he was a passenger. Doesn't take enough chances on the ball for someone of his ability.

3849~~~
Would really love to see that.

3850~~~
Selling him would be like a knife to the heart. Would make no sense in my opinion, he is our best option at number 10, he is performing well and will be crucial with the different challenges we will (hopefully) face in Europe next season. He has only been at the club for a year, I want to see him for many more.

3851~~~
I hope we sell him and bring in a proper united style number 10, one who can grab a game by the scruff off the neck and take our breath away.

3852~~~
It depends what we want really. He is a second striker just as much as rooney is. He isn't a playmaker like silva or Ozil, but he will score plenty when given the chance. I just feel his lack of physical attributes will cost him in LVGs team.

3853~~~
He impacts games as much as anyone, I know he doesn't have the physical attributes others offer but on the flip side, the don't offer what he can.

With more games, tougher games (again hopefully) we can't just say we have someone in his position, we are going to need quality in depth everywhere.

3854~~~
1 thing for sure is if he plays, he needs the team built around him. Pack the team with pace and movement and he will excel. Have we ever tried him in a 4231 with decent wingers and rooney upfront?.

3855~~~
I kind of agree with the talk of building a team around him but I wouldn't say it like that, it sounds too much like depending on him, or placing too much importance, I look at it as simply playing him in his preferred role. No reason why we can't play with a natural number 10. Obviously some games require a different system but our team and more importantly, our squad is far stronger with Mata.

3856~~~
I cant see him at United in the long term, would surprise me if he would still be here in 2 years. Nothing against him and i know he has a lot of fans on here, but it just doesnt seem to work. He was better in the last few weeks, but Rooney is his problem (unless he plays as a striker in the future). Will have the same fate as Kagawa, nothing more than wasted talent and potential for us.

3857~~~
Where is he? Doesn't seem to get a look in recently.

3858~~~
It's ridiculous. He's been one of our best players this season and deserves to start every game, while Falcao, and to an extent RvP, are playing on name rather than merit.

Also, what is up with the short-term memory on here? I thought people had dropped this sell him nonsense when he was our best player for a consistent run of games around the turn of the year? There are at least 15 players we should be selling before Mata.

3859~~~
I'd like to see a 4231 with Mata as the 10 and Rooney up top, easily changing to a 4411. He'd be a better striking option too than Falcao and RVP at the moment, more goals too!

3860~~~
Yeah agree with that. 4-4-1-1 with Mata and Rooney up the top, Young and Di Maria wide and Blind and Herrera midfield. Fellaini can come on for Mata if we need to go long towards the end.

3861~~~
I've not really been THAT impressed with him this season, he's had some brilliant performances like Spurs away but all in all I'd call him productive more than I'd call him very good so far. He still deserves to start ahead of Falcao and would give us more balance, going forward if we're planning on moving to 433 there'll be no space for him in the team for him unfortunately unless we could shift him wide in the front trio an ask him to perform a role similar to Iniesta at Barcelona back when he played there - he doesn't have anywhere near his passing range and his qualities are different so it'd be a big task.

I think we will sell him in the Summer, he just doesn't fit van Gaal's philosophy. He'll go on to perform very well for his new club because he's most certainly a quality player.

3862~~~
i think he does. He doesnt take too many risk passes and keeps posession most of the time. His problems are Rooney and RvP/Falcao. Rooney is the better 10 and captain, undroppable. Van Gaal is happy with Mata, but he is limited in his position and we have great players already there.

3863~~~
If the team was built around him he'd be incredible - but there are loads of players who would excel as a pure number 10 allowed to do their thing whilst all the other midfielders and forwards do all the stuff Mata is useless at. Not just defensively, but making runs in behind, running at defenders, getting from box-to-box quickly during a counter attack either with or without the ball, winning headers, pressurizing the opposition when in possession. If Mata could do just one or two of these things to better standard he would be so much more useful. I's hard to find quality players for the other positions to allow for a pure number 10 - you need players who are excellent in their own positions and who can also make up for some of the number 10s deficiencies. Even Oscar at Chelsea gets dropped for a few big games a season, even though he's much more "multi-functional" than Mata, because it's too big of a luxury to have that kind of player sometimes.

3864~~~
Yeah, I completely agree. If you set the whole team around him, he's one of the best players in the league. But managers like van Gaal and Mourinho are very much 'the sum is stronger than individual parts' kind of managers. And as we move closer and closer to van Gaal finding a formation he seeks to consistently play with, Mata sees less and less game time.

I also think thats why Rooney has been so oftently deployed as the #10/second-striker, because so much as well as consistently get the side goals and assist

3865~~~
Good summary!

3866~~~
yip !! Me to this

3867~~~
Far too obvious for LVG, he is looking for a more obscure answer that will make him look like a genious.

3868~~~
+10.
Mata is the player with the best touch in our squad.

3869~~~
That is very, very debatable.

3870~~~
He's a ghost half the time, unless he has a midfield dominating the center of the pitch behind him he's liable to just float out of the game entirely.
I really, deeply do not rate him, Mourinho knew exactly what he was doing, and tricked us all, personally if we're playing a no.10 i'd pick Herrera over him, at least he has an eye for a pass, offers running and movement in spades and if things aren't going our way he'll get stuck in.
That's just my opinion.

3871~~~
Mata should be a nailed on starter in my opinion. He's arguably our most technically gifted player IMO which is needed when he occupies the tight spaces as a number 10. If we had a foward line of lets just say. Di Maria---Rooney---Winger with Mata in behind with 2 Mobile midfielders in support. Lets say a create player and a box to box I think we would achieve this "balance" LVG is looking for.  He's too good to be benched 3 games in a row.

3872~~~
He has the best technique in our squad but he hasn't done enough to warrant a first team spot. Although to be fair neither has any of the others with the exception of De Gea. But still you'd expect a lot more from Mata. I reckon his time at the club is up. He's not even getting minutes from the bench.

3873~~~
Well i meant for van Gaal (which should be obvious). I like Rooney more as a striker.

3874~~~
So, you're saying Mata does not have an eye for a pass? Really?

3875~~~
Agreed.

Who would you pick ahead of him who has actually been better for us in recent times though?

Plus he has been involved in plenty of games this season, I can't see him being sold when we're going to have even more next year.

3876~~~
When I saw someone insinuating Mata doesn't have an eye for a pass I realised this thread is fecked.

3877~~~
Yeah, possibly a bit much, but one thing I think I'd say about him is I've been pretty disappointed with him on quite a few occasions this season where I've felt he's turned and played a simple ball sideways / backwards when he had a chance to try and do something with it. Course, this could be down to the manager drilling his philosophy into them though. 
He did look like he was improving recently .. before finding himself out of the side again.

3878~~~
What the hell has happened to him? He was our best player for a month and now he's disappeared.

3879~~~
Now it is time for Januzaj to play, after that (maybe it started already with Herrera), then Mata will play again. Repeat.

3880~~~
Let me ask you this, have you found him to be particuarly creative in his time here?  amusingly we've bemoaned our lack of service to the forwards, not just this season but dating back to the last year of Sir Alex time here, so 3 managers playing multiple formations 442, 4231, 4diamond, 352 etc, Mata came in midway through Moyes time, have we seen a noticeable difference in breaking teams down with our 37million pound "no10" on the pitch? not for me.

We have a no.10 who ghosts out of games, offers minimal off the ball, is weak, and isn't particuarly creative in his no.10 role to boot, certainly not in the David Silva mould with his ideal type of ingenuity he brings to his team. It's really not too difficult to understand why Mourinho got rid is it, 37million we gave them, Mourinho must be having a right chuckle.

Edit again, thats just my opinion, I'm not a Mata fan, obviously, If we had an all-conquering midfield behind him, where he was able to get on the ball more often and offer his brand of tidy short  passing and eye for a goal we'd get more out of him.
Clearly right now, and since his arrival we aren't able to play to his strengths, and personally do not think he's good enough to possibly warrant building the side the around in order to see the best of  him.

3881~~~
Well in regards to your first point, yes he has been creative, maybe not as much as his Chelsea days but we would be far more praising of Mata's creative ability if those in front of him did their job. I don't base creativity purely around assists but for the sake of this argument, he could have 20 assists this season if the strikers finished the job more often.

Don't judge the price tag after one year at the club, judge him when he leaves and then we will see if he has been a good signing. So far he has been good, he hasn't done much wrong but because people want the best in the world, anything below the best is a waste. It's a shame many think that way because we should be enjoying what a classy player he is, like other players of ours, I don't think we give them the time they deserve.

People who bring David SIlva into the Mata argument some my case up perfectly so I don't need to go on anymore about that.

Onto your last point, any number 10 would be more effective with an 'all-conquering' midfield behind him, that's a given. So why not get that better midfield and let Mata flourish, rather than buy that midfield and then spend another huge fee on a new number 10 as well?

3882~~~
Because personally I'm not a big fan of passengers, the way he drifts out of games can be quite worrying, and yes, obviously if we did bring in a better midfield (which should be a given) it would alleviate a lot of this issue, yet some games, against some teams, be it a tough European tie vs a Barca/Bayern or even a Stoke away, where your team isn't playing well and surrendering possession (everyone has these through the long season), you want your players to dig in and do their job off the ball, and Mata for  me wont ever offer enough.

Since his arrival we haven't seen him opperating well between the lines, trying an imaginative pass to try and open a tight defence up, I just dont think thats his game, in the same way a Januzaj or a Di Maria try to slide balls though/over, they don't often come off for those two at present i'll admit, but I bring them up as two in our squad whom try to unlock tight defences, or have it in their locker.
For me Mata would be best served playing as an inside forward, playing off of a stronger targetman, rather than what we want him to be, the imaginative spark able to link the midfield with our attack.
Again thats just my opinion.

3883~~~
Mata was one of our better players at Stoke this season.

I think everyones opinion on a good performance differs, as LVG would say, <i>People see what they want to see</i>, both negative and postivie one could say,
After some games, checking the Mata thread you see as many claiming he did well as those screaming he was virtually anonymous at times.
I dont really think theres anything more for me to add, personally dont dislike him enough to carry  on and make it into some faux tirade against the guy, it's just I've just seen as much of his negative points as his positives since his arrival, is all.

3885~~~
He is the Spanish midfielder who deserves to start every game, based on his performances... But, to be fair Januzaj has done good since he started playing regularly and he's hard to drop at this time.

Very disappointing to see him dropped for 3 games, anyway. Hopefully he'll be back in the team soon.

3886~~~
I just feel if Mata is playing, we need either 2 pacey wingers with him, or play him with a fast striker. Having RVP, Rooney and Mata is just too static and slow. It worked well in pre season with Welbeck stretching the lines, but clearly we don't have that option right now. 

If we went 4-2-3-1 and had Young/Di maria wide I think that could get the best of Mata and Rooney.

3887~~~
That's true for Di Maria who seems to put our strikers through on goal every time he plays. Mata's assist stats on the other hand are a pretty good indicative of his overall level of creativity i.e nowhere near the level required of a creative #10.

In fact, Di Maria's creativity and through balls don't reflect too well on Mata and the excuses made for his lack of creativity. Di Maria seems to have no issues picking the runs of Rooney and RVP.

3888~~~
That's part of Di Maria's game, he goes long, whether it be sideways or forwards heaps. He likes hitting those types of balls, Mata doesn't really play those passes over 40-50 yards. I think Mata is a lot more 'creative' than Di Maria in the final 3rd but Di Maria can hurt the opposition more from deeper.

3889~~~
I'd disagree and agree with akash. Mata is more clinical, but Di Maria is more creative in the final third. Di Maria has put van Persie in many times with those cheeky lofted passes outside the box, I haven't seen Mata do that enough.

3890~~~
I'd agree with you, on the whole I think this Mata is a second striker that can't create is complete bollocks. Although I think Mata can play a good long ball too, he just doesn't go for it at every opportunity like Di Maria.

3891~~~
Didn't Mata get something like 28 assists for Chelsea in 12/13? Not bad for a non-creative player who doesn't have an eye for a pass....

Think their midfield was a combination of Ramires, Mikel, and Lampard that season too, wasn't it? Hardly what I'd call all-conquering.....

So yeah.

3892~~~
And Mata has sent through Faclao, RVP and Di Maria at times. I know I have talked about it a little but I really don't have much time for the term 'creative'. It's so subjective.

Both a top players that we should be playing every week but in positions that they will hurt the opposition most.

3893~~~
lets not kid ourselves....Mata has been poor to average in a disappointing United team this year - I can't think of one performance this season where I thought he was excellent - I'm shocked to read how highly some rate him on here - lets be honest - he's like Kagawa with slightly better stats

he's a 'nice' player but I'm very underwhelmed by his impact - similar players like Cazorla/Coutinho/Silva have been much much more impressive

a lot of this is down to his lack of selection and playing in a really disjointed United team....he lacks the presence to grab games for us based on his 13 months at the club

where he has played well he's done it in front of two strong midfield players and with two wide attacking players....maybe we would see the best of him as a #10 in a 4-3-3

3894~~~
12 assists in 34 league matches. Rooney has had better amounts than that.

3895~~~
I never said Rooney didn't have an eye for a pass though, or that he wasn't particularly good at creating chances. Rooney has been an excellent player, the fact that Mata was able to contribute in a comparable way at 24 only highlights how good he is really.

Not going to bother looking up the stats for Cazorla or Silva but if I remember right Mata has contributed half again as many goals/assists as Coutinho in the last year and a half. Stats aren't everything but end product is still end product. If that's Mata in poor form and Coutinho at his best....

3896~~~
It's all opinions but he has been good. However, if someone isn't playing out of their skin and having a great game, they get labelled as having a poor one. For some reason, especially among United fans, people can't accept a player having an okay game, it has to either be a 9/10 or one worthy of placing them on the transfer list.

He isn't having the direct impact as he was at Chelsea, not all his fault but I will accept that however, he makes us a better team and is our best number 10 and surely there is room for our best number 10 in our squad.

3897~~~
No one is saying Mata cannot spot a pass but I'd argue his creativity is overrated. He's no more creative than many of our attacking players. Both Herrera and Rooney are a lot less refined and nowhere near as elegant as Mata is. They're also likely to misplace more passes but they're also hell of a lot more likely to make things happen and very rarely do games pass them by. 

I've said this from the beginning. Mata's productivity in itself would never be enough to keep him in the team. He needed to stand out in a creative sense to beat off the competition and unfortunately he hasn't done that.

I wouldn't sell him though. He's still a very very good player and given the injury issues, he's still likely to start many games. I'd also like for him to given a shot out wide, preferably from the right.

3898~~~
He's wasted out wide imo. If he's going to play, it has to be as a no.10, otherwise don't bother.

3899~~~
At home (not the same debate as his home v away performances) against lesser teams he can be very productive from wide. I think it was Palace he came off the bench on the right and scored the winner. In a game where we dominate possession in the attacking 3rd, he is fine out wide. In tighter games, not so much.

3900~~~
He's spent most of his career playing out wide. I don't see it as an issue.

3901~~~
Surely you'd still admit that he has done more to deserve a spot than Falcao and RvP. 

He was by far our best non-DDG-player for a month not long ago. His reward was getting benched.

3902~~~
Falcao has been shit, so Mata was a bit unlucky there and I said as much in the thread. Not so much RVP who gets a lot of undeserved flack on this forum.

Don't agree with the last line either. He was the best player against Spurs in the first half but aside from that I'm struggling to remember what else he did that stood out. Did nothing at Stoke or Villa (where people were baffled he wasn't taken off). Taken off at half time against QPR and missed a few chances against Southampton. Was good against Newcastle before that but Rooney was our best player in that game. All in all nothing special overall and I wasn't overly surprised he was dropped.

3903~~~
I agree with the idea that some fans are either great or poor and there is no middle ground but I'm not in that group and I think it's a very small group

at the same time his performances have been very meh and whilst he is undoubtedly a nice passer there's genuinely only 1 game where I felt he made a major impact - when he came on as a sub vrs Palace and linked up well scoring the winner - he played well in the first half away to Spurs too - can you think of many more?

in terms of our midfielders I'd rate our performers as

1. Blind (solid throughout)
2. Herrera (has played pretty good in most games)
3. Fellaini (some effective performances but he has his limitations in terms of passing)
3. Carrick (good start then faded a bit)
4. Di Maria (see Carrick)
5. Mata/Rooney/Januzaj (Mata has had much more opportunities but both have been largely ineffectual when playing)

he has to play at 10 or nothing and he hasn't had great movement around him - we shouldn't have bought him as none of our managers have been able to use him

Moyes tried him on the left and it didn't work, Van Gaal has tried the same on the left side of a diamond and he is too lightweight

in our best 11 - a 4-3-3 in my opinion we'd perhaps see the best of him - doubt Van Gaal will go for it though - he sees Fellaini as more effective as a second striker

--------------------------------DDG--------------------------------
Valencia----------Smalling------------Rojo-----------------Shaw
----------------------Herrera---------Blind/Carrick----------------
Di Maria------------------------Mata------------------------Young
------------------------------Rooney-------------------------------

3904~~~
I think my problem is that as a #10, we have quite a few people who can play there. Mata, Herrera, Rooney and Januzaj.

I like Mata. I think he has a lovely touch, and his passing vision is very good. I think the reason he isn't settling into this team is because of the way we are playing. It's slow, it doesn't really progress. When we pass it forward, our strikers come meet the ball, rather than make a run.
His defensive duties are obviously a let down at times, but his attacking play is very good. I do think his lack of pace doesn't help him be dynamic either.

Herrera interests me, and I would like to see him have a few games at #10 though. From what I have seen of him, its been a very mixed bag of reviews.
He likes a forward pass, and he likes to pass into space. I like his aggressive passing. My problem with Herrera is, with aggressive passing, sometimes they get intercepted, and while he players as a 2 man midfield or whatever, losing the ball in the areas he does, can be a big problem as teams will counter it. I think this is the reason he has seen limited game time. Defensively, I don't think Herrera has been great, so I think watching him as a #10 would be interesting. I think he has better agility and movement that Mata, and his work rate, may suit him more than Mata

3905~~~
Don't agree with this at all. We can say that he's our most technically gifted player, but that shouldn't matter. Part of the reason he struggled under Mourinho - and is struggling under Van Gaal - is because he's below average when it comes to playing between the lines. He struggles to shield the ball and can't operate well when he's pressed. Add that to the fact that he struggles in tight spaces, and you have yourself a player who causes us problems. I have no problem with him being a squad player though.

Herrera has shown that he can adapt, take a look at his last two performances for instance. Mata is a very good player, but he's not the amazing player people think he is. This idea that he should be an automatic starter doesn't make sense at all. He should be benched when he doesn't produce and he <i>should</i> fight for his place like every other player at the club.

3906~~~
I don't think anyone argues with that. The confusion is the likes of Falcao, RVP and Wayne Rooney have been favoured, even after some extremely poor games. The timing of his dropping has coincided with our worst footballing performances of the season (although I don't think it's solely down to Mata not playing), so it makes people think.

3907~~~
He came on when we were going all out hoofball, it seemed pointless, can't expect him to do much with that system.

3908~~~
I would have started him with ADM and Herrera, they play well together. Mata has always stated how well he and Herrera play together, the fact they came up the Spanish youth teams together, so know how each other tick. What was the point of Fellaini out there today?

3909~~~
Needs to get starts again. He's a class player, on a completely different level to Van Persie or Falcao, feck knows why he's been on the bench when he was one of our best players in the last few months. 

Drop the strikers permanently and use him behind Rooney for good. We'll be a much better team for it.

3910~~~
Need to get back to starting him again. Ideally in a 4231 with Mata behind Rooney but that'll never happen.

3911~~~
So much this.

3912~~~
Agree with that, though there are some who think that he should be an automatic starter which doesn't make sense. Anyway, Mata should be back in the team, and I do think he should have been utilised more in recent weeks. He was anonymous against QPR - though he did create a great chance for Falcao - and he hasn't featured much since. And it's not like he's put in some great performances either, but at the same time our strikers have been awful. I really hope he can adapt and play like the #10 we need him to be.

3913~~~
We do seem to need the movement that pairing would bring. I'm hoping this summer we'll let Falcao go, sign a wide attacker and play:

-------Rooney------
--DiMaria-Mata--RW
--------Herrera----
-------Blind---------

with the option of replacing Mata with a CM (or Di Maria, with an LW coming in) in tougher games, or dropping Mata for a striker and letting Rooney be the 10 to give us another goalscorer in easier games.

3914~~~
I'd love the lineup. I'd even stick one of Januzaj or Nani on the right wing and go with that. If anything, I'd perhaps like a new striker to challenge Rooney, as I think Rooney's best days are behind him.

Anyway, that lineup with a revamped defence would be great to see (which of course means that we'll never see it..)

3915~~~
Remember when this guy arrived via a helicopter?

Poor fecker.

3916~~~
Start Mata. Build the team around him. Throughout his time he's had to consolidate whilst we try and shoe horn our other big names but he is the one who at his best gets others playing well. Guys like Di Maria, Herrera, Januzaj will bounce off from his excellent movement and creativity if we make him our playmaker. That Spurs game was an outstanding performance and no surprise everything came through him.

For a more easy retort, it's not exactly worked trying to get the three strikers in tandem, so at least give it a go. Mata is a wonderful footballer and it'll be a damn shame if he is let go without given the opportunity to showcase himself as our main man. Even Fellaini has been given that chance.

3917~~~
New blog post is out. Asks for movie favourites - love the little guy!

3918~~~
Agree with this, play with one striker and stick Mata behind that striker and build the midfield around him and watch how we will flourish.

3919~~~
He does slow our play tho, just cos he's not the quickest. Needs to therefore play somewhere with people running past him, formation wise and others players I think he could play left side of a forward 3, it'd ask a bit but Shaw could potentially overlap and provide width allowing him to drop slightly more centre. 

Be interested to see though given a full season at no10 how many goals he'd score.

3920~~~
The sudden freezing out of Mata recently is baffling to say the least. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3921~~~
I think you will find he receives the ball. see's no obvious options even for his mastery to pick a pass and hence has to hold onto it for another second, and another second then a final second before he decides he has to release it to whomever and repeat!

3922~~~
I think Mata is a top player. But his last few years have been a bit gutting for him surely. Chelseas player of the year, a dream signing for anyone. Mourinho, in effect didn't fancy Mata, off to United, and still under scrunity. He doesn't seem to have done much wrong since being arguably the best player in the league

3923~~~
We have no movement upfront so it's difficult to pass forward in this system our only option is passing down the wings, if we have runners from midfield and the wings he would have more options to pass forward.  He's a good finisher and has the knack of being in the right place at the right time, i wouldn't put it past him to get atleast 15 goals in a full season behind the striker, not to mention he was also a prolific assister at Chelsea.

3924~~~
It's not really him that slows it down per se, it's the lack of movement around him. He's not going to quickly pass it straight to nobody or into a space that nobody is moving into.

3925~~~
Well, with RVP out for 2/3 weeks, I see absolutely no reason why Mata shouldn't start the next game.

I wouldn't put it past LVG to find one though...

3926~~~
People always talk about having the team built around him, but he's not an easy player to build around.

Despite being great technically and lacking pace and strength, he's still better when the game is stretched than when the game is slower, more congested and possession based. You then have to factor in the fact that he can still go missing and offers nothing defensively, so isn't even a sure thing in the stretched games.

I think he'd have to join a weaker team/club to be the key player, to be honest. He's great in front of goal, so if he's happy to be a relatively versatile rotation option here then that'll be great.

His attributes just don't match up in a way that creates a truly great player, in my opinion.

3927~~~
Well, dont know what has that do with it. I hope Mata will start but maybe we'll see ADM in his position again.

3928~~~
Mata needs pace and movement around him to be effective. With RVP out I would like to see him behind Rooney with Di Maria and one of Valencia/Young either side, with Herrera and Carrick/Blind behind him. Though I fear we will see 2 up top with Falcao & Rooney.

3929~~~
Well you'd play Mata in an advanced role playing off Rooney as the lone striker. ADM and Young as advanced wingers and Herrera and Blind deep - or you shove Fellaini up top and have Mata behind the two of them. Either way, RVP out leaves a hole in an advanced position, which Mata should fill - and a system worked out accordingly.

3930~~~
He’s not worth building the team around him. He will flourish with great wingers stretching the play and a fast striker with great movement. That of course comes with no/little defensive contribution so it requires two strong box-to-box players behind him. As I said, too difficult and not worth it.

The Chelsea team that won CL with him also finished 6th in Premier League.

3931~~~
I suppose this argument is often used (also by me) because he’s not really a number 10 in Silva mould, a player who pulls the strings in midfield and “makes things happen”. He’s final third player, his passing and vision is good but he can only be effective when the movement from other players provides him options. He’s very direct.

I agree with the rest of your post. He’s not very adaptable, unfortunately.

3932~~~
When a player is as productive as Mata and as consistent as he is, it totally worth it to build a team around him. It's players like Di Maria you don't build your team around because they inconsistent.

3933~~~
To be fair in his second, and most prolific, season at the club they finished 3rd. That was in a team where Torres and Ba were the only senior strikers and where Lampard - Ramires was the most common midfield partnership. Hazard and Oscar had good seasons but they were nowhere near as good or productive as they later became. Ultimately it was a very weak team which Mata almost single-handedly dragged to a top-4 league finish, and one which had very little of what you describe above. Defenders aside, you could build a way better team than that Chelsea team out of our current squad.

edit - just realised than <a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> has made a lot of the same points. But I think you sort of undermine yourself with your last point in your reply to him. You say Mata relies on the movement and quality of others to provide him options (and earn him assists), but it's been demonstrated that his teammates during his best season were far from helpful in that department. Which begs the question, if he managed to get 30+ assists (and 20 goals) in a season out of that lot, what could he do if we consistently played him a #10 alongside some of the players we have at our disposal?

3934~~~
I'd go with that system, problem is I dont see LVG going that way.

3935~~~
Yeah, I see what you're saying, and I think we're saying the same thing in different ways.

Yeah, he's a final third player. A second striker, in fact. What I don't agree with is that pace around him will make a huge difference... unless the system changes drastically. If the system is possession-based and slow, he'll always struggle, because he can't hold the ball under pressure and still has a tendency to get forward too much.

But the problem is also (as Mourinho will probably testify) that even if you play in a faster, more direct system, he can't put a shift in. So, either way, you're sacrificing something whenever you play Mata. Which is why you can't build around him.

3936~~~
I'd rather build my team around a player who's shown he can flourish and create chances even when he's not playing particularly well rather than a player who offers nowhere near the same dynamism or creativity.

3937~~~
I think a lot of people are starting to see the limitations in Mata's game that made Mourinho part with him, what I find odd is the fact he played a lot of his career with Valencia on the right side, i.e. not operating through the middle, yet it doesn't seem an option for him here.

3938~~~
That's what Mata does, he provides assists and goals even when he is not at his best. The only reason people refuses to admit that is because he is not running like an headless chicken.

3939~~~
Rooney does this also, and offers more of a physical presence and defensive layer, particularly in away games. I don't really see why Mata should be the long term #10.

3940~~~
Unless we move towards a more direct system (as in - moving the ball back to front quickly, not dwelling on the ball...) he wont replicate that form, in my opinion. I agree that Ba, Hazard and Oscar were hardly pace/movement merchants. But I'd argue that Mata was as good as he was <i>because </i>Chelsea were so poor, and not in spite of them being so poor. He had a freedom to ghost in and out of games, to get forward as much as he liked (the strikers weren't scoring) and to do less defensive work.

Villas Boas' team had awful balance, and clearly the roles weren't strict enough. You then had Di Matteo, who basically played gung ho football.
Someone like Mata will always put up good numbers because he's got that striker's knack. But once the team is asked to play in a stricter fashion his limitations are revealed. He can't defend and can go missing, so a top level countering system is out of the question. And he's not a Silva-esque dictator, so top level slow possession game is out of the question.

3941~~~
Because he is younger and as productive offensively, I understand the defensive worries but that's why football is a collective sport, we need to become a team again and creates a group who compliment each others qualities and erase each others weaknesses.
Rooney also has his weaknesses, he will try to be everywhere and 50% of the time, he will be nowhere, when Mata is always dangerous offensively, yes you need someone able to cover him defensively, but you don't need someone to cover for him offensively which you will need with Rooney.

3942~~~
No really. Inconsistent Di Maria has been much more creative and influential than Mata despite LVG playing him all over the pitch and admitting he doesn't even know where to play him. Di Maria makes things happen whereas Mata is content to go with the flow.

3943~~~
He worked fine in a faster, direct system in his first two seasons at Chelsea, he was their best player both years in a team that excelled on the counter. His problem in his last season was that Mourinho is an inherently cautious manager who was intent on making an already solid defensive unit even more so rather than going out to play attacking football. A more positive manager would have kept him where he was and improved the team around him. For what it's worth, I think a Chelsea team with

-----------Costa-----
Hazard----Mata----Willian
------Matic----Fabregas----

would run away with the league, they'd probably concede more often that Mourinho's Chelsea but they'd easily make up for that going forwards. 

Incidentally, the change in tone surrounding Mourinho (and his treatment of Mata) before and after the summer transfer window has been very interesting. Beforehand he was taking a fair bit of stick because Chelsea were looking bereft of creativity having marginalised and sold their most creative player. I often wonder how it would have turned out if PSG hadn't splurged on Luiz and FFP had prevented Mourinho from bringing in Costa and Fabregas to bolster their attack. For one I expect Mata would be far more appreciated on here, the 'Mourinho knows best' factor is always pretty prevalent whenever his name is mentioned.

I agree to an extent with most of your first paragraph except for the bolded. Quite the opposite, the rest of the team was poor and Mata was the only person who was consistently making something happen. Suggesting he drifted in and out of games just isn't accurate, he was central to basically all their attacking play.

I see your point about his game suffering in a possession-based team, but I think the same would be true for a lot of great players. Like I said above I disagree with your idea that he's unsuited to counter-attack based style of play, he's proven himself very adept at that. Mourinho's insistence on high work rate from his #10 is a personal preference rather than a key tenet of that approach.

3944~~~
Not sure what you're talking about here. Chelsea only scored 4 fewer goals last season as compared to the 2012-2013 season and scored 6 more compared to the season before that. Needless to add I'm sure, that their defensive record was miles better. To summarize, no real difference on the attacking front while being a lot better at the back. Even from a creative stand point they looked fine until the last couple of months and that was down to some of their players going missing. Oscar was saving himself for the WC and disappeared for the run in which was an issue. Chelsea weren't any worse without Mata, they were better. Whether they would have done just as well with Mata in the team is purely conjecture.



He's not going to dictate the game like a Silva or Iniesta do. That's just not his game. He's also not going to be of much use defensively which on it's own is not an issue because we didn't sign him for 37m to put a defensive shift in. What he needs to is to come up with those defense splitting passes on a more regular basis. Question is, can he do that? He has 33 assists from open play in 130 odd games for Chelsea. Not bad but not entirely convincing for someone who had a team built around him and not all of those assists would be defense splitting passes. Either way he's shown little to no creativity with us which is why he finds himself on the bench. The current excuse is that there's no movement in front of him which doesn't make sense because Di Maria has no problems is playing those clever passes through to our strikers.


So, the question (as with Kagawa) is why should we build a team around someone who's shown very little in the way of actual creativity for us? Why should we build a team around someone who tends to go missing very often?

Actually, what does building the team around Mata even mean? Buy an entire new team to play around him to try and get the best out of him? If a player is coming with that sort of baggage then he's not really worth all the effort.

3945~~~
Very little actually, he was on the left for the vast majority of his Valencia career. He played on the right a handful of times

Mata's game has changed a lot since he came to England. For Valencia he was very good making runs off the ball into goalscoring positions a bit like Griezmann does now. He also had decent pace. He'd get played through, take the ball down with his good first touch and thats where his goals would come from.

At Chelsea and United he seems to have half the speed and comes to the ball a lot wanting to be the player to put the pass through, rather than the one receiving it.

3946~~~
When you refer to 4 fewer goals I assume you mean the league right? In all competitions they scored 47 less, although admittedly they had 12 fewer games to do it in. In 2012/3 they scored an average of 2.13 goals a game compared to 1.75 in 2012/3. With that in mind I think it's pretty fair to say that they were significantly worse offensively last season then they were the one before. To put it into some context, that's almost exactly the same decrease as when Moyes replaced Fergie (from 2.11 goals a game (114 in 54 games) to 1.70 (94 goals in 54 games)).

I'm not sure how you can say he's not creative. In 2012/3 he scored or assisted 55 goals in 64 games. He scored or assisted 28 in 54 games in his first season in English football. the 2013/4 season was a blip because he rarely got more than bit parts under Mourinho, but even then when he got regular game time for us he assisted/scored 10 in 15 games. He showed more in those 15 games under Moyes and Giggs than Kagawa did in a whole year under Fergie, so it's a strange comparison. He's showed plenty of creativity at United, his stats when he's playing as a #10 here have been very good, it's only been the 10 games where LvG dicked around with playing him in centre-midfield where he's struggled.

On your last point, building a team around Mata is something we could comfortably do it with the squad we have now, perhaps adding a strong box-to-box midfielder and a goal-scoring wide player in the summer (which is something most of us wanted anyway). For now a front 4 of

----------------------Rooney----------------------
Di Maria---------------Mata----------------Januzaj

with Carrick/Blind behind (partnered with Fellaini or Herrera depending on the situation) would be a great start.

3947~~~
I agree with a lot in this post even though people are deliberately trying to confuse playing the best team with building a team around Mata. Playing Mata in the hole behind Rooney would solve a lot of the issues this side is having, we would play our least shit forward in his favoured position, we would partner Herrera with Blind at the base of midfield and have genuine width in the side but without totally disregarding central penetration.

3948~~~
He's got no future here and most fans are in denial about that because he cost 37 million quid. He's an incredible little player but he's a bit of a Giovinco in that he is just too lightweight and slow paced for the very top despite being able to do things with a ball that no one else can. Small players are often the best like Messi and Maradona etc but Mata is lacking too much in pace and power to ever come close to fitting into that category

3949~~~
I disagree with pretty much everything you've said here. He can make the top, he was Chelseas best player 2 seasons ago. I simply think that we've used him very poorly, our team lacks pace and movement and a player like Mata thrives in a team that offers this. He'd be superb at a team like Liverpool/Tottenham who actually plays intelligent good football. We're not seeing the best in him because as a team we've been awful for two seasons now. He's simply too good for us at the moment in that he's a player that thrives when a team is playing well. When shit is going wrong then he's a shadow.

3950~~~
He will be good at Barca. Lovely guy but that isn't enough.

3951~~~
How dare he not be as good as Messi and Maradona <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

3952~~~
Building a team around Mata?His performance isn't anywhere near deserving that.A typical hyping up players that not playing.

3953~~~
In '12-13 Chelsea played a load of teams in the Europa League while all their games the following season were in the champions league. They also had one of the worst teams in the competition in Norddsjelland in their group and who only ended up 2 goals shy of the worst goals against record in the history of the CL. Same with the FA cup and the league cup. A lot depends on the draw you get and the teams you face. I mean Chelsea gorged themselves to 5 goals against a defensive pairing of Scott Wooton and Michael Keane when they played us.

You can't really compare their scoring records from different competitions, especially when one of them is a 2nd tier event. The league comparison either seems the fairest way to look at things even if it's not perfect.

I pointed out why I said that however you completely ignored that part of the post for some reason. I also don't understand why your including his goals when we're discussing his creative influence.

For a start, only looking at assists is not the best way to judge creativity although it does provide a good indication. The assists stat includes set pieces and 5 yard passes where all the work is done by the person receiving the ball. Mata has 33 assists from open play in 135 games at Chelsea. That's a much better indicator of how much he creates than lumping in all his set pieces and goals scored.

Di Maria is miles out in front as far as creativity goes so I won't even bring him up. Let's look at Rooney. From deeper positions, he has more assists from open play, more chances created, more key passes per game and more through balls played per game. But, really, you don't even need stats to know Mata has struggled to create. It's been quite obvious on the pitch. His passes are more often than not safe passes. More than 50% of his passes this season have gone backwards which says a lot.


But why do that? What has Mata done for us to trust him in that role? Herrera scores goals, assists goals and offers a lot more defensively. On the basis of this season I'd much rather have him in there than Mata.

3954~~~
We don't need to build the team around anyone - currently, with who is horribly out of form and how we're a bit crap, it currently makes sense to play people who are actually good at football... Mata is such a person, and shoving him in behind Rooney can literally be no worse than playing RVP or Falcao. It would also mean we can try something new (with wingers) as well as give Di Maria a little more freedom.

3955~~~
I understand your point about playing in the Europa league but even if you ignore those games their record is still way better than the next season.

I've never argued shifting Di Maria out for Mata so not sure why you've brought that up. Putting one player in his proper position doesn't necessitate marginalizing another. I'm also unsure as to why you're bringing up Rooney's record from deeper positions, I'm talking about Mata's record as a #10, not stuck in midfield like he has been for chunks of this season.

On the assists from open play issue, I have it him down for I think 37, but going on your stats - 33 in 135 is 0.24 assists a game from open play. Including set pieces his record is 55 in 135 which is 0.40 assists a game. For comparison -

Rooney - 143 in 646 (entire career stats according to his website) = 0.22 a game including set pieces.
Giggs - 162 in 632 Premier League games = 0.26 a game including set pieces.
Van Persie - 38 in 196 since 2009 = 0.19 a game from open play.
Messi - 111 in 299 games since 2009 = 0.37 a game including set pieces
Suarez - 35 in 143 since 2009 = 0.24 a game.

With that in mind, you seem to have a pretty unrealistic concept of how many assists a creative player should be getting, from open play or otherwise. Either way Mata is up there when it comes to productivity from open play. Even then the whole thing about 'defence-splitting passes' being a marker of creativity is entirely subjective, creativity is about what you create, surely. I find it especially strange questioning Mata's record for Chelsea whilst citing Herrera as being more creative. I've followed Herrera since his time at Athletic and I like him as a player but he's never been particularly productive or creative. His record last season where he played exclusively as a #10 in a good Athletic team was 4 open play assists in 33 games (0.12), even including this season he's only assisted 19 goals from open play in his last 174 games (0.11 a game). Mata's record even disregarding his contribution from set pieces is superior to every member of our squad barring Di Maria. I mentioned goals as well because the fact that he gets as many assists as he does whilst also being a prolific goalscorer is part of what makes him such a good player.

As I've said before, Mata's done plenty to prove himself to us as a #10. In the games where's he's actually played there he's been very productive and consistently been one of our best players. As #10 he's assisted 7 from open play in 21 starts in his United career (0.33) whilst also scoring 8 goals, which is a fantastic return. His problem this season isn't that he's been bad, it's that he's played less than half his minutes this season in his natural position.

3956~~~
Mata's technical ability and productivity, even when he's not playing well, are two big reasons as to why we should not even consider selling him. But building a team around him because his stats are good would be the wrong move, as Chelsea found out. For a team to be built around a #10, they have to share responsibilities, and show that they can defend, press, transition well, act as a link between the midfield attack, and create chances.

The difference between Mata of the past two seasons and the Mata of 12/13, is that he has less freedom to do what he wants. In 12/13, he didn't have to bother with the defensive side of the game, and that resulted in lackadaisical pressing. (The GIF below is the perfect example of the free role Mata was given.) If a player needs a team to be built around him to be effective, then that's a huge limitation. Even ignoring the defensive side of his game, which has undoubtedly improved, there are a few elements of his game which do not do not fit the cohesive style Van Gaal is looking to play, IMO.

His positioning is probably the worst part of his game for me. He always likes to position himself away from congested areas - his favourite position being wide right - but it doesn't balance the side and it leads to a missing link. In the QPR game, for example, we seen that. He drifts away from space, while little pressure comes from the opposing team, and he's able to open his body up and deliver a great ball to Falcao. That's when he's at his best, but how many times have we seen him central? How many times have we seen him create chances for us with great passes?


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/AQlbvoJl.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/AQlbvoJl.png"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/SAVZg35l.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/SAVZg35l.png"/>

I would understand building a team around Mata if there is any evidence to suggest that it would be the best route for the team. However, in a side that looks for balance, he's not the type of player that should have a divine right to start every game. FWIW, I like Mata and think he's a good squad option to have, but I simply don't understand building a team around him, especially when you consider that he's done nothing - for us and Chelsea - to warrant that. He's simply not a good enough player for the level of competitiveness we're looking for.

3957~~~
He should be the one that takes RVPs place in the team, but we all know it's gonna be Falcao.

3958~~~
<a class="username" data-user="67446, @MoneyMay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/67446/">@MoneyMay</a> 

Where I disagree with almost everyone is with the "why build the team around Mata" or the" Mata is a liability" or the "If you need to build a team for him then he is not that good".

The answer is very simple, Mata when played in a team who correspond to his qualities, gives you at least 15 assists and 15 goals, there is not a lot of players who do that, he also can play week in week out.
The defensive problems are not real problems for me, you have at least two solutions, you either sign an industrious striker ala Mandzukic, Lewandowski, Diego Costa and/or you sign a defensive midfielder who will play like a "water carrier", all that while considering Mata like a second striker.

The real problem I think is that some people wants to see an interchanging team where all the players defend and all the players attack. Personally I'm fine with a specialized team where 4 players attack all the time, six players cover them and the fullbacks support alternatively the attacks.
I also don't think that a good team is a team where 11 players can defend.

3959~~~
Disagree. I pointed out why looking at the league is the fairest way to judge the impact of Mata's absence or lack of impact. Regardless, Chelsea finished 3rd just like they did in the season before except they were title challengers were for the vast majority of the season and would have probably won if key players hadn't lost form at the end.

Also, that's a very skewed way of looking stats. You've basically taken two of Mata's most productive seasons and then compared it against the entire careers of everyone else. Doesn't really make sense. According to Chelsea forums, Mata has a total of 52 assists for them. 33 from open play, 19 from set pieces. Source - <a class="externalLink" href="http://forum.talkchelsea.net/topic/14112-8-oscar/page-212" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.talkchelsea.net/topic/14112-8-oscar/page-212</a>

Also, Total career stats

Rooney - 141 Assists from 543 games (Everton and United) - 0.26 assists/game
Ryan Giggs - 309 assists from 963 games - 0.32 assists/game
Juan Mata - 88 assists from 344 games (Valencia, Chelsea and United) - 0.25 assists/game. 

That's a much fairer look at the stats. More to the point, Mata has barely looked like creating anything for us this season. For a #10 his passing is too much on the safe side for my liking and I'd like to see him force the issue a lot more.

As for Herrera, like I said I'm judging him mainly based on what I'm seeing at United and I like the look of him. He's been more productive than Mata, offers more defensively and imo brings more balance to the team. Mata's problem is mainly that he doesn't create enough. And when he's not creating he offers next to nothing. Another issue with him that moneymay touched upon is that his positioning as a #10 is too high, In the Liverpool game his average position is level with our strikers for instance.

3960~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> Can't force the issue if your strikers are stood with their back to goal, 4 defenders behind them, screaming for the ball. Mata has never been the type of player to take people on and score screamers. He needs people making runs for him to play them in.

3961~~~
Again, if this was indeed the case then how does it explain Di Maria threading all those through balls to our strikers? RVP has excellent movement more often than not and Di Maria picks him out regularly.

3962~~~
In which games? I'm struggling to think of many in recent times. Likewise, Mata has also played our strikers in a number of times, but again not as much as what players of that calibre should be.

3963~~~
You brought up the Chelsea stats actually, not me. You stated that Mata's open play assist stats for Chelsea were evidence that he doesn't create enough from open play, and I proved that actually his open play figures during those seasons are very strong. If I use your figures and cut it down to just those two seasons (initially I counted the bit-parts he got under Mourinho which diluted his stats) it comes out as 0.28 assists from open play a game and 0.44 in total.

More to the point, those stats are the most pertinent to this debate because the two full seasons he played at Chelsea are the only two seasons where he consistently was played as a #10. Basically the stats suggest that if you play him as a #10 he'll make score or provide an assist in 7 out of every 10 games. The comparisons to other players weren't to prove that he was better than them, simply to make the point that claiming that

I don't have anything against Herrera, I only mentioned him because you were happy to play down Mata's productivity and creativity using stats that are way way superior to Herrera's. Herrera will certainly provide a lot more work-rate from the #10 position than Mata but if previous seasons are anything to go on he'll also contribute far less offensively. I can certainly see why you might prefer him as a #10, but the one thing you can't point at Mata is that he 'doesn't create enough'. As I've proven, played consistently as a #10 he creates loads as well as bringing an admirable goal return.

3964~~~
Actually, I can, because he's struggled with that part of the game here regardless of what he did at Chelsea. He's built up to be some kind of super creative force when the reality on the pitch is completely different. How many defense splitting passes has he actually played in his time here? The kind you'd expect your main creative player to come up with?

3965~~~
According to Squawka he created 29 chances, Di Maria 42, Rooney 33, Oscar 30, David Silva 48, Nasri 50, Hazard 71, Fabregas 67.
He played deeper than most of this players or played with less active teammates.

As for the through balls like Jean-Michel Larqué says, it is the player who makes( or don't) the run who has the power, Mata can't force through balls.

3966~~~
Annoys me to no end he isn't a guaranteed starter. Best #10 we have by a distance. In a 4-2-3-1 he'd be able to utilise Di Maria's pace and would link up well with him.

Yet we persist on playing him as an attacking midfielder in a diamond rather than the second striker #10 role he made his name as. And that's when he gets a game.

3967~~~
I was watching the Juventus game and wondered how good they'd be with him at the tip of their midfield diamond. He'd have all the freedom with a dynamic midfield behind him.

3968~~~
I suppose, despite evidence to the contrary, it's easier to pretend our strikers don't make runs and put all the blame on them rather than accepting Mata's faults.

3969~~~
But you do the same, you put all the blame on Mata but Rooney or Di Maria numbers aren't very good too and the strikers numbers aren't very good too. We tried different roles and positions for Mata, Rooney and Di Maria but nothing changed, I suspect that it's due to the only thing we didn't really tried to change, the strikers.

3970~~~
I'm not putting all the blame on him not am I saying Di Maria and Rooney have been great (Although Di Maria would have a lot more assists if RVP could finish). In fact, it's hard to blame Mata for our performances if he's not been playing as has been the case lately. I just don't think he's the solution either judging by what we've seen from him so far and nor is there a good case for building our team around him.

3971~~~
I wouldnt "build the team around him" but he would definitely be getting in my strongest XI.

3972~~~
I'd swap our team for theirs......

3973~~~
The thing with Mata is that, he is productive but simple player, you don't really need to build a team for him, but you still need to create a team with him in mind, if yo want him to produce correctly, he also needs the same type of team than Di Maria (if you play Di Maria on a wing). A team with fast transition, width and a lot of runs.

Basically I think that creating a team for Di Maria, Mata or even Herrera, will result in the same purchases, an efficient and industrious striker, a winger and a solid box to box.

3974~~~
That's where I disagree. We don't need a player who keeps it simple more often than not. That's pretty much why I prefer pretty much everyone of our attacking options over Mata. They won't get you a 90% passing rate but what they will do is force the play a lot more.

3975~~~
I haven't said that he keeps it simple, I said that he is simple to accommodate. Mata is an assister/goalscorer, that's want you from him, that's what you should except from him.

Maybe I'm wrong, but you prefer a typical playmaker ?

3976~~~
My bad but he does keep it simple or at least he has at United which is disappointing.

Definitely. But the likes of Silva's don't grow on trees so in absence of such a player I'd prefer someone who's more proactive than Mata.

3977~~~
Now, I understand your "problem" it's not Mata but the type of player that he is.
David Silva wouldn't be able to do his magic in our team, he needs movement around him, and we lack movement. 

The interesting thing is that teams press us a lot more because they know that no one is going to run behind them, which give less space and time for players like Mata, Di Maria and Rooney.

3978~~~
I agree with you anyway - and my shopping list would be the same as yours, plus the defense which means another CB and a RB. Five players is quite a lot, if I was to sacrifice one of those it may actually be the striker, I would play Rooney up top on his own and keep RVP as backup, we also have Wilson, I assume Chicharito is definitely off and three is not a huge amount. Its not a great situation and I would definitely prefer to get another striker but I think the need in the other positions is greater, especially if we finally confine the two-striker strategy to the dustbin.

Im also not quite ready to accept that RVP is completely past it, I think with the right team behind him he can actually provide decent competition for Rooney.

3979~~~
Silva's the type of player who elevates his team-mates. I don't think he'd struggle at United. He might not look <i>as </i>good without Toure (in particular), but he'd still do the business.

We definitely wouldn't be sat here wondering why he goes missing or doesn't take initiative.

3980~~~
Fully agreed.

3981~~~
I've already demonstrated that when he's played as #10 he's been very creative, both this season and last. His lack of productivity when he's been shoehorned into midfield, as he has been for the majority of his games this season, doesn't change that.

Like, <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> says above, it's pretty clear from your replies to me and to others that your issue with Mata is how he plays the #10/second striker role. That's fair enough, but if that's your angle there's no hide for this whole pretense of him not being creative enough as a #10. That's just categorically untrue, as borne at by all the stats, including the ones you yourself brought up.

3982~~~
Err..no. I meant what I typed. Mata has not been anywhere near creative enough for us. More than that, more often than not he barely even tries to create. I also said right at the start that assists is not a precise way to judge how creative a player is and you predictably ignored that. If you think Mata's creative play has been good for us then you have very low standards. All it takes is a quick look through his assists for United to know he's not been anything special.

It's not even the assists. How many times do we see someone like Silva play a clever ball through which ends up in a goal? You don't get any of that with Mata either.

3983~~~
I think the point they are making is you can't base his productivity on his time here so far because we have not been very productive compared to his past but I would argue that given the situation at Utd his assist and goal figures aren't too bad.

Play Mata at #10 with a mobile striker (Rooney/Wilson) ahead on him and two wingers either side then we would see a lot more chances created.

3984~~~
I responded to the key passes question, 48 for Silva and 29 for Mata. And I'm telling you the main differences are Aguero, Nasri and 10 games playing CM in a 3-5-2.

3985~~~
I don't think that's a valid point though. We brought him to create more chances. That's why we signed him. You can't tell me see no difference between the way Di Maria and Mata pass the ball? One is constantly looking to create and as a result has created plenty of chances despite the perceived lack of movement up top. The other goes with the flow and does very little.

Ok then.

Key passes are a shit stat though not Mata has great stats there.

3986~~~
I don't think that we bought him with a clear idea in mind, he is very similar to Rooney, and like other said when we bought him, he was a luxury purchase.

3987~~~
You could be talking about any signing we have made in the last 2 years.

3988~~~
That I can agree with. 

Still, I suppose Rooney up top and Mata in behind is worth a go.

3989~~~
Maybe, but Mata was more surprising because we really didn't need him, unless we had in mind to play Rooney elsewhere.

3990~~~
Not at all, this one was particularly perplexing.
Rojo, Blind, Herrera, Shaw were all obvious in terms of what we were bringing them in to do.
Even to an extent Di Maria - pacey attacking midfield player who brings excitement and creates

The only one which perplexed me this summer was Falcao, and of course Fellaini was a bit baffling too (although we needed midfielders)

3991~~~
Looking back now I can see how wrong I was but I was convinced at the time it was a great signing, I was completely sold on the idea of Juanji Matawa, the double act sent from heaven. What a pillock I was.

3992~~~
Youre right I was exaggerating. Rojo, Blind, Di Maria and Shaw were obvious. Herrera I thought was obvious but in retrospect isnt it a similar situation, he can play deeper if necessary but his preferred position is the same one we have Mata and Rooney already competing for, he is one of the glut of number 10s Van Gaal referred to at the start of the season.

3993~~~
Mata has been decent for us, but that's about it. I think he's out most sellable asset somewhat and if a decent offer comes in this summer, I'll have no problem with selling him. For one, I prefer my attackers to be able to carry the ball [Silva] and make things happen on their own sometimes.

3994~~~
I don't think the club brought in Herrera as a no10, remember we had been tracking him for a while. Its what LVG now thinks of him that has complicated things in that respect (in terms of his classification). I don't think no10 is his preferred position either, he only started playing there last season for Athletic, he was playing deeper before then regularly.

EDIT: Anyway don't want to derail the thread. Mata struck me as a panic buy to appease the fans, and it worked for a while.

3995~~~
Di Maria is a different case, not perplexing at all at the time but in retrospect a bit perplexing because it has become increasingly obvious Van Gaal has no idea how to use him. And that was what I was getting at, agreeing with the comment we bought players with no clear idea in mind. Maybe we bought him with a clear idea but the idea turned out to be a bad one. Or maybe Van Gaal just assumed he was more like Robben than he actually was.

3996~~~
You weren't a pillock, Mata is a great player but while most young continental coaches would use a compact line of three made of  Di Maria-Mata-Herrera we signed two coaches who don't like this kind of offensive systems. The problem would be Rafael health and the lack of striker who use all the width of the field, unless Rooney is able to do it.

3997~~~
The warning signs were there in the summer when he listed him as being a great winger we need despite the fact that he'd played the entire season in midfield for Real and was never really a great winger.

3998~~~
That 3 behind a lone striker with pace... one can only dream.

3999~~~
No Im sure we didnt buy him to be a number 10, that would be mental. Im sure we bought him to be the centre of our midfield, I guess its hard to assess him there because of the way Van Gaal has used him, but it leaves the impression that he would be more comfortable playing off a striker.

4000~~~
Looking back it does seem like Van Gaal had actually not bothered to look at a single football match not directly related to his job as Holland boss. I rubbished any suggestion that was even possible last summer.

4001~~~
What do you mean by "things on their own", because I don't think he does, in recent years the only players who did that, are Neymar, Messi, Ronaldinho, Suarez(with Liverpool) and Hazard, the others are almost totally dependent on their teammates runs or services.

4002~~~
In retrospect that is so obvious, if you compare it to Bielsa who watched all Marseille's games in the last two years, and still struggled a little a bit at the start of the season, that's not surprising that Van gaal is still trying to understand his players.

4003~~~
I've seen Silva bail out Man City of many occassions or do something out of the ordinary, Mata doesn't do that though I understand that it's his style. He's more of a final piece type than a go to type.

4004~~~
Mata bailed us at least twice this season, if I remember well.

4005~~~
To ever get the best out of him, we need to play with wide goalscorers and have a solid middle 2 behind him.

4006~~~
Can't remember that, but it's fine. I know he's your favorite player.

4007~~~
He is not even my favorite player, I'm arguing just for the sake of it. But he bailed us against Palace and Stoke(luckily).

4008~~~
I definitely do. Di Maria will look up instantly from deeper positions and aim to fire direct balls into RVP etc but the only match I can remember this being a success was in the Leicester match and the less said about that the better. We aren't retaining the ball high up the pitch in areas in behind the striker (the are where Mata should thrive) because our players are instructed to recycle the ball thus it is usually shifted back out wide when under pressure. Someone linked a document by LVG based on his 433 set up and how he views his system in another thread recently . An idea of his logic would certainly help the understanding here of how our players are expected to perform.

4009~~~
From watching the last few matches, you'd think that Di Maria can't actually pass the ball at all.

4010~~~
Because Mata is somewhat slow he needs quick players around him and in front of him, and defensive cover behind him. Therefore a 4-2-3-1 could work with the right players. Maybe something like

....Wilson
Janucaj...Mata...DM
...Blind....Herrera

And the front 4 would have to be given freedom. If Rooney is the striker than our attack suffers because Mata and Rooney can not beat a defender on the dribble and that takes away an important dimension from the middle of the attack.

LvG wouldn't do this because his system does not include freedom of movement and he would not sit Rooney. More and more it is obvious to me that if Wilson does not develop, or show serious improvement soon, we will need a new striker with pace. Imagine how much our attack would improve with a Sturridge-like player up front.

4011~~~
Not true at all. Di Maria played RVP through about twice in his debut at Burnley alone. Since then he's done it more than a few occasions with both RVP and Falcao and the latest being Rooney. He can be inconsistent with his passing but he's found that killer ball quite often this season.

4012~~~
He's definitely the player most willing to take risks and try pulling off THE pass. That's one of the biggest complains I have of Mata even though I'm a big fan of his. Just doesnt back himself enough to find the killer ball which is tragic given his passing ability.

4013~~~
Actually you said 'only looking at assists is not the best way to judge creativity although it does provide a good indication'. It's you who brought up his open play assist stats in the attempt to prove he was uncreative. If you bring up something as evidence to prove a point you can't then dismiss it out of hand when it turns out it undermines your argument.  He's not been brilliant for us but he has created chances and assisted goals when he's been played in position, despite the poor state of our team under Moyes and the dire form of our strikers under LvG.

On an unrelated point, I think it's pretty clear why Di Maria is playing risky through balls and Mata has been less ambitious in his passing this season. - LVG's instructions. Putting aside the clear problems with the 3-5-2, Van Gaal isn't particularly comfortable with having a risk-taking player like Di Maria playing in a deeper midfield position, he much prefers to have a solid midfield to control the game and have his risk-taking players further up the pitch. But Di Maria has to play, and unfortunately he's nowhere near as effective up front or in the #10 position.

It probably wouldn't be such a huge issue if we had a quality defence, or if top-4 wasn't such an overwhelming priority but as it is LVG feels that in order to stay solid with Di Maria deeper, the rest of the midfield have to play way more cautiously to balance out his attacking instincts. I think this is a key factor in explaining why we're playing the way we are at the moment, and why Mata hasn't been taking the risks that made him one of the best players n the league at Chelsea. It's probably also why we saw so little of Herrera for so long after the opening games of the season, why he's only gotten games against weaker teams and why he's looked far more disciplined on and off the ball since he's returned to the team.

4014~~~
I always find the whole Mata discussion a bit confusing. 
What is it that people actually want/expect of him? At his best, what is Mata, supposed to be bringing to the table game after game?

4015~~~
What any team would expect from an alleged top class #10?
The ability to control the tempo in the final third, as well as chip in with goals and assists. Impose himself in away games, and not just the home ties we coast in.

4016~~~
Other than the bits in bold the rest just isn't his game though.

4017~~~
Probably why we shouldn't have signed him...

4018~~~
Mata has done the same for United. The one thing Moyes did well was to play him. Mata's average has been higher than any of our attackers this season. He's one of our best players.

4019~~~
Mata is a neat technical players who needs movement around him to play that killer ball we all know he is capable of. That movement in and around the box is one of many things that are lacking in this period of time ( one can argue for seasons). People perhaps expected a more influencial impact, but statistics dont lie. Since his glamorous arrival he scored 11 goals in 35 games which is admirable for a traditional number 10. Indeed, what do people want/expect of him ? We face several issues like movement on and off the ball, build up etc and these are ingredients that cause neat players like Mata to be more inefficiënt. Again, looking at the statistics, his numbers are admirable.

4020~~~
I'd say he scores so many because he <i>isn't</i> a traditional number 10. He's a second striker, more or less. I don't think a couple of pacey wingers or better movement will turn him into a dictator of play.

4021~~~
Yeah, it's looking that way. I just think we'll be sitting here this time next year <i>still </i>wondering what the problem is. He'll always score goals though, so I'm definitely all for keeping him as an impact sub and versatile squad option.

His weaknesses and strengths are such that he's a tricky player to accommodate in the first team every week.

4022~~~
Exactly. And you're exactly right in saying that Mata doesn't do those things I mentoned, which makes me believe he will be sold.

4023~~~
Thats my opinion, we either need to play him off the lone front man, and put 2 wingers either side of him to get the best of him or we sell him, personally believe we should sell him as he lets the game drift past him far too often when the team as a unit aren't producing around him.

4024~~~
He's not one of our best players and he's been decent for United, nothing more. Stats are not everything.

4025~~~

4026~~~
Thats what, 6 games in a row he hasn't started now?

Surely his days are numbered?

4027~~~
That's actually crazy when you put it like that. I'm far from his biggest fan but he's far better than RvP and Falcao.

4028~~~
if it's 433 it's disgusting that Falcao was chosen ahead of him

4029~~~
I have said for ages I don't think he's a long term player for us but how Falcao is starting over him is a msytery.

4030~~~
Wouldn't have minded him actually playing up top, as a striker, alongside Rooney today.

4031~~~
Will see a difference when he comes on. Will change the game.

feck, who am I kidding, Fellaini will come on instead and we will see who can kick it the furthest.

4032~~~
Don't be silly, we'll also bring Mata on, and totally bypass him by hoofing it.

4033~~~
He has found himself in difficult situation. I actually predicted that he won't be a starter at the end of the season but IMO it's unfair to play Falcao ahead of him today. Maybe van Gaal wants some psychical presence from Rooney in midfield but whichever way you look at it, it's will be difficul for him.

4034~~~
Will be like the tiny kid at school playing piggy in the middle clutching at thin air as the ball sails over him.

4035~~~
He'd at least score one from those near penalty box free-kicks.

4036~~~
Wouldn't write off his United career just yet, especially considering how capricious LVG has been this season. Herrera went ages without starting too but suddenly seems to be back in favour....

4037~~~
sub him on for Falcao and play Rooney up front. Rooney is really not good in this sytem as 10, that's Mata's perfect position

4038~~~
While i am of the opinion that Mata hasn't done enough to justify a starting place i don't understand how the other attacking players are ahead of him week in week out. They've done no better. He should be getting a look in every now and then.

4039~~~
Bringing on Fellaini instead of Mata. Well at least Herrera is playing. Why not buy Andy Carroll then, eh? He is at least a striker.

4040~~~
Think he would have helped during a game like that as Sunderland pretty much parked themselves on the 18. If it was tighter and Fellaini came on instead of him, I would have been furious.

4041~~~
He should start next match behind Rooney.

4042~~~
Doesn't have a future in the first team unfortunately

4043~~~
LVG will probably eventually realise that Mata is really good and deserves to start. It's a bit unbelievable he sits on the bench while Fellaini, RvP and Falcao play. Him behind Rooney and just ahead of Herrera would be quality

4044~~~
He was only on for like 10 minutes, but he gets on the ball so much and is generally so assured with his touch. Compare that to Di Maria, who's touch is generally very loose (still a class player, just off form). Would love to see Mata start behind Rooney though, as part of a midfield trio with Herrera and Blind but at the same time ghosting in the box. He helps so much with controlling the ball, picking out the right man and his set pieces are generally on a different level to anyone else in our squad.

He has a really good understanding with Herrera as well, though they haven't played much together. Having both of them together will bring out the best of them, and of Rooney who has always been good with quick give and go type football despite what some on here will say.

4045~~~
Clearly been putting his spare time into manscaping that beard to perfection.

4046~~~

4047~~~
Hasn't lived up to the expectations of the fans and his name.  I know he isn't getting as much time on the pitch as he might have wanted but when he is given a chance he doesn't take it.  He's not been our worst player this season but you certainly expect more from Mata.  Probably the way we are playing doesn't suit him and it would be better for him to move somewhere else, like Italy (Juventus).  He's a talented player but has failed to make a big impact since he joined last January.

4048~~~
Think him being dropped was quite harsh on him tbh, others have played a lot worse and remained in the team. The bad thing for him is that he is going to struggle to get back in to this team the way Van Gaal is lining us up. Seems a really nice guy but you would imagine if we do in fact sign a midfielder and striker in Summer which LVG is hinting at, then he will be a casualty unfortunately.

4049~~~
Couldn't have summed it up better. It beggars belief the way he's being sidelined.

4050~~~
Build the team around him

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tFMp-Q84BA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4051~~~
A couple of dinosaurs behind him will do him more benefit. His defensive aspect has always been unreliable which is understandable when one would observe his physical presence or lack of it.

4052~~~
He should be playing ahead of Falcao in this setup (4-4-1-1). Maybe van Gaal thinks that Herrera-Blind duo in midfield lack psychical presence so he prefers Rooney behind the striker. Can’t argue with that really.

It’s a shame he isn’t very adaptable.

4053~~~
He's a very good player, bit when teams park the bus it's just very difficult for him. He hasnt really been able to dismantle teams, doesnt really stretch play and generally doesnt make it happen, I think it's a wise decision from LVG to add some width in the team and sadly this has been at the cost of Mata. Rooney in that role offers a bit more penetration and needed power. Dont think he's suited to possession based play but rather to a system with fast and dynamic players around him.

4054~~~

I was just about to post that, it's just more proof of their secret romance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4056~~~
Surely they're on an Adidas promo day?! nobody with that amount of money would match that well surely lol.

4057~~~
To be honest, I think having the width will benefit him immensely. Gives him more space to work with in the middle, and he keeps possession better then anybody with his always reliable passing and control. Having pace out wide will help him creativity wise as well, as we can actually stretch teams when we use wingers with pace.

As for rooney, he's better as a striker anyways, using both would benefit us more. Hopefully Van gaal puts him in behind just rooney against Newcastle.

4058~~~
Probably worth a read <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4059~~~
I miss his face on the pitch. Hopefully he starts tonight behind Rooney.

4060~~~
"Drift into irrelevance" is a bit harsh. He's out of favour atm but as we've seen with Herrera that can change if he shows form.

4061~~~
lol... dude's not half depressing in his writing... Opening paragraph:

Whuh? I recall being pleased with a 2-0 win, meself. And I didn't sense Old Trafford being weighed down from the noises emitted by the television set... Anybody on here that was there on match day that can confirm that the spoiled brats at OT were disappointed with a controlled 2-0 win?

4062~~~
The only hint of booing I heard was when Falcao was about to be subbed after winning the penalty, but that was more of "oh why sub him off when he's finally done something" than "oh this performance is rubbish".

I was not at the game though either.

4063~~~
My Brother said a lot of fans at Old Trafford were not happy on Saturday, even after getting 3 points.

4064~~~
I was disappointed ....... with yet another utterly dire and frustrating performance. And yes I am spoilt ..... not by winning trophies but by our tradition of playing scintilating attacking football that has been a real privilige to watch for many years.

4065~~~
Are you saying you booed your team at home after winning 2-0, or were you just disappointed?

We must be turning into West Ham...

4066~~~
Definitely first half there was a lot of discontent - but then we were a bit gash, and it wasn't all that controlled (if Connor Wickham wasn't about as useful as a knife shaped spoon Sunderland would well have scored)... second half things did lighten up a bit (though there was the Falcao sub booing - which was completely mental) and so I definitely don't think anyone was "disappointed" after the game - but no one was exactly bouncing off the walls either. Most of the talk outside the ground (as it has been on this forum) is how we're just a bit shit really...

4067~~~
Strange article cause I didnt know Januzaj will be part of the clear out..

4068~~~
Yeah, that's a bit of a shit article from Jim White. I'm sure nobody here would be topping themselves seeing Mata 'run the show for Monaco or Milan'.

4069~~~
In which case you must have been struggling for the last half decade or so.

4070~~~
Thanks for that, it was quite interesting but also very provocative. What i'd like to know is when did Moyes actually say that Mata was a Woodward signing that he didn't approve at the time? I googled it and found nothing but praise from Moyes towards Mata. And if i remember well, Mata had only nice words to say to the Spanish press when asked about how Moyes would do in La Liga. I also have to admit it's the first time i read that Scholes doesn't rate Mata, even as a backroom rumor. But maybe i'm misinformed in both occasions...

As for Mourinho and his tactics in which "Mata wasn’t quick enough, he didn’t tackle enough, he didn’t put in enough of a shift to tick Mourinho’s boxes". Well, neither did Sneijder yet he was pivotal in Mourinho's success at Inter. Jose wasn't exactly overjoyed when Mata was sold but it's true that he couldn't create the right conditions to take the best out of him in the #10 role. Players like Mata and Sneijder flourish when playing in the hole if their role is a dominant one, with two mobile and good defensively midfielders covering for them and allowing them to spend more time in the final third and focus more on their creative duties. Once Mourinho thought of that trick with Zanetti as the supporting midfielder next to Cambiasso, Sneijder had one of the best seasons in his career. Plus we can see that Jose tries to do something similar with Fabregas playing in a more advanced position and Ramires-Matic/Zouma behind him, so i'm not quite sure that Mata didn't fit in his plans at all. But in last season's Chelsea there was absolutely no way that Mourinho would drop Lampard and displease the "Old Guard" in favor of Mata. The fact that Woodward was willing to pay more than enough money for the player just made the decision to let him go easier.

And what's this all about LvG picking formations that don't include Mata? Both the diamond and the 3-5-2 formations did provide cover for him to stay in the final third and play the #10 role like he wants to play it. One can easily argue that LvG highly relied on rotating Rooney, RvP and Falcao up front with Mata playing behind them to get goals and assists. When that didn't work he started experimenting and trying players in different positions. Whether he will get more chances or not, right now, mainly depends on how well Blind and Herrera do. If they show more encouraging signs, like they did against Sunderland, that they can cover effectively all thirds of the pitch without leaving the defense exposed, Mata will get more games. If they don't, the manager will probably opt for a reverted triangle with Carrick at the base of it. The latter seems more logical tbh, given the fact that we have some very tough fixtures ahead of us.

4071~~~
<i>
</i>

When the feck did that happen? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4072~~~
Moyes was limited to Everton's horizons before he arrived. Dithered to aspire to those horizons when he finally arrived. And today has resorted back to those horizons by trying to re-ecast his past. if he didn't want Mata but preferred Fellaini and Baines, then it just goes to show how limited those horizons were. Good riddance, glad he's gone.

4073~~~
Love how he makes Walker look like an idiot in that vid!

4074~~~
Didn't actually know Moyes apparently said that. It would explain a few things, and also a few things about how signings are being made these days.
Wouldn't surprise me if Woodward was the main driving force in signing Mata, to be honest.
Same as Di Maria and Falcao. obviously we already know Shaw and Herrera were club-driven.

It's not even been that long and I already miss the days of knowing (at the very least) the manager actually targeted the player who was joining. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Except Bebe.

4075~~~
Maybe he's said it off the record, but as far as I'm aware, you won't be finding any quotes of him saying such things.

It may well be true though as we also appeared to have no interest in Ozil the summer prior.

4076~~~
I've never booed the team and I never will ...... West Ham?

4077~~~
Not struggling .... disappointed

4078~~~
From what I heard Mata has been put on the market by Chelsea, and Woodward asked Moyes if he wanted him, Moyes said yes and Woodward purchased him. Moyes didn't asked for him and Woodward didn't forced Moyes to accept Mata.

4079~~~
West Ham consistently booed Big Sam last season, even when they won.

4080~~~
Fellaini picked again ahead of him. This guy can't catch a break.

4081~~~
Don't see him and Herrera starting together in midfield anyways. Unless in a diamond with both Carrick and Blind.

4082~~~
He's not a man utd level player so I am never surprised when he is not in the line up

4083~~~
Ok pet, that makes sense..

4084~~~
Lord knows what that makes Fellaini. 
-
It's an away game against a pretty physical side, I don't really think there was any chance of Mata playing today.

4085~~~
He's doomed (assuming being sold off to Spain/wherever in the summer counts as doomed).

4086~~~
I cringe whenever i see him on the bench, its Chelsea all over again we should sell him for at least £16 million this summer

4087~~~
I reckon he will be sacrificed for De Bruyne this summer.

4088~~~
He is back in same situation he was in at Chelsea, when we sell it will be for a big loss though, perfect example of why you shouldn't panic buy in January.

4089~~~
He'll come on and score.

4090~~~
Such a shame but blaming Moyes and Van Gaal for what's happened is missing the point. He just hasn't cut it. Feck knows why but it does seem as though Mourinho saw it coming and he knows his shit.

4091~~~
He should be starting though, mata destroys Newcastle single handedly every time he plays against them, be it for us or for Chelsea.

4092~~~
Fellaini being picked ahead of him isn't criminal. Falcao and Van Persie continually being picked ahead of him after shit performances week-in week-out was criminal. Hope he can get his place back in the team, has a lot to offer.

4093~~~
He's the last name on the sheet at present. Everyone is ahead of him - Fellaini, Januzaj, Di Maria. Even Jones in midfield would be ahead of him. Lets be honest. He's way too handsome for LVG.

4094~~~
Um... ok...

4095~~~
In the midfield we're playing today, his competition is with Herrera and its no real surprise to see Herrera winning that one. Unless you see Van Gaal playing both Herrera and Mata in a middle 3.

4096~~~
Doomed to spend his days playing football in the sun, earning more in a week than any of us earn in a year...

Poor fecker.

4097~~~
Pure writing on the wall material if he's not starting with VP and Falcao out.

Never quite thought he was the right fit, but after his Chelsea exploits you couldn't think it wasn't a good signing

4098~~~
A little piece of my soul dies every time Van Gaal picks Fellaini over Mata.

4099~~~
It took LVG six months to realize that Herrera was a good player - wonder how long before the penny drops with Mata.

4100~~~
When Herrera was sitting on the bench, Mata was a regular. The table has turned and it will be more difficult for him to get back his starting position (not that I’m very surprised by that to be honest).

4101~~~
Unlikely to ever see them both start too many games

4102~~~
Juan, why you no press on defense?

4103~~~
Very few if any of our attackers have been better than Mata in the time since he arrived. He hasn't been amazing or anything but if nearly everyone else has been worse then you'd think they'd be dropped first....

4104~~~
Start him, bring Fellaini on if we need to not the other way around.

4105~~~
Mata not starting is baffling. Fellaini ahead of him makes no sense. He's just a big oaf.

4106~~~
It should certainly be his turn to start the next game... would just be stubbornness not too at this point

4107~~~
I'm with you mate. Just doesn't make sense. One can play proper football, the other one is just a languid guy who chests balls down

4108~~~
The really odd thing is that he's done nothing to deserve being dropped. Had a pretty decent season until LVG benched him.

4109~~~
Thing is, he finally has pace ahead of him now we're playing with two wingers and he thrives on that.

4110~~~
This is an old article but how does this not show he is actually very effective when he plays.  At least according to many people not named LvG...

4111~~~
I'm assuming it's not the point, but Hazard bring much more to the side with his direct dribbling and speed. Mata cannot, however he is more of an end-product provider which every side needs.

4112~~~
Did he get a touch at all when he came on?

4113~~~
Poor finishing against Southampton was a negative he had. Might have been another game too. But overall he wasn't that bad. He will probably be back in the team soon anyway.

4114~~~
The difference is that Mourinho had other options who you could argue were better than Mata for his system (ie. Oscar.) I don't see us having that luxury. LVG apparently likes to control possession, well Mata is greta for that. I'd say he's been a touch underwhelming since joining, but which of our recent signings hasn't (Blind perhaps?) He's still productive, and a far better player than Fellaini.

4115~~~
I'm Mata's biggest fan, but I reckon that's as good an argument as any as to why stats can be misleading.

4116~~~
Mata has lots of faults, but he is very productive.

4117~~~
Bullshit. Mourinho declared Oscar was his number 10 and Mata had to play second fiddle. 10 months later he bought Fabregas and made him his number 10. Mata and Fabregas have similar strengths and weaknesses. I guess after missing out on the title last season he realised he also needed someone like Mata and went in for Cesc.

4118~~~
I'd agree. There were times earlier in the season where Mata was nowhere near his best and largely anonymous in some games, yet his productivity was fairly impressive. Conversely, he's also had games where he didn't get any goals/assists, but played well and had an impact.

4119~~~
I think he will be gone in the summer tbh.Seems to have got Rafael-esque treatment recently (i.e eventually phasing out from the squad).

4120~~~
Fabregas is a playmaker who is more versatile than Mata in Mourinho's eyes. He can play CM alongside a strong defensive partner, and AM. He plays both to a world-class standard.  

They really aren't alike aside from both are Spanish and have small frames. Fabregas will score less than Mata, but provide much better service to the forwards.

4121~~~
They have differences obviously but overall there's not much in it imo. Fabregas is doing what Mata was doing for Chelsea. Mata is a little better at scoring and Cesc is a little better in the final ball but not much in it overall.

4122~~~
Fabregas can play deeper to much better effect that Mata can. Also, he's a lot more involved in the general build up play, has better vision, physically better equipped, more flexible and all round a much better player.

4123~~~
He was Chelseas player of the year two seasons running and when he plays for us he generally hits very good numbers in both goals and assists in a proper shit team.

LVG is pretty mental and has a flavour of the month style of team selection. To say he hasn't cut it is bizarre. 14 starts for us last year with 6 goals 4 assists. This season from CAM - his position - 7 starts 3 goals 2 assists. His numbers hugely drop off in CM but that is absolutely not his position. 

To sum up from cam he has been very good for us but from cm he has been a bit rubbish. He would be rubbish at CB as well. his very good stats have come in a year of the team bein awful as well.

4124~~~
there is a significant difference between them. It is just recently that Fabregas plays more advanced, because Oscar got dropped. But he plays it totally different than Mata (the 10 position).

4125~~~
Can't agree with that at all. He's definitely not a much better player. I will concede he's better suited to a deeper play because he has more experience there but thats not where he's playing is he?

4126~~~
Different in the 10 position? As i said Mata has the edge in scoring and Cesc has the edge in the final ball but not much in it. Even the stats are eerily similar in term of chances created, passing and end product.

4127~~~
Fellaini can play as a 10 too, but not like Mata in terms of style. Same with Fabregas, the difference isnt that big but he is different to Mata in that position. Not to mention the fact that he is 10 times more of a complete player than Mata. Mata is pretty much a second striker, while Fabregas is a playmaker. The fact that Mata is more of a finisher and Fabregas a creator tells you everything you need to know. Their game evolves around those abilities, so they play it differently. You call it a small difference, others see that as a huge difference. A bit like Herrera, who is again a differnet palyer to both of them. Even Silva is different to all the other mentioned.

4128~~~
He plays as a CM unless Mourinho wants more defensive awareness in which case Oscar drops out for Ramires/Mikel and Fabregas plays further forward.

Agree to disagree. Fabregas is on a different level to Mata. It's not even close imo.

4129~~~
He does have good stats (inflated by set-piece contributions) but there's no denying he's been generally a bit disappointing in a United shirt. Under Moyes and under Van Gaal. At least there shouldn't be.

4130~~~
As i said, not much in it. Id say Cesc is better in the final ball but at the end of the day they pretty much create the same amount of chances. If you play them in the center of the midfield then the choice is Fabregas no doubt.

Ah fair enough, wasn't aware of that. 

Agree to disagree. He's not on a different level unless its in the midfield. In the 10 position they are very similar, nothing Fab can do that Mata can't.

4131~~~
Sure stas can be misleading but consider Mata plays for an underwhelming United and Hazard plays for a dominate Chelsea.  It is amazing Mata conjures as many goals as that from this side.

In addition as noted... Mata was kicked to the curb so Hazard/Oscar could play 10, yet clearly they decided they needed more options and went and got Cesc.  So while I know Mata is not a defensive dynamo, and clearly can not provide the options Cesc does, when I watch games like the last two, or games where bot Falcao and RvP do statue impersenations I just wonder how Mata continues to sit.

Put him in the hole behind Rooney with some wings creating space and I think he will be better than anything we have seen lately.

4132~~~
As others have pointed out, there is a large gulf between the two at the moment.

4133~~~
There isn't and many will agree with me. Not in the 10 position. 'Large gulf' is an over exaggeration.

4134~~~
Fabregas plays as our #10 out of necessity, (Matić suspended) if Oscar is in terrible form like he has been, or if we set out defensively with two DM's. It's not his natural position and isn't where he is the majority of the time. He plays a totally different role for us than Mata did.

4135~~~
I think its worth giving Juan a go and I expect Louis to do so soon.

4136~~~
The main difference is Fabregas is doing it in (and contributing to) a well-drilled, efficient, winning team. Mata did it mainly during a period where Chelsea were far off the pace. If Mata's one of your main men, your team probably just isn't that good, in my opinion.

4137~~~
You say this as though Fabregas has been first choice #10 throughout the season when that hasn't even been the case. I think Mourinho also wanted to keep Mata, but it was Mata's decision to leave. Made sense with him probably fearing that his World Cup position wasn't secure, plus it seemed like his relationship with Mourinho reached a point where it couldn't be augmented.

For me, Mata's a squad player at best and there's nothing wrong with that. Unless he somehow revamps his game and works on his deficiencies, I don't think anything will change that. Though what I don't understand is why Van Gaal hasn't utilised him more in the last month. Were the QPR and Southampton performances enough for Van Gaal to opt for Fellaini? It was very sad to see him come on against Newcastle yesterday and have very little impact.

4138~~~
He's never been that good, wasn't at Chelsea isn't now.

4139~~~
Fabregas doesn't play 10 for Chelsea.

4140~~~
We play with a 10 and Mata is our best number 10 by a comfortable distance that it's laughable that LvG doesn't play him. We've had Rooney, Fellaini, Di Maria, Januzaj and Herrera play there and no one has been good. Mata brings you goals but apparently that doesn't warrant a start. The kind of balls Di Maria was putting in (when he did it right) against Sunderland is the kind of balls you only see from him, Mata and maybe Herrera. Rooney should be doing it too but he hasn't at all this season.

4141~~~
Not true at all let alone by a comfortable distance. All of Di Maria, Rooney and Herrera have been better this season.

Januzaj has barely played there at all so that's nonsense. Mata has had more games as a #10 than Fellaini has had as well. Same goes for Rooney as well. The other 2 have been clearly better than Mata has. Even Rooney playing deeper has created more. If all of them are deemed "Not good" then that does not say much for Mata

What kind of balls would that be? Rooney and Di Maria have both played more through balls per game than Mata has. Despite having occasional stinkers (which come with their style of play) their passes are a lot more penetrating and dangerous.


Still a bit strange that he hasn't played a little bit more but hardly a travesty.

4142~~~
Not in the 10 role they haven't. Di Maria either needs to be deeper or wider, Herrera is a natural CM and Rooney, well I think we can all agree is a striker, not a midfielder.

I can't accept the argument about Mata not being brilliant but he is our best number 10 and has done well.

4143~~~
Mata will chip in with a few goals when a game is won against inferior opposition, but how many match winning contributions does he make for us? He doesn't like receiving the ball between the lines, he can't hit a ball first time and he's a passenger defensively. Fabregas is much better at the latter two, and his final ball is also world class, as well as his third man runs in and around the box. Mata may seem to have better stats, but if someone pulls the ball back around the edge of the penalty area, which player would you rather be arriving on the end of it? For me, Fabregas by a distance.

Mata is incredibly good technically, has great vision himself and is a brilliant set piece taker. He's an asset to us no doubt, but he's not a necessity, and he never will be for any club that wishes to be an elite side. Fabregas is, and that's why he's a level above someone like Mata.

4144~~~
This is the problem among far too many fans, why on earth bring Fabregas into the discussion, look at Mata for the player he is, not the player Fabregas is.

4145~~~
If we were playing that Newcastle match at a time when we were more secure in our league position and the team wasn't under as much pressure as they are at the minute then we would have seen Mata in the Fellaini role.

4146~~~
I was adding my two cents to the earlier argument between members regarding Fabregas and Mata. I'm perfectly able to analyse Mata as a player individually, and have done so partially in my post anyway.

4147~~~
It was a general view, not solely specific to your post. For example, Mata is the only player in the league criticised for not being as good as David Silva.

4148~~~
Mata is far from a midfielder either. In my opinion there is very little between Rooney and Mata, and I see both as second strikers. Maybe our best setup  would be Mata behind Rooney, and in front of Blind and Herrera, but if we had more midfielders available I would play Herrera instead of Mata in no10.

I don’t think we have any brilliant players to be honest. And Mata is not even a starter.

4149~~~
Should be.

4150~~~
Fair enough. I believe the fact it's a rational discussion is telling in itself though. Why would anyone criticise Ross Barkley for not being as good as Silva, for example.

4151~~~
In the last few games probably yes, but we have done pretty well without him. IMO van Gaal thinks Herrera-Blind is too lightweight and because Mata doesn’t contribute much defensively, it’s safer to play Fellaini. I wouldn’t play that way, but there is very little chance for him to get into starting line-up in the coming weeks.

4152~~~
Surely Carrick, Herrera and Mata though is more physical than Busquets Xavi Iniesta who did fine away at City.....?

4153~~~
There are a couple of key differences, one is that Barca are a team laying with confidence, but the main one is that they have one of the best, if not the best, attacks in world football, meaning that teams won't press onto their midfield as they can't afford to leave space in behind with that trio of forwards. We pose no such threat in our attack and teams will squeeze up on our midfield relentlessly, making Mata a liability.

4154~~~
I love that argument. It works for Barca so surely it will work for us, right?

You meant Rakitic, Busquets and Iniesta I guess.

4155~~~
Adnan Rooney Di Maria IMO playing ahead of them as a 3 has the potential if all on form  to be as good a front 3 that has ever walked onto a PL pitch.....so I don't think your comment is wholly accurate.

4156~~~
No I'm basically saying physicality can be overrated but in an underhand way <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4157~~~
Adnan has barely posed a goal threat at senior level and Di Maria has never been a consistent goal scorer, I don't see any comparison at all with 3 of the best forwards in the world.

4158~~~
As some Chelsea fan has already pointed out. He is playing no.10 there at present. Fact is Mourinho chose Oscar to be his number 10 and he hasn't been good enough this season so Fabregas has had to push up and take his position. Whatever you think of Mata he was up there with the best in that position. Lets not try to rewrite history

4159~~~
None of them have been better as a 10. Di Maria's best games have come from the wide or in a role that's more free.

It's not nonsense comparing Januzaj. Januzaj has played there at Mata's expense. Same as Fellaini and all the others. That's the point. How many times a player has played there when we have a better one. It's ridiculous. The AMC performances shouldn't be so poor in a team like United but they have. Consistency is to blame as it is for so many other positions.

The gulf between Mata and Fellaini is huge. Rooney's not as a good or better as Mata as you claimed despite having more chances to show this. Also, a part of his chance creation and assists come from corners, not just through balls. Not taking that away from him, just saying it doesn't count as a through ball. And if you're not sure what kind of balls that would be then I don't know how you can argue against it. Di Maria's pass to Rooney through on goal. That high ball from outside the box that goes over the defense through on to a player that makes a run. Like Henderson's pass to Sturridge last game. Those are the kind of balls that you see Di Maria and Mata make and almost no one else.

Di Maria clearly tries the most at creating chances. Recently Januzaj, when played on the right and not in a diamond, has been good at it as well. Herrera is decent but he's not as good of a nr. 10 just like Mata isn't as good further behind.

All of Di Maria's best games have come as a left midfielder/winger.

In our top 5 scoring + assisting chart (you can have stats separate, doesn't matter a lot) you've got RvP, Rooney, Di Maria, Falcao and Mata. These are the guys that most often give the final ball or score a goal. These are also the most expensive players (shocking how that correlates). But you wouldn't know it just by reading these forums because they are all shit apparently.

Before the season started, if we lined up a 4-5-1 system with Rooney up top I bet you the other 5 players chosen by the caf would be Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj, Herrera, Carrick. The defense has basically been whoever is fit. We haven't seen a lineup close to that. People want that lineup because on paper it looks like our strongest lineup. It's a formation that's been used by United and many other teams to a great success. Came close to it last match but I want more.

4160~~~
I cant see what those numbers refer to, do you have a link?

4161~~~
Ah, it's missing. I'll edit the post. It's per 90 minutes. Put it in the spoiler header.

4162~~~
I wouldn't go as far as saying that it's a laughable decision since Mata hasn't been amazing for us, but it's very odd that he's not seen many minutes recently. As for the names you suggested, Rooney comfortably outperformed Mata earlier this season, and if he continued to play there I don't think there would be a debate regarding who fans would prefer in the #10. The problem is that so many fans overrate Mata and make him out to be an influential figure, when he's been anything but that in <i>organised</i> sides.

4163~~~
I don't know about that... loads of people hate Rooney in the #10 role because a) his touch can invariably be a bit rubbish and b) his close, intricate passing isn't great.

4164~~~
Still think he's been the best of a poor bunch of attacking players this year.

4165~~~
Don't get me wrong, I'm not really a big fan of Rooney as a #10 and you can probably see that through my posts from last season, but he's much, much more of an influential figure and offers us what Mata doesn't. I definitely agree that his touch and passing are inconsistent, but he knows how to impose himself and that's just something Mata hasn't been able to master in organised sides.

4166~~~
Mata has been fit all season. This is a player that you want fit and have him playing LvG has persisted with 2 strikers (none of them Rooney) for a long time. Mata's had one good run in the team. Played 4 - benched for 2 - played 3 - benched for 3 - played 10 and then suddenly benched for 6. That's not counting cup games where he has started 1 of 4 games. It is strange.

4167~~~
It's strange when you consider how poorly RvP and Falcao have been playing but not so strange when you consider Mata's performances. He did look to be coming good at one point (Spurs away and Newcastle at home) but generally hasn't been great at all.

Seeing as Van Gaal has finally given up on Falcao and RvP is injured it does present an opportunity for Mata. Fellaini got the nod against Newcastle, to give us a bit more physical presence in midfield but Mata might have a chance of playing against a more technical team like Arsenal.

4168~~~
Agree with these.

4169~~~
Fellaini could potentially drop deep as no.10, becoming a 3 man central midfield, obviously wasn't needed against the barcodes as they set up like the away team, but in crunch fixtures that flexibility could be useful, conceeding some attacking prowess but solidifying our options, his height and strength are fairly useful in both boxes,
Don't get me wrong I'm not considering he should be our no.10 for the next few years but right now, with the run of games we have coming up... it's something, personally I would consider, particuarly away from OT, particuarly because I hold the opinion Mata has the tendency to let the game go past him if his team doesn't have the upper hand in the middle of the pitch.

Personally I wouldn't be surprised if he was let go at  seasons end, I don't think Mata has quite hit it off with LvG in the same way as some others in our squad.

4170~~~
Highly debatable and based on Mata's united form,not true at all. Di Maria creates chances no mater where he plays except when he played up top. Mata doesn't. That's the long and short of it.

And it is nonsense. Januzaj has played one game at AMC, one fecking game. As for how AMC performances shouldn't be so poor for United, seeing as Mata has played more games there than any of the other names you've mentioned, he's also the biggest culprit of why those performances have been poor.

You cannot judge Mata and Fellaini purely on stats like these because the way they play the roles are completely different. Rooney has more assists from open play, more through balls per game, more key passes per game, more goals and this despite playing deeper than Mata and out of position for most of the season. 

<a class="username" data-user="53034, @the" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/53034/">@the</a> bit in bold. Very good. And how many of those passes has Mata made this season? Actually scratch that. How many of those passes has Mata played in his entire United career? Very very few I'd imagine and almost none this season. Almost no one else? Rooney has played more of those passes this season this season than Mata has for a start. Even Januzaj has played a couple of nice through balls despite being played everywhere but as a #10.

Another advantage of having Rooney, Herrera or Maria instead of Mata is they are less likely to disappear from games and provide a lot more defensively while not being any worse going forward.

4171~~~
<a class="username" data-user="84350, @bishblaize" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84350/">@bishblaize</a>. The picture crop was poor. It's per 90 minutes. First row is Key Passes. 2nd is Chances created. 3rd is Assists. 4th is pass completion.
Rooney is worse than Mata in every single aspect. Not better like you say.

Mata hasn't been playing as a 10. He's mostly played in the 3-5-2 formation as the right sided midfielder in a midfield two. QPR, Everton, West Brom, Chelsea. These are the games that he has started as a 10. We've starter 12 games in the league with a nr. 10 and he has started 4 of those game. That's my frustration with the manager.

4172~~~
100% agree. They <i>are </i>very similar. Unfortunately neither is quite there as a traditional number 10. Though I think Rooney is closer.

People still trot the "When we add pace and movement, Mata will be class...." stuff, when the reality is - he's a second striker. No system tweaks will make him a dictator, and no system tweaks will give him the ability to shield the ball, dribble past a man or to refrain from moving into the wrong areas.

4173~~~
So play him as a second striker then with Rooney ahead of him. Problem solved.

4174~~~
If only it was that simple.

4175~~~
Hard not to see him being sold in the summer, if he can't get in the team now and isn't picked ahead of the likes of falcao and fellaini then it will be even tougher next season. No doubt he will be sold for a big loss but bringing in someone who fits into the team better is the right decision and we never should have bought mata in the first place.

4176~~~
I think it's the fact he offers nothing when we don't have the ball that has kept him out of the side, we are in an all hands to the pump situation with this run-in, Mata simply gets bullied too easily and doesn't do enough when he loses the ball, he can't play the 3rd man in midfield the way Isco does for example, he really needs to play with two holding CM's behind him and we have not had the option to do that this season as Carrick and Blind have pretty much been ships passing in the night as regards fitness.

4177~~~
I always thought that Mata is on level with the likes of Cazorla/Silva but not quite. He's great as 10 in 4-2-3-1 but when asked to play slightly different role he simply can't do that. Even Coutinho looks a better player now. He'll be off simply because he can't adapt. For me it's a shame he looks one of the most intelligent players we had in our team over a long time but he's not dynamic enough to form the new big team around. I'd still give him look into team ahead of Fellaini..

4178~~~
Its just not true with regards Fabregas, watch the games yourself, then come back. Unfortunately there's nothing else I can do but implore you make a factually accurate statement.

4179~~~
Regardless of whether or not you are right, that has to be one of the more insufferable comments I've read in this forum. And I think you're being revisionist in saying that Mata wasn't that good at Chelsea. I would agree that he hasn't hit the heights at United.

4180~~~
Its frustrating when people basically just make stuff up, you can even just look at the team sheets if you don't want to watch the game. Its also not revisionist, didn't rate Mata at Chelsea, wasn't happy when we bought him, still don't rate him now.

4181~~~
Why didn't you rate him? I'm genuinely curious.

4182~~~
Doesn't do enough work going backwards, doesn't get involved enough. Productivity isn't good enough for someone with those characteristics.

4183~~~
Was he not very productive at Chelsea?

4184~~~
He was. It was his lack of backtracking, as mentioned by Fiskey, that made Mourinho discard him the way I remember it.

4185~~~
Not enough,
Not productive enough to make up for the negatives. If you want to compare him to midfielders of similar productivity, Beckham/Scholes, they added a lot more to the overall play. Strikers score more goals and make more assists.

4186~~~
Like what? He was never that good at Chelsea? How is that a factually accurate statement?

4187~~~
And who here hopes we see some of this tonight...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h6OjNTMuh88?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4188~~~
Has all the ability to be an absolute maestro in the right system. I think if he survives the summer we should build the team around him.

4189~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Dear oh dear!

4190~~~
Hope to wake up and see his name in the starting line up.

4191~~~
I would be really surprised to see him starting next few games.

4192~~~
Mata played 2.55 time less than scholes, and by the end of his career Scholes recorded 61 assists and 148 goals, if Mata continues his career at the same rhythm he will end with 135 goals and 160 assists.

4193~~~
Needs to get back in the fecking starting 11. Absurd the way he's just dropped out of the team this past month after being our best player through December and early January. Technically we don't have anyone else on his level, and yet we're playing fecking Fellaini in front of him. Hopefully with Di maria out he starts and makes a point.

4194~~~
No excuses for not playing him against Tottenham.

4195~~~
Hope to see him start against Spurs this weekend. Criminal how little he's played recently.

4196~~~
If he plays like he did vs Spurs at WHL I would be glad, if he played like he's done generally, still wouldnt mind benching him.

4197~~~
I can understand if the team was playing well without him but they're not. And he's barely getting a look in. Not that he's been impressive either mind but even at his worst he's always contributed with goals and assists fairly regularly.

4198~~~
Are we really going to be a <i>worse</i> team with him in the side? Surely to god it's at least worth giving him a bit of a run with a proper striker ahead of him?

4199~~~
Please bring him back, play him behind Rooney and move Fellaini back into midfield.

4200~~~
He is not our saviour, problems are much more complicated than one player for another.

4201~~~
Maybe not our savior but things need changing up, it's not working as it is now. Get Mata and Carrick back in the starting 11.

4202~~~
I don't think anyone's suggesting that one player can solve our problems.

4203~~~
If we're going to play with a number 10, then he shouldn't be on the bench, in my opinion.

4204~~~
I have not suggested anyone has, i'm just stating my opinion on him. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4205~~~
After Fellaini tonight, there is no way people can say that him "being too easily barged off the ball" is a reason to not play him...

4206~~~
Why does everyone have to be so melodramatic? Is anyone really suggesting that he'll single-handedly solve our problems? That would be foolish to think. However, I imagine that many, including myself, think that he would be an upgrade over Fellaini.

4207~~~
Ah sorry, just read this after previously posting. Still, I think he would help out.

4208~~~
I reckon he'll end up at Barca and never look back.

4209~~~
More than 10 games since he got a start... Ridiculous.

4210~~~
Yep. People will always find reasons not to play someone and just stick with what the managers doing, like many did with Herrera, but the thing is, nobody is playing better. Herrera came in and was an immediate improvement and we as a team look better with him on the pitch. Right now, same thing at the #10 position. Rooney has clearly shown he's our best striker, so we need to change things in the hole. Mata has been inconsistent this season but is clearly our most talented player, so he really should be getting more chances.

4211~~~
If that's the case, I guess he will still be with us next season. Unless we sell him elsewhere first

4212~~~
We dominate possession and it's all a bit slow. This suits Mata and would be similar to how he had it at Chelsea, so why not give him a go as number 10 behind Rooney. This Fellaini nonsense needs to stop.

4213~~~
A fecking disgrace... so would say a real philosopher. This is just unacceptable by any stretch to have someone like Mata on the bench when Fellaini should be a last resort plan ATM.

4214~~~
Don't worry. Falcao will almost certainly start against Spurs...

4215~~~
Barca don't play with a 10, so he won't fit there.

4216~~~
Reckon we'd have won the match had he started instead of fellaini, and I'm no Mata fan.

4217~~~
Bizarre that he's not getting used more. I'm guessing Van Gaal wants Fellaini's physicality but we could use a few more goals, which Mata could provide.

4218~~~
I don't see LvG playing Mata as one of the midfield 3 against Spurs, so his only shot of starting is if he gets picked over Januzaj to play on the right of the front 3.

4219~~~
It's over for him. He'll probably be off on a loan deal come the summer.

4220~~~
Not a sniff, very hopeful he'd get a start today. But not to feature at all is puzzling, so suited to today's game. See why Fellaini opted for and favoured but really don't agree with it. It screams of anti-football despite the Belgians efforts and that he isn't having a bad season at all, it is just a struggle to see the need for him at times. 

Shame for Mata, he certainly deserves more than this, in the quality he has shown off the bench. Love to see him get a run in the side but the chance of that looks slim to none. A bit of positivity he'd bring and to veer away from the route taken with Fellaini and predictability of that.

4221~~~
The only thing he does is get goals really, he is terrible off the ball and can't seem to have an impact on a teams overall gameplay, that being said would have liked to see him play against Arsenal.

He is on course to leave in the summer to Juventus

4222~~~
Think it's getting to the point where people are overrating him just because he has been out for a while. He hasn't been that good all season, not sure why him coming in would magically turn us around. Having said that, there is no doubt he has been underused lately and I would like to see him become more involved.

4223~~~
I'm depressed.

4224~~~
Is this a general important life comment or just because Mata isn't getting game time?

4225~~~
If Mata doesn't start the next game, it could become a life issue.

I just can't for the life of me get my head around the argument for him not playing or people wanting Fellaini ahead of him.

4226~~~
Well I'd be prepared mate.

It's a physical thing, we have so many light players that LvG favours having Fellaini in there, and of the other CM roles Mata does less work than Herrera and Blind.

4227~~~
If we have the ball at our feet (those of Mata's not Fellaini's) we don't need the physicality, ability and quality will shine through. We have to go with Fellaini because he is the only player tall enough to see the ball in the lights when it comes down.

4228~~~
When you have the ball at your feet you need to move quickly with it and be able to protect it, unfortunately Mata is so easily knocked off the ball and has no pace to get away from challenges when he has it, that's why LvG is reluctant to use him, and I think in the PL you need a physical player in midfield, all the top 7 teams have one bar us.

4229~~~
Judging by Fellaini performances, he don't really do well with the ball at his feet. He was only good when the ball is in the air. There is no reason to have a physical player in midfield when he commits foul every challenge. We need a player who tackles the ball and not the player. Mata on the other hand has good technical skills and ball distribution which is what a number 10 should be doing. Back to the same argument, City has Silva, Chelsea has Oscar and Real Madrid has Isco.

4230~~~
Well play a physical player in midfield and Mata in front where he is at his best. Not rocket science. Mata has proven he can do it in the Premier League, it's not his physical attributes holding him back, it's van Gaal's selections .

4231~~~
Fellaini isn't great with the ball at his feet I agree, but he protects it and lays it off reasonably well, but don't mistake this for me being a fan of what he brings, he's simply the only car we have in the lot for the role LvG needs right now. The huge difference between the 3 players you mention and Mata is strength on the ball and some pace as well as defensive workrate, also for the two that actually play in our league they have big unites like Matic and Fernando to do the dirty work and allow them to play.

4232~~~
How would we do that in a 4-3-3 which is what LvG is using right now? If we switched to a 4-2-3-1 that would put too much defensive reliance on Fellaini as part of the two and positionally he's poor, it might work with Blind and Carrick sitting I guess, in all honestly the midfield is so full of slowness and lacking in athletes that it's a big issue in general.

4233~~~
Herrera with Blind or Carrick in midfield with Mata in the hole.

I can accept arguments to have two strikers and that could affect Mata but when Fellaini is played off the striker with Mata on the bench just kills me.

4234~~~
I don't think he's going to play that as basically we'd be left with two lighter players with very little pace as the holding CM's and Mata offering no tracking back to help them out, Fellaini for all his flaws does put in the defensive effort when we lose the ball.

4235~~~
I agree. Mata always hurts Arsenal.

This should've been our line up...

--------------------DDG------------------
Val-------Smalling------Rojo------Shaw
-----Herrera----------------Blind--------
Di Maria-----------Mata-----------Young
-------------------Rooney----------------

4236~~~
Its crazy really, i can see the physicality argument and think Fellaini is useful but not for every game. 

Im convinced that as with Rafael the manager is doing it to stroke his own ego of doing things his way and as per usual relying on his odd decisions for him to be heralded a genius, not working though is it?

4237~~~
The reason Mata is on the bench is the same reason Mourinho put him on the bench. Talented player he is... He is too weak and slow. If he could opporate as a winger in a 4-3-3 im sure he would have got more games. But he would need to be a lot stronger. Next season I hope we replace him with a Bale or De Bruyne

4238~~~
Like when Fergie refused to play Nani over Valencia or both at the sametime in a big game. Or when he did and we lost to City and everyone was screaming why drop an out of form Valencia. Mangers make strange decisions sometimes but to think it's based on their ego is just as bizarre.

4239~~~
Mata has good technical skills, yes - as in his ability to trap and pass a ball accurately. But one of his limitations is that he's not particularly good at turning, shielding or twisting with the ball. He has to play the way he's facing too much for a number 10 in those often congested areas.
How many times have we seen Mata literally have to move sideways/away from goal to get the opposition marker off his back so he can turn around? It's not for no reason.

It affects quite a bit of his game. From the areas of the pitch he moves into, to what he actually does when he receives the ball under pressure. It's difficult to build on somebody who isn't always able to make the ball stick in those areas of the pitch.

Silva and Isco both have that ability to turn and wriggle free of their man... as well as their technical skills.

As for yesterday: I didn't mind him not starting. We needed to ensure we put a stamp on the game early on, and for all Fellaini's faults, he makes his presence felt. 
I would have liked to see Mata come on later on though, because he's obviously got goals in him.

4240~~~
Also, people talk about him needing a physical midfield behind him to shine... but that still wouldn't change what Mata is capable of when the ball is played into his feet. That's more of an issue than the midfield behind him, in my opinion.

4241~~~
Now Carrick is back and we can play Blind too, Mata should be utilised. Fellaini is fine to use against the more physical teams but the 75th minute onwards was crying out for some quality in the final third. The kind of quality that Mata can produce. I really hope he's in the team against Spurs.

4242~~~
He should of started ahead of Fellaini.

He's our best #10 and by some distance. We should be pairing him with Rooney.

4243~~~
I think that was true for the earlier part of the season but until the So'ton game he was in good form. The problem here is that a different set of rules apply to players like Mata, Rafael and Herrera, one poor game and they are out for ages. Obviously his inclusion is not a panacea to our issues but we will definitely be more creative and score a lot more with him in the side, especially at OT. With Carrick back I'd like to see him, Mata and Herrera in a 3 because I think we would be well primed to utilize the pace on the wings with such a midfield.

4244~~~
Mata is PL proven and Chelsea's player of the year two years in a row.  Why are we acting like he can not handle the EPL?  No he is not as strong or big as Fellaini, but are we acting like this is binary.  Mata bring a load of strengths and weakness to the table like every player.  Are you really going to tell me Fellaini's overall worth is more than Matas?

I mean look what happened when we took Herrera off last night.  We lost all composure on the ball and couldn't string anymore passes together.  I mean look at Bayern and Barca, do you really think they rate size or ability? Do you think they want more or less skilled players on the pitch at one time.  look at arsenal last night with how many skilled players they had on the pitch. 

Yet we sit one of our most skilled players so we can lump the ball forward to Fellaini. 

This is my whole problem... LVG keeps talkinmg of his philosophy and I have not read anything in detail but based off his Ajax, Bayern, and Barca teams I am seeing skilled technical players moving off the ball and retaining possession.  Am I off?

So how is Fellaini and what I watched last night more LVG's Philosophy... ?

4245~~~
Dispossessed per game.

Falcao - 2.1
Rooney - 1.8
RVP - 1.5 
Fellaini - 1.4
Di Maria - 1.4
Mata - 1.0

4246~~~
Not the easiest argument to make when Fellaini ends up fouling people whilst he has the ball.

4247~~~
It's also not a valid argument when Coquelin and Koscielny are both knocking Fellaini off the ball...

4248~~~
The Mourinho example gets used time and again as a stick to beat Mata with but for all his limitations Mourinho was clever enough to realise that Mata could be useful in certain games and played him a lot more actually than he's been playing under LVG recently. Whenever he felt they needed defensive solidity he brought off Mata. But in games like the ones we have had recently with slow static passing possession with no direction i have no doubt Mourinho would have used Mata. 

Also Chelsea had a better team. What applies to them doesn't always apply to us. Felipe Luis is barely getting a game and he would walk right into our starting lineup. Robben was another player they got rid and he's more than good enough to play for us. Tiago as well he would immediately improve our midfield.

4249~~~
When you break down Mata's strengths and weaknesses it's really not hard to see why he's not every manager's cup of tea, despite being Chelsea's player of the year twice running.
His best period coincided with Chelsea being poor in the league, and lacking a proper system or shape.

Some feel that this is just a coincidence; I don't. Some think he was that impressive <i>despite </i>Chelsea being poor; I think it was partly <i>down </i>to Chelsea being so poor.

Looking at Mata's assets, I think his role going forward is an impact sub who's worth a late goal/assist, and a versatile rotational option.

4250~~~
I would much rather see Herrera as a number 10 against Spurs with Rooney up front. Herrera gets involved in games more than Mata and has more pace and has better defensive capabilities even though Mata is a better playmaker. Then Carrick and Blind would make up the two places in central midfield with Mata on the bench to come on in the last 30 mins if Herrera is not performing

4251~~~
Well we are poor and he hasn't exactly been impressive. Not sure if that credits or discredits his Chelsea performances.

4252~~~
We're poor, but that Chelsea side were poor to the extent that Villas Boas was sacked. His replacement then had them playing pretty gung-ho football, where the discipline and balance was lacking (until the Champions League, funnily enough)

I don't think it was a coincidence that Mata shone in a Chelsea side that, for about two years, looked quite lacking in discipline and order over 38 games. It allowed Mata to only get on with what he was good at and not do what he wasn't good at. In theory that's good, but the things he isn't good at can leave holes in the team.

It was also a time where Chelsea lacked a genuine goal scorer. The emphasis wasn't on Mata to dictate games and he didn't (which some people seem to think he did) - the emphasis was probably more on him getting into goalscoring positions and cut-back areas.

Some still think that signing a fast winger and physical midfielder will give Mata the ability to dictate and impose himself on games properly, but the issue is as much (if not more) to do with Mata's own skill-set as his team mates.

4253~~~
Not sure i buy that. Our performances have been equally gung ho. Oh well, doesn't matter really.

4254~~~
If nothing else we've surely given the alternatives enough of a chance at this stage, haven't we?

I mean given that Mata is a better footballer than Fellaini and is in better form than either RvP or Falcao you'd think we'd have been willing to give him more of an extended run in his best position up to now anyway. At this stage though the rivals to his position must've played their way out of the team to a certain extent so maybe at last....

4255~~~
Nothing changes,now Afroman is an issue,you want Mata,next game Mata gets a chance,he does not fulfill your needs nor what you want,then you have a go at him too. Lets be honest,we just know what we want to see,how to get there is another thing.

Maybe Mata is more number 10 but the moment they start knocking him down,some will have a go at him how he can not keep the ball longer then 3 sec,how there was a reason why he got sold, all same bs at the end.

4256~~~
Yeah it is hard to argue that we have given every one else a shot barring januzaj up front.  I would not exactly say we have been "all that" lately would you?

4257~~~
Mata needs a run of games at 10 with Rooney up front as the lone striker. It's our best chance of starting to look like a Manchester United team again. His style would also complement Di Maria and Januzaj/Young playing either side of him.

4258~~~
4231

rooney upfront
mata as the 10
januzaj + a top winger alongside him
2 proper central midfielders, one who can defend and one with some creative guile (like Modric + scheiderlin/matuidi etc
best back 4 we can muster
big dave.

i just think we need to go back to basics and build around the top players we actually have, instead of trying to redefine the wheel.

Mata is an unbelievable no.10 with great productivity, still think he's here for the long term.

4259~~~
It's a question of LVG's philosophy: Blind over Mata

4260~~~
All of those teams you have mentioned that LvG managed had a physical presence in midfield, and you need that in this league more than any other. It's obvious LvG has decided it's either Herrera or Mata, not both. Now Herrera got hauled off and Carrick is back we'll see what he does.

I've eliminated Di Maria as everyone knows he gives the ball away much too often and Falcao can barely control it so he's irrelevant. RvP has been dreadful this season and shouldn't be starting any more than Mata. However this is another example of stats being a poor discussion tool, I mean how many attempts at dribbling with the ball has Mata had compared to Rooney and Fellaini? How many risky passes has he attempted? Those things need to be factored in to give some context to the stats. Mata gets it and almost always gets rid of it straight away, where as Rooney and Fellaini try to keep it and use it.

4261~~~
Its hardly outlandish to suggest LvG is driven by his ego. His world cup goalkeeper switch was nothing but reminding everyone who runs the show. 

He's well known for preferring players he's moulded from scratch. 

To be honest i just cant think of any other reason and this fits the big heads modus operandi

4262~~~
Based on this season neither has done much with the ball. I can't think of a single through ball that has worked. Both Mata and Fellaini have been equally unimpressive. And the same thing can be said about the others.

4263~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4264~~~
He put the keeper better at stopping pens on before a penalty shoot out. How's that ego? If they'd managed to get Krul on for the semi final shoot out, they'd probably be in the finals.

4265~~~
You wont get any disagreement as regards Mata and Fellaini from me, I think Rooney has done pretty well quite often this season playing way too many times out of position. The only advantage Fellaini has right now is his size and that is why it's him and Herrera or Mata IMO.

4266~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4267~~~
Yeah its kinda hard to criticize Rooney when he's played out of position. When he plays upfront he's scoring goals. As regards to Mata and Fellaini i just don't think that one should be played all the time. There are games which suit Mata and there are games which suit Fellaini more. If we are assuming they play in the same position.

4268~~~
It's really difficult to say as we have changed formation so many times, I mean there was a period where neither were playing. I think if we stick with the current 4-3-3 Fellaini will always be one of the 3 CM's for the next 10 games.

4269~~~
You're probably right. Think Fellaini is a mainstay now. I saw some good understanding between Mata and Herrera, would have liked us to explore that more personally and see if we could build around that but they're rarely playing together. Oh well who am i kidding it probably wouldn't have worked lol.

4270~~~
Mata and Herrera do link well and it's a shame we haven't been able to exploit that more. If we had a Matic type DM and a strong back 4 we probably could, but right now we lack the other pieces needed to facilitate playing both of them.

4271~~~
The Mata transfer is another one where we ovrpaid by about 20-25% , never suited or suits or style, very much like ADM seems a panic buy, if we can get rid of both and reinvest into squad I would be very happy.

4272~~~
Hopefully he replaces Fellaini in the line up and we finally start to play some proper football

4273~~~
Its just complete nonsense that Juan Mata is being kept out of the side by Fellaini. The only time that would make sense is when we are chasing a game and going route one.

What exactly has Mata done to lose his place in the lineup, he had a good December then has gone missing - ridiculous IMO.

4274~~~
Or how about we keep both and invest further into the squad? I find it very amusing when people say they'd be very happy to get rid of talents like Di Maria and Mata.

4275~~~
Doing an AMA. This is what has become of our players. smh.

4276~~~
Probably a naive question but what is an AMA?

4277~~~
It's because people and football fans are generally idiots.

4278~~~
And what's so wrong about him doing an AMA?

4279~~~
Ask Me Anything. Like a Q&A session with the fans/general public.

4280~~~
There's nothing wrong, but he should be out playing on the pitch/impressing and convincing the manager to let him play rather than doing a chat show.

4281~~~
You do know that they only kick a ball around for a couple hours a day so they have plenty of free time right?

And I fail to see how doing an AMA somehow takes away from his training.

4282~~~
Mata is an odd one....I find it hard to pick holes in him purely because we've seen what he is like in this league and know what he can do.....

Which begs the question, how can we not fit him in.

*I'm aware the question has been asked before but I'm wrecked tried and want a notification to wake up to tomorrow

4283~~~
It's not just kicking a ball for a couple of hours only. There are activities as well during the day for training/match preparation.

4284~~~
Even if he's there til 1700, that still gives him loads of free time. 

I remember people having s problem with Rio being on Twitter because it took away from his training. I don't get that mentality at all. Players have free time, if they want to spend some of it answering fans' questions I don't see the problem.

4285~~~
What? People are saying him doing something like this will affect his training?

4286~~~
Oh right, thanks.

4287~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Is he supposed to be camping outside Van Gaal's home after hours doing keepy uppies and shuttle runs?

4288~~~
It's an absolute travesty the way one of our most talented players gets consistently ignored while we're left to watch the dross served up by Fellaini and co. I'd love to know quite what Mata has done that has led to Van Gaal's aversion to playing him. 

I've read a few things about how Van Gaal believes that every player has to contribute defensively, hence his falling out with players like Rivaldo in the past. Perhaps he's against Mata as he is relatively poor defensively. However, it isn't exactly like Van Persie, and even Rooney at times, work all that hard defensively. It also seems to be a worryingly limited way of looking at things. Does that mean he wouldn't pick Ronaldo because he doesn't put a "shift" in defensively. There are 11 men on a football pitch, it isn't always necessary for all of them to be defensive lynch-pins, particularly when the team's attack is so impotent.

While Mata wouldn't solve the problem we have with pace, at the very least he can control the ball and play with it on the deck - unlike Monsieur Toilet Brush.

4289~~~
He'll be gone in the Summer anyway. He's come here at a wrong time, I reckon Ferguson might have got the best out of him.

4290~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Nearly spat out my drink.

4291~~~
Maybe 50% of the activities the players are given on a daily basis are not training related. They all have a schedule of PAs and sponsorship related appearances throughout the week after training, this is just one that you've heard of from hundreds that have happened this season.

4292~~~
His best game of the season was against Spurs... can't see any real reason now why he shouldn't start on Sunday. (Bar LVG stubbornness)

4293~~~
Definitely needs to play more.

4294~~~
Mata was a panic buy, but Di Maria is far from it. He finds it hard to adjust to this league, so he isn't playing well but it made sense for us to get him.

4295~~~
The other one was filming a commercial for South Asian markets with a ninja. 

*cringe*

4296~~~
I still think it would have been the best to stick to the plan to play Kagawa behind Rooney. I could imagine that Herrera and AdM would have been the perfect fit for Kagawa.

However Mata is the best one we have available so he should play.

4297~~~
i was at that spurs game... first and only united match i've ever been to. i was amazed by his ability. even the small things... i dunno, it's hard to explain, but watching it on tv never really gave me the appreciation that i gained seeing him in person. what a fantastic talent.

4298~~~
If he doesn't start today, I think it would be fair to say his United career is over.

4299~~~
It's already over. He hasn't been anywhere near good enough for the amount of money we paid for him last year. Having said that, he starts a game then is benched for the next 5 games, so I can hardly blame him either.

4300~~~
He hasn't lived up to his price tag, no. But the way LVG has sidelined him on favour of Fellaini over the past few months is utterly ridiculous.

4301~~~
To be honest his goals and assists are very good, despite not being a striker, and playing in such a dysfunctional, and uncreative team

4302~~~
He'll be here and starting regularly next season once LVG gets his midfield and defense balance right.

4303~~~
Bentaleb is pretty chill out there. I think we could risk Mata on him, Herrera on Mason and Blind on Eriksen.

4304~~~
Besides a very bad miss, Mata was very good against Spurs earlier in the season. Always seems to do well against Tottenham, some players just have those teams.

4305~~~
I still think Van Gaal likes him, I just don't think he has the two other midfielders to play him with. 

Blind and... nobody else does enough work defensively to accomodate him.

4306~~~
Yeah agreed. Not only do I expect him to be here next season, I think he'll be one of the centerpieces

4307~~~
Don't people say that every week when a player doesn't start for a while?

Watch him sit on the bench and witness us lumping long balls to Fellaini all game before getting a nice little 10 minute appearance at the end (unless our defenders get crocked again and we don't have subs left)

4308~~~
If LVG liked him,he'd be going out of his way to play him

Said it from day 1, mata is not an LVG player

4309~~~
Some act as if he actually has more influence than Fellaini has, for the biggest part of the season he just disappeared in matches and passed everything sideways, Fellaini has more use than that. He played very well against Spurs last time, where he put Falcao 1 vs 1 at least twice, but ofcourse he squandered both chances. If he can put in performances like that more often, LVG will play him.

4310~~~
Lvgs logic behind his line up choices is flawed to say the least

4311~~~
Think the same, but Mata doesnt warrant any place based on what he's shown this season, besides a handful matches he has been very non existent imo.

4312~~~
Tweet is from yesterday, but this guy is reliable.

4313~~~
I'd say they've been more or less the same with regards to their influence. i thought Fellaini was more effective in a midfield two when we played 3-5-2 earlier in the season, and has been very average since moving further forward. Mata, on the other hand, seems to have traded places with Herrera, and has not started a league since the win against QPR (?). I believe that we're at our best with both starting, Fellaini gives us the needed physicality we lack without him and Mata provides the creativity.

4314~~~
Fellaini is playing ahead of him in a forward role though, and his performances there have led to us playing some awful stuff that's barely effective. Mata deserves to play more, as does Rafael yet LVG will persist with players who put in a shift. Actually, Fellaini contributes nothing but fouls recently, and he's more effective as a plan B. Not the plan from the start of a match.

4315~~~
It makes sense to start him against this Spurs side. Their pair in front of the back four, Bentaleb and Mason, is very lightweight and offers only the basic off the ball movement when Tottenham are defending. Mata is a clever player, he can find space and time on the ball in between their lines to pick the right pass and expose their defensive line. 

Furthermore, their only threat from the midfield positions is Eriksen and we'll have a holding CM to keep an eye on him. It seems like a reasonable risk, at least on paper and it nearly paid off at the Lane. Plus Fellaini could prove a very useful substitution in this one because Spurs can really step on the gas in the last 20-25 minutes of their games.

4316~~~
Our midfield is incredibly lightweight as well if Fellaini doesn't play.

4317~~~
Not true mate, because of Fellaini we can get up further on the opponents half very easily, we did it against Arsenal and he created 2 chances for di Maria and 1 for Young. He is let me say, a short cut for us, to penetrate teams. To say he's just there for fouls is really unfair.

4318~~~
Which creativity? He has been passing it sideways all season bar some matches.

4319~~~
I know that and that's why i said it would be a reasonable choice to start him only in this particular game, because  he will get more chances to play his game without someone closing him down all the time. I would not have any problem to see Fellaini start either. I can see LvG's logic behind that and i believe that a midfield of Carrick (Blind), Fellaini and Herrera would be better against Arsenal, City, Liverpool and Chelsea.

4320~~~
With Carrick back, I think Mata will be back in the first 11.

4321~~~
If Mata is indeed playing, Herrera won't be

4322~~~
Off the top of my head, Newcastle (home), Spurs (away), QPR (away) were a few of the games where he created some decent/very good opportunities.

4323~~~
Mata behind rooney is what I've wanted to see for a while now. Let's hope it works

4324~~~
He starts again <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Show us something Juan

4325~~~
Good to see him play and as usual I hope I'm wrong but I just can't see how he can really play his game in this line up. He's either going to be wider than he wants, being asked to cross it to the bank post to Fellaini or he's going to be playing behind Rooney/Fellaini, neither with pace, Fellaini who won't link up how Mata wants to and with Valencia/Young stick wide so he can't try to play them in. 

I'd love to see mata, januzaj, rooney and di maria/young given a couple of games together to see how they do. I always think it's unfair when we might play a few of them in one game and people knock it when it doesn't immediately click. Give them a few games together and I think it's a far more balanced side with players who actually complement each other. Fellaini can be effective but for me he takes a way more than he gives.

4326~~~
So after, what, 10 games out, he's thrown back in in a tough game and expected to perform immediately. And when, like the rest of the side, he's inevitably mediocre, he'll be sent to the reserves again. I find it pretty odd, tbh.

4327~~~
Will be starting on the wing, tracking back against Rose will be very important, I hope we don't regret it.

4328~~~
Always plays well vs Spurs. So hopefully today he does again.

4329~~~
No doubt, Rafael will get a start soon too.

Bizarre.

4330~~~
Yep that's how I see it. It's a bizarre thing where people discount context of a performane, i.e. a lack of momentum in to the game and also in a set up that doesn't suit him. Like I said, give him an extended run with Rooney and two of januzaj, young and di maria and then I think it's fair to judge him and I think personally he'd do a lot better there.

4331~~~
LVG has just said, Mata is a similar player to Di Maria. Is he retarded?

4332~~~
He is philosophical

4333~~~
His argument was that they were both left footed. He had no idea how to answer that question. Probably also wouldn't have been able to answer why Fellaini is still a #10.

4334~~~
Yeah, really strange. Apart from the fact that you could vaguely categorise both as attacking midfielders, they're incredibly different.

4335~~~
He was actually tracking back .......wow

4336~~~
Brilliant player.

4337~~~
Looks like he has a fire in his belly today, fighting hard. Still a liability given how slow and weak he is but playing himself into the game and he's a good threat when the ball goes into the box. Hope he has a good second half

4338~~~
His passing is nice and much more accurate than Di Maria's, but his lack of pace and how easily he is knocked off the ball in a one on one situation is still very evidently an issue.

4339~~~
Mata's pressed today. Like, genuinely. Haha. Been great on the ball too. Played a couple of reverse passes that have had me grinning like a Cheshire cat.

4340~~~
He's adding some ball retention, and handsomeness to our team today.

4341~~~

4342~~~
Terrific half. He needs to play

4343~~~
He needs to play more often

4344~~~
Seems to like playing Spurs. Great player to watch when on form.

4345~~~
This pretty much!

4346~~~
Impossible, Redcafe told me he isn't creative.

4347~~~
1. Play Mata
2. Play Herrera
3. ????
4. Win everything

4348~~~
He needs to play on the wing. Always has. Far more time and space out there then down the middle.

4349~~~
No idea why he hasn't been starting the past couple of months. We actually were decent over Christmas when he was playing and our dip has been while he's been benched. Great player.

4350~~~
I still think in certain games Mata cannot be the starter out wide, particularly the games in which we require a bit of pace out there.

4351~~~
Should start most games behind Rooney,.

Its the same with Di Maria. Not that I feel you're comparing the 2 but pointing it out.

4352~~~
As well as his passing he's fairly on the ball when it comes to the tracking back and sticking in side of things today too. A right little terrier when he wants to be.

4353~~~
Him and Herrera just link up well.

4354~~~
Considering he hasn't played for ages he has had a great half. I hope <a class="username" data-user="43572, @Raees" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/43572/">@Raees</a> will close his Eriksen thread where he was ridiculously overrating him. If Mata had played like Eriksen today, G Neville, half of the Caf and I don't know who else would be calling him a pub player. How can anyone want Eriksen in our team when a much better player in Mata is not even a starter for us at times?

4355~~~
3. Play Rafael?

Mata has been great this half, he really should have started more games recently.

4356~~~
Play him till the rest of the season LvG! After being out for so long he's fitted back in like a treat.

4357~~~
Very good so far. Exactly the type of performance we bought him for.

4358~~~
Disagree. I don't think there is a genuine necessity for pace in the side but there is for creativity which Mata brings but only from the wing. Even under Moyes, he looked far better and more involved from the wing then off the front. Just too easy to brush off the ball and crowd out.

4359~~~
The team should be built round him.

4360~~~
Thought he played really well today. Its mind boggling he hasn't played in a month, he's been decent all season imo.

4361~~~
He had a number of games at the start of the season where he was largely anonymous, but he's been brilliant today.

4362~~~
He's a quality player. Players work off him so well and having him on the pitch opens things up for us more.

4363~~~
It was hard to impress when one team is so much more in control than the other. The little possession Eriksen did get he did well with it. Mata did well today but he was equally brilliant last time we played Spurs at white hart lane.. we shall see how influential he is against Liverpool and the remainder of the run in. He did well today and of course I would love for him to continue to prove me wrong.. I'd rather be proven wrong and an existing united player do well and help the team rather than look wise myself.

I still think he is too slow for us and not a long term solution for our side but one thing he did well for us in comparison to Di Maria is a) provide a better mentality to the team i.e. he actually wants to play for the club - everyone in that side seemed to gel well and b) more intelligent with his passing and thus it helped stifle Spurs and they couldn't get the ball off us.

4364~~~
True but the pace helps Di Maria escape in those situations at times.

4365~~~
Brilliant game today and showed what he's capable of. Should keep Di Maria's place imo

4366~~~
Played quite well considering he hasn't had many minutes for some time.

That said, needs to be more adventurous with his passing. That's an aspect of his play that has disappointed me at United.

4367~~~
I actually thought that aspect of his game was very good today, since it's something I think he's generally been lacking this season. Played some intelligent passes at times which troubled the Spurs defence.

4368~~~
Dunno. I'd like to see him attempt more through balls. Today has proved that you don't necessarily need pace in front of you to do that.

Hopefully that will come with more confidence. Have to say as big a Di Maria fan as I am, it will be tough to drop Mata after this.

4369~~~
He played with hunger and it was there for all to see - pressing, making recoveries and generally showing more fire, like the kick after losing the ball (shouldn't be encouraged but he was really up for it today it has to be said).

Really hoping to see him feature regularly in the run in. His link up with Herrera made the right flank/channel impressive and complemented the more direct left flank/channel of Young and Fellaini (with Blind) very well. You could really see that both Herrera and Mata are on the same wavelength on the pitch.

4370~~~
Yeah, I'd play Mata ahead of Di Maria at the moment for definite.

4371~~~
He did very well, going to feel bad for him when he gets dropped for Di Maria next week.

4372~~~
Would be ridiculous if it happened, which of course means it probably will.

4373~~~

4374~~~
Not overly convinced tbh.It's easy to play well when the rest of the team played well but I don't see what's so special about this performance.In fact I would say he's the least impressive out of the front 6.

4375~~~
I loved how Herrera made fun of Mata, when he made a cross that Bebe would be ashamed of.

4376~~~
Hope he gets a good run of games now and prove his quality.

4377~~~
He was not just good when we were in possession, but also off the ball. Worked very hard and helped Valencia shut down the right side

4378~~~

4379~~~
I dunno, you could say that it's not a coincidence that we click when he actually gets a start in the league.

I think he was as good as we would hope after getting so little playing time over the past few months. I was a bit concerned to see him out wide, but he covered a lot of ground defensively which was reassuring.

4380~~~
He's a joy to watch, a fantastic footballer and one of the first names that should be on the team sheet.

4381~~~
Knew he could be effective out wide in 4-3-3, hope to see more of him in this position. If has di Maria overlapping him for midfield it could be even better

4382~~~
Rooney looks like Mata if Mata had grown up in 1842.

4383~~~
Was class today. Love watching him play, He's just so good and intelligent on the ball all the time. Hopefully he keeps his place even with do maria coming back.

4384~~~
Fine peformance. Simply has to play Marie frequently. You can't leave a player like him out for a month. His overall play is very consistent.

4385~~~
He was good, I'm more impressed about his off the ball contribution than when we were in possession. His offensive game should be like that every week though, maybe this position on the right isn’t a bad idea after all.

4386~~~
Must say, his work rate has impressed me. Not just today, but also when we played against Chelsea, he put in a real shift.

4387~~~
Must be so frustrating to be physically targeted by every single team you come up against. This nonstop rough treatment seems to be a new thing this season, I don't remember him having to deal with it last year, or when he was at Chelsea.

Still, he's got a good head on his shoulders. Just keeps picking himself up and doesn't get too riled by it, as far as I can see.

4388~~~
Im not the biggest Mata fan, but I thought he did well quite well today, pleased for him, hopefully can play more in that role in a 433.

4389~~~
That was some ovation he got.

4390~~~
Favourite United player. He's brilliant

4391~~~
Wasn't it?! Lovable wee fecker was always going to a fan favourite.

4392~~~
Great moment, but I was a bit concerned seeing him walk off the field. I wondered if he might have been injured. Any word?

4393~~~
Haven't seen anything but looked to be limping slightly.

4394~~~
Surprised by his pace at times today when he both carried the ball into attack and chased down players - looked faster than his usual self. Lovely player to watch with arguably the best technique in the squad. Also, he seems to be a genuinely likeable character.

4395~~~
Exactly. The majority of Mata's best games came from playing out wide on the right. With him being weak on the ball, there's no way he can be at his best in the middle unless he has the space to play his game. He's much better out wide where he can receive the ball in more space and, thus, be more creative and dangerous.

He may not be quick or fast, but he's very intelligent, and his intelligence helps him be "quicker" than he is on the ball. He links up very well with others, and he plays very intelligent passes, particularly in the final third.

4396~~~
Another great performance. I mentioned a few months back that in a game where we are going to dominate possession, he is more than fine in a wide area. He just offers so much when on the ball, such a clever player and praying we see him at Anfield.

4397~~~
Fans really love him and he justified his place too, albeit marginally. Might lose his place to Di Maria this coming weekend but he definitely is such a valuable asset to us! Would love to read this next blog after yesterday's performance

4398~~~
I imagine you had the same happy, warm feeling I did, seeing him get cheered as he left the pitch. He went far beyond the usual clapping to the supporters (a fair number of thumbs-up were thrown in for good measure.) You just have to love the little guy. Gracias Juan!

4399~~~
His touch is awesome. Now that we've finally sorted Rooney up front we should be trying to use him in the three behind him, either on the flank like yesterday or down the centre. I really hope we don't let him go in the Summer, he's an excellent player. I've had him written off as a departure in the next transfer window but maybe, just maybe, there's still hope for him here.

If we could get Depay and get Di Maria into proper form we'd have excellent options for our front 4. We could play a compact side with Depay and Di Maria on the wings and Mata in the middle, or whenever needed put Fellaini further up and give up on one of the smaller players. All we'd need is antoher forward to step up when Rooney's not firing and we'd be golden.

He's such a likable character too.

4400~~~
I have to watch the game again because I thought he was ineffective and as usual non-creative. I cannot remember him creating any good goal scoring opportunities or playing a part in any of our goals. Nearly everyone is singing his praises and the crowd at OT seemed obviously impressed with his performance. I guess it must be just me and thus I need to watch the game again and make sure I am not being overly critical.

4401~~~
I agree with this.  His performance was fine, but he didn't shine like Young / Fellaini / Rooney / Blind.  Pretty much all our best moves were going down the left.

4402~~~
I've always been a Mata fan and I really want him to stay.  If LvG is true to his word and starts players based on form rather than name we should be seeing him instead of Di Maria at Anfield and I really hope that's the case.  Loved his partnership with Herrera and Valencia, need to see more.

4403~~~
I was thinking the same thing.It was the confirmation bias that got into people's head as he was benched for the whole month and people was calling for him to be back to the XI.All of our 5 other non-defenders were better than him.His performance was decent at best which is fine considering it's his first game back but I totally don't get the praise.

4404~~~
The second goal came from his corner (true, its just a corner - but with our shit standards of corner this season, the fact that he actually took a decent one that we scored from should be appreciated) - and we earned that corner thanks to his immaculate touch from a Spurs clearance that allowed us to launch a quick attack and get the corner. He also nearly got on the end of both a Fellaini and Rooney cut-back (He could have done better for the Fellaini one, and Rooney should have done better with his cut-back, still two good opportunites though) Not saying that any of these were especially creative moments - but it was little things, like a fine first touch, or a quick pass or good movement that added to our overall quicker tempo of play. He was also able to drift inside and add an extra body in-field, and generally just took up good positions where he was always available to receive the ball.

It's not a coincidence we played quicker football with him, Herrera and Carrick on the pitch at the same time. Herrera didn't contribute to any of our goals either, but he was still effective/creative when we had the ball.

4405~~~
In terms of ball retention, I think Mata offers a lot more than Di Maria. Not sure we can afford Di Maria giving the ball away non-stop at Anfield. On the other hand, Di Maria can create assists out of nowhere. Good problem to have, but as Mata played well yesterday and Di Maria is still trying to recover his best form, I'd stick with Mata.

4406~~~
Think Mata was excellent yesterday, and played a big part in us being able to keep onto the ball and create chances. Although played out wide, he was given the license to cut in at times and link up with Herrera, whilst Valencia overlapped.

4407~~~
Neat, tidy passing and excellent first touches is all well and good but it should go without saying that he needs to be creating more chances. Other than a couple of set pieces he never really threatened to create anything. Needs to shift away from his comfort zones and take a lot more risks on the ball. In comparison the likes of Young and Fellaini looked much more threatening on the ball and ran rings around the Spurs defense.

4408~~~
He was my MoTM yesterday; immense game from him. Carrick however, made the world of difference to the midfield yesterday as he allowed Mata and Herrera a lot more freedom to roam. It's one of the reasons why Dembele came on at halftime, Carrick had way too much options on the ball in the first half.

4409~~~
He keeps the ball and his movement is good. Yesterday he also worked hard defensively until tiring in the second half. He wasn't spectacular but for his first start in about 2 months he did well.

4410~~~
Only our fans could see a performace like we got yesterday and then start pulling a players performance apart. They all played well.

4411~~~
Watching the game over since I couldn't properly watch it yesterday on my phone...

But that touch he had right before our corner for the 2nd goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Also, gotta love the understanding he has with herrera. Class.

4412~~~
I give mine to Herrera, but as you said, Carrick playing allowed Herrera and Mata to do what they do best, which is to play free flowing football. It was a joy to watch yesterday. Long may it continue.

4413~~~
It's bizzare how Young and Mata absolutely destroyed Rose and Walker given the fact both are quite small and not very strong, and neither are blisteringly fast either. The movement and passing was outstanding.

It has to continue at those levels though.

4414~~~
If you put Mata's footballing ability, in Valencia's body, you'd probably have one of the top 3 players in the world.

Its so frustrating to see his physical limitations hamper him to much at times. But despite that, it was bloody great to see him back in the team. He's just a great footballer who's presence tends to result in a better class of football. I hope he can establish himself as part of our first XI.

4415~~~
A Mata-Valencia hybrid.... But would he smile?

4416~~~
Young isn't small, he's 5'10.

4417~~~
Walker is a noticeably bigger unit (and noticeably shit too).

4418~~~
After consulting wikipedia, you are right, he is not 5'10 he's 5'9. I guess me being 5'8 like Mata everyone is taller <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4419~~~
<a class="username" data-user="65136, @NotoriousISSY" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65136/">@NotoriousISSY</a>  Young is actually quite fast, I think. He doesn't seem as quick as he did in his Villa days, but he is definitely a quick player - it's just that Walker is a sprinter, pretty much the only thing he actually offers as a footballer.

4420~~~
Valid points, especially with respect to corners, DiMaria's are awful. I still think Mata would be more useful if he would look for and at least try a few through passes to our striker(s) and also attempt more one-twos at the top of the box. Carrick, although adopting a more defensive position, appears more creative and seems to produce beautiful central passes to our striker(s).

4421~~~
One thing that always bugged me. Why didn't they let Mata take all the set pieces? Not even one lausy corner!

4422~~~
He took them from the left side didn't he? We've been doing out-swinging corners lately and it's actually worked pretty well (in terms of goals scored). Generally we were a threat from most set pieces as well vs Spurs.

4423~~~
I might be getting old. I don't remember him taking a single set piece against Spurs.

4424~~~
He took the corner for our second goal, don't remember the others from that side but I know he took that one for sure. No idea about free kicks though.

4425~~~
He should take all corners at least.

4426~~~
I actually don't like his corner taking, he floats them too high. Doesn't hit the first man at least but it's hard to get any power on those kind of deliveries. Helps get it to Fellaini though, I guess and we saw what he can do. 

Think Rooney and RVP are our best corner takers, RVP for penalties, di Maria for deep FKs, and Rooney or Mata for direct FKs.

4427~~~
I was surprised at how effective he was even starting out wide right. I guess playing our 3 best passers, Blind, Carrick and Mata helps us increase the tempo by moving the ball faster rather than simply rely on pace of the player. Also looked defensively active even if he looks like a tiny pug nipping at someone's heels to let him out.

4428~~~
He should take all the set pieces really, his free kicks are almost always pinpoint and his corners are pretty consistent... Got loads of goals and assists from them at Chelsea as well.

4429~~~
100% agreed. Who could forget his free-kicks against us, and that cat-like save DDG made once.

4430~~~
If for nothing other than the fact that he can neither attack or defend when a set piece is taken so unless he takes it himself, he's useless on the pitch for that duration.

4431~~~
Hope we start Mata over Di Maria on Sunday again, he has been poor recently and his suspension was a blessing in disguise, I would be pretty annoyed if he got given a starting place because he's Di Maria who cost 60m where as Mata deserves one over form

4432~~~
I didn't think Mata was exceptional against Tottenham, but then it'd be unfair to expect too much from him considering how much of our play went down the opposite flank. He did well, brilliant touch and ball retention throughout and he put in a shift which was nice to see. Not all your players can be match-winners in a single game.

4433~~~
I mentioned in the match day thread how natural Mata and Herrera look playing together.  Convenient observation given their nationality I know, but it's not the first time I've noticed it.

4434~~~
He and the rest of the team that started again Spurs at least deserve the chance to fail against Liverpool.

4435~~~
I'm not that surprised to be honest. He's been playing on the wing for much of his career. During his time in Valencia and Chelsea, he mostly played from the right side, and he relishes the freedom he gets from that wide attacking midfielder role.

4436~~~
I wrote earlier in this thread that Mata brings a fluency to our passing and him and Herrera playing together see us move the ball around a lot quicker. Only issue is that he doesn't offer much defensively but I was pleased to see him harry and chase back against Spurs. Same team against Liverpool, Di Maria on the bench to offer us something different if it isn't working.

4437~~~
This will be close I reckon. Mata wasn’t really great on Sunday, he did good job combining with Herrera, had a lot of nice touches and put a shift defensively but I don’t think he was a direct danger. I could say the same about Young.

Liverpool will be all over us, their pressing is much more aggressive so I went for Young + Di Maria because they look more threatening on the counter, and they are better at tracking back. But to be honest, I won’t complain about any setup because there are reasons to play each one of them. Playing Mata would be a good message to Di Maria too.

4438~~~
Earlier we were playing 3 strikers with one of them in the midfield. Now we are playing Rooney in his proper position. RVP, Falcao out, Mata, Herrera in. Its clear why we looked good. Lets not mess around with this formation too much. Give it time to develop.

4439~~~
I feel like he'll go back to Rooney in midfield and RVP up front as soon as he's fit.

4440~~~
It'll be madness if he does.

4441~~~
Nicked this off another forum. Thought it was quite good

4442~~~
Another reason why I think the thought of selling Mata is crazy. If and I believe we will qualify for the Champions League, Mata is one of the first players I will be looking to for that competition.

4443~~~
That same guy in that thread also states that Mata is comfortably better than Silva...

Anyway... Yeah, the only reason to sell him would be for the money, which, frankly, the club shouldn't need. Great impact sub, even if he's not a first team player week in-week out, which I don't think he should be, especially in a 433.

He's just not got 'it' in my opinion, and there's no escaping his limitations (I don't believe signing pace will actually solve anything), but still he has some valuable assets.

His stats. at Chelsea are good, and Chelsea <i>were </i>quite crap. but I still think that's partly <i>why </i>he got the goals and assists he did. You'd think - well if he can manage that at a poor Chelsea, imagine what he'd do at a much better Man City (say 2011-12.) But swap him for Silva and City are quite a bit weaker as a whole unit, in my opinion. That control they have (or had) over games and that ability to keep the ball deep in the opponent's half is reduced significantly.

I guess it comes down to whether you think his added goals would make up for it.

4444~~~
Did anyone think Mata looked a lot fitter and leaner against Spurs? Been put through his paces perhaps?

4445~~~
Been left out of the Spanish squad.

4446~~~
Can't complain about that, to be honest. Just needs to force his way back into our first eleven, and he'll be back.

4447~~~
He wont get in the NT anywhere soon, Silva, Cazorla, Isco have been miles better.

4448~~~
I think it was the determination to keep his place. He knew he'd have to give everything, in terms of both attack and defense, to keep his place in the side for today's game.

4449~~~
For Mata, its keeping the ball that's his main problem. I also think other teams know to put pressure on him and he he will either loose the ball or pass it to the player that's most nearest to him which effectively stops him from influencing the game. He needs to be in the vicinity where he has players around him so he can bounce of them which isn't always the case in the way we play.

 I think the forward players can make more use of Fellani upfront with the space that is freed up, if your in close quarters of him, 95% of the time in that situation where defenders are tugging at him, he will try to get the ball to who he can see visibly and that's where people like Mata, Januzaj can exploit making those inside runs into the box. I know it sounds like an old fashion tactic but with the intensity that teams play at today, then you need to be looking for the space that become available, especially in the final third.

4450~~~
Great to see him starting, was expecting Di Maria! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4451~~~
Seize it Juan.

Needs a defining big match away game.

4452~~~
I'm not sure it was wise to start him. Hope to be proved wrong, but I've had a thing about Mata playing away games, he usually seems to play to about half the level he can.

Hope he proves me wrong and scores.

4453~~~
This.

4454~~~
Chuffed to bits for him and it's great man management by Van Gaal after that long length on the side lines. He put in the performance against Spurs and he's putting faith in him for arguably the biggest game of the season. 

Not only is that a big message to Juan but a big message to the rest of the squad.

4455~~~
Not expecting anything big. Just keep it tidy and help us keep possession and he'd have done his job.

4456~~~
Surprising selection, it makes Herrera and Valencia's game more difficult, they'll have to be very disciplined.

4457~~~
Defensively he did fine against Rose (who is quick like Moreno) and their other winger. While di Maria is obviously quicker, he seems lazier defensively.

4458~~~
We dominated possession in that game and if we'd played Di Maria Moreno would be less inclined to push on and leave space in behind, now he'll feel free to bomb forward and link with Coutinho or Sterling.

4459~~~
Potentially. Fingers crossed it won't be an issue

4460~~~
I expect to eat a piece of humble Paella after that first half from Mata. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4461~~~
Proven many wrong, he's been the best player on the pitch.

4462~~~
Good thing Moreno felt free to bomb forward and do nothing.

4463~~~
Who says he can't play on the wing? Been absolutely amazing this match. I was in the camp of starting ADM ahead of him.

How wrong I was. He and Herrera seem to have telepathic abilities the way they combine.

4464~~~
Happy for him, he has a future at United.

4465~~~
Looked after the ball much better and his defensive work has been good. Really good first half

4466~~~
Still the best attacking midfielder in England when in this form.

4467~~~
He has also been showing a high work rate today. Not a liability at all.

4468~~~
You sexy bastard!

Both finishes were pure sex

Oh my god

I'm in love and this time...it's the real thing. 

What a beautiful, sexy and fantastic man.

4474~~~
Mata just broke the internet.

Orgasmic <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

4477~~~
My god what a goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4478~~~
Can't wait for his post-Liverpool blog now.

Hugs. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4479~~~
I said it all along - the guy is our best technical player. He should play in Barcelona.

4480~~~
Brilliant for him to get the two goals today, really hitting some form now. Hopefully he can sustain it.

4481~~~
Best 2 performances in recent times coincide with him and Herrera both on the field. They play so well together.

4482~~~
He's a magnificent footballer... magnificent.

4483~~~
Where are the haters now... <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>?

4484~~~
Currently at 99% in the motm voting. Says it all.

4485~~~
Always been adamant he should be starting, he's class and we're a better team when he's in the side.

4486~~~
Perfect example of skill > physique

4487~~~
Fecking brilliant today. Both him and Herrera were unstoppable. Linked up so well.

Should always have a spot on the wing from here on out. He seems to be playing so well in that position cutting inside.

4488~~~
This x100

4489~~~
lol at people who said he's a luxury player. Tough game at anfield and he was comfortably our best player.

4490~~~
Even if he didn't score those 2 great goals, his performance was flawless. Great passing, great retention and intelligence on the ball. The goals made his performance a 10/10 for me. He blew me away today.

4491~~~
Check my posts... I have been banging this drum as well.

He is a class footballer, he should be playing, end of.

4492~~~
Seriously, who in their right mind would doubt this mans ability as a footballer? What a brilliant player and a superb finish on the second goal. 

I fecking love you Juan. Hugs

4493~~~
That's ridiculous... what are 1% of people doing?!

4494~~~
What a player.

4495~~~
Beautiful bastard ....

4496~~~
Always said he should start. Ridiculous he hasn't been.

4497~~~
I wonder what <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> thinks of his performance.

4498~~~
Beautiful player.

4499~~~
Brilliant game by him.

That second goal was just divine.

4500~~~
Too weak. Can't play in away games. Defensively not good enough etc. etc. etc.

4501~~~
Sublime performance. That second goal is up there with my all time favourite Man United goals, considering the style and importance. Surely he'll stay in the team now.

4502~~~
We've been waiting ages for a game that Mata dominates and wins on his own. And what a game to do it in.

4503~~~
Lovely footballer. Can't believe some idiots would want to sell him.

4504~~~
Chelsea reject Chelsea reject wohoaaa wohoaaa

4505~~~
happy for him.

the last 2 months prior to the spurs game were pretty tough for him, but now he is there to stay in the starting line up.

4506~~~
Brilliant second goal. What a technique.

This game is so much like that Anfield game where Forlan scored 2. Hilarious Liverpool cock ups, 2 goal heroes, even down to the score. On a serious note, we still can do better. Got sloppy and uncertain at times with our passing later in the game. But that first half performance was the best I've ever seen us play at Anfield since I can remember.

4507~~~
He's produced some great performances in the past for us but today he took it to another level.  Finally we have the right system to accommodate him and Rooney and surprise, surprise he's thriving (as is Rooney)

4508~~~
Brilliant performance all around even if you ignore the goals. Ran the show, Liverpool couldn't get close to him. Should have taken the pen, it was seriously as close as you can get to a perfect performance from him. Brilliant.

4509~~~
Gary Neville screaming in the background like a little girl when Mata scored his 2nd made my day. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

His performance against Tottenham and today against Liverpool. This is what made Mata one of the best players in the league while playing for Chelsea. When he's on form, he's a nightmare for the opposition.

4510~~~
Excellent performance, not just the two world class finishes but his composure and awareness on the ball was superb, easily the best game he's ever had in a United shirt.

4511~~~
He made the scousers cry<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4512~~~
With Mata emulating Iniesta but on the right winger, do we have fixed one wing ?

4513~~~
Hugs Juan <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> What a man and what a performance

4514~~~
Absolutely brilliant! His best game for United by a considerable distance. That goal will go down in history along with the Berbatov and Rooney goals.

I screamed and yelped when he scored that.

4515~~~
That's the player we (or rather David Moyes) paid £40m for.

Someone who can make key contributions in massive games. Who has quality in abundance. Who was genuinely considered to be better than Silva by an awful lot of people only two years ago.

F*cking get the f*ck in, Mata! Repaying our faith in him!

4516~~~
Sensational performance.. I apologise for doubting you Juan.

4517~~~
MOTM and a dream goal. Fallaini put in another top shift too. God bless Moyesy.

4518~~~
World class performance. He was a cut above the rest today.

4519~~~
Well I am glad I have always believed in him (have to add I fell in love with him when he was at Valencia, and even when he was great for Chelsea, for me he still didn't reach his Valencia level at Chelsea and was more exciting to watch as a Valencia player).

Oh and the way he had been called a pub/sunday league player last season especially by Carragher and Neville was shocking. He was playing in a new and completely disjointed team under a clueless manager and ppl expected wonders. Of course back then it was in to critisize Mata because everybody's darling Mourinho got rid off him. Carragher and Neville have done really well for their clubs, but they could only dream of even getting close to Mata's skill, touch, technique and intelligence. But hey, they still have the balls to call him a pub/sunday league player.

4520~~~
Absolutely world class performance from him today. Sensational stuff. A Mata in this form is just a pure joy to watch.

4521~~~
Much like Forlan, Mata will be immortal to Man Utd fans now. Two tremendous finishes, especially the second. Lord above what a bicycle kick!

4522~~~
Two world class goals, world class performance. And if he hadn't already he has now cemented a place in all our hearts. What a beautiful man.

4523~~~
Gem of a player. Possibly the best tekkers in the team. LvG loves him, there's no way he's going to be sold.

4524~~~
Brilliant. Not much more to say.

Let's hope these last two games were the catalysts that spurred his career at the club to new heights. He has everything necessary to play a big part in taking us back to where we should be.

4525~~~

4526~~~
As Carrick said, he's a little magician. I don't want to see him out of the team for a second again, he's just too good.

4527~~~
Juan has just cemented he's place in Utd fan folk law. He was outstanding today, one of the best individual performances I've seen for some time from a Utd player.

4528~~~
Classic performance that will never be forgotten by United fans. That goal was the best moment of the season for me.

4529~~~
Its incredible. With the right players around him, he can be the centerpiece of a very very good team.

4530~~~
Two excellent goals indeed. So happy for the man. Just felt Rooney should have allowed him to go for the hat-trick. Next week more of the same please.

4531~~~
Thanks Moyesy!

4532~~~
He's given us Fellaini and Mata, maybe we shouldn't be so harsh on him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4533~~~
I take back all criticism, Juan.

4534~~~
he would have bought Herrera too, he knows his stuff.

4535~~~
While Di Maria and Falcao sat on the bench. Incredible

4536~~~
And Shaw. Clearly those two were his buys.

4537~~~
Juan Mata, Mata 
He scored with a bicycle kick,
And made all the scousers feel sick,
Juan Mata, Mata

4538~~~
Even without the goals, he would have been the best player in the match. Made the team kicked, and never lost posession.

Briliant player!

4539~~~
I think he's been excellent for the last two games. He's been better in general since I whinged about him after the Southampton game...but he's doing what he should be doing now. Taking the ball in difficult situations and making things happen, instead of taking it in easy situations and passing it sideways.

4540~~~
It's matches like these which define you, I still remember the "he's not a United player" argument and that's definitely put to bed.

He certainly has nailed himself in the lineup.

Sorry Mourinho but this lad really does track for the team, what an engine.

4541~~~
Always loved Mata - so happy for him today. A performance never to be forgotten for us fans. Hugs Juan<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4542~~~
2 goals vs them. This will be talked about for years. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4543~~~
I was wrong on this guy. I thought he wasn't a United player. Glad to say I am being proven wrong. What a wonderful footballer. As we move to a more 'continental' style of play he will become a key player for us. 

Magician.

4544~~~
Fantastic stuff from him.  

Really hope this gets him going properly as a United player now.  A quality player in every way.

4545~~~
Mata and Herrera were a joy to watch. Desperately hope it's not too late for him to stay beyond this summer.

4546~~~
Looks so much better with a proper midfield in support. Always knew he could play from the outside tucking in, but it's never happening with the wrong system.

4547~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i58.tinypic.com/2itge8l.jpg" src="http://i58.tinypic.com/2itge8l.jpg"/>

4548~~~
Best game of his United career. Always liked him from day one, he'll be more of a cult here now. That second goal in particular will never be forgotten. Who said he van't play in away matches?

4549~~~
To score that goal in a game of such magnitude - All one can say is 'What an absolute legend'. One of the greatest ever man utd goals considering the magnitude of it all...I have been a big critic of his as he has been anonymous in some other big games this season. But fair play to Mata and Fellaini....both of them have cemented their first team places and both have been crucial to our recent good form. 8 more games to go

4550~~~
Been saying all season he's been our best attacking player, hopefully this will cement his place in the starting XI. Should be one of the first 3-4 names on the team sheet.

4551~~~

4552~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Hang on, he even switched to a red kit straight after the goal. He really is a magician!

4553~~~
About 3 minutes before Mata scored (from goonersworld)

4554~~~
Panic buy.

4555~~~
I will always remember him for this goal. Hopefully I'll remember him for a lot more too.

4556~~~
Been on the fence with him. Two terrific performances, the world class performances we have been waiting for a year now. Chuffed for the guy. 

More of this, Juan.

4557~~~
Bang on. Nobody will forget what he's done for us today. Makes it even better that's he's such a great character too.

4558~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4559~~~
Special goal from a special player. I was one of those who questioned his ability to play in these games but I don't think we can doubt his ability now. Hopefully he keeps his place on the right side of the team and continues to put in match winning displays like today.

4560~~~
Thought he would struggle today because of Liverpool's pressing but i don't think he gave the ball away once, this is the Mata we have been waiting to see, a player worthy of being at the heart of your attacks.

4561~~~
Hopefully he can nail down that position now.

4562~~~
Let's not forget the first goal. That was fecking brilliant as well

4563~~~
Not only great with the way he took his goals, but the guy is so good in possession it's a breath of fresh air. Him and Herrera have a great understanding and knock it about each other until one finds space, it's fantastic to watch. Made up for the lad. Who says you need to be rapid to make an impact from the wing?

4564~~~

4566~~~
lol i couldn't get the celebration gif so used an old one.

4567~~~
I was ready to drop him for this game. I was thinking of Shaw(if fit) and then have Blind and Carrick with Herrera taking Juan's position in a 4231.

4568~~~
I want to kiss his lovely little face all over.

But then tbf, I always want to do that.

4569~~~
Mata leaving next season? Not a bloody hope. Fantastic performance by the special Juan.

4570~~~
Encouraging words from LVG about finally having found a position for Mata. Could be a very important player for our system next season. Has to work on his consistency, but today is all about Mata. Stunning goals.

4571~~~
LVG's comments about Mata being one of his best players should reassure those of us who worried he'd be sold. This false winger position will hopefully see us stick with Mata in the first team.

4572~~~

4573~~~
Second goal was a bit special, very good finishing today. If he's going to be that clinical more often than not, I think he's fine on the right

4574~~~
I think that the attitude of the team has held him back. As the team improve, i'm sure Mata will become more influential. I doubt he's going anywhere anytime soon.

4575~~~
Is it just me or did he look pretty quick today running for the first goal? Moreno is fast as feck, but couldn't catch him. Against Tottenham, Mata also looked pretty quick covering distance. In the past he has looked pedestrian at times. 

Overall a terrific performance by him, and he is just such a likable character as well.

4576~~~
Happy to admit i was wrong when i wrote that i didn't think Mata was the right choice for the Liverpool game, he really performed great and 2 nice goals.
He has earned a start for the rest of our games!

4577~~~
What a Performance! Sorry for being sceptical Special Juan!

4578~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i57.tinypic.com/4kadch.jpg" src="http://i57.tinypic.com/4kadch.jpg"/>

4579~~~
He is not slow, but he doesn't have a great acceleration.

4580~~~
When on song, Mata is simply a joy to watch, world class. I remember he made me watch a couple of Chelsea games a few years back. Admittedly, I've doubted his defensive solidity and pace in a team that wants to keep a high tempo. His world class attacking skills have never been in doubt though and he was clearly man of the match today.

4581~~~

4582~~~
He also has great attitude, always thankful and humble. I like reading his blog post match. He's a really likeable guy and is full of United quality

4583~~~
<b>
</b>
Hopeful the manager knows now how good he is, and he should forget about the "balance" philosophy he constantly talked about. The team we have since the Spurs game is a balance team with Mata and Carrick. And the subs made were upsetting the balance to be honest.

4584~~~
Very true, can only agree with you there. And yes I read the blog every week too. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4585~~~
Gave away the ball for their goal which is the worry but two world class finishes. Love the bloke.
Am in Thailand, was my birthday yesterday and we beat scum away with stampy lasting 45 secs. Sometimes life is great.

4586~~~
What a beautiful second goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. I could watch that all day.

4587~~~
He needs to play.

4588~~~
That was Carrick

4589~~~
It's Carrick who tried to dribble ?

4590~~~
I've felt sorry for him because he was getting loads of unfair criticism from fans for not producing in a crap system with a group of out of form players.

He's a sublime player, and he's one of the best to watch when he's in form.

4591~~~
Yeah..

4592~~~
Love him! I could not understand why he was benched for so long because he wasn't playing badly. I was happy to see him getting his chance against Spurs. He was great in that game and today he was great again. He's in good form and he deserves his spot in the team.

I think LVG realizes this seeing that he didn't change the line-up compared to last week. Good decision.

4593~~~
Thanks, I was wondering who it was.

4594~~~
Hugs

4595~~~
Love him so much. I hope Di Maria comes good, as having those two on either flank could be incredible.

4596~~~
Can't wait for his blog.

4597~~~
MOTM and deserves to keep his spot in the team. I like his attitude too.

4598~~~
Hey Liverpool you haven't lost in 13 league matches? You're one of the best in form teams?

It doesn't Mata!

4599~~~
Where are Smalling and Fellaini? Big man discrimination? <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

4600~~~
Cannot believe some wanted him out a few weeks back. Terrific player.

4601~~~
What a performance from Juan Mata today! Simply incredible.

People say he's a lot better as a 10, and I guess he was excellent there for Chelsea, and his numbers were brilliant. However, as a number 10, I find that the games where the middle is congested, and we have a team against us that defends with 10 men behind the ball, sometimes Mata can go missing, and doesn't get involved much. On the flank; however, Mata sees a lot of the ball, and he's able to drift in from the flank and influence the game from the middle just like he did today. He made the most touches <b>(90)</b> and passes <b>(73) </b>in the whole game as a right midfielder. I've always said he should be used similar to how City use Silva, and that's how he was used today. He was superb.

4602~~~
Still out on the pitch winning headers

4603~~~
Fantastic performance from the little magician today! Credit to him for his attitude to work his way back into the team and fight for his place!

4604~~~
Amazing goal.

Superstar.

4605~~~
Judging by LVG's comments this is probably where he'll continue to be played. This could be really good for us.

4606~~~
Amazing isn't it ? When he scored, I celebrated it as if I was the one who scored it. I even love his movement and control for the first. His technique is so consistent.

4607~~~
I fecking love Juan Mata. Probably second to my grandmother as my favorite person in the world.

4608~~~
Hope so. It gives us an extra body in midfield, which allows us to keep the ball better, whilst Valencia gives the width on the right.

4609~~~
Was mad when Rooney took the penalty, should've let Mata get his hattrick, he deserved it. What a second goal, hope ADM doesn't get off the bench for him.

4610~~~
Seems like we've finally found a place for Mata. He's so fecking loveable.

4611~~~
Couldn't agree more. He looks great as a wide playmaker with the license to come in. That's how he played for Valencia and also for Chelsea in his first season.

4612~~~
I think it is due to distance to the camera and the position. When he played like  10 or 8 in two striker system he was quite lost there, he's not the right guy to burst forward and press the keeper or anyone, on the right when the combination's rightly timed and Herrera's perfect guy to make 1-2 with, you can be send free that right hand side and the defender doesn't have a chance to catch you. I was also little bit surprised to see Mata driving past Moreno tbh but that's him he's intelligent little poacher who can find spaces.

I also hope that Rafael is coming on for Valencia, not tha Valencia wasn't solid enough but this understanding between Juan and Ander could be utilized even more as Rafael is another intelligent player onlike Antonio-robot--Valencia.

Anyway as for Mata two sublime finishes, I am very pleased for him, the second goal was pretty much Berbatov-esque, shame he didn't complete his hattrick like Bulgarian that day..

4613~~~
No matter how his career ends for United, that performance and those goals at Anfield resulting in a win will make him a legend for us. Hope he gets a great chant out of it now. Classy player that links well with Herrera and Carrick and with Rooney. No surprise.

4614~~~

Shades of Rooney against City on that goal. Not as good of course but I fecking love beating those cnuts.

Needs a song surely?

4616~~~
This Mata performance will be remembered for decades, much like Forlan's.

4617~~~
He's small,
He's nice,
He fecked the Scousers twice

The finish for the first goal was fantastic as well. If we're going to play one up front from now on, we'll need our wingers to be reliable finishers. Mata is exactly that.

Probably? I sense some doubt. We need a tiebreaker.

Who would you shag - your granny or Mata?

We both know the answer, don't we.

Juan Mata is now your favorite person in the world.

Watch herrera when he scores that goal. He's off the screen the moment it happens, but comes on just at the end and looks like he has his hand on his head in disbelief <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'm still giddy thinking about it.

It's Russian.

I'd love to have a screencap or some wallpaper or whatever from 25ish second when you've got all those cnuts looking his way and he's already in the air producing magic, would be my new desktop or that 'in the background' photo on facebook <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

False right-winger.

4636~~~
Also potentially helps to resolve one of our problem areas. Who needs to sign new wingers when we have Juan sexying things up on the right?

4637~~~
It is days like today that make being a football fan worthwhile. I was delirious at times in that game. I was laughing like a maniac at the Gerarrd moment and Mata's goal!

4638~~~
That was as good a performance as I can remember for a long time by an attacking player of ours in a big big match. His control over everything he was doing was top notch, he never looked like losing the ball ever, and his goals were top notch. Well done Mata.

One of my friends sisters does the make up for most of Uniteds Wags. For my birthday my mate asked her to get a Juan Mata shirt signed, anyway she gets the signed shirt but he made it out in her brothers name.... So my mate (who is a Leeds fan) has a really nice framed Mata shirt with his feckin name on it. When he sent me the pic I nearly cried.

4641~~~
Love him.  I feel vindicated for pleading his case all season when others have said he's too lightweight and other such rubbish.

Just a little Mata...but very important.  <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Such a shame he never took the penalty at the end, though. I'd be built a statue out of my own shite for him outside my house if he scored a hattrick away at Liverpool. We'd have still been talking about that for years.

4643~~~
Brilliant today. He lifted our tempo, controlled our play and scored 2 fantastic goals. Deserves to feature more for sure.

4644~~~
You sound like the kind of guy who sees restraining orders as a challenge.

4645~~~
I'm also going to take credit for being a season-long member of the Mata fan club (although I did post a few times in the autumn, wondering why his performances had been so muted.) I love the guy to bits!

4646~~~
Massive performance. Hope we see him as a permanent fixture in that position now. The link-up between him and Herrera is superb.

4647~~~
Wonderful performance. He, Herrera and Valencia build a holy triangle. Surely he deserves his starting place now

4648~~~
Cannot wait for tomorrow's blog. Suave little bastard

4649~~~
Yep, feeling vindicated today. "Too lightweight", "not creative", "can't do it in big games", "shouldn't play away from home", "Chelsea reject", "panic buy", etc etc. Let's hope that's the last we hear of that nonsense.

4650~~~
Still can't get over that goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>  Was really good defensively as well I thought. 4 interceptions, 1 tackle (Herrera had 7 tackles and 3 interceptions as well, who said these spaniards are too lightweight?)

Seems to be really suited to that role out as a false winger as Van Gaal called it. Combines brilliantly with Herrera and Valencia as well.

4651~~~
Am I the only saddo that thought "I can't wait to read his blog" when he scored the second goal?

4652~~~
So unfair to judge a player when he's not getting regular games.  

And it's not just his ability - it's his whole demeanour/attitude, not just on the pitch, but off it.

4653~~~
No you are not. I did as well.

4655~~~
Whenever there has been discussion about our best XI I have always included him since the day he arrived, ahead of RVP, Di Maria, Herrera, Fellaini etc. In fact for a couple of months he was costing me a point in the predictions every week as I refused to not predict him in the line-up as it never made sense for him to be left out. Buzzing for him.

4656~~~
Great post. The day he arrived was one of the biggest moments in the club history. To be totally honest, in a fully honest way, I have to say we're not exactly suppose to be able to sign a player like that. In all honesty he should be signed up for a club like Real Madrid or Barcelona. I still wake up every morning feeling like a kid on christmas day when I realise we actually signed this guy. 

€37m - should go down as the biggest bargains in the club history.

4657~~~
His link up play with Herrera was sex

4658~~~
A bit ott mate lol but the wee fella is a magician

4659~~~
I can't see your post.

4660~~~
Another WUM post

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4661~~~
I've been a critic of Mata so it was great to see him so clinical in front of goal today. That said, his pure output in terms of goals and assists has never really been the issue.

I do think that the current system and his position in it, suits Mata. The danger with him playing centrally is that he doesn't offer much defensively, and when he has a bad game he tends to be completely invisible. On the wing neither of those things are such a problem, and he has Herrera covering on his side, chipping in defensively as well.

Basically I like him in this role although if he could just try to somehow become a little quicker then he would be much more dangerous out wide. Still with Herrera in support and a FB overlapping, Mata has great license to cut inside and influence the game, which is what he does very well. It also poses a problem to the opponents marking him.

4662~~~
To be fair, there's an argument that it didn't make sense to play him earlier in the season. When we always had two up front, it arguably made more sense for Rooney to play in behind RVP and Falcao since he generally offers a higher overall workrate than Mata.

Now though, we seem to have found a system which suits Mata's game, and he's also upped his own game as well. I really like him, but he was often fairly anonymous earlier in the season and would struggle to make an overall impact on a match in his play. He's fixed that now though, and has found both a level of productivity and excellent football.

4663~~~
That's a fair point. If we play two strikers it is hard to accomodate Mata, but at this point and time we have given every single other attacking two a try and this 4-1-4-1 we played today and again Spurs has been pure sex.

So Rooney can start up top but Mata gets on the pitch every day for me as the other attacking player.

4664~~~
Yep, I'd agree right now.

4665~~~
I thought he was destined to be sold in the summer but he has looked like the player he was at Chelsea in the last two games and arguably that is his best position playing on right of a front three, he took both goals brilliantly today and I hope it continues.

4666~~~
2 outstanding finishes today

4667~~~
His touch was impeccable today. He never looked troubled in possession.

4668~~~
Best #10 in the side by far. Next season he needs to be starting there week in week out.

Said it for ages but Mata is so far ahead of anyone in that position in the team it's unrreal. Best touch and close control by a mile.

4669~~~
Looking so forward to his blog tomorrow.

4670~~~
He is indeed. He has a unique combination of vision, intelligence, finishing, and patience that is rare. Towards the end when we were controlling the ball in their half, he could've easily gone for goal or passed it to another attacker, but instead opted to keep possession. Fantastic player all around.

4671~~~
That's that, he's done enough for me to call him a legend just like Berba had with his hat-trick against the feckers. But just how good was the 2nd goal though? He's awesome <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4672~~~
Add to that his production. Statistics don't always tell a story but you can't ignore that Mata gets assists and gets goals. He manages to take those attributes you've correctly highlighted but also convert them to real tangible end products consistently.

4673~~~
The more I watch it the better it gets.

4674~~~
Absolutely love the little magician.  Skills are only matched by his great attitude.  How many other players can respond as well as he has after being left out of the team for a good portion of the season?  Sure he must have been disappointed, but never complained and is always a great teammate.  Anyone recall towards the end of the game, when he could have attempted a low percentage shot to get his hat trick but instead pulled back and wasted more time?  Announcer said it best "Mata cares more about getting 3 points than he does about getting his 3rd goal".  Ultimate professional.  So stoked for him.

4675~~~
Actually given mata's lack of physicality I think herrera looks better than him in central areas and hence as a number 10 albiet from central midfield. Mara was our best player today though. This right sided midfielder position is suiting him superbly.

4676~~~
His second looks better every time you see it, sublime finish.

4677~~~
he was mustard today

4678~~~
Actually it looks the same. Because it's the same goal.

<span style="color: #ffffff">lollll</span>

Mata needs a chant not quite sure it will ever catch on but I sing this on fifa when Mata scores <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/> Change "my girl" to "Mata"

4680~~~
Alright sassy.

4681~~~
Ha!

4682~~~
Looked like he did during his best form for us today, influencing things and dictating play.

4683~~~
Admit it though, he wasn't this attractive in blue as he is in red.

And by attractive, I mean good at football... yep, that's what I mean.

4684~~~
<span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 12px">The two goals aside, he was tracking really well and contributing so well defensively.

This role really suits him, he has so much freedom to do what he wants knowing Valencia can cover wide and Herrera can offer support.

He is a Latin symbol for sex personified on a beautifully manscaped beard. The red on him brings out the desire for lust.</span></span>

4685~~~
Blue brought out his face  a bit more. Just need him to turn up vs Shitty now.

That goal was better than Rooney's against City and as good as Berba's against Liverpool. There I said it! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4688~~~
The more I see it, the higher I rank it. Proper contact, great technique and it would only be bettered if it was at Old Trafford.

4689~~~
Best goal we've scored in Anfield? Rafael's and Berbatov's come to mind for recent great goals, but Mata's is better.

4690~~~
I hope this puts an end to the whole "he's not quick enough" argument that the likes of Gary Neville have lapped up. No one brought this up at Chelsea when he was roaming as a playmaker around the pitch. Mata is a player who can seize control of a game with his intelligence and assured play with the ball. It's not like he's unproven in the league. He was arguably in the top 5 players at Chelsea!! When you have his skill, work with it.

4691~~~
I just woke up, I honestly don't know what to say. Don't have a clear memory of the whole game but those goals, just amazing. The 2nd will be remembered by United fans forever.

Obviously I have always been on Mata's side and these arguments like, can't do it away, can't do it again physical teams, wrong signing, no future etc, whatever your opinion is, he will forever be remembered now. It's simple, it's not rugby, it's football, play your best footballers and you will get what you want.

A massive hug to everyone.

4692~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Also just woke up. Last night's game was just a haze for me because I was so tired.

4693~~~
Berbatov's was at OT

4694~~~
Both of his goals today were top notch. 

But that second goal was simply outrageous.

4695~~~
Best in recent memory. Probably since Becks in 97? Charlton and Robson have a couple classics of yore tho.

He was their player of the year 2 years running. If we're toying with "arguable" terms, he was arguably their best player.

4696~~~
I think he means top 5 in the league, whilst a Chelsea player.

4697~~~
Aha. Makes more sense. Ignore me.

4698~~~
I'm talking the entire league!!

4699~~~
Played very well today.  Cemented himself as a starter for at least the next match.  Di Maria is not himself.  Aside from the assist to the wonder goal that Mata scored, he was pretty awful.  It didn't help his nerves or confidence to catch a ball in the field of play.  Mata though...even if you don't count the goals he was definitely one of the best players for us today.

4700~~~
Was rightly criticized for his poor first half of the season. Gave the ball away and looked slow and lightweight all the time.

Since January he's been good and should have played more. Spurs and today's game showed that he can play on the wing at a high level.

This is huge. To get Mata playing at this level is brilliant.  

He's manned the feck up in a big way and I couldn't be happier.

Get him on all set piece duty too.

4701~~~

4702~~~
An absolutely fantastic footballer

Hugs.

4712~~~
He looks especially sharp in our white strip. It's a lovely uniform.

4713~~~
The whole substitute bench were immensely happy with the second goal. Classic.  Great little player.

4714~~~
Matachester

4715~~~
United

4716~~~
If we sell him in the summer, I will be pissed. We should build the team around players like him and Herrera.

Finally a midfield, who doesn't shit themself when pressed.

4717~~~
He is the only player I have ever seen pull off having the top button done up.

4718~~~
Every time I see this goal. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4719~~~
Before the Liverpool game, when was the last time he scored away from home? Sunderland? When was the last time he had this sort of impact in an away fixture?

You just don't sell players like Mata. Two world class finishes. The first touch for his first goal was impeccable. He put in the defensive work as well which he's often criticised for. Can't see him being played behind the striker now for various reasons - Van Gaal's post-match comments about balance may indicate that he doesn't favour Mata behind a striker - but on the right is where I've wanted him to play since the start of the season. This is also a massive indicator that you don't need to build the team around him to get the best out of him. Really delighted for him.

4720~~~
He won Chelsea player of the season 2 years in a row playing from the right hand side. He's been excellent in that position for us. 8 goals this season.  Juan Love.

4721~~~
When he is on his game he is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Hope he can be consistent for the rest of the season and not drift in and out of games.

4722~~~
He's certainly happier in this new role. He hated being forced to play as a creative midfielder. The 433 gives him license to drift everywhere. He loves that, as does Herrera and Fellaini. If LVG continues with this formation, the team will play with even greater understanding. Its looking good.

4723~~~

What a performance. Sheer class. So happy to see him enjoying his football again.

4731~~~
What a game he had yesterday. He's brilliant as a false winger in a 4-3-3 and his link up play with Herrera is wonderful. I still can't get over them two goals <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4732~~~
This! It was also really nice to hear LvG say how impressed he was and mention how important Mata is to the team and how much Mata is in his thoughts. I was worried Mata could be sold in the Summer, but LvG's comments yesterday alleviated most of those worries.

I told a friend of mine before the game that Mata would score (I also said that we would win 0-3 with Rooney scoring two, to be fair..). The thing he objected to was that I said Mata would score.

What a time to be alive <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Thanks, Juan, and hugs!

4736~~~
Honestly, it has to be one of the finest United performances i've seen away against a top side/rival. RvP against City two years ago was also brilliant, but this was also quite special. Not only did he score two majestic goals, he hardly put a foot wrong all game, and out right side just demolished Moreno yesterday

4737~~~
Love that!

4738~~~
By far and away his best performance for us so far. That was the Mata from Chelsea!

Not only his two beautifully taken goals, but just the way he absolutely ran the game, even from a wide position. Carry on like that and the position is his <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4742~~~

4743~~~
Liked this part-

<b><span style="font-size: 15px">Certainly during the past three months it has been possible to question the Mourinho-ish vogue for insisting the one quality attacking midfielders must have above all others is defensive discipline. For one thing Mata’s defensive frailties are perhaps overplayed. He will never be a tackler but under van Gaal he has made more interceptions per game than Cesc Fàbregas, Oscar, David Silva and Mesut Özil. Willian has made marginally more tackles (by 0.2 per game) and been dribbled past 0.3 times fewer. Against that Mata’s passing accuracy is better and despite playing less than Willian he has been directly involved in twice as many goals. At which point you start to wonder exactly which of these two attacking midfielders is failing to do some vital part of his job.</span></b>

4744~~~
Mourinho must be regretting selling him. His creativity and ability to pop up with a goal is something they really miss. Hazard is an amazing player of course and better then Mata, but after that, Mourinho definitely should have found a way to fit him in. Willian, Cuadrado, Oscar are nowhere close, and hell, not even Fabregas is as talented as Mata on his day. 

Delighted the way it worked out though and us having him now, think he'll thrive from now on if he doesn't get dropped or anything like that. Very few players in the prem can put in performances like he did yesterday.

4745~~~
Don't know if Mourinho regrets it, don't think he does but it was very strange declaring Oscar to be his number 10 just one month into the season on September without giving Mata a proper chance. Hopefully LVG will have properly sorted out this team by next season and we will see who is the better playmaker.

4746~~~
Such a nice guy Not sure how we will move forward with him. When he was on the right at Chelsea, teams ran at him down his side which he struggled to dea with. I would love to find a place for him to start every week though.

4747~~~
To be fair, Van Gaal's game plan changes that completely. Mourinho's ideas were all about absorbing pressure, breaking fast on the counters and utilizing pace in the final third. Van Gaal is all about pressing in defense and that "if you keep the ball, you cannot be hurt". In Van Gaal's team, Mata might not be the liability he'd be in Mourinho's team. Plus he appears insistent on moving the ball faster by pass than moving with the ball with dribbles.

4748~~~
In that case it may work. Hopefully.

4749~~~
To be honest, I don't think Mourinho really regrets it all that much. For one reason or another, Mata didn't really seem to fit into his style, which is why he wasn't getting a lot of first team football and eventually came to us.

I don't think the lack of a player like Mata is what Chelsea are struggling with creatively: their sometimes average (although often still very good) creative play often comes from the types of tactics Mourinho employs in certain games. Fabregas arguably edges Mata as an overall footballer and offers a lot creatively, as does Hazard obviously.

4750~~~
Maybe it was my screen.. or the kit.. or my eyes... but I swear he looked leaner on Sunday. Seemed to turn and spin a bit quicker too.
Class performance from him!

4751~~~
That's a bit of an exaggeration. Yes i did watch a ton of Chelsea games back then and at no point do i remember teams targeting him. Obviously Mata is of not much use to us defensively but like that article says his defensive frailties have been overplayed. There are loads of other attacking players who does equally or worse than him defensively. No other playmaker has been as harshly judged as Mata for his defensive contribution or the lack of it.

4752~~~
I had no idea that his name literally translates to Johnny Kills. What. A. Guy.

4753~~~
He certainly Mata'd that second goal.

4754~~~
I've been hoping to see him get time out wide since the season began, looked amazing out there so far!

So childish but I love it.

4756~~~
Wow, just like watching match of the day.

4757~~~
I really really hope its the start of a great time for him over here. He's such a lovable bastard. 

Plus if he plays regularly he'll get you 15 goals a season from the wing easily. That in itself his priceless.

He used to post on here didn't he?

4760~~~
That has to stick! Should be a banner every time Mata plays at Anfield.

4761~~~
I agree Hazard is amazing (not really a fan of the person, but can't deny his qualities on the pitch).  But why Jose did not try and work a front six of....

------Fabergas----Matic------
Willian/Oscar-Mata---Hazard
--------------Costa-----------

Sure you can sort some players around if you want more defense, say switch Fabergas for Mata and put Ramires next to Matic... but it baffles me to this day why Jose was not even a bit more thourough in trying to make this work.

Of course I couldn't be happier he didn't... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

It will be interesting to see if he can lock down that right forward role in the front 3, as I don't see LvG wanting to play him central in his midfield 3.

4766~~~
Class player, hope he keeps it up and is a key player next season. hope he starts taking our free kicks  <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4767~~~
I always liked Mata but if he were to leave this summer I wouldn't have be too fussed. After Sunday though I now want him to stay forever <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4768~~~
I think he already used him there in quite a few matches, though it depends on what you mean by 'central'. It's confusing because of all our switch ups, but when we were playing 5-3-2 I think he put Rooney in central midfield for the physical balance, so Mata could play as the most attacking midfielder in a midfield three.

I guess that's what he means with balance, he doesn't seem to like Carrick/Blind - Herrera - Mata as our midfield, if Herrera plays CM then he wants a physical player there with Fellaini, when Mata played in midfield he either played Rooney or Fellaini as CM.

4769~~~
I didn't realise his output was <i>that </i>good! Blimey thats impressive, especially as there are two clear periods in that time he hasn't even been first choice for two teams.

4770~~~
This.

4771~~~
We've tried so many combinations and formations this season that it does get confusing I agree, but I think the fallout of all the testing is that Di Maria and Mata will compete for an inverted wide role on the right, with neither doing enough physically to suit LvG in a midfield role. I think our 3 CM set-up next season will see Carrick/Blind/Herrera/Fellaini/New CM and when needed Rooney as the 6 options for the 3 spots.

4772~~~
This was the part of the article that struck me too.  An attacking midfielder's primary focus should be goal creation and goal scoring - it's incredible that people lose sight of that.  Mata may have been surplus to Mourinho's requirements, but I'm very happy to have him here.  I can't imagine many football fans in general who would say Chelsea get the best of the deal in trading Mata in for Willian.

4773~~~
Yes, can also be Johnny Woods. The place where he takes the bodies he kills, probably.

4774~~~
Juan Mata = John Bush.

4775~~~
Mata means "eye" in my language. So there has been plenty of times when someone's made daft unfunny comments when him and Blind are in the lineup.

4776~~~
Us English speakers have this hilarious pun, because Mata sounds very similar to matter.

4777~~~
Gotta love the guy.

He just gets better every day of the week. He will cure a disease by the end of his career, mark my words.

4780~~~
There's only Juan!
There's only Juan!
There's only Juan! Juan Mata!

There's only one!
There's only one!
There's only one Juan Mata!

4781~~~
Player of the month, well deserved. Hugs.

4782~~~
We needed to get more out of him. When he came we looked towards him and he was pretty decent. He had a few influential games but I think Di Maria was more the guy we looked towards for creativity. These last few games have to be Mata's level. That's what we want. He's too good a player to be a passenger. He's scored some very important goals in his career. He has a great mentality. He's really flourishing. He might even be better with a better quality full back offering width but I would hope he ends his days at the club. To me, he has the mentality of a United player and we need to ensure we get these performances out of him week after week.

4783~~~
That was a bit awkward.

4784~~~
He did something similar when he was at Chelsea.

4785~~~
Only because the guy was being a bit stiff and awkward. I mean how do you allow yourself to be in the presence of Juan Mata and not ask for a hug? Juan, if you are reading this, and ever find yourself in Toronto, please drop by my school with a signed jersey. I think I'd burst into tears.

4786~~~

4787~~~
Congrats to Mata, his last 2 games have been very good.

4788~~~
Great for him!

4789~~~
What a beautiful man.

4790~~~
Congrats, love to have him here. 

All this talk about him leaving was attrocious.

4791~~~
Does he say that his favourite player at United is David Herrera? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4792~~~
Class

4793~~~
He did, that was great. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4794~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4795~~~
Loved the look on his face when they asked who's the best free kick taker in the squad. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4796~~~
For a split second I was a bit confused when he said Iniesta was the best player he'd played with... sometimes you forget that he's a World Cup and European Championship winner...

4797~~~
David Herrera <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That was brilliant!

4798~~~
To the David Herrera thread!

4799~~~
What was his favourite city?

4800~~~
Oviedo i think

4801~~~
How can anyone have ever wanted rid.

I'd happily see us build towards playing every game with Mata just off the striker. Ridiculously productive, and you'd imagine he'd be here as long we want him.

Great man, and great attitude.

4802~~~
Well because he still has been a passenger for a very long time, 2 great matches dont undo that.

4803~~~
Never understood the passenger thing. He's always good for a goal or an assist. If he's providing goals and assists what more do people want from him.

4804~~~
He was an easy target for some fans because he wasn't as involved. But in reality, how could he be, when we were just lumping it, Mata was the one who would always suffer the most. The times we have played good football, he has been involved and productive.

4805~~~
Why not David Di Herrera? Get rid.

4806~~~
WTF

4807~~~
David Herrera would be my favourite United player of all time!

4808~~~
Not sure that's fair. He had some pretty anonymous games when Fellaini was injured/not in the team, infact I'd say mostly Fellaini not in the team, or when Fellaini was playing deep. He wasn't the only one, and there were mitigating factors for sure but I'm not sure his fluctuation in form had anything to do with us sometimes resorting to lumping it. The lack of pace or movement or link up etc.etc. - sure.

4809~~~
What did he mean when he said "easy" in reply to who the best FK taker at United was? Was he suggesting that he was the best? Or Rooney? Di Maria?

4810~~~
Yeh, no doubt the inclusion of Herrera has helped things a lot but that's still in the same argument as him getting the ball in dangerous areas. So often the ball was played around the back and the space in midfield was non-existent because teams were able to shape up against us. So I guess my point is that the more purpose in our play (which should have always been there), the better Mata will play.

As a big a fan I am of him, I will put my hands up and accept he hasn't been up to his Chelsea standard but I truly believe that's down to the way we were playing. Keep up the recent form and he will just get better.

4811~~~
Primary goals does he add, he doesnt get that many assists for us. The general consensus was that if he doesnt score, he just had little influence. He didnt create many chances, often passed the ball backwards and had no influence defensively, if you play as a no 10, and you have those kind of performances, you're being a passenger.

4812~~~
Easy to forget his early outings this season after his latest run of games. He was absolutely shocking - even if he did nick a goal or two. He wasn't the only one, mind. RvP has scored a few as well, but that alone doesn't make his season a good one.

4813~~~
I will admit he wasn't great but to call him shocking is just stupid. I don't get how fans just label a player shocking or a waste of space if they are not playing at their absolute peak. It's either a 9/10 performance or 1/10. He was okay during that spell, I admit he wasn't great but to call him shocking is just absurd.

4814~~~
He'll go back to being a passenger soon enough.

4815~~~
He's definitely not a passenger, which is an odd term to use for any player. He has probably been a bit of a victim of LvG's constant formation swapping which resulted in him not playing in a number of fixtures in order to shoehorn the likes of RvP and Falcao into the lineup.

4816~~~
Yeah, he was far from his best but that was just him not really doing anything special in a game and not sticking out. Went hiding basically. Ridiculous to call it shocking if he did nothing wrong. People go way over the top with criticism on here.

4817~~~
Correct. LvG called him one of his most consistent performers. High praise for a 'passenger'...

4818~~~
Well the period before the Spurs away game, you can look it up in the treadmarks, the dominan posts where anonymous, passenger, passive, too lightweight etc, dont know if he just had no confidence but he had very little influence when he played, very easy to make it undone after 2 brilliant matches. Similar to the Rooney discussion, he scores 2 times in a row and suddenly he didnt have a bad patch of form.

4819~~~
But also look at the results and performances of the team during that spell. Fans were frustrated and it's only natural to pick apart a players performance, especially one that isn't playing to his usual high standard. Now that the system is working, the team is playing well, those same fans look at the positives and those arguments like lightweight (which should not change overnight as he is the same size and strength) go away.

4820~~~
Yeah, there you said it. He wasnt playing to his high standard and that was very clear, to moan about people who criticised him when he wasnt doing that seems pointless to me. It's just like lets say Falcao suddenly starts to deliver, and then I'm like ; how in hell did people not want him to stay? Well because he wasnt good enough before he delivered? Mata has been in fine form recently, but you and I know that he was quite anonymous fior a fine period.

4821~~~
His interview on football focus <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

He's just so perfect. Don't ever leave me Juan.

4822~~~
That's the spirit.

4823~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4824~~~
Not if he's got Herrera playing in centre midfield to the side of him. 

We all know what Mata is, drifts between the lines, likes the give and go, play him with other players like that and he excels. If we are using players who are on Mata's wavelength he'll look great, but if we try to arrow direct balls over the defence for him to run on to...forget about it.

4825~~~
Another assist. What's his stats looking like now?

4826~~~
They're actually at the top of this page.

What the hell man.

4827~~~
Played decent. Put Valencia in quite a few times, who then wasted it.

4828~~~
Classy performance, did he misplace a single pass? The false winger role is working out for him as it allows his strengths to shine and covers his weaknesses.

4829~~~
Wtf?

4830~~~
My issue wasn't the criticism, it was the constant calls for him to be sold. Players go through bad patches, but I don't think fans should call for players of his quality to be sold because of them, especially within a year of buying. A player like Mata always deserved to be backed better than that. At least with Falcao, we haven't already committed the 40m to buy him in the first place.

4831~~~
Kagawa fan?

4832~~~
Speaking of Kagawa, now that the dust has settled and he's been gone a while I think it's safe to say that he was a bit crap for us relative to expectations. As poor as Mata has been at times hat least manages a goal or assist semi frequently. Norwich hat trick aside Kagawa was a nothing player. I know the system implemented by Moyes didn't best suit his skill set, but he never did much in his limited playing time.

Top Banter.

4835~~~
I noticed Mata is starting to bald. On that slowmo where Navas fouls him you can see the back of his head is getting thinner. I'd give it 2 more years and he'll look like Zidane unless he puts in a real effort with hair treatment. Knowing him and his obsession with having perfect hair I would bet he's already stacked in that area.

4836~~~
Abso-bloody-lutely.  

Where are all those uneducated Caftards <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> who declared he wasn't good enough/didn't suit - mainly at a time when he wasn't even getting in the team.  Never a good time to judge a player imo.

4837~~~
Absolutely brilliant 25 or so mins from him. Just bloody brilliant.

4838~~~
This new role is really suiting him. A big reason for the recent upturn in form/performance.

4839~~~
Good thing we didn't sell him to Juve for €18m a couple of months ago then. I adore this man. Statue outside old trafford is most likely going to be raised.

4840~~~
If hes sold in the summer i'm off to support Liverpool! Great little player who you just cant help but love!

Also did you see him leave that FK it for Young? World class dummy

4841~~~
Good to see the important issues are being addressed...

Start typing your blog, Juan.

4844~~~
Class act from a class player. He is just wonderful to watch at the moment.

4845~~~
First thing that came to my mind as well lol.

4846~~~
I feared he would miss but his nose for goalscoring is astonishing. I love scoring goals like that in Fifa, cap cap cap - goal. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4847~~~
he's given LVG a lot of food for thought recently. Not defensively minded, but so dam creative.

4848~~~
He's always been a great technical finisher. Can't wait for the blog again.

4849~~~
He's getting better and more consistent and he still hasn't reached Chelsea level yet. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4850~~~
I love the fact he plays for us.

4855~~~
Would walk into that Chelsea team on form.

4856~~~

4857~~~
Big match world class player. Finally.

All he needed was LVG's patience.

4858~~~
Im not worried over his hair. He'll get plenty tips from Wayne..

4859~~~
Another classy performance, if he had pace to get away in tight areas he'd be rated higher IMO.

4860~~~
Classy player in every way.  We need players like that, that are smart, positive and calm at the right moment.

4861~~~
Doesn't work hard defensively <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck that, brilliant all around. Back to his best. Mourinho put a target on his back with regards to his defensive work but he's done more then his fair share when he's played. Seems quicker then he was at the start of the season too.

4862~~~
Another one whose career here was genuinely in the balance.

Now he's gaining almost legendary status with these big moments.

4863~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4866~~~
Did well today. Thought he was a little bit quieter than in some of his previous games where he's been immense, but good performance overall with a goal to boot, of course.

4867~~~
Way more aggressive off the ball than he used to be. Sure he made a sliding challenge in the first half as well. He's been great

4868~~~
I'm shaving my head if he goes bald.

4869~~~
That finish was excellent, he knew what he was going to do from the moment he received the ball.

4870~~~
This time last year he was an overpriced Chelsea reject that we panic bought for no good reason.

Now, if he keeps up his current form, it won't be long before the 'better than Silva' arguments start up again.

Shows you how quickly things can change in football, and why patience is a virtue.

4871~~~
Was on a different level to him today really. At his best they're similar quality players but he was off form for so long. Just brilliant on the ball he is.

4872~~~
Made some good tackles too. Robbed Clichy from behind as well.

4873~~~
He is just ridiculously productive. Doesn't really possess any outstanding physical attributes but boy does he know how to time things. He really is an outrageously intelligent player

4874~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4875~~~
good player

4876~~~
What's good enough for Bobby Charlton is good enough for Mata. Besides, Rooney looked better with a shaved head than the silly thing he's got stitched to it these days. Seriously.

But yeah, after another goal and fine performance <i>this</i> is the key issue.

4877~~~
Think I'll start praying to him.

4878~~~
What a classy little man. Can't wait to read his blog this week.

4879~~~
Mourinho is f*cking mad for selling him, deserves a lot of criticism I think.

4880~~~
I also noticed the bald patch. Imagine if he did turn into Zidane <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Anyway on to his performance today, another good display and once again justified why he's in the team over Di Maria. He links up really well with Herrera on the right side and his goal return for us has been very good. Mourinho was nuts for selling him.

4881~~~
Gave Clichy the run around today...great performance.

Once again, I can't wait to read an online feckin' blog... when did I become a teenage girl?

4882~~~
That goal was sublime, I thought he should have shot earlier, and when Hart came even closer, I thought he`d blown his chance, cant believe he megged him, haha, what a finish

4883~~~
Fair play to him he's turned it around.

Not just the goals but he's also getting more involved in the general play and the defensive side of his game has improved loads. Even saw him winning a few physical battles which he rarely did.

His productivity is just ridiculous.

4884~~~
Such a ridiculously intelligent player, who knows why Chelsea were daft enough to sell him to us.

4885~~~
He's working his ass off so much you seriously have to doubt Mou's sanity, thank you Jose.

4886~~~
They also sold De Bruyne who's having an amazing season. They put all their eggs in one basket by putting so much faith in Oscar. Fortunately for them they have Fabregas.

4887~~~
Him and Herrera are fast becoming my fav players at the club. 

Superb again today. Great to see him put in a shift defensively as well.

4888~~~
Becoming the player he was at his peak for Chelsea now, looks sensational and combined with Herrera really sets our team up perfectly. Sublime pass and movement once again and a very well taken goal. Thriving under the pressure of being a United player and looking world class at the moment.

4889~~~
Great again today.He is a real big game player.

4890~~~
Well Cesc has been half the player since January, which is a trend he always abides to. I think if Chelsea had a real challenger contesting them that they would crack under the pressure.

4891~~~
As soon as Rooney put him through one on one I knew it was only going to end one way <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4892~~~
Really refound his confidence. He looks stronger, quicker, and even better defensively. Herrera brings a lot of his game too, I think.

4893~~~
Hilarious really, the contrast between him going through and Navas going through!

4894~~~
Wonder if Mourinho would have sold him to us if he knew LVG was going to be our manager. Jose surely thought Moyes would be here longer.

4895~~~
To be fair to Navas, you're never going to have as much confidence running towards big Dave as you are towards Hart <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

4896~~~
Also, to be fair to Navas... he's not very good at football.

4897~~~
Just a few weeks back, him and Mata were "disliked by LvG and sure to be gone in the summer".

4898~~~
Yea but also to be fair... He can run quick

4899~~~
He's absolutely lethal. Right up there with the best strikers in Europe when it comes to converting chances.

4900~~~
Yup, I loved that too. He probably should have tracked Clichy better for the first goal but after that, he made him his bitch in defense and offense.

4901~~~
I love him, I really do.

And a big LOL to people who wanted him gone and said he does basically nothing but pass the ball sideways <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4902~~~
Loved his work rate, was closing Clichy down all the time. That finish was class too, glad he kept his cool under pressure.

4903~~~
New blog entry tomorrow <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.mercuryserver.com/forums/images/smilies/icon_wub.gif" src="http://www.mercuryserver.com/forums/images/smilies/icon_wub.gif"/>

4904~~~
He's such a loveable scamp. He was good again today and his finish was top notch.

4905~~~
That wouldnt have played a part really.

4906~~~
Really enjoying him doing well.

The importance of his goals this season is worth a mention. Winners against Palace, Stoke and Liverpool and goals at crucial times in the home games against City and Liverpool again.

4907~~~

4908~~~
The rain did him no favors and he's becoming the bald Juan!

4909~~~
It's almost a bit out of character for such a nice guy.

4910~~~
Excellent understanding of space in the final third when we had possession today. He knew that it would be difficult to get involved if he stayed wide, especially after the box to box midfielder on his side, Herrera, was forced to stay deeper and help Carrick get the ball forward. There was a stat at half time showing that we had used the left wing to build 57% of our attacks. A creative/attacking player who flourishes when he has the ball at his feet in the final third usually struggles under these circumstances but Mata found a way to make the difference today.

Many people don't notice this on the TV but a wide player moving out of position and all the way to the other wing in order to overload that side is a bold decision cause if the ball is lost the opposition has lots of free space to exploit. And City is a team that knows how to get the ball forward with pace. But Mata's off the ball movement in our third goal was fantastic. He knew that Rooney would drop deeper and try to link with Fellaini and he spotted the huge gap in the center of City's defense.

He found the opportunity to overload the right flank three or four more times and he managed to get something out of each one of these opportunities, including a foul in a very dangerous position. Fine performance and proof that when a player has the intelligence, the skills and the personality to deliver the goods, LvG has no problem giving him freedom of movement on the pitch.

4911~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCaJzZZUEAAMQSX.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCaJzZZUEAAMQSX.jpg"/>
Is that really Mata? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4912~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4913~~~
Just rewatching parts of the match and he had a really good pass to Young for the second goal. Then another dangerous pass to Fellaini in the box at around 35mins

4914~~~
Oh, and his ball out wide for the second goal was bloody delightful.

He'll probably finish the season with goals in the double figures - which is pretty remarkable considering the football he hasn't played.

4915~~~
When I was back in the noobs Mata was getting some grief in his thread.

The guy has got 15 in last 24 appearances, he's a machine.

4916~~~
Produced a good game defensively too. It was an excellent finish. Most players would have missed imo.

4917~~~
Can't be, Mata had a beard from the age of 3.

4918~~~
Always liked him and could never understand why Mourinho never gave him a fair chance at Chelsea. I worried for him at United that he wouldn't get back to his best level he was at previously but he has now flourished into the Mata who played so well for Chelsea.

4919~~~

Do you mean "him and Herrera"? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Mata was, once again, excellent and gave loads of trouble to Clichy. As TRDA pointed out, he was very intelligent and drifted infield to take advantage of spaces in the middle when we overloaded our left side. Him drifting in caused Man. City so many problems as Yaya was attracted to Fellaini and Fernandinho to Herrera. His understanding of the situations is amazing, and I'm sure van Gaal would be very happy with Mata as he currently suits van Gaal's philosophy to the tee.

He's pure class and now he's putting himself about as well. What more can we want?

4923~~~
Winner against Chelsea.

4924~~~
Now that would be something.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4925~~~
His last appearance against United for Chelsea... a 1-0 win at Old Trafford. The scorer... none other than Juan Mata.

4926~~~
Yeah once you get pulled a bit wide, it's much harder to score. He took it superbly

You're, right, meant Herrera <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4927~~~
Louis van Gaal had stated prior to the sale he wanted to work in England but back then Spurs were the club interested in him. Moyes stated his surprise that he signed Juan in January saying they had been working on the deal for a while but expected it to happen in the summer.

A conspiracy theory would be Mourinho sold Mata to Moyes (as opposed to finding a club abroad) thinking he'd at least keep himself in a job thus making dominating the league easier for himself but in truth that's highly unlikely, I doubt Mourinho cares if Louis van Gaal lays down the foundations and then Pep takes over.

4928~~~
Would make my life.

4929~~~
He's starting to replicate the form he had at Chelsea.  Truly world class.

4930~~~
That would be brilliant <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4931~~~
Oh yes please.

4932~~~
Loving his form at the moment, some of his passing is effortlessly sublime

4933~~~
Good finish today, felt he needed to get a bit more involved in the 2nd half after being on the periphery in the first half. And he did just that with the goal

Again (not the first time) Mata and Ander both made the most tackles for us today with 3 each. Cant defend? Okay Jose

Also he now has 4 goals and 1 assist in his 4 starts on the right for us this season. Cant play on the wing? Another myth debunked

4934~~~
He was always a big game player for Chelsea. He had a fantastic record against the best sides and in important games.

4935~~~
He seemed to always play well against us for a start!

4936~~~
He's now starting to replicate his performances at Chelsea, when he's playing like that, he's fantastic to watch.

4937~~~
I love his false winger position, it allows him to get around and if he is out of position, Herrera will fill in. It's surprisingly effective.

4938~~~
Well Jose said when he sold Mata that he need to work harder in defence and if he would change his game a little he would be in the first team at Chelsea tbh. But Mata wanted to leave and he was sold because of that, not because Jose didn't wanted him.

Same happened to Mata at the start of the season when he was out of the first team. I think Mata saw what is wrong and listened to LVG and we now see the improvement Jose wanted. Mata is definetly working much harder in defence as he did last year at Chelsea. His attacking contribution was never questioned.

Same happened to Herrera, he is much more disciplined player now as he was at the start of the season. For me there is no surprise that the players who are willing to listen are the players who most improved (Herrera, Mata, Fellaini, Young, Carrick).

4939~~~
When he went through on goal, I was just praying, watching those little legs close in on goal. Topped off yet another great performance.

He is a pleasure to watch. Hugs.

4940~~~

4941~~~
Yup, this is a big improvement in his game and i think that's why van gaal trusts him now.

4942~~~
There's two of them <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4943~~~
This. Never seen him do it before tbh.

4944~~~

4945~~~
Hugs.

4946~~~
It's uncanny.  Hart closed his angles off extremely well but Mata went in between the legs.  He has nerves of steel when he is in those situations.

4947~~~
I think that was helped by the fact that Silva was on his flank and doing the same thing, but yeah, I like seeing that from Mata. It's exactly how I thought Kagawa could've played for us. The fact that Herrera is in the team is a big part of this working.

I never had any doubt he would score as soon as he was bearing down on Hart.

Hugs.

4948~~~
I doubted Mata early in the season, but I was wrong. Very wrong. The team balance we have at the moment is just perfect, and Mata is a huge part of that. Also, he is absolutely ruthless in front of goal. An assassin. Please score against Chelsea <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4949~~~
He has a striker's instinct inside the box. And as stats show there aren't many better in terms of efficiency in front of goal. He doesn't need many chances.

4950~~~
absolute disgrace spain didn't call him

4951~~~
Which is so valuable to us.  We've not had many players you could say that about in recent times.  He's a huge asset going forward, in more ways than one.

4952~~~
HUGS

4953~~~
For a player who isn't a deadly striker, his calmness bearing down on goal is quite simply brilliant. You can see in one of the angles, he is running, looking at Hart and the goal while still taking touches on the ball. Amazing ball control in a pressure situation.

For those wanting him to score the winner at the Bridge, as much as that would send me over the edge, he is just too nice to do that to Chelsea. He will round the keeper and square it to Herrera for a tap in.

4954~~~
His finish for the first goal at Anfield and the goal yesterday were fantastic, neither of those were easy but he made it look so simple. He's class. 

Now where's that new blog, Juan??

4955~~~

4956~~~
Yes, yesterday's finish was pretty spectacular in fairness. Hart did everything right, but Juan just completely waited him out (takes extreme composure), and as soon as Hart blinked he pounced at exactly the right moment and put it between his legs before the gap closed.

A lot of people will see that as an easy goal, a one on one against the keeper, but in truth even very decent strikers will miss those more often than not in that angle, coming up against a keeper of Hart's calibre.

4957~~~
Thought he actually had a quieter game yest. But then all the play was down the left so makes sense. But took his goal excellently.

4958~~~
Surely the best finisher in our squad?

High praise when you consider the strikers we have.

4959~~~
Yes, it was a wierd decision to sell him. However, we did pay a premium price, so it's not like he gave him away. I think it was a fair deal for everyone involved.

I just wish they'll find a way to combine all our attacking options. It shouldn't be unrealistic to use Di Maria and Mata at the same time. Would be nice to see them match. It's just that their playing style is a bit different. There has been some magic when Di Maria is assisting Mata with some passas like the one vs Liverpool, but there has got to be more to it than that when you look at their talent.

4960~~~
We have always known that Mata offers a lot going forwards, this was never in question. His limitations are that he is a luxury player who offers very little defensively - I think this is why he struggled to get gametime in central positions under Mourinho, and has similarly been using by LVG out wide. It is no coincidence that LVG prefers players like Fellaini and Rooney in the central positions, who offer better workrate and tracking back whilst still contributing in attack.

I am pleased that Mata has come into form, especially now at the crucial end of the season, but for a player who can be a complete passenger, I feel he <i>needs</i> to be performing at this sort of level to justify his place in the team.

4961~~~
I actually think he's starting to surpass his Chelsea form. He's becoming a more complete player and almost something of a terrier in this current system with his tackles and pressing - both of which are not only becoming more frequent, but also more effective and are done with the high intelligence the rest of his game is played at.

4962~~~
He's not a luxury player. A luxury player doesn't show up in big games (Liverpool, City). Its true he doesn't offer much defensively but his defensive frailties have been overplayed.

4963~~~
I think he is almost the very definition of a luxury player, and disagree with your definition (doesnt show up in big games). A luxury player is one who must be carried somewhat by the team, who is "the icing on the cake". A player who when the team is playing well, will look even better [than the rest of the team], but when the team is playing poorly, will be one of the most invisible.
I said the same about Kagawa.

Regarding defensive frailties - it was his failure to track Silva yesterday that led to City's opening goal on 8 minutes, which could have cued a disastrous result for us.

I dont think LVG would be prepared to use Mata in a central role, due to the above, and I think that if Di Maria was in better form he would be starting ahead of Mata on the right.

4964~~~
It was also a failure on Valencia for not picking up Milner, Carrick for not getting to Silva and Jones for not doing a great job of cutting out the pass too Aguero... fact is, it was the first 5-10 minutes, and there was a long way to go before any "disastrous" result occurred. 

The whole team didn't start well yesterday, but from 20 minutes onwards, everyone got more organised, defended properly - Mata included.

4965~~~
Mata was good yesterday but certainly wasn't our best player(Young was MOTM, Fellaini, Herrera were equally as good if not better). And there's been plenty of times this season where we were poor but Mata wasn't the worst player on the pitch. He's not a luxury player even by your own definition.

4966~~~
Leave him as part of the attack. His midfield play has never been that great in essence he isn't an Iniesta more of a ronaldinho. He's not one to organise the team and get us moving forward. Not one to create space for others by attracting opponents and realising team-mates into space. Not one to drive past midfielders thus breaching midfield lines. Instead, he's a final third player. Put him there and he just knows how goals are scored and created. Put him in front of goal and he's finding the back of the net. Has a great final pass on him and reads the play and spots gaps quicker than most players.  He's a big time footballer and thankfully we're starting to get some great football out of him as he's such a big asset.

4967~~~
There were definitely other players at fault than Mata, but im just saying that he was a part of it as it is a convenient example of what I was saying. I dont think even the staunchest Mata fans can argue that he offers as much defensively as Young, Di Maria, Fellaini, Herrera, Valencia (when he was playing as a winger) or Rooney. The fact that both Mourinho and LVG have refused to utilise him as a #10 (preferring Oscar and Fellaini respectively - both of whom offer more defensively but perhaps less offensively than Mata) is proof of this I think.

Well we all have our opinions - but generally I do think that if Mata starts a game and the team is playing badly, he will typically be a complete passenger. Its a tradeoff as to whether the manager feels his offensive contribution is worth it, just like when SAF sacrificed other areas of the team to accomodate Ronaldo. Obviously at the moment LVG feels (and I agree) that Mata is in excellent form, so he should continue to start.

4968~~~
I wish all of our players contributed as much end product as Mata does when he's a "passenger".

4969~~~
He's definitely working harder and playing slightly differently. Whether that can, or will last remains to be seen. Great to see him playing like this, though. His ability on the ball is something we should be aiming for, IMO. 

That said - and I might be crazy - but I still see him as vulnerable this summer.

4970~~~
Yep its all about opinions. Generally speaking when a team plays poorly most of the players tends to struggle. This could be said about 90 percent of all players. If not then the team wouldn't be playing poorly in the first place. Mata has his limitations, he made some good tackles yesterday but he will NEVER be a great tackler, that's just not his game. But his defensive frailties have been unfairly overplayed.

There will be games that won't suit him and he doesn't offer much defensively but as that article earlier posted shows his defensive contribution is no different to many other top class playmakers. But we rarely see them getting criticized for it. Also Mata was top 3 in terms of winning possession in the final third in 2012/13 season. This was BEFORE Mourinho came back to Chelsea and benched him. Funny how he's got a reputation of being lazy since then.

<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>2012/13 Season</b></span>

4971~~~
Is he? as nice as he is, he plays for United and that was his decision. Chelsea are our rivals and I'd expect him to act professionally and score against the chavs.

4972~~~
Not always - a lot of the really top class players can still look very dangerous even when the rest of the team is playing badly. Suarez, Aguero, Hazard, Ronaldo (when he played for us - although obviously still the case) - these are players who <i>always</i> look dangerous (Suarez in more ways than one...). Not every player is like that of course, but it isnt black and white. Again for me, players like Mata and Kagawa are very much "the icing on the cake" - if you play well, they make you even better, but if you play badly, they will often be one of the worst.

As you said, he will never be a great tackler, it isnt his game - similarly Fellaini will never be spraying out 50 yard passes, and Carrick wont be scoring 10+ per season. This is fair - the thing that I think Mata lacks however, is some work rate/ethic as far as tracking back and defending goes. Hazard is a great example of this - when he went to Chelsea originally he was seen as quite lazy I think. Mourinho even came out and publicly said he needs to work harder. Now, he has very much added that to his game, as has Oscar (although he was already a fairly hard worker).

For me, work rate isnt a "not his game" quality. Some players like Zlatan can get away with it because they are a) world class and/or b) play in a less physically demanding position (striker). For a midfielder or winger though, its very hard to get away with it. Even Ronaldo was always praised due to his athleticism and work rate, and he was/is one of the players who could arguably get away with being lazy simply because of how good they are (in fact since joining Madrid I think Cristiano has gotten progressively lazier, but that is as much due to the circus that is Madrid, as anything else).

Work rate is important in the PL. Look at the comparative differences between Ozil and Sanchez in terms of how big a success they have been at Arsenal. Look at Willian, who was never deemed to be a *great* player but who is now pretty much undisputed first choice for Chelsea, and has been for some time. I already mentioned Oscar and Hazard (and the fact that Mourinho sold Mata himself). Look at how effective Suarez was at Liverpool, look at how Milner has become one of City's arguably most important players this season.

There is a definite theme and correlation here - that if you want to be a truly top player in the PL, you pretty much need to have work ethic, as well as skill. Naturally there are exceptions, but those are exceptions, for exceptional players where the sacrifice is worth making.

What I am basically saying from all this is that yes, Mata is playing well at the moment, and he deserves to stay in the team without a doubt. However for me until he improves his work rate in terms of tracking back and defending (or his "attacking" improves to "one of the best in the world" standard) he will never be recognised as a truly great player (not in the PL at least), and that someone like Di Maria you can argue would have a higher 'ceiling' for us in this respect.

4973~~~
He's become quite an odd player hasn't he in his wing role? He's completely revamped his identity as a typical Spanish possession number 10 to what he is now. 

His off the ball runs are great, he challenges his full back nonstop and then sometimes he decides to switch his old style on and he starts playing great pass-and-move football with Herrera or dropping centrally to do the same.

More interceptions/Tackles than Young yesterday and as many as Herrera and is absolutely great in our pressing game. Him and Herrera really leads by example when it comes to intelligent pressing. 

The best example was late in the game when we were dropping back way too deep and letting Chelsea dominate the game too close to our area and Herrera showed true leadership and started pressing and the team followed the example.

Rooney has done really well in that regard too. Defensively, now when we use pressing, I think our right side is stronger than the Young-Fellaini side which says a lot.

4974~~~
I get what you're saying, but isn't Mata essentially playing in the same position that made one one of Europe's outstanding young talents at Valencia?
It always confused me when posters claimed he couldn't play from wide.

4975~~~
If someone ever said Mata never could play out wide then they clearly didn't see him at Valencia, he was very good there. I think people have questioned whether or not he could do it to the same level that he played for Chelsea as an CAM, whether or not he could find that form and ability again in a different league under different circumstances. 

Nobody can say that Rooney was bad out wide earlier in his career, but it doesn't mean that he'd be able to redo it for us right now and be as useful as he could be elsewhere.

4976~~~
You make some very good points. The players you mentioned can be put into the 10% category i was talking about. And we both agree that Mata isn't the best defensively. What we don't agree perhaps is that Mata's workrate has never been that bad in general in the past. As i showed in 2012/13 season he was top 3 in terms of winning the ball in the final third. Another article as posted by #07. And i highlight this part.

<i><b>Certainly during the past three months it has been possible to question the Mourinho-ish vogue for insisting the one quality attacking midfielders must have above all others is defensive discipline. For one thing Mata’s defensive frailties are perhaps overplayed. He will never be a tackler but under van Gaal he has made more interceptions per game than Cesc Fàbregas, Oscar, David Silva and Mesut Özil. Willian has made marginally more tackles (by 0.2 per game) and been dribbled past 0.3 times fewer. Against that Mata’s passing accuracy is better and despite playing less than Willian he has been directly involved in twice as many goals. At which point you start to wonder exactly which of these two attacking midfielders is failing to do some vital part of his job.
</b></i>

4977~~~
Call it nitpicking, but I am really specifically talking about tracking back (and similar) - which is for me the single most important factor, and something I would put into a different category to "pressing".

So yes, interceptions, winning the ball in the final third and the likes is one area of overall defensive contribution, but the other area which - which is basically what happens <i>outside</i> of the final third - is what I am primarily talking about.

Again, it may seem like a small thing, and you can argue "well if he can do x, y and z then surely it doesnt matter if he lacks this one particular thing" - but for me, tracking back and helping the team defend in our half of the pitch is the most important thing.

Pressing the opponent high up the pitch can almost be argued as part of a players "attacking" qualities, since the outcome is often to create a chance for us to score [if we win the ball off their defenders, for instance]. Defending is about preventing the opposition from scoring though - and whilst obviously they cant score if they dont have the ball - I have felt in recent games that Valencia and Smalling look particularly exposed and outnumbered in our half of the pitch - and that is because Mata is often nowhere to be seen.

It doesnt matter if he isnt a great tackler, what is important is to track his man and make up the numbers, rather than leaving a potential 2v3 situation when defending on the right.

4978~~~
Fair enough. Id love to see a statistic of possession won in own half, or a 'distance run tracking' or something like that(not sure if anyone even keeps a track of those stats). But i won't be surprised if Mata is no different to any other playmakers like Silva, Ozil, Nasri etc. What we do know however is that he puts in the shift in the other half. For tracking players in our own half he's probably not the best, i can't argue with that. Personally i do think he puts in the shift, he's just not very good at it, like most other playmakers.

4979~~~
Aye, like you said its hard to truly judge without seeing the stats. Still though I do think Valencia and Smalling have looked more exposed than Blind and Jones, due to the amount of defensive work Young/Fellaini put in compared with Herrera/Mata (primarily Mata though).

4980~~~
He's tracking back lately has been very good as was his work rate. No complains at all from me. But the main attributes he should be judged on is rather his offensive contribution

4981~~~
I think hes been awesome for us and i would love to see us build a team around him.

As it stands I'm still worried that LvG will get rid of him in the summer even after how great hes been for us, i donno why but i just can't shake the feeling and i wish i could.

4982~~~
He's obviously not as good at tracking back as Young (who can play full back it should be noted), but he's been streets ahead of Di Maria in this regard for my money so I've no complaints. My issue with his defending earlier in the season was that he was being easily shrugged off the ball and lost every 50/50, but now with his new found confidence he's putting himself about, winning fouls and generally making himself a nuisance whenever we don't have the ball. With a physique like his, I couldn't ask for any more.

4983~~~
No, he was playing on the left, Joaquin and Pablo Hernandez were the right wingers.

4984~~~
I think that what is working so well for him defensively is that we are extremely compact and it relies more on him being in the proper position instead of pure workrate.  He isn't a good fit out wide for a Mourinho side, because Mourinho wants to set his team up deeper and hit with pace on the counter while we are looking to dominate possession with a high line.  He fits very well out wide in our setup, because it allows him to do everything he was good at when he was in his pomp at Chelsea and allows him to flit in and out of the game.  He wasn't going to fit as the primary playmaker most of us thought he would play as, but he is perfect for his current role.  I thought he would be off due to not fitting in to what LvG wants out of his #10 and never thought he would slot seamlessly wide right.

4985~~~
Just looked at his goal again and saw how calm he remained. I thought he missed his chance to shoot at first but then he coolly slots it in between the legs of the keeper.

4986~~~
He was never getting close to Silva, Carrick was goal side, in a better position and should have blocked off Silva's run, I've seen the game like 5 times again. Before that too, Valencia and Herrera lost their men.

4987~~~
Which reminds me of Neville's analysis of Rooney's game. Rooney had only 35 touches, lowest in his United career. From the outset he was a mere passenger. But Neville said that that was his best performance under LVG and that the manager would have been very pleased with his performance. Neville said that having played with him for 10 years he knows that Rooney is the sort of player who love's to track and fight for every ball. But there was a noticeable difference in his game now, instead of chasing every ball he was more focused on his positioning and organization both defensively and offensively. Herrera said something along the same lines in his recent interview, that LVG does not want him to go after seeking the ball, instead he has to keep his shape and play in an organized manner.

4988~~~
Really? So it wasnt Valencia's or Carrick's or Herrera's fault for not tracking Silva?

4989~~~
Originally I held Valencia to blame, but having watched the replay a few times he isnt at fault - there are two City players out wide near the by line, and Valencia and Smalling are covering those two. Silva was the third man, making a run inside. Mata tracked him back to around the mid point of our half, and then seemed to just stop.

I didnt record the game and cant for the life of me find the highlights to re-watch it to really see in detail, but the above was my take on it from what I have seen.

4990~~~
Valencia was in no mans land behind Smalling. When Milner cut in Smalling had to cover Clichy because he was overlapping, which meant Valencia had to step up and cut off Milner which he didnt. Also Carrick had to have seen Silva's run and he reacted late as well. Carrick was ball watching.

4991~~~
I can easily see Mata being our player of the year next season if he continue playing in this position. It is not far off from his form and consistency at Chelsea

4992~~~
I agree Valencia didnt track Milners run, but Silva should have been tracked by Mata I feel - unless told otherwise by LVG.

4993~~~
You need a hobby fella.

4994~~~
Just watched the goal again. Very harsh to blame it on Mata. But i noticed something i hadn't earlier. But lets talk about Mata first. Clichy cuts in and takes out Valencia, runs forward and finds Milner.  Milner is completely free on the left as Valencia is up in no man's land. Smalling goes to meet Milner while Carrick falls back. At this point Valencia gets back but completely ignores the onrushing Silva as he's still focused on the left. Meanwhile Mata follows Silva, who is already running 3-4 yards ahead of him, into the box. Milner lays it in front of Silva through Valencia and Carrick, Mata wouldn't have reached the ball even if he had the pace of Usain Bolt. Completely unrealistic. <b>BUT</b> Aguero was completely unmarked in the middle. He is between Fellaini, Jones and Blind. No one even bothers to mark him. The tap in was too easy for him.

4995~~~
Mata could have tracked him for only so long. He stopped because Milner was running towards him and there was no one to cover Milner. Carrick should have seen that run from Silva. Mata had Milner covered if he was going to keep cutting further in. Carrick stopped once Milner cutt inside and was caught ball watching.

4996~~~
Not sure if this has been mentioned, but doesn't anyone else think van Gaal is doing 'a Herrera' on him? Previously known as 'a Sneijder' for Dutch people.

Before the worldcup, van Gaal said in an interview he was going to CHEER! (he yelled) at the line if Sneijder would capture a ball, and even left him out of the selection a couple of times. At the worldcup Sneijder defended more than ever and ran more kilometers than he's ever done - at age 30! He followed special training in his own time to become stronger, fitter and started to defend much more.

Herrera was also very attack minded and got left out for a while, he's more naturally gifted when it comes to defending but he was in the wrong places. He learned him some defensive ways to play as 8.

In the last matches on the wing (where defending is less important than in midfield) we saw Mata tracking back, making tackles and winning the ball. Van Gaal said he left him out for the balance of the team, this would be the defensive balance. He will never be great at defending, but in our possesion style putting pressure on the opponent is just as important - Mata could easily do this. I think we will see Mata defending more and more as the matches go by.

I have a hunch feeling, that since we're getting a new CM (who will probably be good defensive wise - quote me on this), Mata could even play in midfield next season. He's great on the wing too and van Gaal loves multifunctional players, this way he doesn't need as big of a squad either (which he likes).

4997~~~
Oh for God's sake...

4998~~~
Sorry. Mata is the nicest guy on the planet, I want to have his babies. I hope he scores a cheeky own goal against us in Saturday to remind the Chelsea fans he's just the kindest little fella.

Hugs.

4999~~~
So you actually thought he was serious when he suggested that Mata would rather pass than score against Chelsea?

I don't know man, I don't even remember making that post before you quoted it.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://strettynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mata-Oscar-717x520.jpg" src="http://strettynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mata-Oscar-717x520.jpg"/>
Mourinho done f*cked up.

5003~~~
Doesn't mata. He's ours now and he's been juanderful.

5004~~~
He was already doing the defensive work when he was being picked in CM earlier in the season. Its just that when he was playing there, he had minimal effect in creating or scoring.

Now he's on the right he's creating and scoring at a good rate, but he's still defending his fair share

5005~~~
Fair enough! Suffice it to say, I think we'll all lose it if he scores a decisive goal against Chelsea.

5006~~~
I bet Oscar has more fouls feigned.

5007~~~
Of course mata is better going forward. That is obvious. But I'd like to see the stats for distance covered and defensive contribution as well.

5008~~~
This stuff just seems so obvious to me.  Throw in goals against Pool and City and I just do not get it.  He performs when it matters and consistently.

5009~~~
I would have thought Oscar would have more passes to be honest. Before Chelsea everyone hyped him up to be a proper playmaker who could run the game.

5010~~~
I don't know about a direct comparison, but Mata is very often in the top 3 distance covered in our games.

It's a strange one. If Mata is to be believed, him and Mourinho had no relationship right from the start. He didn't get a chance to turn it right

5011~~~
Mourinho is just a twat. He kicked Mata out just because he could and wanted everyone to know he could.

5012~~~
Yeah he had to mark his territory and make a point that he's got more control from Roman this time around.

5013~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://vid.me/Yuws" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mata on EPL World show</a>

5014~~~
Nice interview.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5015~~~
Indeed, it'd be wonderful. Another performance like the one we seen at Anfield would be immense.

5016~~~

5017~~~
Mata was bought by AvB and made the main man by Benitez, two manages Mourinho has fallen out with, whereas Oscar was a club signing. That probably also played a part in Mourinho's decision to make a point. 

Anyway good that he felt the need to make a point, otherwise we would have never bought Mata.

5018~~~
To be fair to Mourinho, the theory was that he didn't feel Mata did enough without the ball. Would need to compare their defensive stats to see how that panned out.

5019~~~
On Talksport this morning it was rumoured that he was going to get rid of Oscar for exactly the same reason he got rid of Mata.

5020~~~
From that article;
'Mata is one of seven players to run over 30 kilometres in United’s last three games. However, having been withdrawn late on in the 4-2 win over Man City, he’s actually covered more ground per minute than the other six. More than the hard-running Ander Herrera. More than the fleet-footed Antonio Valencia.' 

Not too shabby.

5021~~~
The only attacking midfielder I'd have over him in the league right now is Hazard. Other than that, he's a cut above in current form.

5022~~~
For the same reasons? Whenever I have seen Oscar for Chelsea he has worked tirelessly but produced nothing else. I certainly wouldn't be shocked if Mourinho got rid of Oscar to bring in another CM though.

5023~~~
He's been playing 360° football. Moving in all directions up and down the pitch. Incredible stuff.

5024~~~
Just shows you what can be achieved if a manager can see you have talent and will give you time to fit into his system. That is good coaching, a willingness to nuture someone.

5025~~~
Exactly... Hazrd is awesome, but after him... right now... Carzorla or Sanchez would not be terrible picks... and other than that it is Mata for me.  But back to the original Chelsea quandary...  if you had to pick between Oscar or Mata, who would you pick?

And this.

Seriously the article from a few pages back shows convincingly that Mata does work at both ends of the pitch...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/23/juan-mata-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/23/juan-mata-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal</a>

Here is perhaps the most relavent part quoted...

Seriously goals in big games... most distance covered.... assists all the time... 

All I can say is... HUGS <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>!!

5026~~~
Honestly, he's getting back to his world class best, and will only improve from now on in.

5027~~~
If I recall, Joe-Say's excuse for selling him was that Mata didn't track back as Oscar does. Not sure how valid that is, but the stats clearly don't back up the idea that the transfer was good for Chelsea.

5028~~~
His form now reminds me of why I was so excited the day I saw that helicopter land at Carrington. On his day, truly world class.

5029~~~
It was awful for them IMO. More of a knee jerk decision then anything, though they got a fair price. Ignoring the price though, Mourinho would have been far better off if he stuck with Mata and got him to work in his system, instead of going with Oscar who is half the player for me...
They might've won the title last season even, with his extra ability on the ball, creativity and the goals he brings which could have been key in those smaller games where they dropped points in constantly. Same with De Bruyne actually. People kept going on about how they got so much money for De Bruyne and Mata (and a few others), but are they actually better off without these players? Not at all IMO.

5030~~~
Never leave us, Juan.

5031~~~
Some one else singing his praises...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/paul-scholes-angel-di-marias-red-card-against-arsenal-was-the-turning-point-for-manchester-united-10182575.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/foo...ing-point-for-manchester-united-10182575.html</a>

5032~~~
Wow. I never imagined Mata as a defensive juggernaut. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Really good to see he is performing defensively. Does anyone have any defensive stats of Mata now vs Mata under Mourinho/Chelsea?

Would be great comparison to see if Mourinho's criticism of Mata is justified. Could it be man management issues or could there be more to this than just stats?

5033~~~
There is always more than stats... these are just facts to consider but depending of the angle, it could mean anything and the contrary. Mata is an excellent player for United right now, he also seems to understand better what to do without the ball in the attacking and defensive phases as well, which is important.

5034~~~
Interesting about Van Gaal's admission that he fields players if they are returning to their old club. I've always thought it's a great motivational technique. Mata plays <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5035~~~
I think Mata changed as a player and used his previous experience at Chelsea and how he was benched by Mourinho to improve himself and regain a starting position at Utd.

5036~~~
I get where you are coming from but purely "running around a lot" doesn't make someone good defensively. I would still say Mata is relatively weak defensively however he is without doubt exceptional going forward which is exactly what we need from him.

Not suggesting he is terrible defensively just maybe not what Jose would look for in his team. I agree it was stupid for Chelsea to let him go though

5037~~~
Not as effective without Herrera near him.

5038~~~
He's been OK. Obviously has license to come inside and even to the left. Passing has been spot on. Set pieces haven't been great.

5039~~~
Could be more direct and aggressive in his play.

5040~~~
He definitely missed the link-up play with Herrera as that is vital to him getting into space and affecting the game, in that type of game we really needed a wide attacker that could run at a defense.

5041~~~
Yep, seemed really isolated today... constantly had to carry the ball in field to find the pass.

5042~~~
Maybe the occasion got to him today. Was a bit quiet.

And I've resigned myself to the idea that he's more of a goalscoring AM. Any creativity he might have had at Chelsea has been all but snuffed out here.

5043~~~
He was a little quiet because we struggled in the final third. Chelsea were set up solidly at the back, as you'd expect. Mata struggled to break them down and find space just like the rest of our forward players did.

5044~~~
It was quite frustrating when Januzaj came on for him. Mata wasn't at his best but he showed strength and maintained possession even under pressure. Adnan seemed to lose the ball with every moment.

5045~~~
I understand Juan better than most, nothing happened today that I didnt know about. Get back to me when he wins us another game ditractors.

5046~~~
So stupid to take him off.

5047~~~
Did look half the player he has been recently without the tidy interplay with Herrera, Rooney just can't do that.

5048~~~
Was decent, but Van Gaal probably wanted more pace so took him off for Januzaj as they closed him down well. Didn't really work out though.

5049~~~
Thing is, Mata is the player we probably need to be able to break down organised defences like that.

5050~~~
Not his day, that's life.

5051~~~
He was completely isolated on the right-hand side without Herrera to play off. Rooney was more interested in staying perfectly central and, if anything, drifting  a bit left so he could ping it to Valencia. Which left Mata with no one to play-off on the inside, and could only really check back to Valencia... our right-hand side has only worked so well because there's been 3 of them to make the runs and the space.

5052~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69817, @prarek" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69817/">@prarek</a>

This is what I was talking about when I called him a luxury player last week.
I agree that there were mitigating circumstances (as identified by <a class="username" data-user="56592, @Annihilate Now!" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56592/">@Annihilate Now!</a> and others) - that basically without Herrera next to him, his impact dropped dramatically - but that is pretty much my point. Mata is a player who needs the rest of the team set up a certain way and playing well in order to have an impact. Yesterday we didnt have the team set up perfectly, and Mata struggled - more than most I would say.

I feel that a player of the mould of Mata needs to be able to create a bit more in the final third and needs to be able to impact games when things arent all going according to plan. Silva is the perfect example of what I want from that sort of player - one of those who has that "moment of magic" quality in his game. Hazard is another example - just look at yesterday. Yes, Hazard has some different qualities to Mata, but the role in the team is pretty similar for both - the attacking, creative player who has license to roam when required.

5053~~~
He missed his buddy Herrera

5054~~~
Not a great game for him. With the way Chelsea set up it was difficult for him.

5055~~~
I understand what you are saying but my point stands. By this definition 90 percent of footballers are all luxury players. You can put Hazard and Silva in the other 10 percent. At the end of the day Mata has more often than not performed in the big games this season. 4 goals and 1 assist i believe. Even Messi would struggle to create something against such an expensive parked bus. Actually im certain even Hazard would have struggled. Mata can be forgiven, he wasn't effective but he wasn't woeful either. There aren't many teams of Chelsea's quality that can park the bus like that.

5056~~~
Context is important. True. He's playing well for us and I'm happy for that. I was just wondering how he compares with his old self. Would be interesting to see.

5057~~~
Thought bringing on AJ for Mata was a huge mistake.  AJ hasn't had much match time in ages, whereas Mata has been in form, and players can often do something against their old clubs.

5058~~~
Azpilicueta shut him down properly, he definitely needs Ander closer to him to be effective in this role.

5059~~~
I thought he was a little too static compared to his performance against City.

5060~~~
He definitely needs good movement and clever passing around him to make that 'false winger' role work. When it does work though, as it has over the last few weeks, its fantastic.

5061~~~
^This... I completely agree with.

<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> picking Mata out of our team against Chelsea and casting stones seems petty. 

I mean the whole attacking quintet struggled.  Did Young play well?  Fellaini? Rooney? Falcao? ADM when he came on? How about Januzaj?  We struggled against an very organized and determined Chelsea who will most likely win the EPL. 

Based on your definition of luxury player who on United is not a luxury player?

5062~~~
He should've moved around more as he was never going to get joy out of azpilicueta outwide. As an attacker, he's really an average dribbler. He doesn't possess a direct threat and once you mix that in with him being defended by the best 1 on 1 defender in the league then you're going to have an ineffective player.

5063~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69817, @prarek" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69817/">@prarek</a> tagging you since this is also somewhat in response to your post.

You and I clearly have very different definitions of a luxury player, or you have simply misunderstood mine.

A player playing badly =/= a luxury player.

Lets take a quick trip through history and look at how formations have changed and evolved over the years. Without spending pages and pages on it, the basic trend is that as time has gone on, teams have tended to field fewer and fewer strikers, in favour of more midfielders who can impact all phases of play.
We have even seen the likes of Barca and Spain using systems with no striker at all, with varying degrees of success.

The reason in my eyes is pretty simple - an out and out striker is someone who generally the team must carry for most of the game. He isnt expected to defend a lot (although the recent trend of high pressing is something the striker can participate in), and often can simply act as a poacher. Of course there are other types of striker who get more involved (like Rooney), and typically those players tend to be the more successful ones at the moment - Suarez, Rooney, Messi etc. It is often said that the time of the #9 is going/gone.

So teams stack the midfield, to have more players who can contribute in all phases of play. Again, a lot of the most successful attacking midfielders in the PL of recent years have been the ones who still work hard and put a shift in, whilst also offering a lot going forwards.

Now back to luxury players - a luxury player is someone who typically does not contribute much except for in the final third or attacking situations. They - as with a striker - need to be carried by the team to an extent, in the hope that they can provide something. If the team is playing poorly they will often be anonymous, but when the team is playing well they can be the icing on the cake.

Rooney is not a luxury player, nor is Young, nor is Fellaini - these are all players who will put a shift in, and whilst they can still have bad games, will inevitably contribute in some way shape or form. The likes of Mata however, can very easily play 90 minutes without contributing anything of note, because he is quite a limited player in respect to what he actually brings to the team;
Young - Good pace, good defensive contribution, decent crossing, can also cut inside and shoot.
Fellaini - Chest control and general strength/holdup play making him a great outball for defenders. Also a guaranteed threat on set pieces/corners, and valuable in defending the same.
Rooney - Definition is a bit stretched here as Rooney is a striker not a midfielder, but he is a very versatile, complete player.

As for Mata - he isnt fast, he isnt particularly strong, he doesnt have the sort of workrate of a Rooney or Hazard and offers little defensively. In short, all he brings to the table are his technical attacking qualities - linking up, playing through balls and being a good finisher. Its a very limited skillset somewhat like Valencia, in that he is very good at what he does, but "what he does" is limited to a few things.

I imagine this comes across as me calling Mata crap, which I am not, and I dont think of him. In the exchange I had with <a class="username" data-user="69817, @prarek" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69817/">@prarek</a> last week after the City game I summed up my thoughts on Mata and his contributions. He is a good player and it is made more prominent by the fact that he seems such a likeable, nice bloke, however I dont think he will ever reach the sort of levels that the top PL players of recent years like Hazard, Silva or Suarez, until he is able to either expand his skillset or start impacting games consistently and "taking them by the scruff of their neck" to use the cliché.

5064~~~
I could understand the argument that Hazard's so much more influential in attack that he's allowed to do less defensively, but to think that Hazard's work rate is better than Mata's is incredible IMO. The only way that is true is he sprints more in possession and given how rare that is in a game in the grand scheme of things, I can't see how anyone could come to that conclusion beyond some inexplicable agenda. It almost seems like people are just towing the Mourinho line here and see what they want to see.

5065~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a>  I think we agreed on most points. I would like to point out a few things however. Firstly something we touched upon earlier. Mata may not be a good defender but he can play the pressing game very well which is a fact. He was top three in the league terms of winning possession in the final third in his last full season for Chelsea. A perfect example of this is Chelsea's game vs Spurs where Mata robs Walker from behind high up the pitch and feeds an assist for Sturridge. Its on youtube as well. I think the modern attacker spends more time in pressing than tackling as part of his defensive game as they are mostly up the pitch against defenders who rarely try to dribble past them, rather they pass the ball forward or sideways. Pressing, in a way, can be described as defending from the front, or atleast is a big part of it.

Secondly, he rarely loses the the ball, even in tight spaces and inside our own box too. There are other offensive players like Fellaini, Di Maria and Rooney who lose the ball more often. His passing is also the best in the team. Which is especially impressive considering the higher you play the harder it is to maintain a good passing accuracy which is why most defenders have a very good pass completion rate as they aren't as much under pressure. I feel these two things - pressing and ability to maintain possession in tight spaces goes some way in making up for his defensive contribution, or the lack of, which in itself might be a little overplayed as i don't think he's any worse than most playmakers out there. The article posted a few pages ago shows this to be true, that his defensive contribution really isn't as bad as its been made out to be.

Also one more thing that gets overlooked. He is very clinical in the box. He has 8 goals in 26 shots. That conversion rate is better than world class strikers like Aguero and Suarez. Better than Messi and Ronaldo. Think of any top european striker and no one has that good a conversion rate. Only Costa comes close. Simply put you create enough chances and he will score. I think thats a great 'attribute' to have.

Personally i've always felt that a luxury player is someone you could do without. That they can put up good numbers and look good in the process but really they don't make much of a difference on the overall performance of the team. They're just that.. a luxury. Id love to own an armani suit but really its a luxury i could do without. Id be fine with my two piece. Mata is not a luxury, he has been an integral part of our team's revival. He has also scored some vital winners, Liverpool, Stoke, Crystal Palace i can think of. He's performed against City. Seems harsh to label him luxury. I do admit he's got weaknesses - not the greatest defensively, not the strongest, cannot dribble, doesn't have great pace. Anyway this will be my last post on the luxury subject for a while as i've run out of things to say lol. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

5066~~~
This is essentially "Someone elses opinion is different to mine so they must have some agenda, because no other opinion can possibly be valid."


<a class="username" data-user="69817, @prarek" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69817/">@prarek</a> you make some good points - I agree that Mata is excellent at retaining possession and is very clinical (which is something we lack at times).
I have also run out of things to say after that last wall of text. I do think that even using your definition, Mata is probably the most dispensable of our front four (Rooney, Mata, Rooney, Young) which sounds harsh, but consider that Mata is often one of those taken off (he has only completed 90 minutes four times this calendar year), so I would say he isnt <i>that</i> integral, although his attacking play is obviously very easy on the eye.

5067~~~
Without going too far off topic, I don't see how Young is more valuable then Mata. Think of the players that can perform to a higher level then Young (obviously he is in great form but we know it's a good patch and to be the best, we need to upgrade), we have Di Maria, potentially Januzaj and the likely scenario of a player like Depay. All upgrades on Young (as well as he is doing) if we are looking to be the best in Europe. I don't think anyone can offer what Mata does and I don't see us selling Mata to bring in a similar player to him.

5068~~~
I didnt say that Young is the better, or more gifted player - but that in the current system it can be argued that he is more indispensable than Mata. This is based partially on form (which has been good for both players of course), but moreso on the fact that Young's game is better rounded than Mata's. I believe that LVGs reluctance to put Mata in a central role is due to his percieved lack of workrate/defensive contribution, and similarly that if we had two Mata's, he would avoid fielding both of them on the flanks at the same time for the same reasons.

5069~~~
The current system, while could be used for the next 10 years, is really just looking at next week in my opinion. And we need to be looking a lot further ahead than that.

I understand your argument but I think it needs a broader outlook. Yes, we need to perform next week and at the moment, Young ticks that box but overall, we need to be looking at how to become the best and I see Mata involved and Young not involved when it comes to that.

5070~~~
I agree. Herrera and Mata have a wonderful partnership out wide and they seem to love playing together which really shows. Whenever Mata gets the ball out wide Herrera makes a run to link up with him and provide an option. 

Not Rooney's fault of course, he's not a central midfielder and it was the first time he played the role of Herrera so to say.

5071~~~
Well not really, Mata has a very good work ethic and always puts a shift in, he just isn't very noticeable defensively because he's small so his work rate isn't as useful as it could be... He does press defenders well though. Certainly has been doing a lot more on the defensive side of things since about december compared to the start of the season.

5072~~~
I agree Mata is the better long term option, and if you told me that we could only keep one then I would choose Mata. However the original discussion was about Mata being a luxury player (or not), rather than who is the better long term squad option for us.

5073~~~
Tbh i dont think any of our attacking players were too bad or were the issue against chelsea.
We were just taking too long to move the ball forward and there was no real possession in the middle of the field.
They always had their back 4 on the edge of their box and matic and zouma shielding them, we never really got behind them. 
Drogba and Oscar in particular did a good job making things awkward too. It was a great defensive performance by all to be fair to them.
I'd put a lot of our difficulty with breaking through them down to missing carrick in particular, mcnair was a bit hesitant too which didn't help.
Shaw played well but blind is good at keeping the ball moving at a good speed. Probably seems backward to most but our defence was the issue with our attacking play imo.

Too much of our play was pinned out on the wings with very little space.
If the ball moved from one wing to the other it was generally rooney pinging the ball from one wing to the other as opposed to it being worked across the field.
I'd say mcnair probably had more possession in the attacking third in front of their goal than any of our other players.
Not trying to be too critical - they had a zouma and matic in midfield, it was always going to be a bit of a struggle.

Mata's impressed me a lot this season though.
I've criticised him in the past for his (lack of) defensive contribution but hes been as good as can be expected this season. 
He works hard, does a good job of covering the angles and hes smart and good at nicking the ball back when opposition players hesitate on the ball a bit long.
I'd struggle to think of a criticism this season outside of physical stuff that he cant really change like pace and being a big lump of a player who can bully people a bit.
He offers enough elsewhere that i dont particularly care though tbh. Im sure there'll be occasions when we want some more pace from our front 3 and he'll be dropped but hes a great option.

5074~~~
Except your opinions do not match up with Mata's stats. 

As for <b>workrate</b> against Liverpool Fellaini and Mata covered the most distance 11.6 KM, more than any other United player.  Carrick covered 11.4 KM, and next is Rooney covering only 10.6 KM.  He also had more touches than any other United player in this game.  Seems like an all around performance to me.

<b>Defensively...

Most importantly we all agree Hazard is awesome, yet look at the stats (thru December) for the creative force for Chelsea vs Mata (and remember Hazard takes PKs)...

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article8309852.ece/alternates/s615/Hazard-and-Mata.jpg" src="http://i1.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article8309852.ece/alternates/s615/Hazard-and-Mata.jpg"/>


Now if all these stats do not convince you think about when we started to play our great football this year.  We flamed out of the FA Cup to Arsenal and because of ADM's red card Mata got called into the starting line-up the next game... the start of our unbeaten streak until Chelsea.

I am sure all those great games and Mata being on the pitch scoring big goals against City and Pool are just coincidence <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>.

5075~~~
Without anyone to link with on the right he couldn't get into the game, he's not a player that has the attributes needed to play as isolated as he was today.

5076~~~
Took absolutely no responsibility today. Took the easy option every single fecking time. Not good enough Juan.

5077~~~
To be fair to Mata, he's working with right back with zero footballing intelligence or ability and that cant make life easy for him.

5078~~~
I said somewhere else that usually it is a Herrera/Mata/Valencia triangle. If one of those elements is well off their game, the whole thing breaks down.

5079~~~
Almost as though those good performances - with the same fullback - never happened.  

If he gets plaudits for good games he can take criticism when he's not good. Without trying to blame other players. 

He wasn't all that bad today anyway. Just a bit average. It happens. Players have good games and average games. We'd win the league if all our players had good games, every game.

5080~~~
I dont know how many times he had the possibility to play a risky pass,  but waited and opted for a simple side pass. He surely has the freedom to try something more adventurous, hopefully he finds his form again

5081~~~
Is there a player in the world that has shown they can consistently break down mourinho's chelsea at home when they park the bus? Pretty sure messi has failed at this task. I don't expect much from Mata

5082~~~
So what then, we should just concede defeat and set up with 10 defenders?

5083~~~
When he cut in he had so much space but did nothing with it, also it doesn't help when any pass he did play into the striker was miscontrolled or Rooney was so slow to react, the defender nipped in front and possession was lost. Very frustrating.

5084~~~
He's blatantly not a winger.

5085~~~
Unfortunately reverting back to how he was earlier in the season, with little penetration in his passing and an ease to nullify due to his lack of pace and stature.

5086~~~
No, not a traditional one anyway.

He's only going to work out there with quick passing and clever movement around him. He doesn't have the pace/skill to beat a defender one on one, so needs to be clever. When the passing is slow and the movement pedestrian (like today) he's virtually pointless.

5087~~~
Valid points, but he was just at fault with the pedestrian passing. Him and Valencia were playing some of the slowest one-two's I've seen.

5088~~~
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I thought he was terrible today. Didn't take any initiative to make something happen on his own, and just kept taking the easy option with every pass. It might have kept us in possession, but it wasn't going to get us a goal.

5089~~~
My stream was iffy, but from what I saw, Mata, Valencia and Herrera didn't seem to have those delightful, one-touch triangles going that they'd had during our winning run. Any particular reason why?

5090~~~
There was just no zip or fluency in it, it was always in front of their lines and very plodded.

5091~~~
Yeah that was my impression, but I'm curious as to why that's the case. Was just a collective malaise, or was there a more tactical explanation for it?

5092~~~
I think it was just a bad day at the office. We struggled in our switching over to the left side - Fellaini found himself in too many petulant duels that riled him up, Shaw did okay but wasted a few crosses, and Young didn't look anywhere near as threatening as he has been recently. As a result, almost some sort of telepathy, the right side struggled.

5093~~~
It happened so often in the first half, it's bit unfair to blame him after he gave up trying for through passes after that.

5094~~~
We don't concede an early goal. Any team in the world finds it tough after conceding an early goal at the bridge vs mourinho's chelsea. Maybe there's some player in the world we could sign that means we could create lots of open play chances in that scenario - but I don't think so

5095~~~
Well we didnt concede *early* against Chelsea - it was the 38th minute, close to HT.

I maintain that in a game where over the 90 minutes we have 70% possession, that it is players like Mata who we need to be able to make the difference. Against stubborn, organised defenses is where a defence splitting pass, a clever one-two, a good through ball....these are the tools that we need.

If we are playing against a side who are attacking us, rather than sitting back, there are plenty of options - pace, long balls etc. It is against the stubborn defences that we need the "creators" to create something, and that is the category that Mata certainly would appear to fit into.

Basically, I dont want to get into the "luxury player" debate again (to be fair, I was impressed by some of the defensive efforts from Mata today) - but it is against the organised, stubborn defences where we need that sort of player to shine I feel. Against weaker, lesser teams basically anyone should be able to do the job (within reason). You pay £37m for a top quality playmaker for precisely the type of game we had last week against Chelsea, in my opinion.

5096~~~
Yeah I get it. My point was the best players in the world have failed to cut open Mourinho sides that park the bus. The player that will do that consistently doesn't appear to exist. 

There have been times where I've been very critical of mata when he's created nothing vs very defensive sides. I just don't think it's fair vs this chelsea side, at home, a goal up, playing for the title. No player in the world could be relied on, give him a break

5097~~~
Valencia in particular was extremely slow at releasing it, but Everton did a cracking job of filling in the holes so the guys just ended up going for the easy option. A bit gutless at times, particularly when you're already trailing in the game.

5098~~~
He was a bit flat, lacked some dynamism on the ball I thought. Those saying he isn't a winger or whatever are being a bit hasty. He can clearly play there (as he has shown).

5099~~~
I know he's the nicest man alive and a Caf favourite but he isn't really what I want to see in a United front 3, I feel in that formation you need two dynamic and fast wide attackers supporting the lone #9.

5100~~~
So you didn't enjoy his performances vs Tottenham, Liverpool, Aston Villa and City? He may not fit the conventional winger profile, but he's more than capable of being decisive from that position.

5101~~~
It's pretty obvious that if you cut him off from Herrera he's not going to offer much, when you play wide in a front 3 you need to be able to drive in with the ball and commit defenders, he's never going to be that player. I think there are games we can use him there but he wouldn't be a starting choice for me, in the last 2 games it looks like the triangle stuff we used in the prior 4 games has been sussed and the limitations individually of a couple of players have been highlighted.

5102~~~
Fair enough - I agree that a lot of players can and will struggle against Mourinho teams like that. Even the mighty Fellaini had a quiet game <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5103~~~

5104~~~
The problem you are always going to face eventually is that the teams wisen up and then plan to cut such things out. The Triangle passing system has been key to us for the past 6 weeks along with Fellaini and teams have now seen that, and plan accordingly to prevent it. Now we are at the stage where LVG has to earn his money and think of alternate ways to freshen things up. Whether that may be to put Di Maria in on that wing against West Brom to throw off the scent is something LVG should probably be looking at. I would of liked to of seen the Triangle system with Rafael rather than Valencia initially though, think that could of been possibly even better.

5105~~~
The video was great! Why did they show Fellaini goal against Tottenham though? Mata didn't assists or play a part in it, did he?

5106~~~
I think they're showing his hugs, referring to his blog posts that always ends in 'Hugs!'.

5107~~~
Hope he has a great day and spoils himself.

5108~~~
Hope he gets plenty if hugs for his birthday. He's a ripping bloke who's nigh on impossible to dislike.

5109~~~
Happy birthday Juan. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5110~~~
Hugs.

5111~~~
Agreed, it's time to try a switch up and utilize the options we have, I just think you need starters that can vary their game as opposed to actually needing to swap them out in the middle of a good run.

5123~~~
Agent Mata needs to be activated to convince De Gea to stay

5124~~~
The only guy who looked like trying something out there. He actually dribbled past more players than probably all our others expensive wankers put together.

5125~~~
Looked the most likely to make something happen in the second half.

5126~~~
He's looked a shadow of the player from a few weeks ago. Too much sideways passing.

5127~~~
I gave him my MOTM, not that it matters

5128~~~
He was decent but Moyes still paid 2 times more for him than he is worth

5129~~~
He's supposed to be our creative hub but he always looks as though he needs someone else to be that. Too much sideways passing.

5130~~~
For a wide player the lack of attacking his fullback is pathetic.

Ok you can blame tactics but he is always coming inside into traffic, he needs to atleast try and get to the byline?

5131~~~
He's not actually very creative at all.

5132~~~
I thought he was decent but wtf has happened to his crossing? He used to get so many assists from his "short" crosses but now it looks more like he is spending his free time hanging out with Valencia and Young.

5133~~~
One of our better players. Seemed determined to get us something from the game on his own, despite being surrounded by flops.

5134~~~
He still crosses the ball but he floats it therefore it's got little chance to create danger.

5135~~~
Yup, his game is far more fixated on goal scoring and finalising attacks. He is probably our most clinical finisher.
That's not what he's there, though.

5136~~~
Tidy player but no creativity.

5137~~~
Thought he was pretty mediocre today. Shame that everyone else was poor too.

5138~~~
Agreed, not sure what everyone else saw, but every time the ball fell his way, he looked as though he wasn't sure what to do.

5139~~~
Does anyone really think he'll be here next season? Good player that he is but does he fit our style?

5140~~~
He can't accelerate like a Silva or Coutinho; technically good and intelligent but lacks pace

5141~~~
he was ok, the amount of times we miss his clever runs into the box is ridiculous. We need a cm that can play through balls like Gundogan.

5142~~~
Tidy passing that goes nowhere seems to be the epitome of our style atm.

5143~~~
Easy to defend against

5144~~~
When was the last time he created a chance? He creates nothing when playing as a winger.

Additionally, his set pieces are absolutely woeful, too. 

Shadow of the player we witnessed at Chelsea.

5145~~~
There's no point in playing him out on the wing against teams that park the bus. We need width against those teams and all he does is cut in. Not to mention the buffoon playing beside him who rarely goes forward and if he does, shits himself and turns back.

5146~~~
He can't play as a winger against teams which park the bus.

5147~~~
Ah, I see it's "<i>open season to ressurect your previously unpopular agenda with any fielded player"</i> week. Good good.

5148~~~
I don't know if he's that much slower than Silva, but I think City play with a higher tempo, which suits him.

5149~~~
Blaming Valencia for Mata's shortcomings?

5150~~~
Without Herrera's support, and only Valencia's usual overlap, he had fewer options and wasn't able to influence much. Get Herrera back on the right and I think he does better. Can see Mata being benched though.

5151~~~
So true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5152~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Pretty much.

5153~~~
He continues to play it way too safe, which could also be an order from LVG though. He didn't commit many mistakes, but he really create anything either, which is his job.

5154~~~
Not at all. They were both as bad as each other today. But having a floating right winger means you have to have a real right back there who will overlap and provide an outlet when the inverted winger cuts in. Valencia rarely does that.

5155~~~
People clearly got carried away a few weeks ago. Understandably I guess, but this (plus maybe a goal) is closer to what you'll get over a season from Mata.

5156~~~
Glad I wasn't the only one who missed that. I thought I was making that up!

5157~~~
Yeah, games against shit opponent when the whole team is crap are definitely the ones that define the player, not the away games at Anfield and some other unimportant ganes like that. How he plays against WBA at Old Trafford is all that matters.

5158~~~
I argued before in this thread and I will say it again - Mata's job in the team is to create. We havent scored a goal in the last 3 games and so Mata needs to take some responsibility for that.
He looks tidy and technical and all that, but he just isnt a particularly productive player. It goes back to the "luxury player" debate.

5159~~~
Thought he should have been moved inside for Fellaini. It was too tight in there for Fellaini and it needed someone who could get on the ball and do something on the ground.

Did very well considering.

5160~~~
Mata should not be the player that has the burden of creating in our team. He is basically a second striker, he will eat up chances if he is given them. I'd say he is without a doubt our most clinical finisher right now

5161~~~
I agree. He would be the first person I would get rid of in the summer. I hold him mainly responsible for the poor form of our strikers and their subsequent lack of confidence. I was hoping he would be like a fabregas, carzola, iniesta or david silva type but he does not seem to like to dribble and clearly does not look for through passes or little neat touches to our strikers.
Seems like a nice guy but he was not brought here for his personality.

5162~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5163~~~
He's our no 10/false winger, if his task isnt too create, what is he doing over there? We need people who create chances in that position, no striker.

5164~~~
He probably is but he hasn't got the pace or physical presence to play as a striker so the only way he can justify his place in the team is as a creator and he often struggles to create. He's a great wee player but bloody hard to use properly. You can see why Mourinho had his doubts.

5165~~~
He's a bit of both. Create and score. Jack of both trades. He tried to release RVP thrice yesterday that i can think off. It just didn't come off. RVP missed it by an inch on the right, bit too long. And then there was the ariel ball again down the middle missed by a whisker and then another that was cut off very well by their defender. Apart from that most of his forward passes were to release Valencia down the right.

edit: I also noticed he constantly made runs into the box from the right which were mostly ignored and also cut off atleast twice. Overall he kept possession very well but didn't offer much threat.

5166~~~
I don't think he's a jack of all trades at all. He's a slow, technically gifted floating attacker who is best picking up pockets and funnelling space to create goals. He must surely be a short term option at RW because it has not been working well for the last month.

5167~~~
Not sure how my comment elicited that poor, sarcastic response. I don't see things in as black and white as you, clearly.

"All that matters" and "define the player" probably suggest your own viewpoint more than mine, bearing in mind they were terms you wrote, and not me.

For the record: Three points are three points in the Premier League. You don't get more from Anfield. I'm sure Hazard would testify to the importance of every game, when making an impression.

5168~~~
This says it all really. Three (four?) years in this league, and we still actually don't (and it's not just these two posters) know how much Mata should be tasked with creating in a team. Is he even a 'number 10'?
He's a luxury player. Unless he's played as a striker, and used for his best asset (finishing) he'll be inconsistent and anonymous throughout large parts of the season.

That wouldn't be such an issue if he weren't a supposed top class 'number 10'.

5169~~~
Dunno, he was assisting for fun pre-Mourinho. In that 2012/13 season where Chelsea had a shed ton of games he racked up something like 35 assists. I think his own attitude has changed though to emphasize scoring unfortunately.

5170~~~
Wasn't so much creativity in those assists though. I'm not saying he can't be a creative passer, but the majority of his assists at Chelsea were from set pieces/ playing the final pass in a counter attack (see Theo Walcott getting 20 assists in his best two seasons at Arsenal).

5171~~~
Said it before. Glad to here it straight from a Chelsea fan.

5172~~~
wtf

5173~~~
Despite your name, I could have sworn you supported Chelsea.

5174~~~
A good chunk were set-pieces but hardly 'most'. I doubt even half were, and if they were - that's still 17 assists. 

Plus, how is 'playing the final ball' not creative? You say that dismissively like it's something that won't work here. I figure that we won't counter quite as often due to the style, but that shows he had an eye for a pass and the ability to execute it well - that's the sort of creativity we need to open up locked defenses. 

His starting position is far too wide for him to have those opportunities though against teams who will park the bus. We end up being completely camped outside their box, and our midfielders are already occupying those inside spaces that he'd want to come into. There's just no space for him to exploit, no interchanging to be had that doesn't result in him at the byline mostly.

5175~~~
Nope! There's a Chelsea fan called <a class="username" data-user="11509, @antihenry" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/11509/">@antihenry</a> - I'd assume you've mixed us up. In future, please don't. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Fwiw I completely agree with you on Mata here:

5176~~~
Ahh, yes.. that makes sense. Apologies.

People always refer to his time at Chelsea, but (a) as you said - a lot of set-pieces, and Chelsea have been great at them for a decade.
(b) when you break down how he played, and the type of assists he made at Chelsea, as well as the type of football they played - it doesn't translate to the skills needed to play as effectively in this system. 

He's in the top three finishers at the club, and can lay on chances from forward positions, so he's worth having as a goal-scoring impact sub and versatile option. But nothing more, in my opinion.

5177~~~
He was tidy and decent, but didn't look like creating. Not sure whether that is down to him though or more down to LvG's tactics.

5178~~~
That applies to every player of his type, including Silva and Ozil. That's the nature of the type of player he is.

5179~~~
Silva, in particular, <i>isn't </i>a player of his type though.

5180~~~
He is missing Herrera badly. The link up play with Herrera when he was still playing higher up the field was a big part of why he looked so dangerous in the weeks before Carrick's injury. The problem is that neither Rooney nor Valencia have any chemistry or understanding with Mata which he could thrive on.

5181~~~
He looks to hold up play and control possession more, but he's still at heart a creative player who looks to interplay and exploit space. You stick him on the wing against a team who sits back and you'll see him struggle too - it's happened for them plenty of times. It's why we were so often lauding Toure for powering through and saving them last season.

5182~~~
Not really. Silva and Ozil are fairly similar players, Mata isn't, even if they're all preferred 'No 10s'.

At Chelsea he wouldn't run games like the other two do, though you could argue that's because of their tactics. But since he's been to United he's played all over the place, and I'm sure you'd agree that his strengths are his technique, his finishing, and his attitude, but not his creativity, passing and play-making abilities. He has more of the skillset of a forward than Ozil and Silva, but without the physical attributes to shine there against every team in the Premiership. That's why he hasn't been able to make it as a '10' at United, and why he could still be a success for you, but it would have to be (IMO) as an end-product player, instead of a creator.

5183~~~
Id say Silva and Ozil aren't all that similar. Silva controls games and can play deeper, Ozil doesn't. Ozil is a player for the final third, much like Mata. But Ozil is a better creator and Mata is a better finisher.

5184~~~
The bit in bold could be said of Sterling, and we'd never claim he was similar.
It's one of those cases where in theory they <i>should </i>be similar, and it's easy to just say they're similar.. but they actually aren't.

Silva's positioning is completely different, because he's much better at shielding the ball, and  at skipping past a man from standstill. He's more patient by nature. He's more likely to exchange a few deep passes before assisting the assister, whereas Mata is more likely to directly assist the goal. Mata is a much better finisher, and gravitates towards goal a lot more. Though he has tidy technique, he's essentially more of an instinctive player in a similar way to Rooney, which couldn't be said of Silva.

When you break down the limitations and weaknesses between the two, Silva is significantly less likely to be made quiet than Mata, thus going back to your original point, the situation doesn't apply to them both.

People probably get bored with comparing the two, but you always have people claiming it's not down to Mata's specific limitations, and that it would happen to Silva too.. which I think believe is completely false.

5185~~~
Not sure about that, but I agree with the Mata-Silva comparisons.

5186~~~
Some brilliant assists in this video. Would like to see more of this.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDX8hef0pf8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2.05,
2.20 for 2 assists v tottenham;
3.25

These 4 were especially nice. Yes there was set pieces in there but that's not a surprise considering how good his crossing was for them.

5187~~~
The volley against us by Juan was one of the best goals I have ever seen. Such a underrated goal.

5188~~~
His lofted pass for Demba Ba's volley was also sexy. God knows, he doesn't look half as creative in most games for us. Some nice touches, some nice turns but his inswinging crosses are not effective at all.

5189~~~
Been saying it since the start of the season when people pretended the main reason he wasn't in the team was because he didn't work hard enough (which apparently is not even true). He's quite simply not creative enough and doesn't bring much to the table aside from goals. A glorified striker basically. Of course, goals aren't bad but we have plenty of players who can score provided they get chances, which they don't because Mata and Young create feck all.

And people are exaggerating the link up play that he partakes in. The whole Herrera/Mata/Valencia triangle (which lasted for about 2 games and was significantly less effective than the Blind-Fellaini-Young axis on the left) was mostly Herrera's quality shining through and was apparent even early on in the season when he played together with Rafael.

5190~~~
Static attacking play limits Mata's abilities. He will not dribble past a couple of opponents, he will use his touch and vision for inter-play and a killer-pass. Taking into account the mobility of our strikers and quality of our fullbacks' overlaps, Mata basically has Herrera to play with. Juan is no Hazard or Silva in this regard.

5191~~~
I don't really like him wide right, but in the current formation (lvg's favorite) it's probably the only position he will realistically ever get a chance to play.

5192~~~
Totally agreed. Not a bad thing, but I'd say his role should be as an impact sub in an ideal world.

5193~~~
Without Herrera there to link up then his (lack of) speed becomes a factor. it's like Barcelona playing without Iniesta or Xavi but trying to control possession... if we play mata ont he wing then we need Herrera (or someone of that ilk) in close proximity.

5194~~~
Pretty much. Even the thread regarding how much of a miss Carrick is doesn't take into consideration that missing Carrick has a knock on effect to other positions; it means Herrera has to drop back and Rooney has had to drop back. 

A key part of Mata's game was the triangle between him, Herrera and Valencia. You drop Herrera deeper and that triangle is destroyed, no-one else in our midfield can play the quick, one touch play that brought the best out of both of them.

5195~~~
Looking at the table now, thank god for his two goals against Liverpool. Potentially season saving.

5196~~~
If he isn't going to be played as a #10, he shouldn't be here. He's top class in that position, but out wide his complete lack of pace lets him down and makes us predictable.

5197~~~
Pretty much spot on.

5198~~~
Basically this.

He needs movement and pace around him (of which we have very little) for him to be effective. Otherwise, he's basically pointless.

5199~~~
What a weird performance. He looked great at times and very positive with the ball, moving it through their midfield playing one twos and actually being very creative and dangerous, and at times you wouldn't notice he was playing. That ball for Jones was also very stupid. And the penalty incident. But good penalty though.

5200~~~
Wasn't too confident of him scoring after seeing that graphic of his previous penalties. Anyone think he's going to take penalties for the long haul? Or will it be a fad?

5201~~~
Good pen but not much else. Should take a good long hard look at Ashley Young.

5202~~~
Thought he was better the more he drifted in and negated the right side.

5203~~~
I thought he was good overall and a decent penalty. He will remain our penalty taker until he misses, it's how LvG does it.

5204~~~
Thought the same. He was able to link up with Blind and Herrera more and get in behind their midfield. I know Fellaini got the goal but there a times like today and last week where I think he should be switched to a No10 position which of course means sacrificing Afroman. He's been getting increasingly isolated over the last few games and our play suffers for it.

5205~~~
Interesting little stat from the BBC - Before today, Mata had missed his last three penalties in English football.

5206~~~
He also missed one in Chelsea's CL final shootout.

5207~~~
I thought he played well compared to the average performance of the rest of the team. Rarely misplaced any passes and was probably the leading player dictating our tempo during the periods of possession we did have.

5208~~~
Tbh i think we would have suffered more losing Fellaini than mata. They were kind of scary on set pieces.
I think the ozil comparison is a decent one, a bit of pace around him could do wonders and its hard to argue with 9 goals in a season like this.

I think he'll get games next season but wont be a nailed on starter ever.
Fellaini will play against a lot of league sides i'd think, maybe mata will play more in europe. 
I kind of hope we get 2 wingers and a bit more pace on the pitch more often next season though.

5209~~~
On Sky Sports they flashed up a graphic of where he placed his last four pens. The three red dots scared the crap out of me!

5210~~~
Certainly wasn't his best game but the combination of his technical and finishing ability at least mean he can contribute something even when he isn't playing amazingly well. Proper footballer.

5211~~~
The set piece thing is a good point. Could really do with adding extra height to the team in the summer to aide that situation.

Depending on who we buy in the summer I can actually see Fellaini dropping to the bench in a lot of games and being used mainly for tactical reasons, against teams that are good at set pieces and have a lot of height or teams where he can just absolutely bully them. Agree on Mata though, think he'll feature most heavily in Europe next season.

5212~~~
You and me both!

5213~~~
The false winger role is a difficult one for him if Herrera is not getting close, and without the Carrick safety net Herrera is playing deeper, this leaves Mata isolated as you say and without the ability to play one twos he can't hurt a team from out wide as he doesn't have the pace to run at defenses. It will be interesting to see how LvG uses him next season, I feel unless we move to a 4-2-3-1 he'll struggle to get games as a #10.

5214~~~
I was surprised he took the penalty considering he doesn't have a great record. Glad he put that away.

5215~~~
Was on a different level when central towards the end of the game

5216~~~
Very strange his penalty statistics being such a clinical finisher from open play and free kicks.

5217~~~
A better game today. Good penalty.

5218~~~
He really should have it written into his contract that he is never, under any circumstances, allowed to shave his beard. 

Ever.

5219~~~
Shat myself when he took the ball for the pen. Two reasons, I was so excited but also that I only ever saw him miss two penalties for Chelsea. Showed good nerves though.

Overall, a decent performance especially considering the way the game played out. Showed some great glimpse in the 2nd half when he came into a central area and was able to turn. That's where he should be playing.

5220~~~
He's been good, but we were having trouble controlling the tempo when Palace were on top. None of our midfield today knew how to slow the game down. You saw Herrera and Mata playing lovely one-twos around the centre circle and Fellaini taking a quick free-kick in our half when we really needed to just hold onto the ball for a while.

5221~~~
Unacceptable, a disgrace to the shirt! What was he thinking?
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">How could he shave that magnificent beard?</span>

5222~~~
Double figures for a midfielder though. Fantastic effort that, think Ronaldo was the last time that happened and he almost shouldn't count as he was freakishly good.

5223~~~
Did very well i thought, think Valencia should of made better use of the space made by mata. His first touch is as good as it gets!

5224~~~
Put very little disguise on his pen. Was obvious were he was putting it. Great little player. Needs pace around him

5225~~~
Could Mata be a first choice starter in Fellaini's position next season? Some say he's the type of attack midfielder LVG likes.

5226~~~
Depends on which midfielders arrive.

5227~~~
Apparently he missed 3 of his last 4 before that one, thank feck he scored it. Was pretty good today, far from his best but was like a standard 7/10 performance. Only thing was that we were on the back foot a lot more then normal so he didn't have enough time on the ball to make as big of an impact as he would've otherwise... Probably should have scored that one chance in the second half as well but he did well none the less. His touch is ridiculous though, always perfect.

5228~~~
Petulant little tosser today. 

How he wasn't booked is beyond me....Very unusual for him. He's not like that

5229~~~
Not a very good penalty imo  Gk guess the correct direction and almost saved it.

5230~~~
Would you also say RVN's penalties weren't very good as he almost always went the same way and keepers always knew where he was going to place it? Mata's penalty was excellent.

5231~~~
He couldn't have hit it better - not his fault the keeper guessed it right, after all it's most likely a guess. In such circumstances, the best you can do is put it in the corner and keep it out of GK's reach as much as you can, which he did to perfection. I'm not convinced that he should be our penalty taker, though!

5232~~~
huh?

5233~~~
Hook.Line.Sinker.

I agree though, disappointed to see the beard go. Should be back to something appropriate for Arsenal.

5234~~~
Oh crap
Pulling a Keane will be impressive<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5235~~~
It wasn't well disguised but very well placed. So the keeper had little chance even if he guessed the right way. I still don't feel comfortable with Mata taking the pens. He'd be the one player id bet my house on to score from a chance in open play though.

5236~~~
I like the idea of Mata as a No. 10 with Depay and Di Maria providing pace and dribbling ability on the wings, but he seemed to get crowded out of the game too easily when he's played centrally for us before. It could leave us very lightweight in central midfield too. I think his current position on the right side of atack is a good fit for his skill set and our style of play, but we really need a better attacking right back than Valencia to provide width on that side.

5237~~~
Yeh me too ! You didn't really want someone that's missed there last 3 taking that pen but fair play to him for having the balls . 
Unless LVG told him he was taking them

5238~~~
Wonder if he is going to be a first team regular next season, what with LVG stating that he would like another creative player.  Disappointing how he can be instrumental in some matches and completely vanish in others, if only he could be more consistent.  Still believe he could be a key player for us if he is deployed as a no.10 with 2 midfield players to create the space he needs to operate.  Playing as a false winger merely limits our attacks to come from the left, and teams that park the bus can more easily contain us.  We've got no attacking prowess on the right as Mata cannot take on the defender and Valencia's crossing is abysmal. However even if not first team regular Mata is a great asset to the squad- he provides depth, he is a free kick specialist and he really seems to like playing for United.

5239~~~
According to our Facebook, he's been nominated for Content of the Year at the Facebook Football Awards! Almost as good as the Ballon D'Or.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/football/app_370670299785157" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/football/app_370670299785157</a>

5240~~~
Get voting people.

5241~~~
Done.

5242~~~
He's scored 10 goals in 26 starts... that's a pretty impressive return for a "wide-man"

5243~~~
If we get a proper DM we might even see Mata played centrally. With someone similar to Matic we could allow more freedom for our attackers.

5244~~~
Did anyone else notice him playing as a number 10 for about 10-15 minutes in the lead up to our second goal?

Dunno if it was just him drifting central or a more formal tactical reshuffle but it worked quite well.

5245~~~
really happy for mata that he was able to turn his season around... no coincidence it happened right when we started winning, too.

5246~~~
He's brilliant.

Quietly consistent, highly skilled and hugely likable.

His tackles/possession regained stats are awesome for a creative player, and his goal and assist stats are always of an elite level.

A ruthless finisher who's proven himself this season to be a stealthy winger - appearing at crucial moments to affect games.

Mata, Fellaini and Young have been the most important outfield players in dragging us over the line this season (particularly since Carrick's been out).

5247~~~
His goals for us, he doesntt have more than 10 league assists in more than a year for us.

5248~~~
Yeah, definitely started having more of an influence. He's tended to drift around the pitch a lot while starting out wide the last few months anyways, acts like a 4th central midfielder at times (which helps, considering 2 of them went missing on the weekend).

5249~~~
If the strikers could shoot this season, that stat might change. Never judge a player on the amount of assists as it depends on something out of their control.

5250~~~
Considering the fact that he wasn't played much when Rooney was scoring earlier in the season and that the rest of our strikers are playing like they would have problems scoring against an under 10s team, Mata not having 10 league assists this season is normal.

5251~~~
His goal scoring ability is phenomenal, he even has a Euro final goal and a world cup goal despite coming on as a (very late) sub. I am actually baffled when he is in a half decent position for us and doesn't score whereas with our underperforming strikers nothing baffles me anymore. 

He does not have Silva's playmaking ability but he has lots of other attributes. He keeps the ball very well, is adaptable, big game player, doesn't moan when getting dropped, great passer, oh and he wins a lot of fouls (which will only increase in Europe as refs in the CL are going to whistle more). 
Oh and did I already mention that apart from a couple of games he seems to be the only player who hasn't caught the United virus of being regularly injured either.

5252~~~
<a class="username" data-user="74337, @Eric'sCollar" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74337/">@Eric'sCollar</a> well di Maria has like 10 in this season, and he's been very poor. Fact is, Mata doesnt create that much for us and is more of a finisher for us, he has brilliant movement and positioning in the final third, that's his biggest asset.

5253~~~
Our strikers were very clinical at the start of the season.

5254~~~
But do you think he's not creating as much because of him as a player or how we're using him/setting up. I personally don't think that if you did a direct swap and took Mata out and replaced him with a silva, ozil, iniesta etc that you would see a huge amount of difference in terms of creativity. Each of them is better than Mata at getting past someone but they'd still all struggle to create in a team that has very limited movement/slow on the ball.

I mean it's not like we're seeing Fellaini, Rooney, Young make runs and Mata not find them and that's not counting the fact that most the time because of where he is positionally the type of pass he and players like him would want to play isn't on, it's down to a long pass/cross, most the time when the opposition have already packed their box with players making the success of the pass down to a mistake/how much the players wants it than a top quality ball. Then there's very little option to play a give and go with the front four as the players around him aren't hugely suited to it.

A player like Di Maria with his pace will do better in such a set up and make the numbers as he has done, although he's also given the ball away a lot and frustrated. That said if we were planning to stick with Fellaini where he is then I'd probably agree that over a season we'd probably have more luck with someone like ADM in the team however as influential as Fellaini has been I can't believe he's going to stay in the number 10 role going forward. I see him more as a Park player in terms of coming in for big games because he can make a difference. 

Personally I think Mata has shown enough that we need to play to his strengths more and that if we get players like ADM when he's back on form (if he stays) then he can make stuff happen, even if he's not playing a cutting the ball/getting the final assist just his use of the ball in tight areas, retaining possession in the final third etc all help to keep the momentum of the attach going. I think Mata flanked by ADM and Depay/Januzaj has a huge amount going for it with the right midfield behind it.

5255~~~
Creativity in regards to assists is a shit way at looking at things in my opinion. Look at our goal against Newcastle, where Falcao cuts it back for Rooney to tap in. Falcao gets credited with the assist and rightly so but it's a great ball by Mata over the top to Falcao. In so many cases, it's the 2nd last ball, not the final ball that 'creates' the goal.

5256~~~
If you want to go down the full stats route - Juan Mata has our second highest pass completion rate for anyone who's started more than 5 games for us this season (sort of unsurprisingly, Valencia is top - considering how safe he plays plays it and he's a very accurate 5/10 yard passer) and he's joint 2nd for key passes per 90 minutes with Rooney (again, unsurprisingly ADM is top)...

But really, the fact is that the bloke scores a goal for every 2.5 starts... which for a winger, is a great return. Who needs "creativity" when you're actually providing... you know... goals.

5257~~~
Yeah definitely- Scholes is a prime example of that particularly in the latter part of his career and similarly Carrick, they might not often play the final pass but they're the one's who got us in position in the first place.

5258~~~
I've changed my mind during the last few months when he played on the right and I think he can be very effective if we get a good attacking rightback. Herrera is nailed on as a right midfielder too.

5259~~~
Because nobody else is providing the 'creativity'. Ander alone isn't enough, and Di Maria is always benched. For all the wankfest about how improved Young and Fellaini are they're still nowhere near a level to continuously create chances in matches. The latter especially, it just won't be a part of his game.

5260~~~
I think it's a combination of both, in the final third he's one of the best, but I hardly see him splitting defensec with a beautiful cross or through ball whixh sets a striker 1 vs 1, his lack of making something happen out of his own, his speed, dribbling skills, physique hold him back to as he can barely pass defensers. If you swap Mata for the Hazard, Silva,  Ozil their respective clubs would go backwords in terms of creating chances imo.

5261~~~
Wouldt call it shit, it isnt definite thats true. But also in terms of key passes and chances created, Mata is a far distance off from Silva, Hazard, Ozil, de Bruyne.

5262~~~
He's been our best attacking player this season by quite a distance in my opinion. He should be one of the 5-6 players we build around next season.

5263~~~
But those players are playing in teams set up for them. Our team couldn't really be further away from how those players want to play in the final third. Our central strikers and Fellaini aren't particularly mobile and often play with their back to goal and Young isn't the sort who's going to run in often from his flank. If ADM/Januzaj were playing and in form and linking with Mata then I think his numbers for key passes etc would be higher but you can't make the passes if they're not there unless your're a ADM who's got the pace to make his own openings and crossing the ball not looking to play people in. 

As I said I agree that Mata doens't have the speed/dribbling as some players of his ilk but the far bigger issue for me is the type of players in our attack.

5264~~~
Mata has had an excellent season, IMO.

He had a slight dodgy patch at an important part of the season which has led to him not getting the credit that he deserves. Overall he has been brilliant.

5265~~~
What a player. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5266~~~
Certainly a good season, pretty consistent. He's having a good game again today.

5267~~~
Playing beautifully so far

5268~~~
Impressive half today. If only he was a bit quicker, though.

5269~~~
Him and Herrera just running the game right now. Can't even get near those two when they get the "passing carousel" going.

5270~~~
Brilliant so far.

5271~~~
Probably the best outfield player we have at the club.

5272~~~
Him and Herrera are just superb. Get a proper intelligent RB next to them and it'd be superb.

5273~~~
Hilarious over exaggeration. This Herrera-Mata combination is largely myth.

Almost everything has come down our left as has been the case in most of our games this season.

5274~~~
Biggest difference between the 2 sides is Young. After all the interplay between young, blind/LB and Fellaini, it's young that puts the ball in. On the right, both Herrera and mata are more involved in the interplay than putting the ball in and unfortunately Valencia isn't upto it. The right side will be superb with a proper RB.

5275~~~
Not really. Rojo has been non existent today and Young has still looked superb. Blaming Valencia is cheap way out given his movement in and around is still excellent even if his final ball is shit.

Young-Fellaini on the left have been far far more effective and productive than Mata-Herrera.

5276~~~
I'm saying the difference between the 2 sides is a player willing to put the final ball in, that's young. Both the spaniards are more about the interplay than the final ball. Hence the better productivity from the left.

5277~~~
How many times did Mata and Herrera outnumber their players with quick passing and played the ball left to Young leaving him with lot of space? Probably at least 4 or 5 times in just one half.

How many times did that happen from left side to right? None.

Now, I am not saying that Young should do that too, but our good play and winning the space on the right side definitely helps our left side and it's really not difficult to notice it. But then you hardly ever notice anything good about Mata.

5278~~~
Fizzled out of the game after a very impressive first half.

5279~~~
he's so good, we need a good RB for next season.

5280~~~
Worked his arse off. Would like to see him try more risky passes and get a cross into the box once in a while.

5281~~~
Love Juan. Hope he improves again next season. And hopefully we get the right players in that can allow him to play the way he can.

5282~~~
Probably although a lot of the 'quick passing' is run of the mill exchange of passes and is not even all that quick. And if the sum total of their quick passing is putting Young into space then it's not doing anything that a long diagonal into Young wouldn't. In fact the latter would be better as it often takes the opposing winger out of contention. 

That's because doing that is pointless as Mata has no pace and is not going to beat his man. And Mata drifts in a lot more meaning often a pass out wide in not an option. This has nothing to do with either Fellaini or Young. I'm sure they are more than good enough to make a 10 yard to pass to the right should they so desire.

A lot of the Herrera-Mata-Valencia triangle is exaggerated and is mostly Herrera dictating things with his movement and passing. He did that very well even with Rafael at the start of the season. It was quite obvious how much impact Herrera has when he wasn't playing there for a couple of games.

As for the comment above. I like Mata but I'm sorry he does not create anywhere near enough chances as he should. Seems to get a free pass for it though from many...Young gets ripped to shreds for not creating enough and Mata gets praised for playing 1-2's near the middle of the park.

5283~~~
Some classy stuff in the first half, the whole team dipped in the second half once RvP came on.

5284~~~
Need a decent RB to help Juan and Ander on that side. It was there with Rafael. They need help.

5285~~~
The performance of the team dipped because Mata couldn't influence the game from a central position, that's why in the first half we were most creative. In the second half Herrera sat deeper, Mata stayed wide and Fellaini moved to #10, we lost creativity. Mata should play as #10 its a no brainer even if it means dropping Fellaini. We are far more creative with him there and that link up he has with Herrera will be more effective. He linked wide players, Midfielders and the striker when he cut in a played more centrally, why can't we just play him there, Fellaini even with his strengths at best is no match to Matas creativity and ball retention.

5286~~~
Wonderful player.

5287~~~
Because for all his "creativity", Young has one assist more than Mata this season. And Mata actually averages 1.5 key passes per game to Young's 1.3. And Young is considered as our most creative player this season by many, especialy in comparision with Mata. They are both lacking creativity, but Mata is involved in midfield dominating the game(see first half today) while Young should be the bloke who is getting praise for his end product and creativity like any other good winger at top club. Which he isn't doing. 
Mata also has 9 goals versus Young's 2(on par with someone like Blind).

If we are going to look dangerous in whole game then I would pick Young, but if we are going to win the game then I would definitely pick Mata.

5288~~~
I hope we sell him, He is not being used to the best of his abilities at all. 

He used to play through balls all the time at Chelsea and have a lot of assists, but now he isn't very creative at all.

5289~~~
He has to shoot more instead of passing it out wide all the time.

5290~~~
We're not going to sell him. He's played a lot this season and LVG has said he's one of our best players, something that should be evident to anyone who has watched us this season.

Given that LVG said he was left out of the team due to balance (and Fellaini was introduced for the same reason) I suspect we're likely to see the team change into something that ends up suiting Mata more rather than Mata being sold because he doesn't suit the team as is.

5291~~~
Played well but needs to be more decisive.

5292~~~
Polished performance today, but needs to shoot when the opportunity arises. Stop trying to out-Arsenal Arsenal please.

5293~~~
He's certainly more clinical than Young, no arguments from me but imo he doesn't make things happen. He's far too content to play sideways and backwards when he should be more proactive with the ball like Young is. Yes, Young's final ball can improve but a lot of the he creates space and chances purely by running with the ball and dragging player out of position.

Key passes don't mean much and not reflective of creativity. I mean Mata got a key pass for Young having a shot from miles out today. There's also the fact that Young's played a more defensive role for many games this season.

I don't think Mata was bad (he very rarely is). But I'd like to see him being (or at least try to) more decisive and proactive with the ball than what he's been.

5294~~~
Yeah, I noticed there was a bit of that at times today which was frustrating.

5295~~~
Best Spanish play-maker on the pitch.

And better than Ozil too.

5296~~~
I am delighted he is part of our team. Off the pitch and on the pitch. Hope to see him in the starting line up next season aswell. He should shoot more, he can certainly hit them.

5297~~~
That has more to do with the lack of movement of the strikers and supporting midfielders than Mata. We bring in a striker with movement and pace and you will see those incisive throughballs from Mata next season IMO.

5298~~~
Feck me... Is there anyone you don't want us to sell?

5299~~~
Incorrect.  Valencia seems afraid to cross the ball and when he does it never reaches a target, that's the difference between the left and right.

5300~~~
In the second half, he had a one two with Herrera, was on the edge of the box. He didnt shoot, then I realised he probably would have got in trouble with LVG for shooting <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I like him, hope he stays. The way we use him on the right side with herrera is beautiful.

5301~~~
Thats just not true. Blind and Herrera shoot very often when they are near the box, like today. Mata surely would have more freedom if we go by some posts in the philosophy thread.

5302~~~
I know, the smiley was meant to indicate it was tongue in cheek. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5303~~~
You'd think so, but try reading some of the shit on this place after a bad game.

5304~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He should definately shoot more often, i was disappointed when he passed it out wide again. It was a perfect position and he has it in him to score from there.

5305~~~
This place is amazing. It's the right back's fault that our left winger produced more then the right winger. In a game where our left back was probably the worst player in a United shirt and offered precisely zero going forwards. Flawless logic.

Mata played quite well but lacked cutting edge. Which has been a problem in recent weeks. All our penetration has come from Young taking on and beating his man, one on one. We lack that on the opposite flank and it makes us a bit one dimensional. A better striker might help, mind you.

5306~~~
Thought he played well considering the way the game played out around him. Thought he could have had a few shots from outside the box at times.

5307~~~
Yes, De Gea, Rooney, Rafael, Smalling, Jones, Carrick, Blind, Herrera, Wilson, McNair, Januzaj

5308~~~
My thoughts on his game. He wasn't great (as in Young great, like dribbling past players to create chances) but he was great (as in great for LVG's system). This has been the theme lately. His passing was spot on even under pressure and never lost possession. In the opposition half it was very clear how hard he was working, he was pressing till the end. Looked in great shape. Often got into great shooting positions as always inside the box but the ball never made it to him on those occasions. Linked well with everyone, came in and regularly swapped positions on the left with Fellaini. Its clear he's not limited to the right hand side, i've noticed this for a while now. Overall he did well. 7/10.

5309~~~
Had a perfect 75% of the game.  We lost our shape once Falcao went off, and Mata lost his influence.

He should definitely shoot more.  I counted at least three occasions when a shot was on and the entire stadium went "Shooooot!" (love it when Old Trafford does that!) but he chose to switch play instead.

Some of the through balls to Falcao were delicious.

5310~~~
I agree, its a stark contrast reading this thread compared to that of Young or Fellaini in terms of the attitude towards the players.

5311~~~
Thought he had a really good game today, was great in possession and his combination play with Herrera was great. He obviously doesn't play like a conventional winger at all, and today, he spent a lot of time in the center of the pitch (which is good).

5312~~~
It's weird tbh. He's such a clinical striker of the ball but virtually never shoots from outside the box. Dunno if it's the 'philosophy' or what, but he's the kind of guy you would accept taking a few potshots.

5313~~~
Mata is actually a better player than either Fellaini or Young though, so there's a natural tendency to read into their performances with that in mind.

5314~~~
Yep. I've lost count the amount of times i've shouted at the TV in recent months because of this. He takes a brilliant free kick so i can't understand why he's so reluctant.

5315~~~
His form has dropped of since the salvo a few weeks back. Same for the team. I didn't think he was up to much today. Most of the joy came against Bellerin on the other side. He had a chance that I can't quite recall but I do remember shouting for him to shoot instead of passing.

5316~~~
I understand why he is played on the right and I am a fan of it (most of the time) but you can't help and get excited when he moves inside, he just looks so much more dangerous.

Would love to see him off the striker next season, especially in Europe.

5317~~~
Happened 3 times I think. It's ridiculous how easily he creates a yard of space for a cross or a shot but then prefers to pass it infield and move rather than go for the decisive ball/finish. He creates that space for a cross with half the effort it takes Young but he just doesn't seem to want to go for the jugular.

5318~~~
What is up with his crossing ? The ball is always too floaty and therefore easier to defend.

5319~~~
He is very good at keeping the ball but just not creative enough. He has been playing well but lacking the jazz which we expect from one of the premier playmakers in the league.

5320~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5321~~~
Seems to be cutting a lot more inside when Rooney is not playing and I think he's more suited to the role he played yesterday.

5322~~~
Just watch what he did on Herrera's goal.  It is his run that creates the space for Herrera.  He starts wide and drags the arsenal player across the goal.  The cross comes and all the Arsenal players are now focused on Fellaini and that now empty space Mata created is where Herrera ghost to.  But this is a perfect example of how Young and Herrera get the stats, and everyone fawns over Fellaini occupying Arsenal's focus, but just as important is what Mata did without any attention or notice. 

Honestly so much of what this guy does can not be quantified.

5323~~~
keep him unless some club offers crazy money.

5324~~~
I'm not a fan of bow ties but he makes it work. Have not celebrated a goal like that for a while.

Did you see his acceptance speech? He looked tiny on the stage, delightfully scuttling around as the presenter told him where to stand. He is truly the human teddy bear.

5326~~~
I felt as though he was going to drop the trophy.

5327~~~
I think everyone, including Juan, harboured that fear.

5328~~~
Is it just me or has Yorke not aged a day??

5329~~~
I never noticed before how pointy his chin is.

5330~~~
It is going to be interesting to see what happens with Mata, he was supposed to be the right sided attacker in the front 3 today but spent most of the game centrally, with Herrea spending more time out wide than him.

5331~~~
The only player in the team that can dress properly?

There are pictures in the MEN and Herrera is wearing something pretty similar. Just in different colours. Maybe it is Spanish style.

5334~~~
I have made no secret of my man love for him but I really think he had a great season. He can do a lot better but given the balance of the squad and the way we set up, I think he was very good. Hopefully see him move in to off the striker next season with Depay out wide.

Hugs.

5335~~~
Mata used to top assists charts at Chelsea and most likely in the league. Is it possible that it's so difficult to get one of our strikers clear on goal in the same way Mata gets clear on goal for many of the goals he scores for us.

I really do think we lack movement in our final third. The only movement Mata finds in the final third is Herrera most of the time. Herrera and Mata both make the kind of runs off the ball that our strikers should be making.

5336~~~
Not sure how many of them there were but I imagine he would have had a huge chunk from set pieces. Put in a decent delivery each time and there's a chance one of their big guys will put it in.

5337~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mata-Career-Stats.png" src="http://eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mata-Career-Stats.png"/>

Only Silva was ahead of him in the league for chances created. Eplindex says 69% of the goalscoring chances he creates are from open play.

His assist levels and chance created statistic is very poor since joining us and I don't think it's his fault.

5338~~~
I actually still believe he is very underrated and is usually playing out of his favoured position most of the time, he's a brilliant and talented footballer and has been one of our main players this season and has a lot more to offer, I hope he stays here and we can fit him in our system.

5339~~~
I think so too. Arguably our best outfield player.

5340~~~
Based on ability? Or you mean based on his performances this season?

5341~~~
He is one of our best players together with De Gea, Herrera, Carrick and Young based on their performances for Manchester United this season.

If we were to sign a striker I think he deserves the number 10 spot ahead of Rooney on both ability and performances. He is very underrated on this forum and I don't know why since many worse players in other leagues are thought of as world class on here.

5342~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCptE6SqLCQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Brilliant video. Actually enjoyed watching it.

5343~~~
Bit of both, I guess?

He's been one of our best outfield players this season and he's more talented than any of those who actually were better than him. So of all our supposed superstars (Rooney, RVP, Di Maria, etc) he's the one I'd have most faith in atm.

5344~~~
He's had a mixed season imo, he began quite poorly, not creating enough and not influencing our play enough, later in the season he has played a more significant role, created more, scored more, so generally I think he's been good. 

Next season I expext him to be even better, he needs pace, dynamism around him, people who make runs, when he plays around the likes of ADM, Depay, Young he will thrive and get closer to his old form, especially Depay is ideal for a player like Mata. Similar to Ronaldo, he's always making runs behind the defence, trying to be direct, to score. I wonder if he'll get back to the NT, I think that could be a good aim for Mata.

5345~~~
The amount of clear cut chances he creates in that video alone and our players miss is incredible. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5346~~~
Yes we have seen some incredible wasting of chances from some of our forwards this season, and Fellaini. TBH though I think Mata missed a hat trick of sitters vs Southampton too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5347~~~
That is why I believe he will be the first name on the team sheet once we get a top striker.

5348~~~
I think van Gaal really likes him as well. If we get a proper defensive midfielder we could go with with a 4-3-3 with 1 holding, 1 box to box and a play-maker in midfield. This will allow Mata to push even further and be in and around the box where he's the most effective, centrally. Something like a Schneiderlin type, Herrera as a box to box and Mata shall work I think. Their dynamism shall compensate for his lack of strength when defending.

5349~~~
If we believe what LVG said when Mata was dropped (that it was solely due to the balance of the team and that Mata is actually one of our best players) then you would logically assume that whatever changes we make in the summer will help Mata bed in even more.

5350~~~
I think what Mata needs most in regards to new arrivals, is a powerful midfielder, someone to partner Herrera and allow Mata to be the 10 in a 3 man midfield.

5351~~~
We'd be short on numbers in midfield if we did that. He's not really a midfield 10, he can barely defend and when games get really tight he disappears. He also can't breach the midfield line and can't create space for others. Not what you'd want in that position. He's fine where he's currently playing, just needs to play with more freedom.

5352~~~
While he is fine where he is, he is far better in a central area.

5353~~~
There were times this season when Mata has looked world class, then he'll go off the boil. He seems quite temperamental in that he needs the team to be on a similar wavelength. He's never going to be a player you build around or relied on to carry the team.

5354~~~
I think the bolded is exactly why he excels when a team is built around him. His combination with Herrera shows just how effective he can be when technically gifted player's are around him. If he's going to be played on the right side then an upgrade on Valencia will make a huge difference (also a more mobile and technically proficient striker would benefit him). If he's playing through the middle an upgrade on Fellaini technically will hugely benefit him.

I think Smalling, Mata, Herrera & Shaw are the 4 player's we should be building around (hopefully Depay will prove to be in this category to) for the next 5 years.

From that video, you can see herrera, di maria, and mata together have a great understanding in their play, and some of our best stuff came with all 3 of them together

5358~~~
Happy to keep him but we need better players in our first XI to challenge for the huge honours. But he is good to come in and out and score 10+ goals.

5359~~~
Couldn't agree more.

Rooney these days. <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

Any other striker I would expect to take it into his stride and score. Many are saying we don't create enough chances but passes like those are clear cut chances for most strikers when it was such an easy pass to control.

5362~~~
He and Di Maria are our two best outfield players, and thus we should build around them.

fsw please bid 80m for mata.  it's all yours

5364~~~
Thought he was linked with them and almost got a heart attack!!

His quotes on DDG don't sound promising though ...

5365~~~
He's a Moyes/Nani level player who can produce moments of magic every 20 games. I'd be very happy if someone bid 20 Million for him. I think he is an incredibly gifted footbaler but unfortunately he is not Man Utd level and I fully expect him to be sold this summer

5366~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>...are you joking?

5367~~~
I disagree, I think van Gaal is planning to use Mata next season. LvG came to an English club who played totally different football to what he wants and Mata, Carrick and Blind were the only players who really suited his style of football from the start. He's said Mata was his best performer but that he had to leave him out for the balance of the team, Mata isn't very physical and we don't have alot of defensive options in the squad. We're buying a defensive CM, why not buy one so he could play Mata in midfield again? That would kill 2 birds with one stone and Mata is also a good option out wide.

Mata is a perfect van Gaal player in possesion, he also does defensive work but he isn't tall, strong or quick. If he can compensate for that in the team he's got a player who can perform his instructions perfectly, therefore I can't see Mata leaving.

5368~~~
What on earth is a Moyes/Nani level player?

Mata is one of the most effective footballers to ever play in the Premier League. That's a fact. It refutes the idea that he produces in one in every twenty games. It's more like one every two, or at most three.

Why you would be happy to sell him for the same price at which Liverpool splurged on Lazar Markovic is beyond me. He won't be sold this summer either.

5369~~~
That is a very strange opinion/post.

5370~~~
A cleverley/Anderson/Osman level player...I love Mata but he is not Utd quality

5371~~~
So strange that Mourinho was over the moon to get rid of him

5372~~~
I respect your opinion but there was a time when Cleverley was considered world class on here. It was the red tinted glasses on...Mata is great but he is not a Utd level player..end of story..I reckon he will be sold this summer to Valencia

5373~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What!?

Those players aren't fit to lace Mata's boots. He's more than good enough to play for you. If LvG actually plays him in his natural position he'd perform better.

5374~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5375~~~
Obvious WUM <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5376~~~
So if Mourinho doesn't rate him he must be crap? What happened to the idea that no one manager has perfect judgement?

Given that a lot of the AMs he kept over Mata are pretty ordinary in an attacking sense (the most important part of an AMs game) then maybe we shouldn't take his opinion as fact?

Also pretty amazing that Mata managed to better than so many of our players before he ever came to United, given that he isn't United quality. Hell, even here he has still be one of our best attacking players. What an overachiever.

5377~~~
FFS, actually thought you were being serious. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5378~~~
He reminds me of Wes Hoolahan.....brilliant ball skill but shite player

5379~~~
The game is up, Ringo.

5380~~~
His lack of pace out wide and strength to play centrally makes him a difficult one to fit in, unless LvG decides to beast up the midfield base and play more of a 4-2-3-1, but I quite liked the 4-3-3 and Rooney and Mata as our two main attackers doesn't fill me with confidence.

5381~~~
I agree...he is a wonderful Spurs level player..no more than that

5382~~~

5384~~~
Ringo is on a massive wum.

5385~~~
No idea why Ringo's still trying, we know you're a WUM mate.

5386~~~
This is precisely why we sold him. No pace to be super effective on the wing, won't track back and help the fullback, and is too lightweight in José's eyes to sit in front of a midfield two.

If he played as the #10 with a fully fit Carrick and a new, beast of a DM behind him to shield the back four I think he'd be one of your best players.

5387~~~
The problem then becomes that we'd have him and Di Maria in the team not contributing much when we don't have the ball, I think it's tricky to carry two players like that, especially with an aging CM like Carrick in the mix.

5388~~~
Unfortunately I'm pretty sure Ringo isn't wumming at all.

5389~~~
He says he's from Craggy Island, so is he Father Dougal in disguise?

5390~~~
I was wondering how on earth he got promoted and then I noticed he joined in 2004.

5391~~~
Part of the problem is that you have to play 2 very defensive players behind him for him to be that.
We could play one of carrick or some other DM with hererra and ... say rooney as the 10 and it'd be similarly solid defensively but your getting rooney and hererras attacking contribution instead of just mata's

He'll have his place in the squad next season and I think he'd probably be ok in a midfield with hererra and schneiderlin for instance, think he's underrated on the wing too.
But i dont see van gaal (or many other managers) putting 2 very defensive, safe players in midfield to fit mata in week in week out, 
not with the alternative options that united and chelsea have anyway.

5392~~~
In your last few posts, you've called Mata "great" and "incredibly gifted footballer" and then finished saying "but he's not United quality". 

What level do you think we are at?

5393~~~
Isn't it typical Mourinho set-up?

5394~~~
Haven't you heard we are close to signing Ramos, Ronaldo, Neymar, Modric, Isco and Koke so we have no room for 2nd rate players like Mata who couldn't hold a candle next to our awesome starting 11.

5395~~~
<a class="username" data-user="12458, @Ringo 07" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/12458/">@Ringo 07</a> is obviously exaggerating, but I wouldnt be surprised if he were sold either - <i>if</i> a good offer came in. I dont feel that LVG trusts Mata as a #10/advanced midfielder due to his lack of defensive contribution, and I dont think he is particularly productive playing out wide. With the introduction of Depay, I find it hard to see where exactly Mata fits in to the starting XI.

I would sooner see Depay, Di Maria, Nani or Young as a winger.

5396~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm sorry but that's absolute rubbish. WUM surely?

5397~~~
Hes good competition for di maria and vice versa imo (and depay by extension).
Young is a different player, hes very functional and (after last season) pretty dependable, its harder to see him prising apart a 10 man defence with a moment of brilliance though.
Hasn't Nani been sold to fenerbache or is that bullshit?

I think he might get more opportunities at #10 in the champions league next season anyway

5398~~~
Moyes/Cleverley/Anderson/Osman/Mata. Spot the odd one out. 

feck me, this place is mental at times.

5399~~~
You forgot Wes Hoolahan.

5400~~~
Ah yes, the great Wes Hoolahan <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5401~~~
He's an incredible player. People talk about how Di Maria is wasteful in possession because he's creative and takes risks. Well, Mata has managed to produce even more end product over his career, whilst at the same time maintaining 90% passing. I'd love to see him given more playmaking responsibility. Even when he's off-form, he's capable of keeping the team's passing going. With Carrick and Rooney's future roles in the team uncertain, I want to see Mata as the man that everyone in the team looks for.

5402~~~
We will have to wait and see I guess - personally I am not convinced that LVG will want to deploy an out-and-out #10. This season we saw the likes of Fellaini and Herera being used as advanced midfielders who could join the attack but still got back and offered a defensive presence. For me, that provided us with excellent balance and is a system we should stick with, and I dont see Mata in that sort of a role.

5403~~~
Whatever about the "debate" going on above I do feel Mata will start to get less games for LVG. I mean he is in direct competition with Di Maria. Think we all expect Di Maria to start holding the right side of midfield to himself. 

Mata is a huge fan favourite and rightly so, he's a fantastic footballer and model professional and speaks very fondly of the club and its fans.

5404~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
0/10 Must try harder

5405~~~
He's technically superb, reads the game well, scores and assists goals consistently. Yet he's still not got 'it', in my opinion. We surely all know his limitations. 

He'd be a sub at every one of last season's Champions League semi-finalists, and if we get to near that level, ultimately he'll be relegated to a sub role here as well. Not a bad sub to have, though.

5406~~~
The problem with that logic (ie. comparing him to players at CL semi-finalists) is that we bought a player who was a star performer for a CL winner (Di Maria,) and yet by the end of the season, he couldn't get a sniff of a starting spot on a team that barely qualified for the CL. For all we know, Mata would really flourish at Bayern or Real. I do hope to see him step it up a level next season, though.

5407~~~
That's fair enough. It was just an example. In my opinion, he wouldn't last long as a first-teamer for a title-winning side that can also do the business in Europe, i.e. a really top side. There will always be more suitable options.

Many will disagree, because he scores goals and has great technique. but, for me, it's the bits in between where he's lacking. However, next season's team may well be the most settled, balanced team he's played in since coming to England (if we get the transfers spot on) so maybe he'll surprise me and really show it next season.

5408~~~
I agree. With the inevitable injuries (from which he rarely seems to suffer - hope I didn't jinx him!), he'll likely play a lot, even if he's not a pencilled-in starter.

5409~~~
Completely agree, the guy is a good footballer but I think consistency wise he isn't good enough. He vanishes for large portions of matches and pops up with a goal to cover over the fact he's played poorly. 

Di Maria will start to take over from him more next season, so your original post above will in time ring true I'm sure.

5410~~~
The idea of Di Maria taking over from him is dependent on Di Maria actually playing better than him though, which wasn't the case this season.

Maybe Mata will get marginalised or maybe he'll increase in importance in a more balanced team. Either way though, there's no chance of us selling him given he's currently one of our best players.

5411~~~
Mourinho got rid due to Mata's defensive contribution which Mourinho didn't feel was good enough. Considering the way Chelsea play under Mourinho, and the type of player they used instead of Mata (Willian, Oscar, Schurrle), Mourinho was right to get rid.

As an attacking midfielder, Mata is world class. To compare him to Wes Hoolahan, I mean FFS.

5412~~~
It really never works like that. If we bought Rakitic and Jérémy Mathieu last year, you'd be hearing the same nonsense "yes they're good but are they a Puyol or Xavi?". I don't know why there tends to be talk about players quality totally independent of the circumstances around them ie: league, formation, position, style, ... and so on. Outside of players who have those "obvious talents" like a Messi or Suarez, it is more and more difficult to tell just what would work and how it would in each system and style. Mata might turn out to be our best player next season just as he might turn out a disappointment.

5413~~~
Hoolahan <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Is <a class="username" data-user="12458, @Ringo 07" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/12458/">@Ringo 07</a>, by any chance, Irish?

5414~~~
Mata also appears to be van Gaal's ideal #10. As well as being able to maintain possession through short, crisp passing triangles, he has the vision to spot players in the final third (I wish he could demonstrate this more) as well as having the ability to score goals. van Gaal wants his #10's to be goalscorers, and Mata is one who can easily get 10+ goals per season if he plays regularly as a #10 under van Gaal.

Mata's lack of physicality is a huge issue in the middle, however, and this is a big reason why van Gaal plays Mata out wide. The "false winger" role is the role that brings the best out of Mata as well. If he plays in the middle, he can be easily outmuscled off the ball, and this was demonstrated against Swansea at home. Out wide, he doesn't have to deal with the constant pressure, but he's no winger, so unless we have a right wing back with a great attacking threat, Mata won't be as influential out wide.

It's not easy to put Mata into the current side at the moment. If he's in the middle, he'll struggle to maintain possession/make himself available for the ball. If he plays out wide, he'll need an attacking right back to provide the width down that side as well as a right-sided defensive midfielder to cover the right side (van Gaal hinted at getting such a player during May).

5415~~~
Come on now, Wes Hoolahan's not shite. Meyler, Quinn, McClean, Sammy Ameobi, Vardy, and Andy King are shite, but not Hoolahan.

5416~~~
Think LVG will play him as a 10 behind Rooney next season, once we get a Schneirderlin type behind him.

------------------Valdes----------------
Ramos---Smalling---Otamendi---Shaw
------Herrera------Schneiderlin--
---------------Mata----------------
Di Maria--------Rooney-----------Depay

Would be my guess of how we might line up.

5417~~~
I fully agree with everything you wrote. Mata has the goals, passing, assists and vision van Gaal wants from a 10, but needs compensation for his physicality. We don't have the right midfielders at the club to play Mata there, Rooney and Fellaini are our only muscles in midfield and don't work together well with him. Mata is also a good option out wide to have since van Gaal likes multifunctionality, but he still has his limitations there. I just think that because Mata is already at the club and does these important things so well van Gaal could kill 2 birds with one stone because we're already looking to strenghten rightback and cm. The 10 is very important for van Gaal's style of play and I think Mata could be ideal for him in the correct setup. I think a midfield of Schneiderlin-Mata-Herrera with the point forward could work for example.

How big his role will be or his position I'm not sure, but he's a great player to have at the club and I can't see him leaving yet. We're already looking to strenghten so many positions Mata does not need replacing imo.

5418~~~
Depay has just come in and we have not even seen how he finds in a new country/league/team. Young is downright average. He had a few good moments last season but Mata still had better stats and looked good most of the time. Nani is going to be sold and the jury is still out on whether Di Maria will be able to step it up at United. With those being our other options, why would anyone want a player like Mata sold? Would you sell Rooney because he has been far worse than Mata last season?

Not to mention, LVG categorically said Mata is one of his best players.

5419~~~
I agree as well. There's no point in van Gaal moving Mata on as he'll be looking to strengthen the RB position and add depth to the CM roles. However, that midfield 3 is seriously lacking in a midfielder with a good passing range. Herrera can improve his passing range, and I hope he does, but assuming he doesn't, then that midfield won't be strong unless Herrera is given more license to go forward, but I doubt Schneiderlin can do the defensive work all by himself.

5420~~~
Mata is better at #10. He has done enough to deserve a chance to play there. He did fairly well on the right, when he was paired with a full back who could not create a chance to save his life and he was not an option a lot of times. If Mata was with a Rafael sort of a full back, that combination would have been a lot more lethal.
His presence behind a front three as the #10 in a midfield three is a bit risky, but if we have solid two man midfield, we have to try that. Rooney can be a good #9 if he is played with two natural wide players and in front of Mata.

Depay------Rooney-----Di Maria
-------------Mata---------------
------herrera---schneiderlin-----
Shaw----Smalling---Ramos----RB(who has attacking abilities at par with Rafael)
-----------valdes-----------------

Is the most balanced team we could have.
As Carrick is aging, we should buy two CMs, Schneiderlin and Schein/Gungogan.
Blind can be assigned the role of the second LB and 5 CM. Next season he can be the fourth CM when carrick leaves.

5421~~~
I think hes a system player, or one of those players that play well when the team is firing on all cylinders and keeping possession. He's also a player that needs a lot of movement around him to fully express himself. Having said that, if our run of 6 win mid season reflects the way LVG wants us to play, then im sure with the right signings improving our team this summer, Juan will have a much better season.

Hugs.

5422~~~
Anyone wanting/expecting Mata to be sold this Summer is going to be left disappointed.

5423~~~
To be fair, Mathieu and Rakitic are examples of what I'm talking about.
Mathieu isn't a first team starter, and the interest in Pogba suggests that Rakitic will soon be replaced in the first team (I can't think of who else would be displaced). I'll be surprised if Rakitic is in their best XI two seasons from now, as well as he's done.

I've already said that next season's team is potentially the most balanced and settled team Mata will have played in, so maybe he'll really show it next season. I'm not ruling Mata out, but I'm not even convinced he's in the United best XI right now, let alone if/when more quality is added.

Personally, I'd have Herrera ahead of him in the AM role with, for example, Gundogan (would have loved Strootman too) and Schneiderlin behind him. Whereas obviously many would rather Mata as the AM, and Herrera + 1 behind him.
I don't want him sold though. At worst, he's a brilliant replacement/impact sub. to have.

5424~~~
Same.

5425~~~
I honestly don't understand why anybody in their right mind would want Mata sold.

5426~~~
Arguably our most important player. Love the little maestro.

5427~~~
I do not think the club can go into the season without a DDG replacement, that backline would be a time bomb with or without ramos waiting to go off, Valdes is nothing but a backup keeper. So while people say get a RB, we lose DDG he must be replaced. Plus herrera can easily do mata's role would rather see him further forward, so I think 2 CM players, a RB, a GK if DDG is gone must be the priority.

5428~~~
Is he feck.

Nowhere near as important to us as DDG or Carrick.

5429~~~
<b>
</b>
Then we have problems as one is going and the other isn't far off being too old.

5430~~~
I havent said I "wanted him sold", and yes, I would sell Rooney as well because I dont think he is of the calibre to be a #1 striker at an elite club any more, but that is for a different thread.

As I said, I think our best football this season came when we played 4-3-3 with a backward facing triangle (ie a DM and 2 CMs). Herrera and Fellaini worked very well as the CMs in that system, with license to get forwards frequently and join the attack, whilst Carrick did his thing behind them. I cant see Mata fitting into a central position unless we significantly change our system therefore.
Out wide, I just dont rate him as a wide player that highly. In the system described above, in my opinion you want a pair of inside-forward style wingers. The likes of Robben, Bale, Ronaldo, Depay and Nani. Especially if we are using a forward like Rooney who has a tendency to drop a little deeper anyway, you want the wide men to be direct players who can pick up the ball and run with it outside or inside, and that is clearly not Mata's game.

There has been talk from some (including <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a>) that we will likely be playing more of a 4-2-3-1 next season, as LVGs preferred system is using a forward facing triangle in midfield. I am not convinced that that will suit us better than what we did this season. I dont think Herrera's best role is as a deep lying midfielder (which he would be in the proposed system), and I also think that going into next season with potential changes to an already inexperienced back 5, we need to have a figure like Carrick who can screen the defence - which you do not typically get in the proposed system.

I realise that LVG has previously used that version of a 4-3-3, but he has also stated that he is not so stubborn that he is above changing and adapting it when required - we saw that with the 3-5-2 (although it didnt work out).


So, my stance is unchanged. Mata is a good footballer and one of the most likeable players in the game. For these reasons it is understandable that he is a fan favourite, however he is not indispensable to the club. And if (and yes, it is an if) Di Maria gets back to form and/or Nani/Young remain and play well, then I dont see a place for Mata in the starting XI. I agree with <a class="username" data-user="28685, @Cina" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28685/">@Cina</a> that there are plenty of players in the team who are more important than Mata.

5431~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a>, pretty much agree with all you've said there.

5432~~~
<a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> I agree with all you said about Mata, I myself think that he might be one of the players surprisingly sold mainly due his lack of physicality, I can see LVG make the same assessment than Mourinho and opt for a player who is maybe slightly less technical but a lot better physically, and that's where I disagree with you, this player might be Herrera, you counted him as a potential deep lying midfielder but in my opinion he is ideal at the tip of the triangle his only problem with Athletic was his lack of goals and he showed this season that he was a decent contributor in that department.

5433~~~
Agreed with this too.
Schneiderlin, Strootman, Herrera would have been my aim for this summer. But with Strootman's injuries, I'd be happy with a midfield like:

Schneiderlin<span style="color: #ffffff"> --- </span>Gundogan
<span style="color: #ffffff">----------</span>Herrera<span style="color: #ffffff">--------</span>
<span style="color: #000000">
I didn't see much of Herrera at Bilbao, but he looked so bright in that AM role. He can turn and drive towards goal so well. He plays passes that most others don't dare to try. He can shield the ball and ride a challenge. He can pick those final passes. He can add pace to attacks really well. 
And then defend from the front. 

Despite being less precise, I think he trumps Mata in everyone of these departments bar playing the final pass (and I think there's very little in this too - In fact, I'd actually argue that Herrera can spot passes that Mata can't, though many will disagree).</span>

5434~~~
I would certainly prefer Herrera in that "tip of the triangle" position rather than playing deeper. My ideal setup though is basically what we had this season - a backward facing triangle with Carrick screening the defence, and then Herrera and Fellaini in front of him, both of whom were free to get forward and attack, but also contributed defensively. You can potentially upgrade any of these players sure, however that system looked really promising I felt.

5435~~~
You are right, but in reality both systems work together Barcelona for example, switch from one to the other within the same game. That's why I think Fellaini isn't the right player for it, we need a more specialized box to box, and Herrera will be free to play both roles depending on the situational needs.

Edit: And to be on topic, I don't see Mata giving us that flexibility.

5436~~~
Well, we can agree on the Mata part at least then <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5437~~~
If Di Maria regains his form, he can take Mata's place on the wings with Mata moving centrally as the #10. He is miles better than Rooney there. Also, with so many changes required to our set up, I don't see a point in letting go of one of our better attacking threats. No one is indispensable and surely Carrick and DDG are more important to us, but as one of our attacking outfielders, he is most important of the lot.

5438~~~
The thing about this is:
To be the man that everyone looks for, your shielding has to be brilliant. You also have to be able to hold the ball under pressure and ride multiple challenges, and generally withstand bullying and man-marking. You need to be comfortable receiving the ball everywhere.

Mata has yet to show he can do this, in my opinion. Having tidy technique and a good brain isn't enough when the team is built around you as a midfielder or number 10.

5439~~~
What makes you think that LVG will want to use Mata as a #10, or that we will use a #10 at all? We didnt use a #10 this season during our best periods of form, and if we do, then I would prefer it to be Herrera. <i>None</i> of our attackers are particularly important or indispensable at the moment, including Mata.

5440~~~
Who has LVG used as a #10 before? Comparing them to Mata would seem like the obvious way of judging how capable Mata is of functioning in that role the way LVG would want. The only one I can remember is Litmanen?

He certainly suits in terms of his attacking output but maybe not in other ways...

5441~~~
He's very difficult to dispossess because he's so beautifully balanced.. His lack of heft only affects the defensive, pressing side of his game, imo.

5442~~~
I wouldn't say that's why he's difficult to dispossess. I'd say it's as much down to the fact he usually distances himself from challengers (often dropping very deep, or just releasing the ball before he can be closed down). And I think this is a negative.
The team's default pass option should be a player who's comfortable holding the ball under pressure, receiving the ball with men on his shoulder, and riding challenges.

Being difficult to dispossess is only a special special trait when you're doing it in pressured areas of the pitch. That's not the case for Mata, so the praise can only go so far, in my opinion.

if you're playing a passing game, and the majority of the passing is sideways and in front of two lines of four, your go-to passing option needs to be the guy who can hold the ball that bit longer, shield the ball, and turn when the challenges come in.
If he can't do that, then the team is just forced to pass in front of the lines of four even more.

5443~~~
Funnily enough, you could argue the exact opposite and probably make a better case.

5444~~~
That he's our least important? Surely Jonny Evans takes that prize.

5445~~~
That he's a player who we've found it difficult to accommodate in our starting XI (we did towards the end of the season with Herrera + Mata linking up beautifully). He can play wide, and did at Valencia, but his best form came when he played through the middle with Chelsea. We can't accommodate him there.

If Di Maria hadn't had such a horrible second half to the season, I think Mata would have been the first casualty on the team sheet.

5446~~~
He definitely isn't our most important player atm, not sure how you could make that argument really.

The real question is whether he will be more or less important next season as you could probably make a decent argument in both directions.

I'm leaning towards the idea of him having a more important role, on the basis that a) LVG has recognized that Mata is one of his best players, b) he pointed to a lack of balance as the reason for leaving Mata out of the team and c) we're likely to see that balance restored over the course of the window.

It's hard to see how Mata wouldn't be more effective with a secure midfield behind him or, if we're playing him as a false winger, with a better RB.

Maybe not though. Maybe he will continue to drift in and out of the team in different positions. I'm very sure he won't be sold though, that would be a backwards step given our lack of quality in attack.

5447~~~
I know that LvG prefers 'inverted wingers', but I think Mata could work well ahead of Shaw dominating the left flank. It's not like Mata is a particularly orthodox wide man on the right anyway. Whether he drifts inside from the right or the left, it all works out the same. Plus, he's technically good enough for it not to matter too much.

5448~~~
With all this transfer news, what does the future hold for Mata? I still rate him and believe he can be the best in the PL when on form.

5449~~~
The best what? Generally curious.

5450~~~
Player.

5451~~~
No sorry this is completely wrong. The second bit I have bolded is related to the 1st. Your default pass should be to players who are able to create space for themselves and receive in space. This means they are have created time to have a look to assess options before passing <b>but more importantly have time to receive the ball with a positive touch</b>, which simply means they can receive  in a manner which means they can then play forward. Receiving the ball under pressure means players are receiving the ball and shielding the ball from defenders which in turn often means receiving the ball without the option of playing forward on the first touch.

5452~~~
There wont always be space. Barcelona didn't always have Space when they pinned teams back. Heck, Arsenal and City don't always have space when pinning teams back. That's part of being a possession team. You create space for yourselves by being comfortable under pressure. Epecially as a number 10. That very position is surrounded by defensive midfielders and centre backs. The best of them can play without acres of space.

Deep-lying playmakers are completely different, however. Their skillset and requirements are different.

The bit in bold applies to a player like Mata. Hence he's often on the fringes of a game.

It doesn't apply to Iniesta, or Silva, or Isco, or even Coutinho. They often receive the ball under pressure and can turn their man, or move forward with it, or at least hold it and shield it. That makes them a great 'go-to' pass options. They sometimes drop into loads of space, but they don't rely on it.

You're backing up my point, because the best number 10s (or players in that pocket) do exactly that - they receive the ball in those congested areas consistently. There are probably more players I could add to the list.
The best players/number 10s are those who can be trusted to move the ball in and into dangerous areas. It's much easier to drop extremely deep and find loads of space to turn into it.

If Mata's always dropping deep or into more non-dangerous areas, then having him as the go-to pass just means we'll struggle to carve teams open.
if you pass to Mata, and he's got a man tight on his shoulder, he's basically restricted to pass the way he's facing. That doesn't apply for the best number 10s. That's why he's not the best go-to pass.

You want to pass to the go-to player on your terms, not his. Not only when he feels okay receiving it.

5453~~~
I think this could have been a possibility too. If Di Maria had done a job on the right and continued creating chances at the same rate as he did between September and December, Mata wouldn't have got a look in.

I still love Mata though, and hope he stays. I reckon he still has a big role to play here.

5454~~~
What transfer news ?

5455~~~
I'm fully expecting Mata to play less next season, LVG will have a chat with Di Maria on his return and make sure he is in the right frame of mind for playing again, which I'm sure he will be. 

Once he finds his form he'll make that RW spot his own. Unless LVG has plans to play Mata more centrally which I doubt, I really can't see Mata being anything other than a squad player / impact sub. 

Which is fine with me, he has proven himself to be a very useful impact sub on quite a few occasions.

5456~~~
Sorry we will have to agree to disagree. The beautiful thing about Iniesta, Coutinho etc is that they are able to receive with a positive touch, they have always created enough space for themselves to be able to receive going forward.  The pressure for the majority of time comes after they have received the ball.  The so called number 10's operate in the space between the lines, the reason they do this is so they can receive in a manner which means their first touch is forward. Watch closer you will see they are always positioned on the half turn so their default option is to go forward. You cant do this when you have a defender on your shoulder. 
If a player is having to shield the ball as he receives it on his first touch his most likely next pass is back or sideways.
Being comfortable under pressure is different to your claim that <b>your go-to passing option needs to be the guy who can hold the ball that bit longer, shield the ball, and turn when the challenges come in.  </b>You are confusing the attributes of a striker with a #10. You dont want a #10 having to operate with his back to goal when he is having to shield the ball from a defender.  Mata is very good at making space for himself, thats a good thing.

5457~~~
As you say, we'll have to agree to disagree.
In Mata's case, I feel he makes space for himself. But rarely in the right area. Often too deep or too high. Rarely in the pocket where it's crowded (and it's almost always crowded in a 60+% possession team).
I agree about being in the pocket on the half turn, but it's not ALWAYS possible, and the ability to shield the ball and hold it under pressure is an asset. One that mata doesn't have.

5458~~~
The thing with this is, though, is if an attacking midfielder does shield the ball, it's almost impossible for them to be positive on the ball. Take Hazard, for example. Every time there's someone right on his shoulder/holding him, he has to go back. The same goes for someone like Ozil who, when under pressure, will turn back to relieve the pressure. This is the same for the likes of Coutinho, Silva, Iniesta, etc. The only sort of players who can play the ball positively under pressure are target men or physical yet skilled forwards like Ibrahimovic or Diego Costa.

What Mata does is good as an attacking midfielder, and I do agree with what <a class="username" data-user="22707, @Stack" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/22707/">@Stack</a> says in that he does a great job at finding space for himself in order to do something positively. However, I also agree with you, Speak, with regards to Mata being weak under pressure. Whenever Mata gets physically challenged, more often than not, he does lose the ball. Having said that, Mata has demonstrated many times that he is very good in working the ball in tight spaces and congested areas. The number of times he's received the ball and turned the opposing marker away is something I cannot count in my hand.

I do feel that Mata will thrive under van Gaal for us. Mata is van Gaal's ideal #10, and I feel that van Gaal will do all he can to bring the best out of Mata as he did for Muller and Litmanen.

This picture is pretty much all that matters now.

5460~~~
I had another think about what you are saying and i think I have misinterpreted some of what you are saying and that in fact  we are talking about the same thing but using different ways of expressing it which is why i have got your comments arse about face.

Cheers

5461~~~
News of us interested in two midfielders and retaining Di Maria. You'd have to think it will be difficult for Juan to hold a place. Many will disagree with me on this but I believe Juan Mata to be better than Di Maria as a player in overall quality.

5462~~~
Mata, the best player in the league?

5463~~~
Yeah. I think when he's on form he's the best player in the league.

5464~~~
Fair enough mate, I'm not sure I'd even place him in the top 10 personally.

5465~~~
Even during the 12-13 season you didn't think he was in the top 10 ?

5466~~~
I've heard the same been said about Nani etc...I've heard many times that Rafael is the best right back in the league. Mata reminds me a lot like Kagawa...a little Genius on his day but doesn't do the business often enough to be guaranteed a place in a top 4 PL team.....to call him best player in PL is just silly really....maybe the player with the best vision but if that was a bar to measure the best player in the league then Real Madrid would be making Remy Cabela their priority signing this summer......but yes Juan is a special talent but maybe not as good as his hype on redcafe

5467~~~
Yeah I guess in that season he'd have made the top 10, but that was before Hazard, Sanchez, Fabregas and Matic all came into the league.

5468~~~
I don't think he's far from all those players. I put them all and Mata in the same league.

5469~~~
Well he <b>was </b>the main player for a top 4 PL team (chelsea) so I don't see how it is silly opinion. When on form I really think he can be the best player in the PL. This isn't some absurd opinion as many experts have previously said he's the best in the premier league (and this was when we had Gareth Bale still playing).

Mata is way ahead of the likes of Kagawa or Nani.

5470~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This is fantastic

5471~~~
Hazard played for Chelsea that season didn't he?

5472~~~
I don't even think he's good enough to start every game for a team that wants to win the League and challenge for the CL.

5473~~~
No, he signed the summer after.

5474~~~
So you're saying he signed in 2013? That would mean that last season was only his second with Chelsea. I don't think that's true.

5475~~~
You recently claimed he was on the level of Cleverley and Osman, so it's hard to take your post seriously.

5476~~~
Just too perfect. Hugs.

5477~~~
both Hazard and Mata were in the PFA Team for 2012-13 season while at Chelsea

5478~~~
I don't know, I'm not even sure we'll sign 2 CMs.

5479~~~
Well, apart from the fact that he started every game for a team that won the CL...

5480~~~
This.

He is the type of player you need to do well in Europe.

5481~~~
This is obviously a subliminal message directed to De Gea that whenever he tries to leave for Madrid, his dear amigo will not hesitate for one sec to pick him up in his little spaceship. Si, Agent Mata at work.

5482~~~
Yet he's already won the CL. Infact, he's one of only a few players in our squad that actually has.

5483~~~
That was hardly a proper CL winning team was it? It was a one off fluke that won't happen often.

5484~~~
Greece did an even worse version in 2004 - there's more then one way to skin a cat.

A massive element of fortune/luck sure, but you make your own luck and all that garbage.

5485~~~
Right so we should have Juan Mata as a starter because we would then have a team within the possibility to fluke a CL win? The fact is he is a good player who deserves an important role in our squad but we should have better in our strongest XI. Jose realised that.

5486~~~
I'm gonna have to go out to try and find me a hat like that now!

5487~~~
No, but to claim he's not good enough to start for a team with CL ambitions is a bit harsh, when he's actually won the competition. Direct evidence suggests he is in fact, good enough to start for a team that can win the CL - and he was one of the better, if not the best player in that side... imagine if he was surrounded by better players/a better manager?!  It's not like he looked out of place in any of Chelsea's CL games.

Also, Jose isn't always right.

5488~~~
Bizarre opinion. He's one of our best player's and would be a consistent starter in almost every team in the world. Just because Mourinho prefers hard workers over quality is an indictment on his managerial style, rather than Mata's ability. That coupled with his need to raise funds to strengthen otherweaker areas of the squad.

He should be one of the 4-5 players who will build a team around.

5489~~~
The best #10 in the squad, and by a distance. If rumours about Bastian and Schneiderlein are true, pick two from them and Carrick/Herrera and play them behind Mata.

Mata is glorious.

5490~~~
Quite, also José didn't sell him because he wasn't good enough, merely not suited to the style he wanted to implement

5491~~~
He's a wonderful talent, you'd have to be a complete idiot to deny that, but  for whatever reason we haven't consistently seen the best of him. I'd like him to start putting in performances like the one vs Liverpool more regularly. He's capable of doing so.

5492~~~
Mata has won the Europa League, The European Cup, The European Championships and The World Cup... he must be doing something right.

5493~~~
Although I agree that we haven't consistently seen the best of him since he's been here, could you say we've consistently seen the best of <i>anyone </i>in the past 2 seasons, apart from De Gea really?

5494~~~
Fair point, but with Mata being up there with one of our best players, I think we're right to expect more from him. That game at Anfield, he took the game by the scruff of the neck and dominated it in the process. It was a complete performance that he's capable of repeating more often than he has.

5495~~~
He barely starts for Spain and has very little influence. He was vital for Chelsea tho.

5496~~~
All I'm saying is if you look at our team in 2008, Bayern in 2013 and the other Barcelona teams to have been the best in Europe...Mata wouldn't get into any of them. He has never done much for Spain. He is not a good enough player to be Man United's best but at the moment he is our best player.

5497~~~
Oh I'm not saying he won it single-handidly or anything - but still, you've got to be a pretty good footballer to get into both of those Spain squads... or an average to shit striker.

5498~~~
If Mourinho sold Mata because he wasn't good enough for a CL winning side (despite him actually having been one of the best players in a CL winning side) then does that mean he thought someone like Willian was a better player than Mata? If so, he's an idiot.

In reality it was Mata's style that Mourinho had a problem with, not his actual quality. So, given the level of criticism Mou's style tends to get on here anyway, maybe that says more about him than it does about Mata?

5499~~~
Just as i thought

5500~~~
so just to be clear: willian and oscar are better players than mata. Is that what you are saying?

5501~~~
My mistake. I think Hazard has improved a lot in the last 3 seasons though.

5502~~~
To be honest, I'm a huge Mata fan, but I think he's a bracket below Hazard (certainly no shame in that.) I still think he has the potential to be a top-10 player in this league (for the simple fact that he once was when with Chelsea.)

5503~~~
Do you think he can do it playing in the false winger role?

5504~~~
As a #10 it's between him and Silva as the best in the league. He's ridiculous when he's played there. People forget how good he is because of how we've misused him in general.

He's in a similar situation to Di Maria. Both are arguably our most talented players, but we dont play a system that plays to their strength. 

As a winger Mata is still good, but nowhere near his effectiveness as a 10.

5505~~~
Tbh Spain NEEDS someone like Mata. Are there better spanish midfielders than Mata? Yes. There are better playmakers and technical spanish wizards than him. But that's not what Spain lacks, they need goals. And none of them are better than Mata in the final third. Since David Villa's retirement you have these amazing worldclass midfielders passing around the ball because no one wants to score.

5506~~~
Well I thought he looked great there in the last part of the season. I think with a better RB playing behind him, he, Herrera and that new RB could create triangular magic!

5507~~~
Does anyone have the stats that highlighted Mata's surprisingly impressive work rate from the season just gone?

They disproved Mourinho's reason for selling Mata - the fact that he didn't work hard enough. I really like Mata.

5508~~~
To be fair, there's still a difference between having impressive work rate and actually being useful/effective defensively.
So this isn't really disproving Mourinho's reasoning.

5509~~~
Covering large areas of the pitch and having a high average miles run per match over the season is impressive. He obviously lacks defensive skills such as marking and tackling but overall I don't think he's a liability when we're defending like Jose made out.

5510~~~
That's certainly possible, although I think Di Maria will take that right wing spot next season, and of course we'd need a very good attacking RB.

5511~~~
He has been silent many times he played as a number 10 for us.Let's not rewrite history to hype up your favourite players.

5512~~~
He's been completely ineffective as a #10. Playing him out wide is one of the few things LVG has got right.

5513~~~
He was ineffective as the no.10 ?

He was like our best player when we went 352 and he was the no.10. Nearly everything was coming from him but our strikers weren't finding the net.

I'll never forget how one sided that game as whl in the first half, he was majestic but time and time again flacao and rvp couldn't find the net.

5514~~~
That was maybe like 2 matches at most... he was very criticised before the match at whl. Remember passenger?

5515~~~
I worry for him when we get a long term left footed RW.  We dont really play with a number 10. As good as the player is,  once van gaal sees a player like bale available unfortunately mata is probably one of the first person to leave. 

Atleast we will have another year or two to see him and a few more goals like the one against liverpool will keep everyone happy

5516~~~
We didn't really play with a proper #10 in the second half of the season, but looking at how much attacking freedom Fellaini got and how restricted Herrera was, it was quite apparent that he did give one midfielder more attacking freedom than the other. Also, he mentioned that he wanted a right-sided defensive midfielder in the team, hinting at a 4-2-3-1 approach for the next season (though not stubbornly sticking to this formation).

van Gaal has always seemed to favour Mata in that #10 role and has tried many different ways to accommodate him. He tried a 3-4-1-2 at the start to give him attacking freedom as the #10. He tried a 3-1-4-2 to take the load off of Mata even more with a defensive midfielder and box-to-box midfielder instead of two box-to-box midfielders. He then went with a backwards-pointing 4-3-3 and tried to accommodate Mata in the more attacking central midfield role with Fellaini playing more defensively. Finally, he put him on the right wing once he saw that Mata couldn't play effectively enough in a deeper role.

I get the feeling that van Gaal will try his hardest to accommodate Mata this summer, but if that isn't possible, then I feel that van Gaal may give up and play Herrera or Rooney ahead of him as the #10/attacking central midfielder.

5517~~~
The problem with Mata was that whenever we played him in any position; we had to make a lot of changes to accommodate him in the team. It's not like I want him to go, we as a club could definitely use him; but when the final puzzle is complete I doubt Mata will be an important piece of it.

Van Gaal said that some of the transfers out this season might surprise us fans; I still wouldn't sell Mata unless we got a like for like RW version of Depay; a true forward rather than a made up one.

5518~~~
Completely agree,

I can see him being dropped down from being first team player to squad player from next season onwards. He's very useful as an impact sub, himself and Fellaini would be great options to have sat on the bench.

5519~~~
I think with the #10 role or AM role in the midfield LvG still wants a degree of strength and physicality, which is why I think he'll play Herrera there unless he gets a top striker, in which case he may use Rooney.

5520~~~
Yes, and this can result in Mata not becoming a first-11 player anymore. This season's pretty much going to determine whether van Gaal will make Mata a starter or not.

5521~~~
The reason alot of players fall out with Van Gaal is that its normally his way or the high way. His way is set in stone. The 433 in particular has limited space for an AM when you consider the importance of a DM. Moving Mata to the RW was a wonderful move; but that is not a long term solution at all. If I remember even Herrera was asked to cover him on the right so he could cut in centrally.

I wonder if mata could become a CF though. The striker position is going to be vital not in scoring goals but to link our wide forwards together. In that aspect; Mata could be one of the best around if he became a better finisher.

5522~~~
The 4-2-3-1, however, provides the perfect platform for the #10, and van Gaal has used this setup many times throughout his managerial career, so much so that I would consider this his main formation. Having said this, Mata's too weak on the ball to handle the physical challenges from the middle, so he's not suited for a central role. Out wide, he doesn't have to face the physical challenges that would in the middle, but this requires a good attacking right back to provide the width on the right as well as a midfielder on the right side who's quite disciplined, defensively.

In terms of playing as a striker, again, he's too weak. van Gaal's strikers are supposed to handle the physical pressure from the defenders and not lose possession cheaply to them. In no way can Mata perform that role adequately.

5523~~~
I bet he already is planning movie nights with Sergio Ramos.

5524~~~

He is wonderful.

5526~~~
Considering he used to play for a club who's trying to "buy" that history, quite a political statement.

5527~~~
He is indeed.

5528~~~
Reckon he'll play here for a very long time. His general play at times though the middle was very tidy and he's capable of goals as we know. Still to reach his Chelsea form, but will be great when it happens.

Is this an old clip? I've never seen it before.



Some piece of skill!

5531~~~
Few years ago, little magician.

5532~~~
Yeah, was before the 2010 world cup I think

5533~~~
I absolutely love Mata, and he's a great spokesman - eloquent and seems passionate for the club.

5534~~~
He's a joy to behold on his day..truly world class playmaker....He is Pirlo level when he turns up...I still feel he only turned up in about 25% of games last season and he was mostly anonymous in many big games but when he turned up he controlled the game from start to finish so I hope he can turn that 25% into something much higher this season...He only turned up in about 10% of games under Moyes so Van Gaal has been a revelation for his career so I hope he can improve consistency by another 25% next season..I don't see why not

5535~~~
Still never managed to work out how there's enough room around his ankles to pull that trick off!

I feel like now is an appropriate time for my favourite footballing gif of all time, in which the laws of physics just... give up.

but closely followed by this as the second best footballing gif of all time:

Anyone got the gif where he just slides like he is moon walking looking at the camera in the background when another player was on camera? Happened early in the season from memory.

5539~~~
tried to find it but then i found this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5545~~~
If we get Morgan and Bastien on board then Mata should have no excuses when he gets his chance in the hole. With those two propping him he will have a full hunting license to concentrate on scoring and creating goals, with pace on either side of him we could be lethal in attack.

5546~~~
What role is Mata going to obtain in this 4-3-3 formation ?

5547~~~
Same as before I'd assume.

5548~~~
I imagine he'll be competing with Herrera for the AM spot, whilst also providing an option for the RW spot (as last season) if Di Maria doesn't immediately find form.

5549~~~
Mata is the best finisher we have, if we play to his strengths we'll still be contending in May.

5550~~~
So guys, we're close to signing Schweinsteiger and Shneiderlin. Should I be worried for Mata in any way? I think Blind/Herrera wont be playing as often. Herrera might be a back up for him. Something like this.

----------------------back four--------
----------Schneiderlin-----Schweinsteiger-----
---Di Maria------------Mata---------------Depay
-----------------------Rooney-------------------

What do you guys think?

5551~~~
People are forgetting just how many games we'll be playing this year... we'll need a full squad to battle on different fronts. Mata will get plenty of gametime, as will Herrera and Blind.

5552~~~
I think it was a good decision to sign these two midfielders. Also, schweinsteiger will probably get injured (as will carrick) and we will need a solid midfield for those times.

5553~~~
I think he'll be a key player in CL fixtures for us. One thing I like about him is he plays the right pass more often than not, and where someone like Depay or Herrera will most likely be more erratic, he can play a few roles himself to bring a cool head into the side.

5554~~~
I worry for Mata but mainly because of Depay and Di Maria

It's Herrera I worry for after this weekends antics in the transfer market

5555~~~
I think Mata will be able to get 30-35 starts next year, whether through form, injury, suspensions, etc., across all comps

We should be expecting to play at least 50 matches next season, hopefully closer to 60. There will be enough to go around for the big names and the young players too.

5556~~~
I prefer Herrera, but if ADM leaves he could play on the right flank for us.

5557~~~
Personally think Herrera will slot in next to Schweiny and Schneiderlin perfectly... He's still the only midfielder we have who is creative and forward thinking, unless we put mata or di maria in there (which we'll probably do to rest him). 

The main players who will suffer a big reduction of playing time will be Carrick, young, blind and fellaini I think. Unless Shaw is injured a lot like last year, then blind is fine.

5558~~~
I said it when he first signed, I think we will get the best out of Mata in Europe. Not that we can't or we shouldn't expect it in the league but I think the way we will set up in Europe, I think playing him off the lone striker, with a solid two behind him in midfield, he will really show what a great number 10 he is.

5559~~~
Is he a viable alternative as an out and out striker? Or is he just too small?

5560~~~
Would completely halve the amount of forward balls to the front. Can't play him in behind, can't knock the ball at height to him. Needs someone in front of him.
