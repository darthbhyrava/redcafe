Time for a thread in here now Sporting have confirmed it?



Edit: And now United

2~~~
So this official ?

And  what does pavilhao mean ?

3~~~
Welcome.

The big question is how well he can do at CB having primarily been a leftback.

4~~~
Wouldn't start this thread until United themselves tweet it...

5~~~
Until we confirm it, it ain't official.

6~~~
He played at centre back all last season?

7~~~
It's definitely official. 

Happy with the signing, really feel he can become a fan favourite. Appears to be quite the nutter.

8~~~
One down three to go.

Good luck marcos,

9~~~
He's been playing as a cb for sporting for 2 seasons apparently so ... fine?

10~~~
Get stuck in you nutcase.

Welcome to Manchester.

11~~~
Pavillion.

12~~~
Is he better than Buttner?

13~~~
Ok and what does Pavillion mean ? (with respect to a transfer being announced)

14~~~
I think he'll be a fan favourite. Although there will be mistakes I'm sure.

15~~~
Just pavillion but they will use 9 million of their received fee and build one with it or something like that.

16~~~
Not that excited about this signing,but welcome to OT i guess.

17~~~
A Sporting sports-crentre for all their other sports tiers apart from football.

Welcome, Rojo. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

20~~~
They're saying they'll use €9m of the money on their Pavilion.

21~~~
Ah ok, so they will use the 9 million for the construction of a pavillion. Now i get it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

22~~~
They will build a pavilion in the stadium.

23~~~
Hopefully he will be a good signing, I have a feeling the fans will love him for his character.

24~~~
What number will he wear? 5 or 15?

25~~~
Lets hope he has a great career here at United!! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

26~~~
Manchester is Rojo <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

27~~~
A versatile defender is what we needed, let's hope he develops well. 

Now let's sort out our midfield and we're good to go

28~~~
I'm cautiously optimistic about this guy, I think he'll add some fire and personality to us on the pitch. Welcome Marcos, now time for the shirt pic! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

29~~~
Yea i know what a pavillion is, but I thought the tweet said the deal was done subject to them building a pavillion. I had no idea what to make of it, but now I get it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

30~~~
Great deal for Sporting. If we're actually paying all of Nani's wages, then we're idiots. Would have been much better to pay them a few more million and having him as an option/selling him later in the window.

We needed a defender, though, any defender. I don't know much about this guy but expect him to be around the same level as the ones we have, so a bit underwhelmed at that price. Now for the next one, please.

31~~~
Welcome Rojo !

32~~~
I would have liked to have seen a tear up between them that's for sure.

33~~~
Why don't we have a pavilion?

34~~~
Best of luck to him, hope it proves a success.

35~~~
Atleast we got rid of him for a year.

36~~~
Excellent. Very good signing.

Wish we could build some pavilions though, stoopid Ed.

37~~~
How is that a good thing when we're paying all of his wages? It's another lousy deal negotiated by Woodward, whichever way you put it. Hopefully Rojo will make us forget that.

38~~~
Sporting's press release is here. <a class="externalLink" href="http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR51803.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR51803.pdf</a>

Translation:

39~~~
I wonder what we had to pay for him and how it works with Nani

40~~~
You would have to be a more ecletic club. We are the second most ecletic club in Europe after Barcelona. Our athletes have won olympic medals. Just wish football also won a bit more. I guess MarcosDeto will be delighted with another argie. Time for him to defend him now. I´m relieved of my duties <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

41~~~
Olly thread but no GIF?

Waste of time.

42~~~
First LVG signing, I feel good about it even though I know nothing about the player....

43~~~
Olly is the new Top.

Past his best imo.

44~~~
Welcome, dude.

45~~~
Well we'd be paying his wages if his on our bench anyway, atleast now he helped us secure this deal which was looking to many as being completley blocked just a couple of days ago. Rojo to United for €20m was looking unlikley the moment Sporting came out threathening to take Doyen to court. I think Woodward resolved this just fine, smoothed things over between the two, unblocked the deal, got us Rojo for 20 mil and found a solution for Nani in the process.

46~~~
Official statement from Sporting. €10 million upfront, two €5 million installments to be paid after.

47~~~
I feel good about this singning. He's young, has lots of experience at an international level(usually a good sign), read the game well and will become a bit more disciplined under someone like van Gaal.

48~~~
What is the pavilion's buyout fee & how much of it do Doyen own?

49~~~
We have paid €10m now, and a further €10m in 2 stage payments.

50~~~
Shocked he's actually coming, simply because we've been such massive jokers with our transfers lately. Much needed signing if all they say about him is true.

51~~~
... are you telling me we've bought someone?

52~~~
Happy to get a new signing but embarrassed to admit that I don't know much about Rojo other than he's a left-footed defender and Argentinian.  Can someone describe what his strengths are and who he is similar to.  Why are people saying that he's a nutter?  How's his disciplinary record?  And lastly, it appears as if his brief time spent in Russia was rather disappointing.  Was he injured?  Or was it a case of being too young and not fitting in to a new environment?

53~~~
Welcome, Marcos.

54~~~
If he was on our bench, we could play him, or we could sell him later. Would have been much more sensible to pay Sporting a few more million.

55~~~
I hope this is not our last signing of the window but I have an uncomfortable feeling it's going to be.

Anyways welcome to United, Rojo.

56~~~
Welcome to United. I hope that's not the last time I'll be saying that before the window closes.

57~~~
We should buy sportings pavillion next season.
It has handball AND futsall already!!!

58~~~
As a signing he makes perfect sense but then the last time I thought that about one of our signings was Kagawa so what do I know...

It's a bit of a shame for Blackett but it had to be done. Wonder who gets dropped out of Jones, Smalling and Evans.

59~~~
Welcome to United Rojo <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

Nice to have an Argie again, I like South American players. Now only Vidal and Di Maria to go!!

60~~~
I would probably guess Jones? He seems to be an all action centre-back like Jones.

61~~~
Finally it's official!

62~~~

63~~~
Jury's out on him at CB after what I've read. Pleased with this transfer for fullback cover though.

Hopefully he can help get Di Maria to come.

64~~~

65~~~
Marcos Rojo is a red, is a red, is a red. Marcos Rojo is a red! It's his surname!

66~~~
So, the most important question, how do you correctly pronounce his name? 

Rojo?
Roho?
Rogo?

67~~~
Rokho, no?

68~~~
Smalling or Evans, I think the plan will be for the pace and power of Rojo and Jones to flank one of them as the central CB.

69~~~
Mar-kos

70~~~
Roho.

71~~~
Welcome, Mr Rojo. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

72~~~
I'm not calling him that.

Rojo it is.

73~~~
Ben-aaa-tia

74~~~
I've been saying it the same way you'd say the "J" in Jose.

So the sound you do if you're preparing to formulate a massive bolus of phlegm to spit out.

75~~~
The player seems to have said he's coming so it would be handy if we have actually signed him.

76~~~
Hopefully a good signing. Can't say I know much about him since I hadn't seen him play before the world cup. I thought he was pretty good at that, though others have impressed at that before and not got up to much. He certainly ticks in the right boxes in terms of increasing squad numbers in a position that badly needed strengthening. Especially useful that he can play left-back too. Let's hope he is good enough to be a starter right away. The disciplinary record is a slight concern though.

77~~~
This will be interesting and exciting! Welcome to Manchester, Rojo!

78~~~
Get in!

79~~~
The press will be waiting for him to be sent off so they can go roll out things like:
Rojo's first reds red.

Welcome to Manchester. Manchester is rojo.

80~~~
Nice to actually sign someone! 

And it seems like he genuinely wanted to join the club, I always love seeing that. He could become a fan favorite I feel. 

Welcome aboard, Marcos.

81~~~
Grand job a defender. Wish em the best of luck for the future.

82~~~
He seems like a bastard and we're lacking in bastards. Happy with this.

83~~~
Rocco co.

84~~~
When he's going on strike again you proably won't feel that way!

85~~~
Been the case with all our signings so far this summer really! Our history with Argentinean players isn't so good though. Hopefully he won't go on strike again but from everything I've seen, it seems like a dream of his so hopefully not.

86~~~
His first name is Marcos, its Marcos, Its Marcos
His second name is Rojo, its Rojo, its Rojo
He done it in the World Cup, the World Cup, the World Cup
We said then we'll have em, we'll have em, we'll have em

Oooowoooohooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

87~~~
More.

88~~~

89~~~
Welcome Rojo!

90~~~
Sounds like he's talking about a dog, not a human. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

91~~~
Good luck to him. Hope he delivers.

92~~~
16m GBP + 5m GBP(Nani 1year/salary). Good deal for Sporting..

93~~~
So wait why's the few £16m now? Sporting clearly said €9m on their twitter account.

94~~~
We had to pay Nani's salary anyway. It's good for all parties if we wanted Nani out which seemingly we did after the Tour.

95~~~
If it was the Nani of three years ago. The fee alone is pretty good though.

96~~~
No they said they'd use €9m of the transfer fee on their pavilion.

97~~~
Welcome Rojo

98~~~
Their official statement reveals €10 million to be paid now with two €5 million installments in the future.

99~~~
Marcos Rojo is a red, is a red, is a red.
Marcos Rojo is a red.
His name directly translate into it.

100~~~
Welcome Rojo! 

Now let's get 2 more on board. A CM and a Winger preferably

101~~~
1 down! hopefully two more signings.

102~~~
One of the best things about this signing is that absolutely nobody had a clue until Rojo let it slip. Then him going on strike, part ownership is what exploded this into a saga. Very quiet on our end, so it gives me a lot of hope there's more going on in the background.

103~~~
5 I think.

104~~~

105~~~
Welcome you crazy bastard!

106~~~
I think we probably knew Vermaelen is gonna be tough, so sounded him out.

107~~~
Welcome Rojo. Hopefully Van Gaal will turn him into a world class defender.

108~~~
I reckon they'd come up with something better than that.

109~~~

110~~~
So I guess he's one of the targets Woodward said we were making progress on during that MUTV interview and it also proves that the whole van Gaal evaluating speech was just a smokescreen while we're silently sealing deals with no interest from the media. Interesting, there could be more Rojo and Herrera type of signings that come out of nowhere in these 2 weeks!

111~~~

112~~~
So happy we've got another defender in. It could be the difference between another disaster season and having a good run.

That being said, this better not be it for the summer. We still need more.

113~~~
Gives me (slim) hope that there's actually a process in place--and United are throwing some head fakes by getting the press thinking we're in for one player while negotiating with another.  Herrara came out of nowhere-now Rojo. 

That Ronaldo/Messi double swoop is just around the corner <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

114~~~
Yeah that maybe means work is in progress for one or 2 more targets. I hope at least.

115~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

116~~~
So we've been after him since the world cup, but only decided to make a bid 2 weeks before the end of the window after the season had already started instead of getting it done early so we can have him bed in during pre season? Smart.

117~~~
Nutcase out, nutcase in, quite pleasing signing but we must go again. 

#Glazersin?

118~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

119~~~
How old is he?

120~~~
Deal was very complicated, journos on MUTV said Rojo was affiliated to the same agency as Mangala who's only signed for Manchester City recently after agreeing everything with them ages ago.

121~~~
24

122~~~
He will be a lot of fun. Always love a bit of aggression in players.

123~~~
Good to break up the English back line! 

He speaks Spanish right?

124~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>Welcome to UTD, Rojo!

125~~~
Welcome, he'll surprise a few im sure!

126~~~
Welcome to Old Trafford Rojo, but not any improvement on Smalling imo. Another cb is necessary and if we don't get one I'll remain very worried about our defence this season. Does he even speak English, because our miscommunication in the last game led to both goals?

127~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fl6bPfw1sU4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

World Cup highlights. 

Warning: Shit music

128~~~
Not excited at all but, well, good luck, I hope that he proves me wrong. And if Van Gaal wants him, he should have him. We need numbers in defense anyway

129~~~
He's a completely different type of defender to Smalling for one.

130~~~
At least someone here has seen a fair bit of him.

131~~~
Shaw & Rojo, better option than an ageing Evra & useless Buttner, atleast that is one area of the team we have improved on.

132~~~
If it was during the world cup I wonder if he was someone we scouted last season rather than a LvG signing

133~~~
It's quite obvious we thought we would get Vermaelen.

134~~~
Good news welcome to United Rojo.First of a few hopefully.

135~~~

136~~~
Rojo is a CB first and its his preferable position.

137~~~
How many of those that are critical of this signing have watched him play more than 10 times?

Can't say I have but then I'm not being critical.

Seems like a lot of people are basing their opinion on people from Twitter.

138~~~
I'm aware of this, I meant in terms of pure quality. I assume atm, we'll play with this defence:

I want to be positive about him, but I'd be surprised if he makes a big difference, at least in the short term. His main appeal is that he's left footed. Who knows though, Van Gaal may turn him into a very good cb.

139~~~
He's definitely our most tattooed player ever. He has 'em on his neck!

140~~~
Who doesn't speak English out of Blackett, Smalling and Jones?

141~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/Sport_Witness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Sport Witness</b> ‏@Sport_Witness </a> <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/Sport_Witness/status/501790316090114048" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1h</a>
Sporting have put a clause in the Rojo contract, seeing them get 20% if Manchester United sell the player for more than €23m.

142~~~
Yeah.. That'll never happen

143~~~
No need to be like that, I'm just saying, he won't be able to help in that respect in the short term. Their lack of communication obviously wasn't because of a language barrier, it was because none of them took control of the defence the way Vidic and Rio used to. Constant communication is vital in any good defence.

144~~~
He won't last long with LVG if he does that and I'm sure he will learn that soon enough.

145~~~
Plus Nani free of charge for a year. Heavy fee

146~~~
Not only this but people are saying a fee of c. £16m (+ say £3-4m of Nani's wages) is stupidly high.

The fact is without knowing Rojo's salary fans can't really judge if we are overpaying. If he is earning £1-2m a year then he's a bargain.

147~~~
Well said Ole!

148~~~
SAD Sporting SAD

149~~~
But can also cover left back and is better than Buttner so win win.

150~~~
The pavilion i.e. the stands.

151~~~
Just joking mate. 
I agree with you, communication is a key for a good defense, it will be better once they click, weather it is 4 or 3 in the back. They were shifting positions all the time and didnt play regulary together and I think LVG will slot Rojo in that equation nicely. 
Weather he speaks English or not I dont know, but its his dream move to play for us, that's a good thing to hear for sure. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

152~~~
Bebé, Fellaini above release clause, Herrera one year later, and a 5m gift in Nani's wages to Sporting, which added to the rest severely overvalues Rojo.

You really need to do something about your upper management. It's wonderful doing business with you lot.

153~~~
Does this mean we are signing Di Maria?

154~~~
I'm sure he's ecstatic to play at United, as any player would be. But why do people still value this clichéed stuff? What were the last players to say something neutral such as "hmmm. I guess it's ok" when asked about how it feels to play at United.

155~~~
Absolutely, it's always better when a player actually wants to play for us for reasons other than money. I'd love to see him succeed, but I'm not getting carried away just yet. More investment is still needed imo. At least it's a start though.

156~~~
There's a difference between I'm happy to be here and It's my dream to play for this club.

157~~~
Chevrolet, adidas and AON agree.

158~~~
Of course, we need 2 or 3 more signings, I think we'll be happy if we make 2 more..

159~~~
There is?

160~~~
Decent signing, better than Vermaelen for me, but not enough, hope at least one more will be done soon.

161~~~
Yup.

162~~~
Shhh don´t spoil their fun man <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> If this package is overvaluates Rojo, what would you say about what City payed for Mangala? For all is worth, Rojo had a much better year than Mangala last season.

163~~~
So....Is anyone with some sense, going to answer my question from the other thread??? Is he any good? My other thread was feck all to with me not knowing we were after him or any shit like that. It was a simple question, I know nothing of him and want to know if he is he any good. All the dicks that laughed can go feck yourselves, Sensible answers only please.

164~~~
I'm talking about the football people. Which is what is supposed to matter to fans, unless some of that money will end up in your pocket.

165~~~
City don't manage, they throw money around.

166~~~
You might want to find Rojo thread in transfers forum.

167~~~
We're paying Nani's wages for him not to play for us. 
No change then. 

Personally think Nani can offer us a lot more, this might just work out if he starts hitting his potential.

168~~~
Touché <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

169~~~
A simple yes or no would suffice.

170~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

I never felt that. In fact I have no idea which players, among the ones whom Porto signed this season, said they were happy, and said it's a dream. It's irrelevant. Or perhaps not, if one makes fans happier it might not be so redundant as that?

171~~~
Its not a simple yes or no answer though.

172~~~
It makes me happier. I'm like that. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

173~~~
Depends who do you ask.

174~~~
And going on strike to force the move.

175~~~
Even better!

176~~~
We've just had our worst season in over 20 years, can't offer Champions league football and had no manager to conduct any business until a couple of weeks ago. And even then he was straight on tour and had to evaluate his squad. We were in a somewhat similar situation last year. We had a new manager who was unproven at the top level and was always going to struggle to attract top players. He also had to come in and assess the squad and then identify targets, so it's been a tough couple of transfer windows for us. 

But I have faith in the men at the top because of those sponsorship deals. Whether or not we have it right now, we will have the money to attract top talent soon and if we can get back into the top four and offer Champions League football next year, with a manager who can start to identify targets for next year now, we'll have much better transfer windows ahead.

177~~~
I think moving from Sporting to United/Madrid/City/Chelsea/Arsenal/Everton/Barca/Bayern/Dortmund is a 'dream move' for any player.

178~~~
Google translate said that you mean <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
Ah right. This explains it. A bit annoying cause I'm not entirely sure he's worth nearly £20m <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

179~~~
It's what it takes these days for us to get our man, what happened to good old United paying the required fee and landing their man quietly.

180~~~
Specially considering he'd probably be increasing his salary by about 10 times.

181~~~
I'm not sure Everton should be in that list of clubs.

182~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

183~~~
Not many people actually know. 

Even if they have seen him play well week in week out at Sporting that does not mean that form will translate to the EPL. From what I have seen he likes a tackle, has got good pace, he can run with the ball and can pass too. 

Will he fit the system that LVG wants to play here? LGV thinks that he can or we wouldn't be buying him.  I think he is our first signing that was actually suggested by LVG so I'm willing t o give him a chance.

I don't know where he will be with his fitness having played in the World Cup Final.

184~~~
Just checked his stats (admittedly Wikipedia) and he doesnt appear to have had any seasons where he has played the amount a first team regular would. Is there any reason for this?

Also with Nani gone we are very short on wide players. Obviously in our current formation this isn't a problem but if we switch later in the season surely we need to sign someone?

185~~~
Thank you. Nice to have someone answer a simple question with a simple answer. Why do some have to think they are superior to all others where football is concerned. Pompous fecking twats.

186~~~
At the moment I don't really care if we pay £5m over odds on every player we bring in. We need quality in the squad and more importantly players that LVG has highlighted and believes will do well with his philosophy.

If LVG wants him then I'm happy for him to be here.

187~~~
Im looking forward to watching him too. Cant imagine why, but  for the sort of reason you might enjoy watching a Luiz/Pepe hybrid  playing for a rival team! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

188~~~
Why are people getting so caught up in us paying Nani's wages, Sporting wanted more cash, rather than us doing that we have essentially done a free loan deal which we could benefit from in one of 2 ways.

Nani has a good season and has something to offer us.
Nani has a good season so has some resale value

Nani stay as he is and is worth nothing.

I don't see it as a problem, 16m or 21m for Rojo, not to fussed.

189~~~
Valencia
Adnan
Young
Zaha

We have wide players. Lacking in quality, maybe.

190~~~
If were able to land Di maria it would make sense in a way. Januzaj and di maria first choice, young and valencia backup, thats more than good enough for a team without champions league. the enxt year you can look at dumping 1 of the backups for someone like depay.

191~~~
Good signing, good name.

Most foreign defenders struggle at the beginning in the premier league, it took vidic and evra half a season to shine, we need to give him time.

192~~~
Not too impressed with this signing! Doesn't show an intention to return to the top. This is an Europa League signing or 3rd 4th Place at best but doesn't compare to the likes we call world class. Hope i am proved wrong and eh will have my full support from day one but I think he is prone to make errors either positioning or disciplinary.

193~~~
I don't know why everyone assumes we are paying Nani's wages? Free of charge means no loan fee, not that we are necessarily paying his wages.

194~~~
I just came in the thread to say exactly that - I dont see anything in the official statements to say we are paying all of Nani's wages

195~~~
Why do you think that? Have you seen evidence of it?

196~~~
I've said it in the other thread too, no answer. I'd be very surprised if we are paying his wages.

197~~~
Someone who watches him week in week out as a Sporting fan said it, Sly I think.

198~~~
Basing your opinion on what someone else thinks isn't very wise.

199~~~
What a wonderfully underwhelming signing.

200~~~
Sporting can't afford his wages at all, I am just hoping we are at least not paying his full wages!

201~~~
New redcafe favorite word: Underwhelming.

Embarrasing is in the past.

202~~~
Sly from Portugal who is, I think, a sporting fan, rates him very highly and feels he can become a real quality defender for us under LVG. Based on his comments, rojo has a great season for sporting last season at centre back. He's also supposedly great aerially which I think could really help us.

From what I've read one my own about him, he's physically excellent. Quick, strong and good in the air. Used to have issues with discipline and positioning, and maybe still does, but made huge strides with respect to that last season when he had a fine year. Still does pick up lots of cards.

203~~~
Welcome Rojo. Adds a lot f much needed aggression and physicality (& cuntishness) to our team. 

Fans are going to love him.

204~~~
Haha that's the perfect word for it. We need that <b>cuntishness</b> back. We used to have hard men like Vidic, Roy Keane, Gaz Neville, Staam... today we should be happy with Rojo - Proper nutter.

205~~~
I imagine him going into Gerrard's face at Anfield.

206~~~
His disciplinary record speaks for itself and even if I haven't seen him Play much, his problems with positioning errors are what really everybody confirms who has to do with port. League.

Him and Jones in defence would be two harsh defenders alongside wach other. Can't imagine that this works well for us.

207~~~
20 yellow cards and 4 red cards during the last 2 seasons for Sporting. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

208~~~
So you havent seen him but you know he has positioning errors?

209~~~
Very promising player. Although we don't have a great history with Argentines, hopefully we can get a good solid 4-5 years of service from him. Brings much needed aggression and depth to our team. Very good going forward as well.

210~~~
Thank you. Bit of honing required by the sound of him. here's hoping he fits in.

211~~~
Rojo your boat,
gently down the stream
clean sheets and victories,
Moyes was just a dream

212~~~
Perhaps you should watch him play and make up your own mind. Just have a look at the threads on players in this forum. Some people argue that player A has been fine, another will argue that he was terrible.

213~~~
Absolutely <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Too many players we have who prefers to hide when the going gets tough.

214~~~
hope we sign vidal and de jong and rafael will be back from injury, then we can line-up super aggresive team hungry for success everybody will finally fear.. it is not the last signing is it ?

215~~~
For people bitching about the fee, you need to understanding that Sporting didn't want to get rid of him and we're in need of defenders. He is not a '£16m player' whatever that means, but that's the price you pay to take another clubs valuable assets. If we bid exactly what he's worth for him, Sporting would tell us to feck off. Every club overpays for transfers, or else the system wouldn't work. The ones that seem a 'bargain' are only a bargain in hindsight because a player goes on to surprise everyone by excelling. Perhaps at the end of the season we'll think this is a bargain.

I think it's a fine price we've paid, because, really, what does £16m get you nowadays? Callum Chambers, a 19 year old who's had half a good season for an average side. No guarantees he'll be any good. We've just signed a 24 year old World Cup finalist who has been solid for the last two seasons for Sporting. I think it's fair.

216~~~
Boom boom boom now let me here Rojo, Rojo
I said boom boom boom muthafeckas say Rojo, Rojo.

Welcome Marcos the Red.

217~~~
It's actually too underwhelming a word considering what's happened lately. I can't think of any other words for such an uninspiring feeling.

218~~~

223~~~
£16m is about what we paid for Phil Jones as well, and that was before transfer prices had gone even higher. Have no idea why people think it's a bad price

224~~~
Read first!!! I just told what experts from several sources tell, all confirming his weakness. So most likely there is some truth in it. Wait and see if LvG can discipline and improve him.

225~~~
I agree - doesnt seem expensive at all for a regular Argentine international who just played all the way to the World Cup Final, in fact compared to what we paid for a very inexperienced Shaw its a bargain!

Although the exact terms of the Nani part of the deal does make a difference - still trying to find confirmation if we really are paying all his wages as thats probably an extra £4m or so.

226~~~
You are paying all his wages. It´s in the CMVM report i translated in the Rojo thread in the transfer forum <a class="externalLink" href="http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR51803.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR51803.pdf</a>

"Em simultâneo a SPORTING SAD chegou ao acordo com o Manchester United 
para a cedência temporária, livre de encargos, para a SPORTING SAD do 
atleta Nani, até ao final da época 2014/2015."

Basically says that Sporting gets Nani on loan, free of charge (livre de encargos translation), till the end of the 2014/2015 season.

227~~~
To paraphrase another post I saw elsewhere, if Nani has a good season, we'll get £10-12m for him. At the moment we'd struggle to get £7m. It might be worthwhile.

228~~~
Can "free of charge" be construed as no loan fee?

229~~~
It could but the portuguese media are reporting that United are paying his wage, so it´s free of charge as in no loan fee and wages.

230~~~
No, No 
No, No
No, No
No, No

In the tune of Chelsea, Chelsea.

233~~~
To conclude my point, even if Sporting was suppose to contribute to Nani´s wage, it would always be a residual percentage. Nani to Sporting could only be done thanks to United´s good will and the excellent relationship between the clubs. Our most expensive player wage wise (our goalkeeper Rui Patrício) gets 1.2 million euros per year. That´s our wage cap. United would always have to pay 90 to 100% of Nani´s wage. We simply can´t afford him without United´s financial help.

234~~~
I think it's safe to assume we're paying the vast majority of Nani's wages, more likely his complete wages. I agree there appears to be good relations between the two clubs.

235~~~
I think it's only fair that we clear up this Rojo is ill-disciplined thing. 

Yes he is lacking in discipline but he's not as bad as some people here have made him out to be. In fact he's been improving. I'd like the opinion of <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> to maybe help me out with this. 

- Last year he had 7 YC and 2 RC. One of that was a direct red and other was a Yellow/Red.
- The year before that he had 10 YC and 2 RC.

This would suggest that he has been improving with respect to his discipline. 

Let's not forget that YC are not the best barometer for measuring a player's value.

- Last year Pablo Zabaleta had 11 YC to his name in the PL (The most in the league). Yet, he was still lauded as a tremendous player for them, rightly so. But, it goes to show that YC don't make the player bad or good.

Perhaps what this lad needs is a strong manager to teach him how to keep his head. If we can get him to control his game he'd be invaluable in my book.

At the WC, the key stat that struck me was that he played 6 matches in which out of the 27 tackles he made, he was successful in 17 of them. That's 63% and when we take in aerial duels as well, he fares 60% success ratio when it comes to taking on opposition. In anyone's book those are great numbers. 

So maybe he's not as lunatic-like as people suggest. Perhaps he's not that ill-disciplined and maybe, just maybe we have a very good prospect here. Another stat was that Marcos Rojo was even faster than Arjen Robben in covering ground. That type of speed for a CB can be a real asset. What say?

Sources: ESPN, Squawka

236~~~
It´s a good policy. We have some good players (William Carvalho, Carlos Mané) and an academy that has a proven track record. Who knows, we might do business again in the near future.

237~~~
Rojo Row your boat?
Gently down the stream. 
Stick a leg in, scythe him down
Listen to him scream..

<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>, Welcome to manchester!

238~~~
To be honest I think Sporting have the best end of the deal on this, Nani just needs a bit of confidence, to me he seems like a sensitive soul and with a bit of love he could fly again, with him having the potential to be the main man over there he could do really well for you guys.

Btw I saw it mentioned somewhere that Carvalho could be a backup option for us, what do you reckon the chances are of Sporting selling him to us after this deal? Maybe you'd fancy a bit of Anderson in return to complete the 7 year cycle with these two 'error' purchases.

239~~~

240~~~
Imagine flying over on a private jet to sign for the club of your dreams...wearing a Donald Duck t-shirt.

241~~~
I'm happy to see him signed (pending his medical and all that). Seems like a modern centreback with athleticism, bite and skills who can also cover the LWB position.

242~~~
I´d like to give encouraging words but Rojo is a nutcase. Some of his tackles are mind boggling. I think it comes from his aggressive nature. Heinze was the same in the few games i saw from him at Sporting. He also has to cut the arguing with the refs stance all the time. Portuguese refs are more permissive. English refs won´t tolerate that. Van Gaal will have to do alot of physicological work with Rojo. Sometimes there absolutely no need to be so aggressive. I think his overall game would benefit from that. Keeping his cool and concentration in crucial moments of the game

243~~~
Guys wtf.. his song was decided hours ago in the transfer forum.

244~~~
Welcome Rojo!

245~~~
All the best Rojo lad i hope you're new Vida /Evra in the making

246~~~
Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Rojo, Mushroom, Mushroom.

247~~~
This bit I like a lot. I keep dreading a ball over the top of our defence because our CB's aren't that quick. Hopefully Rojo will fix that.

248~~~
Carvalho won´t leave this year mate. We already lost too many players in our defensive end. We need him for our Champions League campaign. The difference between the team with him and without him is staggering. We are too dependent on him at the moment. I can´t see Bruno de Carvalho letting him leave unless someone pays the clause. Only club rumours lately have been about Arsenal and Chelsea. Apparently Mourinho rates him very highly. They don´t need him now but who knows in the future.

249~~~
Much needed defender with almost World Cup medal on his neck. Hopefully he'll shake this sleepy defense and add confidence.

Big hope after Pat's departure.

250~~~
Dominant in the air and quick. Looks like good potential here. Hopefully van Gaal can help him develop and we'll have a good player on our hands.

251~~~
There is quite a lot of hype around that Carlos Mane guy isn't there. How good do you think he is going to turn out to be and do you think Bruma will go down the Ronaldo route or the Quaresma route?

252~~~
Brilliance. Absolute brilliance.

253~~~
I didn't pay attention to Argentina games during the WC much but all I remember when I lift my head up to telly I often see garay and this guy who seemed to be all over the place. I didn't really checked what position he plays but he looked to be very strong, fast, aggresive player who liked to attack. I eventually found out that he played as a left back so that makes a lot of sense. But that is a good news when you all say he is solid defensively. I always liked versatile players. This palyer can be potentially goal scoring centreback, he can drive forward if he has enough confidence to do so, looks to have a decent shot in him as well.. I am confident he is no david Luiz  and we are not brazil, we play 3 centrebacks so we can afford it to let one of the centrebacks go forward and surely it is the instruction to do it from time to time if its what takes to keep posession or set an unexpected counter. I have a good feeling about this transfer..

254~~~
So, we've been negotiating since the end of the World Cup and nobody had a clue until he liked United on instagram. Shows how much the press knows. 

We have probably noticed him when we were scouting for Carvalho last year.

255~~~
If it's true we're paying Nani's full wages, then this is a terrible deal on our part. I expected Sporting to pay at least 40% of his wages. I seriously hope this part of the deal isn't true.

256~~~

257~~~
Viva our Marco,
Viva our Marco,
He wears Donald Duck,
Doesn't give a f uck,
Viva our Marco!

258~~~
Well going by what Rojo has said, it just shows that the media are clueless. We've apparently been in talks with Rojo since the end of the WC (and his representatives were in contact with us during it too), and yet it wasn't until the last 2 weeks in which we've been linked with Rojo.

259~~~
Aye fair enough, one for next summer then, maybe his sale will give you the funds to buy Nani outright after he wins you the Primeira liga this year!

I have big hopes on Carlos Mané and i expect him to keep evolving at good rhytm. I think he will have a good internacional career if he shows desire for it and works hard. The talent is there. Just a question of getting his head to it. He seems like a quiet and responsible lad. About Bruma i got to be honest, since he left for Galatasaray, i haven´t been following his career. There was a very big hype about him in our academy. Had a serious injury last year, dunno how he recovered.

262~~~
Really? Smalling is probably the quickest in the league.

263~~~
Really hope so mate. Porto are clear favourites but Nani gives a very interesting boost <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Hope he doesn´t have any injury though. That´s my main concern.

264~~~
Hopefully he can add some ball-playing ability to the back line...but I've never really sat back and watched him so I've no idea what he can do. I think we're lacking a personality in defence and he certainly looks like a character.

265~~~
He seems to have good pace but isn't really quick off the mark. The opposite is true for Jones.

Cheers. Hope Gauld does well for you guys as well and starts the trend of promising british youngsters going overseas.

266~~~
I just can't wait to see the personal battle between Diego Costa and Rojo. Will be fantastic.

267~~~
Not sure, he certainly has the acceleration here. <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://shrani.si/f/1H/Sw/4K0tyBNO/smalling.gif" src="http://shrani.si/f/1H/Sw/4K0tyBNO/smalling.gif"/>

268~~~
Gauld did very well for Sporting B against Santa Clara. Got big praise from the media. He´s very young but he got big compliments for his technical ability and specially for his passing. Like Dier was, Gauld is a personal bet from the President. He will have time and support to settle. Then it´s up to him to cement his place at our club. Sorry for the off topic (this is the Rojo thread).

269~~~
Smalling and Jones are extremely quick

270~~~
You never know might just get lucky there, certainly due a good run in that department, if he stays fit for you he'll be great, will be keeping a close eye on Sporting games this season, best of luck this season.

271~~~
He likes good animation <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

272~~~
Like the tats, when was the last time we had a player with loads of tattoos except for Buttner? even he only had one sleeve.

273~~~
Thank you very much mate <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Like i said, i will give reports about Nani´s performances for us

274~~~
Probably Beckham, but he wasn't nearly as tattooed back then as he is now.

275~~~
Yeah I think he only had one on his arm before he left us, and the one on the back of his neck?

276~~~
Rojo, rojo, rojo.
Rojo, rojo, rojo.
Rojo, rojo, rojo.
Rojo, rojo, rojo.
Devils!

277~~~
Not enough mushrooms mate.

278~~~
That's a worrying fact this time though. Vidic and Evra came in United's glory years so had little pressure! Everyone will be getting on Rojo's back if he doesn't perform.

279~~~
Rojo, woaah
Rojo, woaah
His name is f*cking red
Something that rhymes with red

280~~~
No they didn't actually.

281~~~
Well at least we know he is passionate for the club. He really put himself in the firing line to try and get this move to happen. Good luck to him.

282~~~
Don't think we should kid ourselves he is a risk, and a bit of an unknown, if he was signing for City, Chelsea, or Liverpool we'd all be expecting him to be crap,

He could be top, could be terrible, so we now have Phil 'not trained on' Jones, Chris 'I just can't pass' Smalling, Jonny 'Injured again' Evans, and Marcos 'god only knows' Rojo as our main CB's, that's a bit frightening IMO, we are just crying our for a experienced leader but I am not seeing anyone out there at all.

283~~~
They came during very bleak times where it was wondered how we would ever manage to overcome Chelsea. Remember Evra's debut in an awful 3-1 loss to City?

284~~~
Rojo ho you float,
quickly down the wing,
merrily merrily merrily,
signed for muppets dreams!

285~~~
Thats pretty shit, it doesn't even rhyme!

286~~~
We needed a top class defender this summer, and at the moment we still haven't got one. This lad could be good but we need someone with a calm head and experience. There's still time but I haven't got a clue who else we could get.

287~~~
Chill shakespeare, it's based on a popular nursery rhyme. It's just a bit of fun for god sake <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

288~~~
Maybe not 'glory years', but they didn't come off the back of an all time low finish and nasty managerial transitional periods.

289~~~
"Marcos Rojo is a red...it's his surname"

It's the only worthy chant.

290~~~
I think United will win with Nani if he has a good season in Europe, actually this deal was better for him, same pay and CL football.

291~~~
Why? Nobody, rightly because he's awful and probably the thickest footballer on the planet, would buy him and sporting would take him to help this deal go through.

292~~~
Rojooooooooooooooooooo! Rojoooooooooooooooo!

Rojo, Rojo, he is a red you know
He can't defend, i'd rather Blind
Rojo, Rojo

293~~~
No they came at a time when we were battling for the PL which we hadn't won in three or four years if I remember right. The glory years returned under them.

294~~~
Yes they arrived when Chelsea were the dominant team. We were a long way behind when they joined.

295~~~
But we also have Louis 'I'm smart' van Gaal...

296~~~
The season they came we were knocked out of CL in that Benfica, Lille, Villareal group finishing bottom and had somehow managed to get into the top 2/3 after a good run 2nd half with Giggs and O'shea in midfield and Silvestre in defence. Then SAF fell out with our top scorer in Van Nistelrooy at some point after him fouling out with Ronaldo twice. Then Rooney and Ronaldo in the summer had a bust up at the WC meanwhile Chelsea signed some superstars like Ballack, Shevchenko amongst others. Scholes was out with eye issues as well and had a uncertain future.

297~~~

298~~~
I know we wanted someone a bit older, but that's taking the piss. Still, i bet he's at least quicker than Rio.

299~~~
Rojo Rojo with all those tattoos
our new Argentinian will change our views
so no more ohs or oohs
cause he's gonna make sure that we never lose..

300~~~
Plus he escapes unreasonable, hateful fans.

301~~~
I see a lot of people saying he's aggressive, which is something I like to see. We don't have enough cojones at the back, and bringing in Herrera and this guy seems to be the right direction to bringing in some aggression. Look forward to seeing LVG's "official first signing".

302~~~
Glad the deal is done. Hope he can settle in quickly.

303~~~
I wonder will he be available for Sunday? We could really do with him given Shaw is out.

304~~~
The J is indeed silent as it always is with Spanish names.

305~~~
Yeah but you wouldn't call him 'Roo'

306~~~
Aye since 2003. I corrected myself and said not exactly 'glory years' but still in a better way than we are now.

307~~~
Rafael, Jones, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw will give loads of pace in defence.

308~~~
The J is silent? The fucj you on about?

309~~~
fair enough, I'll take your word for it! I did see the 'free of charge' but thought it might just mean no loan fee, but sounds like United had to sweeten the deal to get it through

310~~~
Can he play as a left wing back also though? I thought that was kind of where he'd start his baptism of fire. Maybe as a central player though.

311~~~
Vidal will be

312~~~
Which left footed CB would you have signed?

313~~~
Come into this thread to make a random song about Rojo
Why does this always happen when we sign someone, though?
Why cant you all just say that you're happy with it
Rather than making up songs that are just fecking shit?

314~~~
Nice to see his plane has landed and that he didn't get the same one as Benatia did Saturday and Woodward did last year

315~~~
Its 'Ro-ho' like 'Ho-se' instead of J-ose Mourinho. Im assuming you're European and should know these things <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

316~~~
I think by the end of last weeks podcast I was pronouncing it right. Pretty sure I heard <a class="username" data-user="66352, @The Mitcher" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66352/">@The Mitcher</a> shout 'wahey' after my last attempt!

317~~~
It's more like a light 'h' sound xD Not silent.

318~~~
He had major problems on the podcast <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

319~~~
It's actually pronounced "Roj-Hoi".

Silent J. Silent I.

320~~~
Hehe!

321~~~
Ro-jo, there he goes
Makes a mistake and they score a goal
Foot too high, sent off, oh no
Let's sell him for Candyyyyyy ehhh ehhhh

322~~~
That's the jinx out of the way.

323~~~
Fifteen fouls and a rojo card
Rojo jo and a suspension to come

324~~~
These songs are crap, I just hope we get Di Maria - then every song will be to the tune of Maria by Blondie...

Di Maaaaria!
From Argentina!

325~~~
Actually that's pretty good.

326~~~
Did he play any games in pre-season for Sporting?

327~~~
I laughed, works pretty well too.

328~~~
Mate, that's shocking

329~~~
Is there a reason he cost twice what Federico Fernandez just moved for, other than the tyical Utd tax?

330~~~
surprised we haven't renamed the cafe Rojocafe for the day?

We had oranjecafe when LVG was announced.

331~~~
Hope he's as hard as Ramon Rojo. Even Clint had a hard time dealing with him.

332~~~
Think it will/should be tomorrow when the club officially announces it after the medical etc.

333~~~
Meh. I liked the other row your boat one from a few pages back, about Moyes's reign being a dream. I can't be bothered going back to find it but it was good.

334~~~
Not left footed.

335~~~
But that would be the reason we bought Rojo instead of Fernandez; I'm wondering more about the massive difference in value and what it's due to.

336~~~
Well you're right, we probably did overpay but 16m isn't all that much these days. Portuguese league watchers say that he was better than Mangala last season, for whom city shelled out 40m I think.

337~~~
Another typically underwhelming United signing...

338~~~
So are any of you Woodward hating bastards going to give him the credit for having a back up plan to Vermaelen?

339~~~
Nope.

340~~~
glad about this signing. still young with room for improvement,  can play CB and LB (exactly the positions we're in need of plugging up).

still need atleast another signing though (preferably 2)

341~~~
You mean likely that Van Gaal gave him a back up plan? And that it took him until now to sign him rather then get it done earlier so he can settle with the team? Complicated deal or not I'm sure Woodward could have gotten it done back in July after the world cup if he tried hard enough or was good at what he does... It's just not good that we entered the new season with nothing pretty much, regardless of what happens from now until the end of the window.

342~~~
very much this. not a world class (hopefully not yet) signing but there aren't many available these days and with the state we are currently in, it is not bad to get a young defender who played well at the world cup and was part of the team that made into the final. and he got something like 3 or 4 years of european footie as well. 

now hopefully we'll sign another midfielder, at least.

343~~~
Rojo Rojo Rojo we are Rojo.Welcome Rojo.

344~~~
looking forward to seeing how he does, he was very good in the world cup for Argentina, could end up being a steal at £16m has to be said.

can play on the Left or CB, so ideal really for that area of the pitch, though I think one more defender would be perfect there tbh.

now we have Rojo, if we also get someone like Blind and Di Maria I will be happy with our summer.

345~~~
I reckon this might just be a Vidic/Evra type purchase

346~~~
Thats the mentality of the biggest club of the world. Great on sponsors, cheap on players

347~~~
Following on from my initial welcome, I'll admit, question marks over a defender's positioning always worries me greatly. I think positioning is innate, you either get it or you don't. I look at Smalling and Jones, the former 'gets it', the latter does not. I can't think of many defenders that grew so much in a positional sense, from being rather bad into very good. Jamie Carragher, perhaps? There isn't many. I hope the lad can sort it out and prove to be a success.

348~~~
So tell then please who you wanted instead...

Edit: Thought so. People bitch about signings they have no idea about and can't even suggest alternatives in same position. I remember this happened a lot when the then unknown Vidic and Evra first signed for United.

349~~~
Another expert on the Portugese League. We have so many these days.

350~~~
I don't know why so many people are disappointed when most probably haven't even seen him play more than five or six matches. Just because he isn't a "big name" doesn't mean he can't play.

351~~~
I don't think we are cheap on players. We just don't have the pull to attract the very best, so often end up shopping in the second and third tiers. Being based in Manchester really hurts the club in that regard. It was okay a decade ago when we were basically the richest club around, but now we have at least 5-10 clubs who can pay as much as we do with more chance of trophies along with living in fantastic cities. The really top players who have options to go to shinier cities generally prefer to go there.

352~~~
He did cost half of what City paid for Mangala. So if we're getting ripped off by Portugal, it could always be worse.

353~~~
You're right about this. However, it seems the players rushing to the new money of PSG and Monaco have now realized Ligue 1 is not of the highest quality. Di Maria will realize this after playing there for a season.

354~~~
I wonder how many of those people who are crying about 'underwhelming' signing said the same about Evra and Vidić for instance..

355~~~
They were underwhelming signings as well at that time although Vidic came with a reputation and Evra had already played in a Champion League final. In this case, Rojo has played in a World Cup final so if he turns out to be anywhere near as good as the above two this will be a terrific signing, underwhelming though it may be at the moment.

356~~~
That's all true but people banging on and on about how underwhelming this signins is is a bit tiresome. And for most of them it's underwhelming only because he isn't a big name.
Also people crying and moaning constantly here...
LVG wanted him, if he have wanted a big name great but when he wants a player who isnt so well known it's 'underwhelming'.

357~~~
Didn't take long for the whingers to resurface. I'm willing to bet very few on here have watched much of him outside of the WC yet so many seem to think they're qualified enough to judge. Underwhelming just because he wasn't top of the muppets lists at the start of the summer? LvG clearly likes him, he was desperate to come here and it wouldn't hurt to give him a chance before writing him off. He might not be our most expensive or highest profile signing but they don't all have to be, we've already spent £28m on Shaw in a similar position.

358~~~
If we pay enough we get the players we want. Prior to signing with united this guy was close to go to liverpool feeder club. He also done well in a league were bebe excelled in.

I wish him all the best but i cant see how this guy is better to what weve got

359~~~
This is a very 'modern' view in my opinion. Not peculiar to United fans but a creeping trend with how fans perceive football at the top level. It's actually quite unhealthy in my opinion and is a product of what football is becoming. 

It seems that if you're not buying absolute proven quality for £25m+ then signings don't get fans giddy. A lot of top clubs are indulging in a nonsense-based reality where they are exchanging 'world-class talent' around Europe and if your club doesn't get one fans become disappointed at the purchase of a player without the same cache.   

But ask yourselves this: when have United built a team around the purchase of two or three world class signings in a window, which is being suggested as the solution to all the squad's problems? It seems that building a team has become secondary to a clutch of fans who regard the name and glitz of an individual signing as the chief concern. 

I'm reading it on here everyday about Liverpool's 'underwhelming' spending because they've not bought 'names'. It doesn't strike the average whopper that squads, in the main, are built around team-building. Rodgers is growing a squad with balance and room to develop. It may not work but it's a sane way of proceeding. 

Bayern didn't achieve great things through buying world class players from all corners of Europe. Nor did Barca until recently. The likes of Real, PSG and City have distorted perceptions of how squads should be built. It's caused fans to look on in envy while acting like spoilt children when their own club only pays £16m on a strong, yet unglamorous, looking defender. 

In short, stop playing Football Manager with your club - it makes you look like a 14 year old boy!

360~~~
Arguably the most expensive player of all time came from Liverpool's feeder club.

If he can manage to stay uninjured the entire season, that automatically makes him better than our back four who are perma-crocked. And imo, I would rather have Rojo able to fill in at LB than seeing Ashley Young out there.

361~~~
Evra played for monaco and was a star in a team that reached the CL final. Royo did well in a league were bebe was a star after failing spectacularly in a league were vidic was simply immense in.

Hes ok as cover. However we need someone better in the defense

362~~~
An odd point. Very good players are taken from second tier leagues around Europe - Ronaldo, Suarez, Evra...

363~~~
As i said i have no complains if hes shaw cover. However hes no solution to a CB that is in an absolute mess

364~~~
That won't stop devilish from moaning about our transfers. Di Maria also went to Real Madrid from the same league and hasn't done too bad.

365~~~
I suspect that the portuguese league is well lower in terms of quality then the dutch league or even the same portuguese league ronaldo played in. As i said i have no problem if rojo is seen as buttners replacement but we need someone better to shore the cb mess

366~~~
Have you watched him much to have this opinion or are you just making unqualified assumptions?

367~~~
I fully agree with herreras deal. I believe we overspent on shaw and i have no complains if rojo is brought as backup. However hes no answer for our cb mess

368~~~
Ive watched him a couple of times. Hes a technically gifted defender but his suspect in terms of positioning and hes a bit of a loose cannon.

369~~~
Rojo is spanish for red. It was inevitable.

370~~~
Good post.

371~~~
Excellent post.

372~~~
WOW best post on RedCafe for a while.

373~~~
Great post

374~~~
<span style="text-decoration: line-through">We're</span> they're in a state of panic and meltdown after losing the first game at home and us looking a bit of mess, tbf

More reasonably, I am pleased to see any defender of any kind arrive, just at the moment.

375~~~
It also happened when the unknown bebe, diouf, obertan,etc were signed.

376~~~
I'm happy we're signing this lad and I like the fact he's so eager to join us but I just can't get overly excited until I see who else Woody will successfully bring in.

377~~~
Bayern recent first team signings and the signings who help them dominate europe.

Lewandowski
Gotze
Martinez
Alcantara
Ribery
Neuer
Dante
Manzudic


Other than the last two, all were "names" as you termed them. Skinting on players is never going to get you to the top of europe unless you have an exceptional youth system.

378~~~
Unlike many here, or so it appears, I'm no expert on the Portugese league, but I do know that the lad played well at the world cup, and was so enthusiastic about joining us he leaked his own transfer.

I'll take that and Van Gaal's judgment on this one, one thing he knows, its getting younger talent to shine on a football pitch.

379~~~
Fernandez has played 68 games in the past 4 years in Europe, shared between Napoli and Getafe. Injuries? Not that good?

I think that to answer your question you'd have to find someone who watches them both play for their clubs. Probably a scout.

380~~~
For a CB he looked quite capable on the ball during the WC playing on Argentinas left side and we needed another CB so I feel this deal makes sense. Good to see we finally getting some replacements for our weakened defense in.

381~~~
It looks like right way to build the team like you described but i have to add that i just want 1 big signing per season in the place where we need it. This really helps building a team when you get WC player you need who instantly improve your team. Bayern and Barca does it.

And i want to add just one more thing. We need to get better with selling players we don't need and balance our squad. Van Gaal said we have to much number 10 players and strikers. Why not sell them then. We must start selling players who are not good enough or who we don't need. This is our biggest problem in the last 2 or 3 seasons.

382~~~
I'm glad we signed him. Going by what I saw of him at the WC added to what LvG is capable of doing with players, getting out of them etc I'd be confident enough he'll turn out to be a good signing. 

I hope everyone gives him a proper chance to settle in and adapt to things now and not be acting the bollix by writing him off straight away if he doesn't hit the ground running. That might be asking for a bit much though.

383~~~
Ideally yes but in reality, it comes down to the players. Clubs would be approaching some of our players quite often but when they present them with their offer, it just doesn't match what they are currently getting at United, so no bid is put in.

384~~~
That list is cherry picking. Bayern got to the UCL final against Chelsea without Lewa, Gotze, Martinez and Alcantara who have all been very recent signings. Neuer was good when they signed him, and Fergie had his chance too at him but chose DDG (a choice I have no issues with). Ribery was not "world class" when they signed him either (he was very good though).

385~~~
Neither was Alcantara.

386~~~
whats this i keep hearing about us paying the fee in 3 installments. This true or just bullshit?

387~~~
Doesnt change what I said though? Bayern have spend big to build their team. Those three are going to play a big part in their future while the rest of the names I mentioned are/have playing/played a key role in their dominance of europe. you cant say they spend 10-12 mil on good buys to build the squad only as they offsetted that with big signings to improve the quality of their first team.

You cant do that signing the likes of rojo, ribery was among the best wingers in the world when he was signed and it was the same for neuer,

Edit- And the origninal post wasnt about world class players but rather "names" which all of them fall under as they all had huge hype when bayern signed them.

388~~~
He still isn't world class as he is always injured. Only time will tell with him.

389~~~
So a player that was key in Argentina reaching the World Cup final, that helped keep and lets not forget this, Arjen Robben quiet during the Semi final and everything else that Argentina did, while two of our current first choice cb's couldn't even get into their own national side let alone be instrumental in it, is not an answer for our CB mess? He's a quick,  ball playing CB whose considered rather intelligent but heart on his sleeve type. I'd say this isn't a bad signing by the club whether as a first choice or backup CB. I'll very much give him a chance first before slating him because he played in a different league. Lets not forget where Vidic came from and that's much worse than the Portugese league. 

I'd say this was very much an LVG signing that was scouted during the world cup, but required patience due to 3rd party bullshit. This alone should fill some with confidence because he quite clearly has a clue about players.

390~~~
Why we give them such a big salarys? And people forget that footballers salaries are smaller if they don't play or a team don't achive their goals. It is rumored that all our players will get i think around 20% less money because we are not in CL. Rumored salarys are often the basic amount with all bonuses for playing games and scoring goals and all that.

Edit: pressed send to soon writting on the phone. And sorry for my bad english.

391~~~
That's a ridiculous comparison.
None of them had interational recognition like Rojo has. People are acting as if we have signed an unknown. We havent , this guy was a regular fixture in a defense which reached the WC final.

392~~~
<a class="username" data-user="36915, @PickledRed" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/36915/">@PickledRed</a>- Cracking post mate.

393~~~
Don't ask me why they get put on certain wages.

We say pay what it takes now to land the player but when it comes time to get rid, it's what idiot gave him that contract.

394~~~
Its as valid a comparison as the one with vidic,evra.

Ashley young had international recognition as well, and argentina defense wasnt the reason why they made it to the WC final.

395~~~
You're underrating portuguese league just because Bebe excelled there. Strange argument. 
Just to remind you, Ronaldo came from that exact Portuguese league.

396~~~
Our team which dominated Europe had a back line of players from Russian League, French League and a goalkeeper from Fulham.

Two of our main attackers came from Argentinian and Portuguese league.

397~~~
Actually that's Smalling...

398~~~
Referring to Van der Sar as a goal keeper from Fulham to prove a point? hmmm.

Evra played a key role in monaco's CL run. 

You are forgetting Ferdinand(25m plus), Rooney(25m plus), Hargreaves(17m plus), Tevez(25m loan). Even ronaldo falls under the category of being a player with big hype rather than an underwhelming signing as pickled puts it. 

And what happened to that team once we started bargain hunting instead of continuing the trend of signing big names and complementing them with smart purchases?

399~~~
No its not.

Evra was the part of a team which reached CL final and Vida was part of a Serbian defense which were quite awesome.

Argentina had one of the meanest defenses in the tournament and had the joint highest clean sheets in the World Cup. Messi was their man but Messi wasn't the reason why their defense was good.

400~~~
Well since you compared Rojo with Bebe etc..everything else seems like a sane comparison.

401~~~
Yeah I guess the fact they didnt concede a goal in the KO stages till the final didnt have anything with them reaching the final..

And Evra was a key member in Monaco CL run, but Rojo didnt have aynthing with Argentinian defense being very good at the WC..

All right..

402~~~
Argentina conceded 4 goals in 7 matches and yet defense wasn't the reason why they made into WC final. People are ridiculous here.

403~~~
Bebe wasn't a "star" in the Portuguese league unless Shane Long/Rickie Lambert is a star in the English league. 

Anyway, Wonder what reactions would be on here if we bought Mangala instead for 32 million pounds.

404~~~
Half of these players weren't crucial to their success last season. What exactly are you trying to prove? Bayern have a healthy group of home grown players who have come through their youth squads. What about barca's dominance how many of those players were home grown compared to big money signings?

405~~~
Fans aren't getting giddy because they've been told time and again by the club that we can attract the best players but obviously can't. Couple that with the fact that our last few signings havent set the world alight, you can see why people are frustrated.

You ask when have United purchased top talent in a window. That's not the point. The question is "When have United lacked this much world class talent in their squad?" Not that much over the last twenty years. It would seem that the club have had ample amount of time to address this but haven't (re: midfield).

As for your club the stick that you get is only amplified by the fact you didn't win the league last year WITH a world class player and have let him go this season. And even though you've tried a few times to sign some quality replacements you've failed. United fans know all too well what changes must take place with how the team plays and the results you get once a world class player leaves (Valencia for Ronaldo).

You're right about Bayern and Barcelona not having to spend. But the players that they got from their youth setup were comparable to our class of 92, in the sense that they had extremely talented youngsters that had the potential, reached the potential and in the process saved them millions in spending big. But let's bit forget Ribery, Robben, and other top talent they supported these youngsters with. Where is United's alternative to this setup right now? 

You can add Chelsea to that list of distorting perceptions on the game. Does spending huge amounts of money seem to work? Sadly, yes. Eventually it seems it does get you a trophy but at the cost of your club's soul and identity. 

Now onto Rojo. The fear that he might be only as good at the talent we already have and not someone that can steady the ship (his poor disciplinary record might support this) and discussions on here and other outlets that he lacks positional awareness and concentration. These are things that our own young defenders already suffer from. Essentially, there is a hole in the defence left by our last captain, a leader. Will there be another leader in that defence this season? 

Finally, I won't condemn fans for being upset. This level of failure over the last year, on the field and off, is unique for us all. Of course they will panic. Especially when key parts of the team aren't being addressed correctly.

406~~~
None of these players were even internationals at the time of us signing them. Rojo was in the  world cup 11 team. Vidic was a rock for club and country and Evra was captain of Monaco.

407~~~
And who exactly did they play in the KO stages? Or is that not relevant? 

And that makes it okay to compare them to rojo who has done basically nothing? You cant blame people for having doubts about the signing and say if it worked out for those two it will for Roo as well.

Ashley young was a key part of a team which reached the WC in style. 


I did, where?

408~~~
Yes, it was. They conceded four goals in the World Cup and two of them were in a dead rubber for them against Nigeria.

During the knockout phase they only conceded one goal and that was in the final. So ridiculous to say their defence wasn't the reason they made the final.

409~~~
You mean three players that are yet to win the CL with Bayern, and one whose only just signed. On top of that Gotze and Alcantara have hardly had the chance to make any impact with consistent injury issues.

Meawhile you actually look at the players that made Bayern successful, Muller, Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Alaba, Badstuber, Kross are all home grown. Naturally you can then look at Ribery (was purchased in 2008...) Robben (Got in a Madrid fire sale for silly cheap money) Rafinha (5 million) Neuer (was always happening) Dante (again cheap money).

So in other words, no you don't have to go and spend stupid fecking money on signings. Apart from Gomez, Ribery, Neuer and Martinez, the rest of the team that actually made them one of the top teams in europe was rather inexpensive and the most expensive of those four is now gone.

410~~~
My concern with Rojo is mostly the type of player he is. It might depend on where he ends up playing. If I think of him as providing an alternative to Shaw on the left I am actually pretty cool with the signing. When I think of him as a central defender I am struggling to see it... I get that he would probably suit 3 at the back, but I suppose I just think the 3 at the back thing is set to fail... It is a lot to ask to expect a set of defenders who need to bed into the team to completely change system as well... might do them good in the long run but have some concerns for the next few months.

411~~~
That bayern are a side who go after "names"! and not just signings like rojo as pickled seems to suggest?

412~~~
Why did you include Jones' name in brackets? He wasn't even in the conversation nor was his name in my post. Odd.

413~~~
Lets ignore the part about Barca then, shall we? great*two thumbs up*

414~~~
...

415~~~
My god, Rojo did nothing? So he just stood there?

It is relevant who they played to you. What are you saying, they head weak oponnents so it doesnt matter if they didnt concede a goal.

Ashley Young was a key part of a team which reached the WC in style, yet Rojo did nothing while Argentina reached the WC final..

Can't believe what I'm reading.

You're twisting things just to suit you.

416~~~
Bayern are in an unusual position though. They are by a long distance the most favoured club in Germany and also very close to the national team. This means they get most of the best German players and sets them at an immediate advantage. In England the talent pool is in any case not as strong and it is divided between clubs, creating a real premium on best talent - also the TV deal means that clubs like Everton are not strapped for cash so there is no real reason why they should sell the likes of Stones or Barkley. Once in that dominant position domestically, and with decent talent coming through the academy as well, they are set fair for pulling in additional players from around Europe to supplement what they have.

In short, when we were at our best, it was largely because we had the talent coming through the system locally and that enabled us to stay at the top and get other players that complement this. Without that we would be unlikely to get back to where we were, because we would simply be competing with Chelsea, City, PSG, Real, Barca, Bayern for the same set of players.

The long term answer for United is to get the best kids and play them... and the most concerning aspect of things in recent years is that unlike in the 80s we have actually managed to let some players who we had go... for whatever reason. The team could use Pique and Pogba right now.

417~~~
My bad, you are totally right. Lets start counting on our youth system producing all time greats like messi,xavi,iniesta and the world's best like puyol,buscuits and not sign anyone at all from this point on.

418~~~
ScoutNation's video of Rojo.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-ZyNjm-_CU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

419~~~
<ul>
<li>You dont read sarcasm well(ashley young)
</li>
<li>Duh. Thats how you judge the level of a player.</li>
</ul>

420~~~
But the leaders in that defence were Garay, Zabaleta and Mascherano, and they defended as a team. Fernandez is about to go to Swansea, and Demichelis is well past his best. They defended well for sure and Rojo deserves credit for being a part of that, but it doesn't automatically make him a good choice for us.

421~~~
If some of those are names then so is Shaw and Herrera even.

Every single signing cannot be marquee. Especially defenders are generally underwhelming signings for most clubs most of the time.

422~~~
lets not get distracted here, stay focussed. Please show me where Barca have spent shitloads of cash for foreign talent that has enabled them to win title after title during the last few years.

423~~~
Shaw is yes. Not sure about herrera.

424~~~
May I ask a question here? Who would be your ideal CB acquisition , since Rojo is just another underwhelming signing?

425~~~
Let me dumb it down for you. 

Barca.are.an.exception.Having.youth.like.that.coming.through.your.system.is.not.the.norm.

Even with that they have signed neymar, suarez, that ukrainian defender, henry, etoo,etc in the recent past for big money.

426~~~
No it isn't.

427~~~
Its hard to have a conversation with you. 
Argentina conceded 4 goals in 7 games, yet Rojo isnt a good player cause they had weak oponnents. 
Whatever.

428~~~
Benatia, Hummels(v.unlikely), marquinhos(possible) would make more of an immediate impact.

429~~~
No it doesn't but it also doesn't make him an unknown or an average player like some are trying to portray him.

Apart from Sly I'm willing to bet that no one saw him before the WC and yet the majority have decided that he's average inspite of Sly's opinion.

430~~~
Thiago had a higher status than either Shaw or Herrera when he was bought.

I do agree with the latter point... but it also works the other way. Not every signing can be a punt... and signing too many players that are punts stops your young players coming through and gives you a problem moving those on that don't work out. We have too many 'decent' players who have not kicked on at the moment and a problem moving them on. Anderson, Nani, Young, Valencia, Kagawa, Zaha, Hernandez, Fellaini. I am not saying we need to get rid of all of these and some might still make a breakthrough but our success rate is not looking fantastic at the moment. Partly unfortunate - we very narrowly missed out on Bale and Ramsey for example who would have been excellent punts.

431~~~
Okay, lets ignore the level of opponents while judging the quality of a player. Who is dominating league 1? Am sure he will be a hit here as well.

432~~~
I hope Rojo can prove his doubters, me included, wrong.

433~~~
United had other targets prioritised (Vermaelen). I would think United only really went after Rojo after that deal died.

434~~~
You're a muppet.
Well when you look at our youth system or development team specifically... 

Januzjai, Pogba, Ronaldo, Rafael, Welbeck, Evans, Piquet, Rossi over the past 10 years, our system doesn't look so bad hey... 

And before I get some bullshit about Ronaldo, he was nothing more than a player with potential when he signed with us. Nothing like Gotze or Rooney etc. This is a player that was developed by Manchester United. 

 So effectively, you look at the 10 year period in which Xavi first broke through and all the rest that followed along, and compare that with Ronaldo in 2003 and the 10 years that followed from that, I'd say our academies have both been excellent in churning out youth talent.

435~~~
Thiago Silva is dominating Ligue 1 for instance. Him and Benatia and Marquinhos, they all have weaker oponnents than in PL.

436~~~
We wanted a left footer CB to begin with, it clearly seems. And no Marquinhos won't make a more immediate impact in the English league even more so. He didn't even make a immediate impact in the French league that much and is more of a project.

Benatia i agree on but that's if he's available with Bayern's interest and we want another CB. He would have to play central of the 3.

437~~~
I guess the problem is that by seemingly refining our target to a left footed CB has meant those that fit the bill are significantly below this level as also show by us targeting Vermaelen. I'd argue that it's a problem in itself but if we're going this way then we're limiting ourselves to someone like Rojo. Whether it proves to be a good move, who knows.

438~~~
The player has said that United were talking to his representatives straight after the world cup. So as people have said we have no idea who they are talking to.

439~~~
You're right, but you also have to consider that Rojo wasn't playing in his preferred position either.

440~~~
I think we were after both to be frank. Primarily Vermaelen as the leading CB and Rojo as another CB but could cover in LB if necessary. Part of me is still expecting another center back and midfielder but I think that as of now, with blacket showing promise we might not need another center back.

441~~~
From my POV, I am only judging him directly on the world cup, which straight away I would admit does not say that much about him. Reports about his career up to that point are pretty variable and his disciplinary record is poor. 

I see it this way:

 - He is more than decent technically for a defender
 - He is strong and good in the air
 - He lacks composure and positional sense
 - He makes rash challenges
 - He is clearly able to play on the left to a reasonable level
 - He is the right age
 - When I was watching the world cup I distinctly thought that he looked like something of a filler player for a problem position and thought 'Might be a player, not ready yet'

Something of a rough diamond by the looks of him. I think Van Gaal thinks he can polish him, let's hope he's right... but I am not sure a rough diamond is what we need in central defence. 
From the point of view of needing an alternative to Shaw I think it's reasonable though especially since there aren't loads of good left backs out there.

442~~~
I think we probably knew Vermaelen with Arsenal was never gonna be easy with other clubs interested as well, so sounded out other potential targets in that area as well to gauge their interest.  Sead Kolasinac seemingly has said that United made a offer for him and been watching him etc..

So probably had fallbacks ready. Seems LVG really wanted Vermaelen though so we tried our hardest to wait on that first.

443~~~
Barca is an exception, my arse. Dont pull out this nonsense.No one expected barca to dominate like they did under pep, the fans included. Fans like yourself, want guarantees or assurances as to whether or not the team will be successful, because under fergie United was very close to that. Going by your amateur theory, Barca have managed to be successful while majority of their <b>big money signings failed miserably</b> to contribute to their success during this period.If Barca are an exception, United are as well for managing to reach two cl finals after getting rid of their best players in tevez,ronaldo.

444~~~
We do need a centre back IMO, and I rate all of Smalling, Jones, and Evans... and Blackett, Michael Keane and Thorpe have a chance too. I still think we need a leader here. Maybe, just maybe, it could be Evans but he seems a bit quiet and he keeps getting cocking injured.

445~~~
You know, £16M feels pretty much spot on here. There's always room for arguing a player is worth plus or minus two or three million quid. But generally speaking, it feels about right. 

Before the World Cup, with two decent seasons with Sporting, maybe he'd be worth £10-12M. But add in the inevitable World Cup tax, and you're there. Certainly don't feel we overpaid this time round.

446~~~
More of an immediate impact you say...how are you certain of this? Players with big reputations have flopped in this league before you know. You're knocking Rojo simply because you never heard of him before the world cup. Do you even watch those other players in their domestic leagues on the regular? I doubt you'd mention them specifically if not for our links with two of them. Marquinhos hasn't even fully settled into PSG and even though he is very talented he is still a work in progress.

447~~~
Very pleased with this signing. I liked what I saw at the WC and a lot of people who know what they're talking about seem to rate him. Young, versatile, talented, needed - what's not to like?

448~~~
So has he had his medical & agreed personal terms yet?

449~~~
Nope.

450~~~
I hope the first question they ask him during his interview is "When will Di Maria sign ?"

451~~~
Well personal terms have been agreed, I assume the medical will be today.

452~~~
So they've already got Nani & we might end up with nothing still?

Seems like a Woodward special, or is this how transfers normally work?

453~~~
It has been announced on our official page, so don't panic. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

454~~~
No, the deal with Sporting has been agreed, medical and personal terms with Rojo still need to be done says the official United homepage and Twitter page.

455~~~
They still have to do a medical on Nani as well presumably.

456~~~

457~~~
So we put in a bid for a player who we have not talked to yet? 

I know what the clubs site and twitter says but these personal terms are always agreed before the bid. Rojo has also said he has signed for Man Utd.

458~~~
Just read what the club said, doesn't mean we haven't talked to him, they just haven't officially signed the contract yet.

459~~~
Too much similarity between players to suggest United were after both Rojo, and Vermaelen. Left footed, and both can fill in left back positions and centrally.

460~~~
It will all have been agreed with the players agent. I think what remains is the medical, and the signing ceremony.

461~~~
That's what I said...

462~~~
Probably just a vocal agreement yet, but I wouldn't worry too much about it, he is totally eager to join us it looks.

463~~~
Not significantly weaker though and silva has also proven himself in the CL.

You do know that ronaldo and rafael arent our youth products? Both of them never played for our academy either so no idea why you are including them.

None of our youth players of the past ten years are of the level of that barca generation but yeah label me a muppet for being disappointed with the signing of rojo. Am sure you were saying the same when we signed young, berba, valencia, fellaini,etc.

464~~~
In that case, play blackett or a youth CB there. Why go out and buy someone who wont greatly improve our first team Would much rather give a youngster a chance.

Evans is pretty ambidextrous as well so he could have played as a LCB.

465~~~
Do you even know what you are arguing for? How is any of that related to barca's exceptional youth academy?

466~~~
You are right, have no idea who hummels is. 

Marquinhos' s career I have been following for a while and similarly with benatia when he was in udinese. But yeah believe what you wanna believe.

467~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just a few comments I thought funny.

Any idea whether he's fit enough to start on Sunday?

468~~~
Sporting have got a incredible deal. Nani on loan and 20% sell on fee for anything over 18.4m...

469~~~
I'd say that's good transfer work. We negotiated both deals and one was a back-up for each other's falling out. Rojo mentioned on Argentine radio that we'd been talking to him since the middle of the WC, and that we told him we'd wait for him when all this third party nonsense surfaced.

I'm quite pleased that we had a longview of the situation and it goes to show that it's not as if we don't have a clue as to what is happening in the window. We're working multiple deals.

Woodward is probably to blame for some of it but I think LVG himself is also part of it. He said that he wanted time to assess the players who hadn't come to the tour in the US. His words were: "Signing a player is not a problem. Believe me, we can sign a player in 24 hours."

The fact that he hasn't panicked and probably has waited to see if he's a 100% sure he wants to buy says that he's confident of acquiring the right targets.

Let's put some perspective here, we've been living and breathing this nightmare for the past 12 months and more. LVG hasn't. He's a stubborn man and we love him for that but the downside to that is that he'll want to individually assess his squad regardless of what anyone has to say. He'll make his own mind up.

Of course, I'm not naive enough to believe that he hasn't put out a few must-want names, but those names are hard to get. Vidal is the centre-piece of Juve's crown and Di Maria is one of the best wingers in the world playing for the other super-giant in football.

These are hard deals and even Gill would have struggled to bring them in. When was the last time we bought an established superstar to the club? I can't remember any in the last 10 years. RVP was a special case as he hadn't won much under Wenger. There's no one else that comes to mind.
Today we're trying to sign two! So let's just wait and hope. The club knows what it's doing.

470~~~
So you would rather spend the month with Young and Blackett as our left side of defence ? We bought him as cover for lb and cb,he is certainly adequate for that but has the potential to grow into a more important member of the team.

471~~~
Not significantly weaker but weaker. And who knows maybe he had weak oponnents in the CL.

472~~~
An okay signing but its just more glue over a cracked wall. Need 1 or 2 marquee signings to compete for that top four spot.

473~~~
Sorry then, maybe I misunderstood. I thought your comment and video was referring to Joga Bonito's post...
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i62.tinypic.com/oqkioh.jpg" src="http://i62.tinypic.com/oqkioh.jpg"/>

474~~~
Just can't shake off how he looks like he's from Geordie Shore...

475~~~
So now you agree with my weaker opponents argument?Glad you finally saw sense.
Yes or buy someone who will be first choice.

476~~~
What if we can't sign someone who will be first choice and is able to cover two positions ? Accept that and continue losing ? We don't know what LvG's got planned or how he views Rojo so it's premature to slate the signing.

477~~~
I'd rather play Rojo in the middle & continue to play Blackett on the left. If anyone deserves to be dropped based on Saturday it's certainly not him.

478~~~
I think it would be better off him playing LWB whilst Shaw is out.

479~~~
No, I'm just pointing out how you change your arguments from post to post.

480~~~
Well he is certainly a Red as that is his surname

481~~~
The dutch league? The same dutch league that their clubs are constantly beat by portuguese teams in the european competitions? The same dutch league that hasn´t reached an european cup final in god knows how many years? Why are you talking about things you are virtually clueless about?

482~~~
The former is the only possibility I can think of, myself, though again I don't know enough about the injury history to know if it's stuff that re-occurs or not. The latter seems unlikely to me, Fernandez played for a very good team in a better league than the Portuguese one, and has been first choice for Argentina when fit.

483~~~
I think he will start out playing LWB this weekend given our current injury situation, but if we are sticking with a back 3 I think he will mainly be deployed as a LCB once Shaw is fit.

484~~~
Why does the quality of the league matter in terms of player comparison? It´s about the players and not the quality of the league. Plenty of quality players have come from less glamorous leagues and have succeeded. Other have failed. Same with players from top leagues of europe. Káká came from AC Milan and the italian league who is obviously better than the portuguese league. Coentrão came from Benfica and our league. Who had the best Real Madrid career? Who offered more guarantees before both joined? Things aren´t as linear. It´s about the quality and caractheristics of a player. In Rojo´s case, he has the assets for a swift adaptation to english football. Will he suceed? No idea. Nothing is certain. But who would have thought that Shevchenko would fail at Chelsea?

485~~~
By saying that thiago silva is more qualified than rojo?

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sure mate.
I am slating the person who was saying it will be a success because vidic/evra were. Not the actual signing.

486~~~
I think it would be a little bit of gamble to play him on Sat. Hes new to team and CB/LWB position is not the position you can play straight away in a new system. I think either Rafa starts on right and Young on left or Young on right and James on the left. Our centreback three are good enough if they stay in 3. He will be lucky to be on the bench against Sunderland.

487~~~
No, for start you said Evra was a member of Monaco, CL finalists, and Rojo did nothing for Argentina, WC finalists. That's just for a start.

Either way I give up, must be fun talking to you in person if it's so fun on forum. Twisting and turning things just to fit your agenda against Rojo.

488~~~
so when will we get the customary pic with the jersey pic?
I was expecting the medical to be done by morning today. it will be weird if everything is completed and announced by today.

489~~~
Nothing but he got on WC team of the tournament. How´s that possible. He also got big praise from Diego Maradona and Simeone. Portuguese league isn´t a top league in europe but we have been doing very well in European competitions and the top clubs have some quality. Just look at the Uefa coeficients.  Yeah Evra was a member of Monaco´s CL finalists who got beat 3-0 by a Portuguese team.

490~~~
From a crap Portuguese league if we are to believe some posters here. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

491~~~
I think you're probably replying to to the wrong poster there. Where did I say anything about Rojo failing or someone else being a certainty? 
All I was doing was comparing the transfer fees of Rojo and Fernandez, two Argentinian international CBs of the same age, and wondering why their transfer fees were so different. Someone suggested injuries, which may be a factor, and he also suggested Fernandez was not good enough, which I thought was unlikely, because yes, he has played in a more competitive league than the Portuguese one - this does tend to matter during transfer negotiations by the way.

492~~~
Well said. It's the general vibe I got from a lot of the transfer talk on here, too many people seem to look with envy towards Real Madrid and their super star signings they do almost every summer and they can't help themselves but wanting United to do the same. 

But it's not only that people neglect the fact squad building is more than just buying big names it's also the fact that they can't seem to understand the fact that some players aren't for sale or just don't want to come here. There seems to be the general opinion that as long as you throw enough money at the club and players a deal can be done which sometimes just isn't the case.

493~~~
You mentioned top teams who have all splurged on top signings,I asked you what about barca during the most successful cycle? You said they are unique due to god sent youth academy. I am pointing out that you have been cherry picking since the beginning to support your amateur theory and on top on which you keep getting distracted with crap posts like these without answering my question.Please don't even try to make posts which mildy suggest you are some sort of caf legend with a great sense of humour, you are neither.

494~~~
So the thoughts are that Rojo will be LWB until Shaw comes back then slotting as LCB? At that Point will Evans Slot in the middle pushing Jones out to RCB?

495~~~

496~~~
I'm late but that PickledRed post was great.

497~~~
Why are the transfer fees so different? Because clubs negotiate in different fashion and have different needs in what concerns their financial demands. There are completely different circunstancies regarding both negotiations.

I suppose you have been a part of many transfer negotiations to make that kind of assumptions regarding the importance of playing in particular leagues. In my opinion, one of the best chairmans in europe in what concerns transfer negotiations (if not the best) is Porto´s chairman Pinto da Costa, who comes from the Portuguese league. Suppose that doesn´t matter when clubs negotiate with him and pay his hefty price tag demands.

498~~~
he will be great for you, he is better than Jones / Smalling - but would we have made a difference against Swansea?  You still need a CM

499~~~
Judging by our past Argentinian players, hes going to become a crowd favourite before trying to engineer a move to leeds united.

500~~~
Not at all and stop that aul' sort of chat. 

Rojo is going to change all that. He'll be kicking lumps out of the opposition and pulling off fancy flicks in the box at OT for the next decade.

501~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> When have I even done this? 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> amateur theory.

502~~~
Why does everything have to be said so snidely on this forum? Fine, so your answer to my question is that the difference in negotiating skill between Sporting and Man Utd's executives is larger than between Napoli and Swansea's. That's all that needs to be written.

All this stuff about "I suppose you're an expert" is very discouraging to discussion, and unless someone has actually claimed they are an expert (which is probably the case for about 2-3 people on this thread), completely unnecessary. In that case, let's all just stop posting, unless we have direct professional experience of football at the very top level.

503~~~
I dont have any agenda against him.

504~~~
I wish him all the good luck possible, we need players with courage, players with cojones and since I haven't seen a lot of him and he's described that way, I'm happy by this signing.

505~~~
You've watched him twice, probably during the WC, where he played well, yet you're jumping to conclusions that he isn't good enough?

506~~~
If that video is anything to go by then he looks a good player. I haven't seen him before the WC but he was very good in Brazil. That much we now for sure so let's hope he emulates this.

507~~~
I've watched him 7-8 times with Lisbon too. I am not saying he's shit. However he's not going to sort the CB mess by himself. He would be good enough as Buttner's replacement though and with some luck he may even send Shaw on the bench

508~~~
Talent wise the Dutch league produce better players then the Portuguese league and that had been going on for quite some time. 

Also Can you kindly remind me how Sporting Lisbon faired last season?

509~~~
Send a 32m Left back to the bench? Why would that be anyway lucky for us?

510~~~
That's a very, very good article, if there's an interest for the article, i'll do the trouble and translate it all to English, Tor-Kristian really knows his stuff.

511~~~
I am not referring to luck for us but for him (Rojo). I think we both agree that Rojo would be happy if he ends up a first teamer at United ahead of the likes of Shaw.

From my part I hope that they succeed both. I may have reservations on both players but I wish them all the best

512~~~
Can't believe the negative reaction on here. People talk as if he was dross at the WC dispute him getting in teams of the tournament. You'd think people would use their brain and not be so negative considering one of our best CBs in recent times, Nemanja Vidic, was a complete unknown when he signed.

I honestly think this place is partly populated by children and the type of idiots that you meet down at the pub, whose football knowledge only seems to include the biggest names.

I remember watching Sporting last season to see Carvalho and most on here had never seen him kick a ball by the end of the season. But now they're all experts on his lesser-known teammate. How the feck does that work? Unless they're going off the WC where he actually gained plaudits. Something doesn't add up.

513~~~
Unsexy name,check. Comes from a 2nd rate league,check. I smell success all over this one. Heinze,Evra and Vidic have me feeling very confident and we get a chance to send a tease like Nani away.

514~~~
It´s your opinion. It can hardly be taken as gospel. I disagree. Wanna compare the results of the dutch teams in europe with the portuguese? Wanna compare the Uefa coeficient? Want to compare the results in the games between the national teams? 

Also if you are going to be arrogant, can you kindly remind me how Sliema Wanders or Birkirkara faired last season?

515~~~
Vidic wasn't a complete unknown, stop saying that. He was a rock at Spartak (the same were Rojo failed spectacularly) and a regular of one of the meanest national defenses in Europe. By the time United were interested he had already received bids from Juventus and Inter and when he signed with us, Fiorentina were considering suing him because he promised that he will sign with them. Just because he's not EPL tested that doesn't mean he's unknown

516~~~
And Rojo is a argentinian internacional who made it to the World Cup team of the tournament. He isn´t a complete unknown either. So what if he failed at Spartak? Don´t know any top player that failed in a certain phase of their career and ended up turn it around? Why do things have to be so linear? Oh and please, it´s easy to talk in hindsight but after Vidic did that slow start at United, i don´t doubt for a sec that you with your usual kneejerk stance probably doubted his ability.

517~~~
I support neither of them to be honest. Unlike some people in here I can admit when something local is shit (which it is). There's only 2-3 players in the past 20 years whom I believed that they could make it at top level but that's not the issue. 

And lets agree to disagree on this. However as said, if I had to bet my money on who would win between Holland and Portugal I know were my money would go.

518~~~
So when do we expect his medical to be completed and this all finalized? Can we expect to see him this weekend, or is it likely to early considering he hasn't even trained with us yet

519~~~
Vidic struggled because he wasn't given proper pre season training with us. Same happened to other top quality players such as Evra and Cole. However its ridiculous to compare Vidic with Rojo. The former has seen an exponential rise to his career and had proven himself year after year. Rojo failed spectacularly with Spartak and only did well with an average Portuguese side were even the likes of Bebe excelled.

Hey we're both on the same side and I wish him all the best. However while I believe that he would be a good backup for Shaw (and certainly a better option then Young in the LWB role) I cant see him sort our defensive problems all by himself. The magnitude of the job in question is probably too big for him.

 Am I not entitled to an opinion without hitting nerves and having people going defensive?

520~~~

521~~~
You can put your money where you want but if you want to win it back, it´s better for you to probably study the statistics and historial. Also if you talk about something why not back it with facts and numbers? 

Yeah you can admit whatever you want but perhaps your local teams would be better if you started supporting them, instead of acting like a hot shot and being arrogant against supporters who prefer to root for their own local teams even if they aren´t as big or glamorous as United. Sporting is obviously a smaller club than United but we are traditional, respected european club, with alot of history and some relevant results in european competitions. A club which academy is in the top 5 in europe and that has produced two world players of the year in Figo and Ronaldo. The same Ronaldo who came to your "supposed" club and helped write another glorious chapter for United.

522~~~
Why is it ridiculous to compare Vidic to Rojo? Has the latter even kicked a ball? I know it will be virtually impossible since Vidic is one of the best center backs in the history of United but why can´t Rojo have an exponential rise in his career? 

Sporting isn´t an average side in Portugal. Sporting is a top side in Portugal and Bébé never excelled with us. And Bébé didn´t excell. Bébé had a very good season in a club that avoided relegation in the play offs. Let´s be careful with the words. And you can take mine, since i saw Bébé alot. I doubt you saw Bébé kick a ball.

523~~~
There is no way you can be serious. Scores of elite players come through the Portuguese league these days. Just think about all the players Porto, Benfica and Sporting have moved on in the last decade. Many of the best players in the game, Ronaldo, Falcao, Di Maria, James and many many more. In fact the more I think about it the more laughable that statement is.

The Portuguese league is much stronger as shown by their results in Europe and the better quality players that come through their league.

524~~~
Im excited to see him play centreback for us, that aggression putting the fear of god into Centre forwards. Blackett has proved himself to be capable of first team football so that's 5 centre backs now, once they get settled I can see the back 3 being quite effective.

4/5 of them are pretty damn quick for CBs which should allow us to play a higher line and compress the midfield making it harder to play against us. If we did sign someone like Vidal or Silva to play alongside Herrera then we've got a very mobile team and we can finally see us pressing effectively.

525~~~
Rule Number 1 of the Football Forums; ignore devilish.

526~~~
My history is kind of complicated and just because I don't support Sliema Wanderers or Birkirkara that doesn't mean I don't help others when I can. Club honors also tell part of the story. The EPL is one of the strongest in the world. That doesn't mean it produces the best talent in the world either. To conclude just because a team may have produced a couple of great players in the past that doesn't mean that its producing them now. United had produced more talent then Sporting would ever dream of doing. However we haven't produced a proper world class player since the class of 92. 

Lets agree with disagree on that because we're going out of subject

527~~~
He arrived late last night so I assume the transfer should be official by the end of the day. If i`m not mistaken if we register him before friday he will be eligible to play this weekend

528~~~
Although i agree with part of your post, i think that both the dutch and portuguese league are similiar and on par. We have better results than them in Europe but we belong in the second tier of the european league. I just reacted because it annoys me to see people downgrade less glamorous leagues without having real knowledge of the respective leagues. There´s more life in european football beside the Spanish, English and German leagues.

529~~~
Di Maria, Falcao and James are Portuguese league products as much as Pogba and Ronaldo were EPL products.

530~~~
Who are all of the players coming out of the Dutch league then? Both produce similar domestic talents. Better players come through the Portuguese league as a gateway into Europe.

531~~~
Portuguese league is crap because Bebe excelled there. 

And Sporting Lisbon is an 'average Portuguese side'. 

I heard it all now.

532~~~
Why do you take his view so personally? AFAIK he didn't belittle Sporting but Primeira Liga. Sporting are indeed a good club. It's easy to support your local team if it's Sporting so I won't take your 'I don't support the glamorous United' as a huge sacrifice as Sporting aren't your Luton Towns of this world but a big club with a fine stadium and name. As far as your league goes, it's in the 3rd tier along with Eredivisie, so below the obvious top tier and the second tier containing Bundesliga and Ligue 1.

Devilish isn't much better with his 'Holland would beat Portugal' argument. Well, Belgium would probably beat England and we can all agree their league is at the very bottom of European football. Also, while I don't think Rojo can ever reach the level Vidic did, he was the crucial part of the best back-four in Brazil and found himself in the best 11. That's as big a compliment as being 'a regular in one of the meanest national defenses in Europe'. We, United fans, all know zilch about Rojo and only saw him in the World Cup. Now if that's any indicator of his talent, we should take positive attitude towards this transfer not a negative one.

533~~~
A couple of great players in the past? Sporting keeps producing them on almost yearly basis. Just because you don´t know or lack the knowledge, doesn´t mean that we aren´t producing. And wanna compare the resources between both clubs? What we have been achieving is worthy of praise and that´s why FIFA and UEFA keep giving us awards because of the academy work. The same academy that has United youth team coaches doing internships with us on almost yearly basis. I´d suggest i´d keep your opinion about maltese football and Fergie visits to your island.

534~~~
One can only have a look at the Dutch national team to see the talent. They havent produced as much quality players as in the past but they still produce more talent then the big leagues such as Italy

535~~~

536~~~
Yeah if you can thanks.

537~~~
I didn´t take so personally, i just reacted and gave my opinion. Of course portuguese league is in the second or third tier. You just have to read my last posts where i acknowledge that. I was merely reacting to the glory hunting assumptions from a certain user who thinks that besides the EPL and other top european leagues, all the other european leagues are crap

538~~~
As I said Netherlands and Portugal produce similar domestic talents and have similar strength national sides. One bad tournament for Portugal doesn't change that, their recent international tournament record is still similar to Netherlands. Netherlands have benefited from better management I would say. Similar quality domestic talent, better players coming through the Portuguese league as a gateway into Europe.

539~~~
Duly noted mate.

540~~~
Its funny how you're comparing your team with teams coming from league being played on a small country with a population of half a million people. Kind of show how biased local fans can be about their players.

541~~~
Oh but weren´t you calling my club an average club and comparing us in some itens with arguably the third biggest club in Europe United? Can´t i do the same?

542~~~
Too much pointless chatter

Where are the pics of the fecker going to the medical with the white cloth?

543~~~
I've only said that I cant see how Rojo can solve our defensive woes. That's all.

And you should visit Malta. Its shit in football but with a good standard of living and a ridiculous unemployment rate which is much less the Portugal and Spain. I

544~~~
Yeah i apologize. I´ll end the off topic. Sorry devilish, if Rojo does bad because he comes from a crap league, you can send him back. No refunds though <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

545~~~
I already did mate and i love it. It´s a very good place. Anyways sorry if i was too aggressive and let´s end the off topic. Hope Rojo does well at United. Same with Nani with us.

546~~~
No worries. Maybe I was aggressive too and in that case I apologise (reminds me of an ancient argument I had with another great poster Antohan a couple of years back)

Returning on Rojo my point is that while there are plenty of positives in the guy I fail to see him sorting the defensive problems all by himself. Im more concerned about the magnitude of the job (ie becoming the leader and focal point of a defense which just lost 3 flagships) rather then Rojos talent.

547~~~
They mostly are, aren't they? Doesn't mean there are no decent teams in there. Eredivisie is sort of crap yet you'll find some cracking names, iconic clubs like Ajax or to a lesser extent PSV and Feyenoord. Primeira is pretty much the same. Crap league (or mediocre for your convenience) with a few good teams in it (Benfica, Porto, Sporting). 

It doesn't mean you're a crap fan if you follow such leagues or that Sporting are crap.

548~~~
I dont think that they are crap and actually Holland had proved it so. Clubs like United need to get off their high horse and start searching for players in such leagues just like clubs like Juventus do. For example Strootman would have been a much better option for us then Fellaini.


My concern with Rojo is not that he's shite but simply because the magnitude of the job may be too big for him. As said before if we're planning to use him as backup for Shaw then I am confident he'll make it. For all we know he may even send Shaw on the bench. However if we're expecting him to become our anchor in defense then the gap may be too big for him. FFS the job is bigger then the one given to Vidic when he signed with us. At least Vidic could rely on the likes of Gaz, Wes and Rio. All we have now is 4-5 injury prone defenders and Luke Shaw

<a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> I wonder what he thinks about this

549~~~
Well i agree with that. How can you pass this transition phases smoothly when you just lost two references in Vidic and Ferdinand? To help the existing circunstancies you also have a new manager. It will take time. Time that you simply don´t possess due to the nature of United being a very big club, with a very demanding fan base. He´s not going to sort all the defensive problems by himself but he is going to be a big help with his versatility, physical attributes and ability. Like i said previously Van Gaal will play a pivotal role in his adaptation and evolution.

550~~~
What worries me is that we're expecting a Maldini or at a lesser extent a Rio (ie someone whose a born leader and would just fix everything single handidly) and from what I saw, Rojo is not like that. Mind he's a technically gifted and tough tackling defender with pace. But in my opinion he's still work in progress just like the rest of our defenders.

551~~~
There are good players in those crap leagues just like there are good teams out there. Didn't Strootman play for PSV, team I highlighted as not crap from the water of crap teams? The league is crap but there are some decent players in the less crap or good teams that can prove their worth in the top leagues/teams.

As for Rojo, I don't think anyone believe he's going to be our Vidic from day 1. He's there as another body in defense and a decent first-team player for the time being. He fetched £16m which in todays market is a reasonable price for a talented player coming off a great World Cup performances. If you've got bad feelings about this one, just say so. Nobody says he's our saviour and he wasn't bought to be one. Expectations like this cause our fans to give the players hard time in latter stages of their careers. Signing him makes perfect sense, we've got a new CB as well as a good cover for left-back. Without him we'd have Reece James or Ashley Young (with all due respect as he had a good pre-season) covering for Shaw. What's not to like?

I'm done with this as I'm far from an expert on Rojo.

552~~~
Well i disagree. But people have different expectations of course. I´m 30 years of age and have been following our football since i was a little boy. I´m from Lisbon and the vast majority of my family are Sporting fans. There was an obvious family influence. The standart of football isn´t as good as the top european leagues (depending on the matches of course, games like Sunderland against Stoke are way worse than any Braga vs Guimarães match) but i wouldn´t call it crap. But i understand your point, i would just use other words to discribe the leagues. I think it´s just too depreciative. Just out of curiosity have you watched many matches of the portuguese/dutch leagues without the top clubs to make that claim?

553~~~
About 10 a season each.

554~~~
Just read a great article about third party ownership, Rojo and Doyen Group. Shit's crazy.

555~~~
Fair enough. I understood your points, i would just probably use other words to discribe the leagues. But your opinion is as good as mine in what concerns the personal tastes regarding the leagues. I guess for an Italian their league must be very good and for me i just don´t like that brand of football and rarely watch any game.

556~~~
I believe that the fans (and sometimes even the coaching staff) of clubs at the best leagues tend to underestimate the smaller leagues. I remember the popular concept by EPL fans a few years back was that La Liga was a 2 race horse league with Barcelona/Real being the top dogs and the others being shit. That concept swiftly changed when Athletic Bilbao schooled SAF's team in the UEFA cup. Mind I stress on the phrase clubs coming from the best leagues. I remember quite vividly AC Milan fans/club coaches being absolutely shocked that VG Ajax had managed to dominate them in the CL. The shock was so big that AC Milan just went full muppet mode and went on buying half Ajax team in the 2-3 years following that defeat (Reizeger, Davids, Bogarde, Kluivert)

557~~~
I think he won´t be backup LB for you guys. I doubt Van Gaal after all the hassle and the hefty price tag (plus Nani exchange) is going to use him as backup for Shaw. Since United´s defence is clearly struggling, he will put Rojo as CB. We will see how he goes. I think he can be a vocal leader and organize the defence. But it´s too soon for him. He can´t just enter and do that. There are other players with more years and fully adapted at United. What Rojo will instantly improve you is in terms of aerial ability and United´s defence will have a more aggressive stance. His contribution in set pieces is also an important asset.

558~~~
Please do. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

559~~~
I believe his addition means that we will continue using the 1-3-5-2 system. In a back four I do not believe he is better than Jones, Smalling or Shaw in their respective role. But, he may surprise me when he starts playing regularly for United. As a wingback or fullback, I hope he can become as influential as Zabaleta is at City in that position.

560~~~
is this the guy who played LM for argentina in the world cup? If it is, he impressed me massively back then.

561~~~
Why? I´m genuinely curious.

562~~~
In my opinion he should be bedded slowly as backup and then become first teamer at his own pace. Probably he would end up first teamer after a couple of weeks/months just as Evra did with United (we had the then fans favorite Heinze in that role). I wouldn't exclude if he ends up sending Shaw on the bench which kind of show that I dont see Rojo as crap.

What I am totally against is that he's seen as the leader/savior of our defense just as Stam and Rio were in SAF's reign. First of all I dont think that his maturity as a player is up to that level yet. Secondly because I believe that Rojo's task is actually more difficult than that of both Stam and Rio was when they joined United. Stam had Johnsen, Irwin and Gaz with him. Rio's task was slightly more challenging than that of Stam but he could still rely on Gaz. This defense has no leaders in it and is mostly made up of injury prone players

563~~~
Cause he hasn't seen him play?

564~~~
Left mid? No he didn't.

565~~~
I assume he doesn't know a single bit of English?

566~~~
Fair enough. Those are all United related points and i´ll take your word for it. I wasn´t aware that the level of expectations from United fans was reaching those heights. I do agree that he will try to enter United´s defence in harder circunstancies than Vidic. Also agree that Vidic was more mature and offered more guarantees than him. Vidic was just one of a kind.

567~~~
Ppl will moan either way. Imagine if the deal didn't happen because of issues between Sporting and Doyen. The same posters who are moaning about this signing would probably blame Woodward even if it hadn't been down to him. 

I mean Rojo only had to say he is happy at Sporting in his recent interview on Sporting TV and we already had posters here blaming Woodward for failing to sign him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's a lot of money yes (21 mil £ if you include Nani's wages), but if LvG wants a left footed CB then he was the best option available. I'd much rather have him than Vermaelen (who is never fit and would be on ridiculous wages). Hummels was never going to leave Dortmund, at least not this summer.

And if we do have the money I'd rather give some additional millions to a proper traditional club like Sporting (who we also have a great relationship with and who we bought Ronaldo from for a bargain as we know now), than keep it in Glazers' pockets.

And as we have seen in the past, buying or not buying a player for position x doesn't have anything to do in regards of buying a player for position y at United.

As past 5 seasons have shown, if we don't buy a midfielder it won't be because we spent a certain amount of money on Rojo, but because we somehow failed to identify and progress with enough alternatives/options for midfield again!

568~~~
I think you assume right. I don´t think he speaks a word of english. At least he hasn´t showed it yet. He always spoke in spanish. Even when we had foreign journalists covering Sporting affairs.

569~~~
LB. Maybe you are thinking of Perez who played a few games at LM and did fairly well?

570~~~
He does not look as commanding as a centerback, nor does he have the aerial proficiency to deal with set pieces or threats from that aspect of the games. As a fullback, he may be as good as Shaw at the moment, but from what I saw with Shaw at Southampton last season and Rojo in a fullback role, I do not believe Rojo has that burst of acceleration or pace that shaw has, which is an important factor for a maurading fullback. I believe his vision and technicality might be better than Shaw but for a fullback, I tend to believe crossing, pace and work ethic are the most important factor. Defensive nous is also part of the vital aspect. I can not say that Rojo is much better than Shaw with any of these aspect yet beside his technicality and vision.

571~~~
The situation is as present (other United fans can contradict me if they disagree). We just lost 3 leaders (Rio, Vidic and Evra) and we currently got 5 natural defenders (Rafael, Smalling, Evans, Jones, Shaw) . To beefen up the defense we had promoted a couple of youngsters (Blackett, Reece James and Keane) and wingers are swiftly being converted in wingbacks (Young and Valencia). From that list, nearly all our first team defenders are injured (Shaw, Rafael, Valencia and Evans). It also safe to say that Rafael, Jones and Evans are injury prone.

Whoever comes at United needs to bed in quickly. He must also be a leader as our defense has been leaking goals for quite some times (long before Vidic and co left the club) and because of injury the staff tend to change on a game to game basis. Hence why I said that Rojo is an underwhelming signing. He's a good defender in my books but what we need is a one man army whose capable to singlehandidly sort the defense by himself

572~~~
I deliberatly deleted Shaw from the quote. I won´t argue about the LB spot because although he was good for Argentina in that position in the WC, at Sporting he never convinced me. I just left Smalling and Jones. I´m sorry but aerial proficiency is one of his main assets. Better than Jones but that´s just my opinion. He will have to prove it when he starts playing in the premier league. He was an absolutely essencial player in offensive and defensive set pieces for Sporting and also Argentina. Our defence simply wasn´t as good and stable without Rojo in terms of aerial play. He was an essencial player. I don´t know if he has more pace or burst of acceleration than Shaw but he is a very quick and pacy player. If i was an United fan i wouldn´t worry about that or his physical attributes.

What does doesn´t look as commanding as a center back mean? I mean our other center back Maurício had the nickname "Sheriff" but both were commanding and vocal figures of our defence. In one of the toughest challenges last year against Porto twice (where Porto failed to score in both cup and league games) Rojo was an absolute rock and excellent in leading the line. Rojo is a center back period. He´s at his best at that position. Of course Van Gaal can put him as LB but that´s a waste of his talent. He is clearly better as CB. But perhaps if you elaborate your point i´ll understand it better.

573~~~
Good to know that he is capable of being a commanding figure and his aerial ability is not a flaw in his game. Hopefully, he will become a success at Old trafford. 
What would you say is a flaw to his game?

574~~~
This is the Tor-Kristian Karlsen article translated to English.
Just a few things to note first: I'm danish, so there's a few differences between the two languages which was kinda difficult for me to translate, also i've just come home from an 8-hour school day, so i apologize for any spelling and grammar mistakes i've made.

<b>United wanted Hummels, but gets Rojo. Should the United-fans be pleased?</b>
He’s not a player that the best clubs out there would choose if they get to pick any defender they wanted, but with that said there’s a couple of things that you can’t forget that makes this decision make more sense: Manchester United doesn’t play in the Champions League this season and because of that it’s unrealistic for them to attract players such as Hummels, Höwedes or Varane, just to mention a few of the names that’s being mentioned as ‘’statement signings’’.

Secondly it seems that Louis van Gaal has been very specific with his desire of acquiring a left footed central defender, who presumably will be used as the left sided central defender in a 3-man defense, and with that in mind the signing of Rojo begins to seem more logical.

In a 3-man defense the central defenders have to be more flexible and cover more towards the sidelines, than they’d have to do in a 2-man defense.

And as we saw during the World Cup I anticipate that Van Gaal wants at least one of his central defenders to have freedom to contribute offensively, and with these things in mind I think Rojo could fit in very well.

<b>United acquires a central defender, but is that good enough compared to their rivals?</b>
It might sound a bit strange, but I don’t think that a quality central defender would be the difference for Manchester to be a title contender or not.

Let’s not forget that Manchester City has won 2 league titles with just 1 quality central defender – Vincent Kompany – while those that has played alongside him – Nastasic, Lescott or Demichelis – has been considered as the weak spots for them. Liverpool were in the title race right to the finish line with rotation in their central defense, where all combinations was considered ‘unsatisfying’, and it’s not until now with Lovrens arrival that they seem to have found the answer.

I think what happens with Manchester United midfield and forward will be more decisive of how their season will go.

<b>What can you say about his strengths and weaknesses?</b>
First and foremost he’s a fast and move around very well, which is good qualities as a central defender when you have to press up high. Enthusiastic and intense in his style of play, reaches his opponents quickly and base his a lot of his effectiveness on reading the game and breaking in front of his opponent.

This style of play naturally doesn’t come without any risk, when you encounter as much as Rojo does – even without ‘insurance’ (back up) – it can be pretty ugly at times when he fails. He’ll have to work on his timing to not run into trouble in a league where the ball and players runs around as a flipper game.

Besides that he’s very willing to take part offensively, both from a wingback position, but also as a central defender. Even though he often does offensive runs, I haven’t noticed him contribute with a lot that’s resulted into goals and his left foot is more about power than precision.

As most argentine defenders he’s fearless, he loves duels – both as a wingback and aerial duels – so the physical aspect that’s often mentioned as a threat to newcomers in the Premier League won’t be a problem for him, I believe. As most of his fellow argentines he’s got a temper as well, but I don’t see that as a negative. The threshold for ‘’dirty tricks’’ and rough play is higher in the Premier League than other leagues and it’s often temperamental players from Latin-America that succeed in England.

<b>So where’s he best? As a pure wingback, in a 2-man central defense or as the left sided central defender in a 3-man defense?</b>
I think that when you add up all of his qualities, it’ll suit him very well to play as a central defender in a 3-man defense. In that system he’s allowed to play with high risk, contribute offensively and give his side an extra ‘dimension’ as the ‘’adventurous’’ central defender. As a wingback he loses a bit of the ‘edge’ that makes him a quite unique central defender.

You could say that Marcos Rojo is build as a central defender, but his style of play is like a wingback.

<b>Will he be able to grow more as a player under Louis van Gaal?</b>
Defender, especially central defender has a tendency to develop a lot later than players ahead of them on the field. That’s primarily because the key to good defending is all about reading the situation and being able to put yourself in the right spot. Rojo is as everyone knows not a ‘’talent’’ anymore, but there’s still room for him to adjust certain elements of his game. I like it a lot that he’s enthusiastic when he’s on the field, something that I consider as sign of willingness to learn.

<b>So all in all: A desperate buy or a good alternative?</b>
Time will tell whether the Argentine will be a success or not, but I don’t get the negativity that Manchester United fans feel about this transfer. Although it’s probably about the timing.
If the club had already bought a big name, Rojo could probably have been welcomed with open arms?

Perhaps Manchester United should’ve bought a central defender earlier, but I’d like to believe that the club management had identified a specific profile that they need in the squad and that Rojo was the one who ticked to most boxes accordingly.

I’ve been wrong before, but I’ve got a feeling that Marcos Rojo with his honest, enthusiastic, all action-type of play, has the potential to become a favourite on Old Trafford.

575~~~
Thanks Suggs, that was interesting.

576~~~
I gave an indepth opinion of Rojo in his transfer forum thread. My opinion comes from watching him in the portuguese league. I have been defending him but i understand the skepticism of United fans. United and english football will be a whole new level. Commanding a defence line of Cédric, Maurício and Jefferson against Rio Ave, is easier than commanding a line of Rafael, Johny Evans and Shaw against Liverpool. 

I´m not saying he will be a hit but i think that Rojo possess the right caractheristics for english football. Quick and strong physically. Excelent in the aerial game and capable of holding his own when facing counter attack tactical setups. In Portugal (except in the games against Benfica, Porto and Braga) every team plays that way. Having Rojo with his quickness is a big plus. Having Rojo in corner kicks and free kicks was an obvious advantage. Rojo´s versatility is also a plus. I mean he played mostly as CB but everytime there was an injury problem or an need for tactical change, Rojo is always the first to be ready to play multiple positions. He even played as DM once in the start of his Sporting career. And he wasn´t that bad. In a game, if United is chasing a result and going gung ho, Rojo is a very interesting player to have. With his quickness and positional sense, he was able of handling the whole left side of the defense (as CB/LB) as we changed sometimes to 3-5-2 when adopting a very offensive stance. What´s not to like in having a player as versatile as this? Who´s not injury prone and has the right caractheristics for english football. I´m willing to bet that for Van Gaal when you face teams like Stoke, besides De Gea, he will be the first player in the team sheet. United also needs this kind of players. Players that aren´t know by their finesse but that give their all and hussle when they have to hussle. Play hard when they face opponents that try to intimidate with their physical football. I think Van Gaal thought about all of this. It´s lovely to have players with Evans finesse but you also need warriors like Rojo. Because you face different kinds of opponents. And you have to be prepared for everything.

Rojo´s flaws have been highlighted plenty of times by me. His concentration lapses, occasional positional errors (perhaps explained by the fact that he changes positions alot) and dreadful disciplinary records are his major cons. He will also have to change his approach to referee´s. English refs aren´t as permissive as portuguese refs. He will get sent off alot if he doesn´t change his always complaining nature. Like i already said, Van Gaal will have to do alot of physicological work. England is completely new level and much demanding and difficult than Portugal.

577~~~
I'm afraid there is no single solution to any "cb mess'', ''midfield mess'' or any other mess which is why after signing Herrera we still need another midfielder . In central defence the time has come for the players we currently have to step up and be counted, particularly Evans and Smalling, because even if we do spend on a Marquee CB like Benatia he'd still need his partners to step up. Long story shot, this clamour for signings is protecting players from being held to account for their performances and inconsistencies, they should man up because we know, particularly Evans and Smalling, that they have in them and were counted on to take over the mantle from a highly acclaimed partnership. This is their chance and I hope they take it.

578~~~
Great in depth analysis. Looks like he is capable of making a name here at Manchester United.

579~~~
I think he will mate. I´m in this forum for the long run but i´d be willing to bet that Rojo will become a fan favourite at the end of the season. He´s the kind of player you like to have on your team (aslong as Van Gaal keeps doing Leonardo Jardim´s work of trying to improve his disciplinary woes).

580~~~
I have been a huge fan of our defensive set up of Jones - Smailling - Blackett. Blackett still lacks experience and will mostly be dropped out of three. I hope Rojo performance in this back three will be as good or better from what we saw from Blackett in pre-season.

581~~~
I see mate. I´m going to be honest i haven´t seen much of Blackett. I usually watch 80 to 90% of United´s games since i´m a big fan of english football but i missed the Swansea game due to a family party and just saw the pre season game against Real Madrid and bits of the game against Valência. I´m usually informed about United but this year i haven´t seen much yet.

582~~~

Excellent work. Thanks ! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

583~~~
To be fair, the part that has impressed about Blackett is his calmness on the ball, he hasn't really been tested much defensively since he came in the team.

584~~~
Very nice and informative. Thanks

585~~~
i dont know. I just remember somone being impressive down that left wing

586~~~
Any ideas on when he's having his medical?

587~~~
Hes supposed to have had the first part of the medical at Bridgewater last night and the second part at Carrington this morning. My guess is that the hold up are the personal terms to be finalized but that should be done today.

588~~~
I think he has been tested against many quality team this pre-season. He showed great positioning and reading of the game, which complement hard tacklers like Smailling and Jones. He did not look out of place like M. Keane when we played Real Madrid and he also help set our noteworthy goal conceded ratio this tour. He lacks experience, but he has shown maturity and solidarity in defense so far.

589~~~
Agreed, very interesting, and thanks for translating

590~~~
So you're basically dismissing Rojo because you haven't 'followed' him. You're dismissing something you know nothing about. And yes, im sure you devote a lot of time following other leagues. I bet you haven't watched more than ten games of each player last season.

591~~~

592~~~

593~~~
I loved the last Argentinian left footed centreback/leftback hybrid we had at the club a few years ago, even if he did leave us in bad terms so I'm looking forward to seeing Rojo.

594~~~
He just followed the official United twitter in last few minutes. Not that I'm maniacally checking twitter constantly.

Im not a betting man in that sense, but I know many people will claim to be experts on foreign leagues like they seriously have time to watch these players week in week out. Im skeptical.

598~~~
Looks a good player to me, happy with this business.

599~~~
I'm probably moaning for moaning sake but we really are slow to conclude transfers nowadays. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's slightly disheartening when we consider there's still significant strengthening needed and probably not enough time.

600~~~
Just watching his World Cup goal, all the summer I was trying to monitor Garay, would never have thought we'd end up with Rojo instead.

<a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a>  great coverage as always!

601~~~
People who think that the Portuguese, Dutch, French, etc. are crap and therefore there are no good players there are missing the point. Those leagues are at that level, not because of lack of good players, but because they are seller leagues (except for PSG in the recent years). What they do is take young or unknown players with potential and give them opportunity to develop. That's why you see so many world class players coming from those leagues. The EPL on the other hand is a buyer league - there is very limited opportunity for young/unknown players to make a name for themselves here.

602~~~
If this is our last signing of the summer then we should wait till deadline day and announce this signing then to keep spirits up.

603~~~
Apparently he and Aguero don't see eye to eye. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

Ohh he will wear the #5!

He's wearing the #5???????? That's not more than a minute after I say he shouldn't be given it. What a dark day in our history this is. All air gone out of me now. Feels like i need to go vomit.

Here's Successful's original post from another thread:

638~~~
I like that Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo have their full name on the back of their kit, very continental and sophisticated. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

640~~~
Ander is wearing his full name too.

Must be some new fad.

641~~~
Most players we buy do. It really is their greatest moment

Which is why potentially signing Di Maria worries me. We never buy cast offs (not without trying of course)

642~~~
He's got some arms on him.

643~~~
According to Rojo, United were always his club...

644~~~
"United were always my club."

645~~~
The sheer number of tattoos on him is ridiculous.

646~~~
Better than Rooney's.

647~~~
Is not wanting to give away our best numbers to average signings trolling???? Jesus, this place is sinking. I'm not on my own on this one and I believe we as a club deserves better. It's not only the number - it's also a freaking way to let the supporters know we're now done with transfers regarding central defenders, and we just lost 3 of our best ever defenders this summer!!!!!!!!!!!

648~~~
Ah I'm all excited now, best of luck to him!

649~~~
Why?

650~~~
Apparently we've always been his club, which is good to hear.

651~~~
So, will he be ready for Sunday? Lets hope so...

652~~~
Well everytime I have bought a shirt I haven't paid for the number of letters, but I think around 7 £ for the name and further 7 £ for the shirt number. That was a CL shirt a while ago. Maybe they have changed it now.

If we sign a very good midfielder who can come into the team straight away, it'll be ok.

I take it RVP isn't one of our best players then since he isn't number 9, or Vidic when he wore 15.

658~~~
Funny that, because you were referring to him as "unknown" in his Transfer Forum thread. An "unknown player from a third rate league" was what you said, now your claiming to watch that 'third rate league' fairly frequently? I think like most on here you've watched little to nothing of him, probably just the WC games and because he isn't a big name or from a big club, you're assuming that he won't be good enough. Give him a chance. He's unlikely to be coming here as Buttner's replacement either. I'd be willing to bet that if all of our CBs stay fit he will challenge Smalling for a regular spot in the CB trio with Evans moving central and Jones on the right.

659~~~
It doesnt matter, people know better than coaches and scouts and other people actually employed in football.

660~~~
Now that it's fully official. Welcome to Manchester United Marcos Rojo! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

661~~~
We've already had Valencia as our number 7 and currently have Phil Jones and Evans at 4 and 6. None of these players are superstars. Rojo at 5 is hardly dragging the club through the mire.

662~~~
Must be shite like Buttner than huh?

663~~~
Good signing, let's hope he is the first of a few more this week and a half though.

664~~~
He seems to have bad skin. This is a dark day in the history of our club.

665~~~
There's vomit on your sweater already, mum's spaghetti.

666~~~
Thought his interview was on MUTV? I'm watching Cristiano Ronaldo score a 40 yard free kick at the Emirates? Was it a quick one, no reaction from Irwin, Big Ron etc?

667~~~
You seriously need to have a look at yourself.

668~~~
If Moyes made this signing, I'd of had doubts.. But knowing LVG gave the go ahead fills me with confidence.

669~~~
10/10 would read again

670~~~
It was only a couple of minutes.

671~~~
I bet you he'll be very successful here.

672~~~
Nope, it was literally a couple of questions and that was that.

673~~~
Have another notification.

674~~~
He's a good looking lad in fairness. I'd say the Manchester United wimmin' fans will like him anyways.

675~~~
Vidic came here as a nobody and could easily have changed number as he earned his fame. Probably waited too long and then his name became bigger than the number. Kind of the same thing as with Ronaldo and Beckham in madrid, they didn't need the number all that much as their names were worth more. RVP had no other choice and he's also explained to everyone why he's not switching to no.9.

676~~~
Yaya toure wears 42 for City, Schweinsteiger wears 31 for Bayern, they must all be average players as well

677~~~
When does his interview start? United - Arsenal '09 on MUTV

678~~~
I'd recommend a mirror or anything shiny.

He looks chuffed to bits and this in turn makes me happy. Let's hope we don't have another Argentinian heart break.

679~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

680~~~
Nice to see him get Rio's shirt, good stuff, hope he does well.

681~~~
It was on for about 2 minutes my guess it will be on again either half way through the current programme or after it finishes

682~~~
It's already gone. It was only 3 minutes.

683~~~
It's over, it was literally two minutes.

684~~~
Did he give his interview in English? Not that we don't have enough Spanish speaking people to make life easier for him.

685~~~
Spanish.

686~~~
Nope, it was in Spanish.

687~~~
Nope, Spanish.

688~~~
Oh well, Spanish should be United's second language now anyways.

689~~~
Rojo, awesome. Can we have a CM next please.

690~~~
Ah, okay. I'll have to find a link later.

691~~~
I've uploaded it, but Dailymotion seems to not be working properly at the moment.

Here it is anyway for whenever it decides to work;

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x245cc8?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

692~~~
One down, five to go.

Seriously though, we need five more players.

693~~~
Another player added to the Spanish-speaking clique.

Can't wait for those selfies.

694~~~
Was hoping you'd get my hint <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Thanks a lot.

695~~~
Got a good feeling about him even if on first glance it seems a bit of an underwhelming signing considering we've been linked with Hummels and Benatia.

Two more players of sufficient quality and I'll be content until January.

696~~~
I continued watching MUTV, 25 games unbeaten in the champions league during the 2009 season. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Makes me so sad right now.

697~~~
Feels like a Heinze of a signing, hopefully without the later prat moves. Not seen much of him outside the World Cup but from what people are saying he's tough and likes to put the foot in. I like it.

698~~~
For anyone who has stated the word underwhelming in their comment about this signing, I have this to say:

What an underwhelming comment. 


Seems like a typical United signing. Essence of Heinze, Vidic, Evra in this. Really excited that he's a tough tackler. Replace those softies in the team we currently have! Can't wait to see him. Think he will play this weekend?

699~~~
Rio and Vidic together were a real asset together. Our attack was a muppets delight too. Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney, Giggs and Scholes still youngish, Carrick five years younger.. the list goes on. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

700~~~
He is like a slightly better looking Chris Smalling with shit hair and tattoos!

Welcome Rojo the red!

701~~~
The way I see it these days, as long we he can give us top quality service while he's here for at least three seasons then i'll be ok with whatever happens after that. Loyalty unfortunately is not the name of the game anymore.

702~~~
Not that it matters but has anyone indicated how much we'll be paying him?

703~~~
He looks a right hard bastard.

704~~~
Ollysgotawoody <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

705~~~
how do you pronounce his name ?
Ro Jo. Ro Ko, Ro Yo ?

706~~~
Rojo + smalling? swap back to a back 4 with shaw and rafael as fullbacks?

707~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.forvo.com/word/rojo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.forvo.com/word/rojo/</a>

708~~~

709~~~
Thanks for that ! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

710~~~
Very convenient that he asked him AFTER we signed him eh !

711~~~
He looks like the love child of Smalling and Herrera.

712~~~
There's an absolute ton of this nonsense flying about in every media outlet today. Yes, he isn't a stellar name and he may well be second choice but it's squad depth we very much need. I'm happy with the signing, I just hope we aren't done.

713~~~
I thought it was Ro-Ho?

714~~~
Am sure he's an Arsenal fan, like John Cross.

715~~~
He's a Villa fan.

716~~~
They're all still bitter about Bruce's winner against Sheffield Wednesday in 1993. They really believe they would have won the league if not for that. Delusional Cnuts.

717~~~
It's a joy to see so much enthusiasm and inner pride. These are qualities you can't buy for money.

718~~~
Like Huan Mata?

719~~~
What I saw during the World Cup from Rojo, was miles better than what I saw on Saturday.

720~~~
Pretty smart of him to mention Veron and not Heinze or Teveth

721~~~
Yes like Ho-naldo or Ho-naldinho. I think even the right way of saying Ra-mires is Ha-mires.

722~~~
Can you really judge a player based on a World Cup performance, though?

Diego Costa looked like a total scrub there but we know he's a great player. To be honest, no one here likely even knew who Rojo was until the World Cup where he was good but nothing spectacular that made you think he's destined for the top.

Is it not strange that not a single other big club seemed to be after him? I don't want to dismiss him before he's kicked a ball for us but by most accounts from people who've seen him regularly they say he's pretty average.

723~~~
He was teammates with Veron at Estudiantes.

724~~~
Surely you realised that I did exactly that? I judge a player based on what I saw and found that it was better than Saturday. I cannot see what your issue is with what I said.

Whether that potential is realised in the EPL, remains to be seen.

725~~~
This shit that "no one other club is after him club so Im skeptical about him or I think he is shit" needs to stop. That is the most pointless ideology. Is anyone else after Vidal right now? It looks like we are the ones even linked with him. Does that mean he is shit?

726~~~
Oh, makes sense.

727~~~
Judging from reports, we are the only club who is after Vidal. Does that make him average?

728~~~
He's got quite a lovable face like Chich.

729~~~
Didn't LvG comment on Rojo having a bright future? I trust his judgement and I'm certain that someone as meticulous as him wouldn't ascribe the prediction for someone whom lacked the necessary tools to be a complete success

730~~~
Vidal has been linked with various big clubs before though. Right now, most of our competitors are full up in terms of midfielders anyway.

731~~~
He's destined to be big here. I can feel it. It's always the underwhelming "who are they?" signings that work best at United. We always flop if we go for Mr Big except RVP.

732~~~
Probably explains why we ain't got no one!

733~~~
"You shouldn't buy players based on their World Cup performances" is one of those clichés that actually has a lot of merit.

I've seen a lot of people rate Rojo based on the WC. Personally, I didn't think he looked all that good in the games I saw. I'm not gonna judge him based on those games either way though. He wasn't even playing in his best position! It really tells us very little about his potential.

734~~~
Wonder if he'll be accepted to the newly-founded 4-man-Spanish-speaking-club ( because they didn't accept Valencia for some reason ) or will he be rejected because of that #5 shirt.

735~~~
This would have been especially easy to do, considering he didn't play last Saturday. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

736~~~
Are Arsenal and Chelsea big enough clubs for you to be linked with? 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/chelsea-transfer-gossip-argentina-left-back-marcos-rojo-linked-with-move-to-stamford-bridge-9591524.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...ked-with-move-to-stamford-bridge-9591524.html</a>

737~~~
Of course he would, he's now a united player so of course he's going to say nice things about him. Didn't he also say something along the lines that Cleverley is " still young and can learn".

738~~~
Chicharito's face is more innocent looking though. Rojo is a bit more rough round the edges. A loveable rogue. I think his playing style is going to suit that description also.

739~~~
"Asked <b>somebody who has watched him a lot</b>"


Why post tweets like this.. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

740~~~
Cleverley is an inherited product....... Rojo is a van Gaal purchase. 

He's not going to sign a player he doesn't <i>genuinely </i>believe will improve the team or fit to his philosophy.

741~~~
He looks the sort that our fans will love. And opposition fans will hate!  <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

743~~~
Technique wise he is clearly far better than both Jones and Smalling with the ball at feet. He's lightening fast and good in the air. Only worry seems to be his discipline which is appalling by the look of it.

744~~~
Have a feeling he will become a big player for United over the next few years, good luck to him.
As to those already moaning , hope you eat your words, spoilt your day cos you can't say we've signed nobody for 2 months any more.
Oh forgot we need another 5 players<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>, so 9 this year <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

745~~~
Too right

746~~~
Gonna be a cult hero this one.

747~~~
I don't think his disipline will be a problem at all. The only problem I see With him is that he is a bit rash at pressing and can be played past, but that can't be to hard to fix (a bit like Luiz, but not that out of position). I didn't see that at the WC as I have seen for Sporting, so it might be ok.

Other than that, he is a brilliant defender and if he keeps his positioning and rash play at bay, he will be a real fans favorite. He is really a great player, I think he and Jones can be a great pairing and forwards will dread meeting those two, they know they will be in for a hard time. It's usually attackers going at defenders, but this could be the other way around <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

748~~~
Thank you very much everyone for the great welcome to the biggest club of all more than happy with this ... <a class="externalLink" href="http://t.co/dlW6CPpr0I" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://instagram.com/p/r75BYrxSzb/</a>

749~~~
Exactly

750~~~
Imagine Jones or Smalling even trying to do that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

751~~~
Just watched his interview etc, he looks genuinely excited to be at the club. Looking forward to seeing him play.

752~~~
I don't know if it's weird or gay or sth, but I already noticed it after WC final when he was crying there. Like he really does have a bad skin.

753~~~
Huge number to take on, best of luck to the guy. Any chance we will see him on Sunday?

754~~~
I'm sure he will be in the squad, no idea if he will start though.

755~~~
It's time to Rock n Rojo ! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">too soon? too late?</span>

756~~~
Because Valencia has serious trouble smiling and our 4-men Spanish boy band smile all the time! Rojo will therefore fit in there straight away!

757~~~
You never know how things will turn out but he seems to want to be at Man Utd genuinely and passionately and I can always accept that!

758~~~
I picked up on that too, sometimes you can just sense when they are reading from the PR script but with Rojo, it does seem genuine. Could be off the mark but just the feeling that comes across.

759~~~
I have never claimed that though, I barely watch any match not involving united these days as am short on time. The reason I have followed those two careers is because I signed them on a game called soccermanager where the ratngs depend on their real life performance.(and yes its as nerdish as it sounds 
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

760~~~
Any idea how many Twitter followers he gained following his move to United? I remember Herrera's followers doubling after his move.

761~~~
Surely he'll go with just "Rojo" on the back of the shirt. Someone needs to have a word with Herrera too, drop that whole name business. 

Think he'll be bad ass. If he progresses well he could be come a leader figure at the back, certainly not timid or laid back, not during the World Cup anyway.

762~~~
Do you guys remember that Kolo / Yaya Toure song that City / Pool fans chanted last season?


We could change it to Marco(s) Ro-ho...whilst it's an annoying chant, it's bloody catchy.

763~~~
He had 16k two months ago, now he is over 1 million.

764~~~
Good lord...

765~~~
Glad it's a done deal. Hope he can be playing ASAP, excited to see him in action.

766~~~
Hes unknown in terms of not being a player many would know about and the portuguese league is below the EPL/German/Spanish league and the Serie a/french league

I followed lisbon when it became evident that we were interested in calvalho.

Regarding the last part i explained it in latter posts. Im more concerned about the magnitude of the job then the talent of the player.

767~~~

768~~~
Can't believe the name on the shirt says Marcos Rojo. Why not just Rojo, it sounds and looks much better. Same with Herrera.


Stupid rant over.

769~~~
We have much greater problems than that.

770~~~
As all boy bands have the slightly rough one, he will fit in right away! I think he will be a fan favourite too, I'm already liking his enthusiasm. I love a bruiser as well!

771~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/inside-track-rojos-rise-reds-7645524" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...all-news/inside-track-rojos-rise-reds-7645524</a>

772~~~
He played in the World cup final!

Seems a very fearless and confident guy.

773~~~
I've thought about this shit myself. Two perfectly good last names on their own without the extra lettering of their first names! Rant over

774~~~
Wonder if we will throw in straight in regardless of not really having been able to train with us or if we won't see him until next week

775~~~
I think it depends on how bad LVG found our CB's last game. I guess he'll go with the usual, not fit or ready in my system stuff and not play him yet.

776~~~
<insert joke about a wet windy night at Stoke here>

777~~~
As I said to Sly. I fear that the job is bigger than the one Rio and Stam had when they joined with us. I mean Rio and Stam had experienced heads to allow them to bed in and share the responsibility. Out of the 6 first team defenders we have, 4 are injury prone (Smalling, Rafael, Evans and Jones) and the other is a 19 year old fresh from Saints.

778~~~
and he's injured

779~~~
Will he be ready to play this weekend? Cannot wait to see him on the field for us.

780~~~
True, that or we play him on the left potentially, as shaw is injured, instead of a winger.

781~~~
I think if we play 3-4-1-2 we'll use Young as LWB and Rafael as RWB. Should LVG decide to play a back-four I can see Rojo starting as LB.

782~~~
Would love to see him sooner rather than later too.  I know he doesn't know the system, but I can't help but think he would be an instant improvement on what we have right now when you look at the space Swansea managed to generate for the first goal, this guy seem a little more turned on in that respect and may well have had a better shot at stopping that happening.

783~~~
I think if he is ready he will start at LCB and James at LWB for a away game with Rafael at RWB.

784~~~
He has often played in this type of system, it's probably where he is best suited.

785~~~
Well then, get him on the bloody pitch on sunday!

786~~~
When everyone is fit, I would like to see LvG change to a back four with Shaw LB and Rojo left side central defender. Young is a liability in defence, regardless of how he played on the US tour - he cannot defend.

787~~~
The Moyes effect has traumatised the CAF. We have lost one game but its convinced everyone that we need to sign the finished article in every position or else we're gonna crumble.

I only saw Rojo in the World Cup really but he looked good to me. He's young, he'll develop and learn. He has the same profile as the likes of Evra and Vidic when they came to United. Why are people panicking?

Like you say Sults, he doesn't seem like a shrinking violet. People forget how good Argentina were defensively in the World Cup (probably because going forward they were awful for the most part). This lad knows how to keep a clean sheet. I'm really pleased with his signing.

Plus it means the Argentina chant is probably back. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

788~~~
Does he speak any English at all?

789~~~

790~~~
The color formattig of red (Rojo in spanish) is:

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/wiki/Colores_HTML"><span style="text-decoration: underline">HTML</span></a> #E<b>60</b>0<b>26</b>
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/wiki/Modelo_de_color_RGB"><span style="text-decoration: underline">RGB</span></a> (r,g,b)B (<b>23</b>0, 0, <b>38</b>)

Note that the numbers 60, 26, 23 and 38 is marked in bold. That would mean these are the most likely shirt numbers which means that there is a 25% chance that either Cleverly or Kagawa is leaving the club. We might then assume it is 26, Kagawa that is leaving, then we find out that the color code #E26000 is Orange, this means he will be going to The Netherlands! While the color code for 23000 is still in the red scale. Do we have another transfer confirmed?

791~~~
Tbh not many people have a chance with Wazza anyway.

792~~~
I dont know if he speaks English but he seems to understand Rooney.

793~~~
El Ronyero!

794~~~
No better man than Rooney to Rojo show him the ropes. Great to see.

795~~~
Isn´t Van Gaal going to buy another defender?

796~~~
Rooney looking like a captain in that photo. Good to see.

797~~~

"And now successfully passing the ball to a teammate. Big whoop, I can do that too!"

799~~~
Strange seeing Rojo on united´s training gear but nice to see Rooney helping him settle. I´m sure Rojo understands scouse eh. If it wasn´t for the refusing to train incident, i would genuinely wish him luck. On the other hand, i can´t stay mad at him. He´s paying our pavilion and gave us Nani! You guys wouldn´t believe the euphoria amongst our supporters with Nani´s arrival. It´s kind like when you guys were hoping Ronaldo would rejoin you except he didn´t. If only Madrid would loan him and pay his wages.

800~~~

801~~~
He should probably change that marcosrojoscp to marcosrojomufc

802~~~
why do people care for the name on the back of his shirt? If it is now Rojo or Marcos Rojo, who cares. It is not like some of you wanted to buy the shirt. If it helps to settle in and feel more comfortable, i am all for it. He and Ander had it like that at previous clubs too, so even if it looks a bit shit, i dont know why people are offended.

803~~~
<i>When kush finally hits you.</i>

804~~~
Fred the red also wears full name on his shirt.

805~~~
People just trying to find something to moan about.

806~~~
It is typical for South American/Latin players to have their name listed fully, so I don't understand either what the big deal is.

807~~~
Its been a day and Rojo has been nominated to do the ASL Ice bucket challenge by Mata. Welcome to Manchester lad.

808~~~
Time to give di maria a call rojo!

809~~~

810~~~
Clever by Mata, may as well get used to being wet and cold as fast as possible.

What does the shirt of de Gea says? D something, can't make it. Heard he's into death metal, to check some of his favourites.

Great news. 

He didn't nominate Di Maria! Agent Rojo needs to learn a thing or two from De Gea.

821~~~
Hope Evans is fit. Last thing he needs is playing with Smalling and Jones in his first game.

822~~~
He should have been on an absolute WUM and went "i would like to nominate arturo vidal, Angel di maria Matts hummels and Edd Woodward, You have 24 hours lads"

Add the above to 21 yellows and 4 reds in 49 games and it seems United and LVG have to be on their toes. Wonder how true the court case story is?

826~~~
Sell him!

827~~~
Haha! wouldn't go that far. The way I've heard sporting fans talk about him is encouraging, as is the way he looked solid in the WC. The fact he wound up Aguero and (allegedly) traded blows with him makes United v City even more interesting. But surely LVG and United knew about the court case, if it is actually true?

828~~~
Problem is there are other Herrera's playing around the world e.g. Hector Herrera playing for Porto in Portugal.

829~~~
Will he be starting Sunday?

830~~~
Yea I was joking. It might be true. Sounds legit.

Apparently yes he's expected to start in the back three, so thats him taking Tyler Blacketts place alongside Jones and Smalling.

831~~~
To be fair, I did hear that. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

832~~~
Because as you say it looks rubbish. Untidy.

833~~~
Why the hell would that be a problem?
There's only one Herrera at United.

834~~~
It is a bit strange as his shirt was just "Rojo" when he was at Sporting.

835~~~

836~~~
Weird, I had read that he had apologised and was even back in training with Sporting before we got him.

837~~~
Oh bless him on his own <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

He just became my new favourite.

838~~~
That's what he's talking about. He's saying they asked him to apologize, which he did.

839~~~
I would suggest asking the money guys or it might even be a personal preference but I know people generally like to differentiate, to be unique so to say.

840~~~
A few people in the Fellaini thread won't be happy about Rojo.  He has something of the night about him.

841~~~
Did he speak english?

842~~~
No. He spoke spanish.

843~~~
LVG said he doesn't speak any English.

844~~~
van Gaal said Rojo doesn't have a worken permit yet. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

845~~~
How does he not have a work permit? I thought they usually sort that out with little fuss in cases like these. fecking ridiculous.

846~~~

847~~~
Yeah, didn't he need one to play for Sporting?

848~~~
Nothing is easy these days.

849~~~
Lmfao.. A slight glimmer of hope quickly shut down by fecking work permit issues. Have we EVER signed a player only to have them not able to play due to a work permit?

850~~~
I think Rojo is the most enthusiastic signing I've ever seen! <a class="externalLink" href="http://instagram.com/p/sArgDERS7F/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">He's already having his family dress up in United gear. </a>

851~~~
I approve of his wife.

852~~~

853~~~
Yeah, he used to do that with Sporting kits. His parents, his little girl and sometimes his wife. Did he get called up for this weekend game?

854~~~
No work permit yet apparently.

863~~~
No work permit ffs. Are the border force going to storm carrington?

864~~~
Pfft, work permits. Can he not play his first game cash-in-hand?

865~~~
He's been training hasn't he, Doesn't that constitute as work? I'm getting on the blower..

866~~~
I think he might play in midweek, van Gaal said he'll use a different team than the one he uses in the weekend. We could also end up seeing Powell, Wilson, Keane and a few other youth players starting this game.

867~~~
Surely there has to be a customary chant like "Ro-Ho, Ro-Ho, it's off to work we go" or some BS like that with his name, should be an easy one to come up with chants for

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

875~~~
Loan him back to Sporting. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

876~~~
That would seem a bit ridiculous if true. He's played in 28 internationals since 2011, that's got to be there or thereabouts to fit into the played in 75% of games when available rule?

I'd hazard a guess and say there were maybe 35 international fixtures over that period.

877~~~

878~~~
Why just us? Loads of teams have bought non-EU players. None seem to be having these issues. It just adds to the sense that the club is being run by people who haven't got a clue.

879~~~
I don't get why he would need a new work permit, he's come from Portugal which is in the EU and one would think that the right to work in Portugal would carry over to here

880~~~
It's not just us. Any team signings players who don't hold EU passports has to go through these procedures.

881~~~
UK has different law regarding this. Much easier to import a player to pretty much any other league in Europe than Premier League.

882~~~
Yeah, I thought the same thing yesterday. We haven't really got this right-to-work thing sorted yet, have we? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

883~~~
Some players have received work permits with much less of an international pedigree, it would be scandalous if he didn't get one. He played in the world cup final just a few weeks ago for Christ's sake.

Edit: Hadn't heard about this court case stuff. Bloody hell...

884~~~
The permit delay has nothing to do with the court case, I hope?

885~~~
geez so its basically So who will play as centreback tomorrow? Mike Keane - Jones - Blackett or Thorpe or is Evans ready?

886~~~
Yes but most other clubs have the relevant legal work done to ensure the work permits aren't rejected. Fernando was playing for City within a week of signing, wasn't he? It just feels like United post-Gill has been run shabbily on the football side.

887~~~
That's because he has a Portuguese passport. Rojo only has Argentinian passport and these things could take a while, absolutely nothing on our side we could have done to avoid it, procedures are set in motion once you've signed the player.

888~~~
I imagine it could well be.

889~~~
I can totally understand him not being given a work permit if he's awaiting trial for a violent crime.

890~~~
A guy earning 60k a week can't get a work permit, but Jihadist fighters can return to the country and resume their lives. #UKLogic

891~~~
Isn't it a bank holiday in the UK today?

892~~~
What court case,can someone enlighten me?

893~~~
Apparently he threatened someone with a bottle back in Argentina. Or something along those lines. Happened a few years back.

894~~~
Yeah

895~~~
He is alleged to have smashed a glass bottle on someones head.

896~~~
I wouldn't put it past the current lot running our club but you'd hope that they weren't so incompetent that they wouldn't have checked for any work permit difficulties before completing the transfer.

897~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Bit of a nutter, is Roho

898~~~
Let's assume he fails to get a work permit on appeal, what happens? Is the transfer done and you'll have to loan him out or can you still pull out of the transfer?

899~~~
Probably some scouser,had it coming.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

900~~~
Must. not. bite.

901~~~
I'm doing you a favour and going to have a cup of tea.

902~~~
Well there you go. Court case is irrelevant. Can't get a work permit with nobody at the home office to sign it off.

903~~~
This is probably all it is. The journos would be making a bigger deal of it otherwise.

904~~~
Rojo's missus.. she is smoking.

905~~~
Please do. I'd like to know how my point is invalid.

906~~~
He's unlikely to have put that on his CV.

907~~~
How did he not get a work permit? He is a starter for Argentina.

908~~~
She's stunning.

909~~~
Him and RVP have the best looking birds in the United squad imo.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.boxofficefootball.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Marcos-rojo-babe.jpg" src="http://www.boxofficefootball.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Marcos-rojo-babe.jpg"/>

910~~~
Has any reliable source reported that a work permit has been rejected? And how long does it take to get one for footballers? I thought not more than 2-3 days ...

911~~~
And DDG!!

912~~~
So he smashed a bottle on someone...Can't he just give them 10k or something and settle?

913~~~
We really need to start greasing the wheels in these situations.

914~~~
Convince the UK government not to have a bank holiday the last Monday in August?

Might be tricky...

915~~~
RVP? We've got a very different taste then

916~~~
Oh my days!!! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

917~~~
I think it is obviously very early to judge the player when he didnt feature a single minute for us but he may be played in midfield as well, more precisly as an anchor man. Hes got loads of energy and would do De Jong for us or more technically gifted Jones.. but it is just an early guess. I can't stand Cleverley-Fletcher midfield anymore...

918~~~
Im guessing you haven't see David De Gea's girl, Edurne!

919~~~
Also thank you once again to Agent Marcos for helping us sign Di Maria.

920~~~
Don't get it. She's ugly. Looks like Morticia Addams with big breasts.

921~~~
Where is his work permit? Or am I missing something?

922~~~
Is he eligible for tonight does anybody know? Or are we still waiting on permit?

923~~~
This.

924~~~
The standard of this forum really has plummeted recently.

925~~~
She isn't all that..

926~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously, though, I've had three negative responses to that comment. I'd be genuinely interested to know how it is a 'wrong' or even controversial statement.

927~~~
Mate you're coming across pointy elbows. She's really not that bad, at all.

928~~~
She's very good looking. <a class="username" data-user="77131, @MTR" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77131/">@MTR</a> is just jealous.

929~~~
What's happenning with the work permit. For flips sake, one would think before Woodward signed him that the permit would have been sorted.

If we go into the weekend without him we are going to be shockingly short of quality defenders except Blackett who has been good.

Defence with Rojo should be 

Jones Rojo Blackett

If the permit isn't sorted then it's

Jones Evans Blackett   

I hope the permit is sorted because the above would be shocking.

930~~~
Yup. He wants Rojo all to himself, cheeky fecker.

931~~~
Wonder if LvG will give us an update on the work permit. What happens if he doesn't get a work permit? does it mean that we have to loan him out before he actually plays a game for us?

932~~~
With Rojo in, our strongest defence will be:

Jones - Evans - Rojo


Edit- but with that said, Di Maria signifies a move towards a 4 man defence now and hopefully we'll be seeing this soon:

933~~~
Evans? 

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

934~~~
Because we don't care if they take a day, a week or a month to get their work permit. We're hyper-sensitive about our own players though.

935~~~
Really? We're going to judge him on last night? He's been our best centre back for a long time now.

936~~~
Not really.

937~~~
How long? Vidic was our best until he left and Jones has been better all season.

938~~~
So what are the chances of this guy getting his permit for saturday?  Would love to see him starting with Di Maria to have both their debuts, think it could give our whole performance a bit of a lift.

939~~~
Why aren't we making it a priority to get his permit sorted...especially after the shambolic show from the backline we had last night.

940~~~
His work permit couldn't possibly be a problem or I think we'd see more of a fuss being made about it in the media.

941~~~
It should be sorted shouldn't it? I was under the assumption that the reason Rojo's wasn't was that Monday was a bank holiday, but there are three clear working days between MK Dons and the next game

942~~~
Vidic hasn't been near his best since his injury, lost much. Evans had better stats than him last year also. Evans has been really good, and were brilliant the season before the last one.

The problem with Evans is that he usually do a couple of big mistakes every year, not consistent enough...

943~~~
A declining Vidic was still superior to a prime Jonny Evans. Evans is the definition of ordinary.

944~~~
It's a bit worrying that it hasn't been sorted. Or it has and just hasn't been reported anywhere?

945~~~
News coming in that Rojo has been granted his work permit and is available for selection against Burnley.

946~~~
[Citation needed]

947~~~
Before I get excited, this needs to be confirmed.

948~~~
Does he have experience in a back 3?

949~~~
No source of note has posted the Rojo news, it's all fake ITK's and imitation accounts.

950~~~
im trying to find viable sources. Its all over twitter. Im looking though.

951~~~
Would be bizarre if he still isn't ready for Saturday.

952~~~
Anyone saw this ?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/563861/20140825/manchester-united-news-marcos-rojo-face-prison.htm#.U_4tWvl_tmw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/5638...news-marcos-rojo-face-prison.htm#.U_4tWvl_tmw</a>

953~~~
<img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/> He wouldn't be allowed to move out of Argentina if he was facing a prison sentence..

954~~~
Edit: Hmm apparently was duped. Said it in a later tweet.

955~~~
There was a spell where if you saw his name on the teamsheet you'd crap your pants.
We've moved a long way on from that, but he'll never be a top defender to me. He looks to have the kind of strength and pace I could test him on!

That shocking defending last night wasn't rustiness, it was plain ridiculous. Since when do you try and pass a ball out through your box when a guy is 10cm in front of you.
He's always had a ricket in him that one.

956~~~
The source he's using is an unofficial account. I doubt FIFA would have the inside track on a UK government decision. Their only role is overseeing registration transfers, not immigration law in different countries.

957~~~
Ideal. Means if we do decide to go 4-3-3 now with Di Maria, we actually vaguely have a left back while Shaw is out.

958~~~
Yeah just saw his later tweet which says he was duped. so annoying.

959~~~
Feck sake, it better be approved soon.

960~~~
Yeah, that's not a good source. It's not real, which is worrying. I really wish people would check before rushing in here.

961~~~
Need to relax a little mate. We are all in the same boat looking for some good news about his work permit. Its an easy mistake which is made and can be made by anyone.

962~~~
humble apologies for "rushing in" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

963~~~
Yeah, I was a little harsh, sorry. It's really baffling though, surely it must be sorted by saturday.

964~~~

965~~~
2 things to be sorted out then. Probably won't be in time for Burnley like this.

966~~~
The beef is between Sporting and that investment group that gave them the money to buy Rojo. Nowt to do with us. He signed here and is 100% ours.

967~~~
This is very frustrating.

968~~~
Rather annoying that all the details haven't been sorted out yet. Even more so when we are short of defenders right now

969~~~
He has acquired a work permit,according to Man Utd Insiders.

970~~~
"Acquired" makes it sound well dodgy. Got it off some bloke in the pub did he?

971~~~
Sweet - can't wait to see him play!

972~~~
I´m sure he´ll prove to be a great buy for us but I remember the early days of Vidic and Evra so we have to be patient with this lad. He won´t be Mr Fantastic from the start off I think

973~~~
Odd. Why won't we announce something like that ?

974~~~
For those wondering why the work permit wasn't sorted out before we signed him, how do you imagine that would happen when he wasn't our player then?

975~~~
They should call it "turd" party ownership … it gets so messy!

976~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

977~~~
On a roll today. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

978~~~
Are we gonna have to give this one back to the shop?

979~~~
you won't find a better place than the caf where patience is a virtue of the (very) few

980~~~
We're in a bit of trouble if it isn't sorted before Burnley. Smalling, Rafael and Shaw injured, no Rojo, Evans isn't match fit. That leaves Jones as the only remotely experienced defender and only unproven youngsters as back up or at full back. What a mess.

981~~~
Let's not pretend we weren't expecting Rafael, Smalling and Evans to be injured. The club knows our defenders are made of glass. In fact, I'm shocked Jones isn't on the treatment table either.

982~~~
Doyen on the move?

983~~~
Is currently in Madrid and still not got his permit as per LVG's presser.

984~~~

985~~~
LvG saying he is in Argentinian [Madrid] Embassy working on his permit (seems like he was saying he was working in the embassy for his work permit - weird i know). Issue being that he has an Argentinian passport where as ADM has an Italian passport.

986~~~

987~~~
Why Madrid though? What didn't he go to the Argentinian embassy in the uk?...also how does it take nearly two weeks to get a permit, I can't remember this ever happening another player.

988~~~
It's not as if he qualifies under exceptional talent...

989~~~
He played in a World Cup final. We've got permits for non internationals before.

990~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/work-permits.380683/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/work-permits.380683/</a>

Worth a read on work permits for anyone who wants to know

991~~~
Didn't say it wasn't possible, but pointing out, he obviously wasn't granted an easy quick one...

992~~~
No idea mate...just relaying information to those who didn't watch the presser.

993~~~
God this is a pain in the arse isn't it. Still find it silly that there isn't some kind of exemption when it comes to professional footballers in the UK. I believe there are in most of the other top leagues no? I base this solely on football manager.

994~~~
This has been one of the more convoluted transfers I can ever remember us being involved in.

995~~~
We could loan him out to Molde or Twente for 3 yrs, waiting he gets an european passport <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

996~~~
So I guess he will have to wait till next week to play?

997~~~
If he gets it done before 3 PM tomorrow, he can play. It's still a possibility.

998~~~
Can anybody explain something....

He's been training with us, right? In what way dies that not qualify as working, but playing a match does?

999~~~
He can be trainning while not registered. I guess under the same logic as trials?

1000~~~
I'm guessing we can't register him with the Premier League until the work permit is place? Hence he can't play a match.

Probably can't pay him either but nothing to stop him training with the team meanwhile.

Could be completely wrong though. Making assumptions here.

1001~~~
Apparently Malta have a scheme where if you're resident for a year you can buy an EU passport for £1 million. Last resort send him there and then buy him Maltese citizenship. Once he's an EU national he'll be able to play here freely. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1002~~~
True. I guess he didn't play 75% of Argentina's official matches in the last two years. But it doesn't explain why he had to travel to Spain and go to the embassey there. Normally it's just a regular appeal process.

1003~~~
Is there an Argentinian embassy in the UK?

Just checked..there is one in London.

1004~~~
Maybe there's something extra going on that's outside the usual process.

Or maybe he's getting a Spanish passport. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1005~~~
tried to stay out of the controversial stuff regarding him as i really rate him as a player, but did he really bottle someone in argentina?

1006~~~
So?

1007~~~
I don't think that's out of the question at all. He might have a Spanish parent?

1008~~~
I would imagine that is the case. If he has a grandparant thas was born in Spain, he would most likely be able to get a Spanish Passport. The embassy is probably working on it, but Spain will require documents to confirm everything and that might take some time.

The quicker we get this work permit nonsense sorted out the better, our current defence is a shambles and this guy may not be a world beater but he'll definitely improve on what we currently have. I was hoping to see him feature on Saturday against Burnley but that looks unlikely now. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1010~~~
I hope Rojo is not going to miss a third games due to paper work...ffs!

1011~~~
What happens if he doesn't get a work permit by Monday? Is there a deadline for when we have to register players for?

1012~~~
Why so freaking incompetent... Waiting over a work permit.

1013~~~
It's nothing to do with competence. He's having problems with the Argentinian government and there's a trial to his name in Rosario which is complicating matters.

1014~~~

1015~~~
Spain and bureaucracy. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> They do love their paperwork.

1016~~~
Jesus I didn't realise the work permit was still pending. Crazy.

1017~~~
Spain?

1018~~~
Some more paper work remaining I read, nothing to worry. Unfortunately it looks like we will have to wait until after the Intl. break.

1019~~~
He's getting the work permit from the Argentinian Embassy in Madrid.

1020~~~
To be fair City had to wait weeks with Mangala, the difference is they didn't announce his signing before Prem approval.

1021~~~
Cantona kicked someone in the face. Your point is?

1022~~~
By the end of the season it's my hope we'll be playing 433 with Rojo partnering Jones.

1023~~~
Has this guy been able to train with us?

1024~~~
yes

1025~~~
Good stuff. So we can just chuck him in as soon as he gets signed off.

1026~~~
yes, think so

1027~~~
I personally would prefer Smalling, but Jones comes a close second for me.

1028~~~
The frustration just continues to build with this one. Knowing our luck this season he'll probably get injured as soon as his permit is sorted <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1029~~~
Or we loan him to Antwerp after failing to gain a work permit. What happened to our link between Antwerp though? Rarely see them get mentioned, is the link still there?

1030~~~
crap website, somebody probably forgot the wordpress login details.

1031~~~
Them lads in Lisbon were always well known to be a few sandwiches short of a picnic in fairness. Wouldn't worry about it.

1032~~~
Really annoying to see this hasn't been completed yet. To have a player sitting there unable to be used when our defence is such an issue currently is just frustrating. I'm assuming that he won't be available for this weekend still

1033~~~
He definitely will not make the game.

Also, in terms of the appeal process, there are several avenues it can go down, a simple appeal where he could have don everything in UK, meant that his old team should have pulled their finger out and got the paperwork together, that's all it would take. However, it would seem as though Sporting will make this as hard as possible, difference being that apparently, if he uses the Spanish Argentinian embassy rather than than the UK one, I believe he will have a chance to appeal again, should this fail, whereas if he appealed in UK and failed, he would have to wait another standard 6 months, hence they've tried the Spanish appeal as they don't feel he is a straight forward case.

<a class="username" data-user="577, @Amir" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/577/">@Amir</a> I'm sure you are aware already, but though I'd say, that's only one reason of a few of how someone may qualify automatically for a work permit..

From what I've heard it would seem we are confident of the WP being granted conditionally, however we didn't want to take any chances so made sure if this fails, we had another means.

1034~~~
We have no match after Burnley for 2 weeks due to the Internationals so at least should be completed before the next game

1035~~~
So annoying that he probably won't be able to play this weekend. I just can't wait to see two Argies marauding down that left flank. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1036~~~
Not knowing how the process works, but how can sporting make the process difficult? Aren't work permits purely between United and the UK government (or whatever government body handles them)

1037~~~
What you have to remember is a work permit, is easier attained, with more information, if they don't qualify under a special clause then they need basically speaking "enough information" about enough areas of Marcos Rojo, and a large section of that will be previous employer unfortunately

1038~~~
Seems to me he is trying to get Spanish citizenship. 

Maybe worried about a Work Permit due to his case. But working in embassy in Spain otherwise seems bit weird.

1039~~~
Sporting sold him amicably to us. Why would they not co-operate ? If that was the hold up then we would have held up the deal till he got a work permit.

1040~~~
I hadn't heard that, can you prove it? Not that I have heard otherwise, I'm speculating.

Why wouldn't they co-operate? I'm not sure, the same reason they aren't too fussed about taking him down of either version of their club website as their player.

Again, I don't say this is the reason, I'm merely offering a theory to a subject I know a fair bit about, which means it's a real explanation, but it may not be valid in this case, I just don't understand what other reason he would have for not applying for a WP in UK at the Embassy.

Is it easier to attain Spanish citizenship than UK?

1041~~~
I hope the delay has nothing to do with the pending assault charge he has in Argentina

1042~~~
They agreed a fee with us and sold him to us and we gave them Nani as well.

The third party issues are between them and Doyen.


If he has some sort of spanish lineage then yeah. He won't get UK citizenship anyway but Work Permit. He should qualify automatically  or pretty easily so odd what the hold up is. Most likely it could be worry about his pending case in Argentina. Maybe he is trying to settle that or trying to get Spanish citizenship to get around under EU laws.

1043~~~
Assuming he isn't available for Burnley tomorrow?

1044~~~
Think he had to be registered by midday today so doesn't look like it unfortunately.

1045~~~
I'm actually unaware of other ways, at least for footballers. The international figure is what I've always heard (before appeals, etc). Obviously the process has been updated over the years because we see more and more appeals being successful compared with the days we've had to let Kirovski go or failed to sign Celio Silva, but I'm not really sure about the main process.

1046~~~
FFS! This season is frustrating beyond belief already<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.hibeesbounce.com/forum/images/smilies/wallbash.gif" src="http://www.hibeesbounce.com/forum/images/smilies/wallbash.gif"/>. 

Work Permit! Do they think he's going to moonlight as a minicab driver!

1047~~~
He might avoid paying his taxes like another Argentine... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1048~~~
What happens if the work permit is refused?  Could be due to this court case hanging over him. 

As we have already paid for him, I guess we would have to sell him, but we would be limited who we could sell him to!

1049~~~
Have we though?  I would have thought all such moves were subject to work permit.

1050~~~
His work permit is taking a long time to come through. I hear Abel Hernandez who will soon sign for Hull already has his.

1051~~~
Without repeating what has already been said, why have we signed a player with having previously obtaining a work permit? To get him in quick? Last haste more speed.

1052~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0d-O2go9Po?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I feel like this clip could be made into a topical gif with a bit of trickery.

1053~~~
Can you actually apply for the work permit before you hold the registration?... There has been lots of appeals before (usually because a young player does not have enough caps) but these players usually are signed by then so either clubs continually take risks or perhaps you cant apply till you hold the registration.
Something with third partnership ownership holding this one up so I'm not hopeful it will be resolved quickly

1054~~~
WE brought Dong Fangzhuo a few year ago (2004) and had to loan him out to Royal Antwerp because we could not get a work permit in the UK for him.

We couldn't just give him back to his previous side though.

1055~~~
Surely there must be some bird on the Caf who could marry him, that would sort it.

1056~~~
Paging <a class="username" data-user="73221, @QuackQuack" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/73221/">@QuackQuack</a>...

1057~~~
Yes!

1058~~~
Could you please marry Rojo and sort out his work permit issue?

1059~~~
I'd rather go back to Sporting than give her up...

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://fabwags.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/eugenia-lusardo-marcos-rojo-6-300x300.jpg" src="http://fabwags.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/eugenia-lusardo-marcos-rojo-6-300x300.jpg"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/marcos-rojo-why-is-it-taking-so-long-for-manchester-united-to-get-a-work-permit-9699288.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...ster-united-to-get-a-work-permit-9699288.html</a>

Don't normally trust newspaper stuff but I must say I'm getting worried now, I've never known it to take so long for a player to get a work permit.

1061~~~
Should we be worried about this? Would be absolutely disastrous if Rojo fell through now.

1062~~~
I don't think it will fall through. It's based on appearances for the national team in the last 2 years or something, so he'll be fine. If all else fails, he marries a European or we send him to our Belgian feeder team for 6 months.

1063~~~
It'll be done. No quick way around red-tape unfortunately.

1064~~~
I have a feeling he won't get the work permit and we end up loan him to another club. World will laugh at us. Bad preparation from us and his agent for not knowing that he doesn't have a work permit. Blind rumours shows up again. This could be alternative for us if Rojo's work permit fails.

1065~~~
Of course everyone knew he didn't have one. There's no way he could have had one without signing for us.

1066~~~
Exactly.. Why would he even have a work permit (to work in England) before he even signs for an English team? Some people on here just look for ways to blame the club.

1067~~~
What's(who) has caused the hold up? Argentinian government? Maradona? Eva? Marcosdeto?

1068~~~
Abel Hernandez has problems too with a work permit at Hull. We just have to wait. My fears are more based on the accusations of the bottle attack or whatever it was.

1069~~~
Bloody hell, Rojo deal might have to be cancelled if the permit can't be sorted out by Monday!

1070~~~

1071~~~
Bt sport said its in doubt now

1072~~~
Yet we let god knows how many jobless immigrants into the country

1073~~~
That took an unexpected political turn <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1074~~~
Why until Monday? Didn't LvG say it will be sorted out during international break?

1075~~~
Deadline Day. Isn't that the last opportunity to register players as well? Can a player be registered to play in the Premier League despite not having a work permit?

1076~~~
We fecked if he doesn't come.

1077~~~
Van Gaal said he should play against QPR.

1078~~~

1079~~~
It will be ridiculous if it goes wrong over some fight from 10 years ago.

1080~~~
Hmm, could be the reason we have gone after Blind, in case the Rojo deal does collapse knowing he can play LCB, LWB as well as DM.

1081~~~
Dont think so but Blind could come handy if this doesnt go through...

1082~~~
Come on, get it sorted! I want Rojo to play for us asap! 
Can we still register him even if he doesn't get the work permit until Monday?

1083~~~
Surely considering some of the rough neighborhoods these footballers come from,just hitting someone on the head with a bottle shouldn't be such a big deal. Has there been a precedence where a footballer was refused a work permit because of such complaints?

1084~~~
I keep reading about this but haven't seen a good source yet. Mind sharing one?

1085~~~
I don't understand how he was able to sign a contract if he wasn't legally allowed to work here.

1086~~~
The Mirror seems to be about the most solid out there: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/manchester-uniteds-marcos-rojo-could-4097649" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/manchester-uniteds-marcos-rojo-could-4097649</a>

1087~~~
Surely that's only if he goes back to the country. They wouldn't have the jurisdiction to force him back to Argentina. Of course I'm not a lawyer and I know nothing about this kind of thing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1088~~~
If we don't let him in, can we kick some of our own population out?

1089~~~
Same here.

1090~~~
Well, bring an Argentina international not being able to go to his home country isn't great, but that's by the by.  <i>If </i>there is a genuine open case and <i>if </i>it's serious enough that it could carry a custodial sentence, then you can quite see why that could screw up his work permit application.

On the other hand, the UK and Argentina hate each other... what better way to piss them off than by effectively giving a fugitive asylum!

1091~~~
We could do with a bit more bottle at the moment.

Cracking.

1092~~~
Yeah true. Clearly we should have given him a bigger signing on bonus so he could pay off the corrupt Argentinian judge.

1093~~~
I hope, if there is any chance of this deal falling through or of a work permit not being granted, we are in the market for another centre half. We only have a couple of days to get it sorted.

1094~~~
Are you suggesting we actually starting bottling opponents during matches?

I think you could be on to something...

1095~~~
Even with all the opponents down with blood pouring from their heads, we will still pass it backwards.

1096~~~
Didn't we already confirm the transfer and everything though? What happens if he doesn't get it, is he just stuck on our squad list and we're out 16m or does he go back to Sporting and we get back Nani and the money? Weird situation really

1097~~~
He's our employee but can't work in the country. Now obviously as our games are televised we can't get away with playing him, so we'll just put him lining out pitches and mopping floors I'd say.

1098~~~
So we may have to just send him on loan to Sporting til January in the hope that he can sort out a work permit by then?

1099~~~
He must have been back to Argentina loads of times playing for the NT, why didn't he get arrested? It's hard for me to get past the idea that this is just a wind up: 2+2=5 from the press, or a similar wind-up from a compensation lawyer who has discovered that Rojo has just won the lottery.

1100~~~
Surely a few bribes to the right people can get this sorted. Kim Jong Un is a fan, can't he get North Korean citizenship and then seek political asylum?

1101~~~
If you believe the press, there were never any formal charges pressed against him at the time of the incident but the case has recently been reopened for investigation for some reason. Still no criminal charges mind. So it's likely the visa office are just double checking the facts and making sure he has no criminal record. Or they're checking the progress of the investigation.

1102~~~
Rojo visa update, courtesy of the Beeb:

1103~~~
Contrived, but brilliant idea <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1104~~~
"The transfer window deadline is on Monday evening but, as the deal is done and a work permit secured, the player can be registered with the Premier League after it closes."

Phewww!

1105~~~
Phew, was getting worried there for a sec reading these last pages

1106~~~

1107~~~
That's good news give em time to train and then get going at QPR. Could have done with em today but feck it as long as he's secured a permit that's all that matters.

1108~~~
Visa delays are awful. My dad was scheduled to come to US this July but still hasn't come due to shitty NVC service.

1109~~~

1110~~~
He glassed someone? Favourite United player already.

1111~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1112~~~
seems just a matter of a few days or maybe a week.

1113~~~
How come he could play for Sporting Lisbon and yet is having problems joining us? Seeing as we're both in the EU? I'd have thought any problem here would have also been a problem there?

1114~~~
Agreed. 

Also, am I missing something? I thought the permit to work here is granted not by Argentina but by the UK government?

1115~~~
At least it looks like it'll be done by QPR. If it isn't then I'll just give up and expect him to be loaned somewhere until it is sorted. Why can't things just be easy <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1116~~~
What's the betting it was about the music being too loud.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1117~~~
Maybe is needs something of the Argentinians to say there isn't any reason a visa can't be granted.

1118~~~
It Read like a proper non-story. He's been with Argentina during the WC qualifiers, playing in Buenos Aires for example. He would have been arrested the moment he attempted to enter the country.

1119~~~
Is he gonna be on the other side of the world during the international break and come back knackered? Be typical of our season if he did.

1120~~~
This thing does have legs. It's why his work permit is being held up.

Also the Premier League hasn't yet signed off on the transfer due to the Third Party Ownership thing.

1121~~~
I can honestly see him still missing the QPR game. If it hasn't been done yet, it's because it's a mess and when it's a mess, these things can go on forever.

1122~~~
No. 

Argentina only play Germany in a friendly in Germany.

1123~~~
They are playing Germany on Wednesday. I forgot to check where. It is same kick off or round about as Englands so I presume in Germany.

1124~~~
Firstly, I highly doubt United would have signed him if their lawyers thought the trial in Argentina would be an issue. Secondly, the latter isn't true if you take the time to read the BBC article.

1125~~~
My understand was the PL has signed off, it is solely the permit.

1126~~~
BBC

1127~~~
I think it's the 3rd party ownership that's holding up the deal, well that's what Jonathan Northcroft said earlier on Sunday supplement.

1128~~~
He's been granted International transfer clearance, and also a Work permit but now needs a Working Visa too  which is a hold up?

This seems complex. Should just settle the case from 2010 paying some compensation or something.

1129~~~
His owenership and rights have already been transferred.

That third party stuff is now between Sporting and Doyen as to who gets how much money. I imagine Doyen agreed to this and allowed the transfer despite Sporting rescinding there contract so that they can later sort it out in courts.

1130~~~
Or a brown envelope in the right pocket <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1131~~~
Mmm that will settle it just nicely! <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1132~~~
The Premier League have stated that they've signed that off. It's just the Visa now.

1133~~~
It's just more negative attention on us isn't it. Surely the deal wouldn't of gone through if they club didn't their homework properly. He's been with us nearly 2 weeks.

1134~~~
I don't think it works that way in this case. I think Sporting had the full ownership but was obliged by contract to pay a percentage (75%) of the value to Doyen. That's the contract they rescinded. United or the FA have nothing to do with it, they only had to deal with Sporting.

Mangala was different, that's what Doyen said about it (my translation): "(...) For the first time in history, an investment fund sold their economic rights over a player directly to an English club, with total approval and supervision from the FA. Everything ran perfectly. We'd also like to thank FA and Manchester's City stance. (...)"

1135~~~
There is obviously something holding the deal up but it will be resolved soon.

There is no way a club the size of United with lawyers and advisors would pay 16m for a player without being able to get the deal done and him playing on the pitch.

I wouldn't worry.

1136~~~
After the way we've handled other deals, nothing would surprise me now. I'm wondering if we were even aware of the court case when we signed him. These details didn't emerge till at least a few days after the deal was done.

1137~~~
According to Jonathon Northcroft in the ST today it could take weeks to ratify the transfer and Doyen, the company with a stake in Rojo have mounted a challenge that will heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He goes on to say that 'VG, as a man of experience and intelligence will be asking Woodward questions such as why Rojo was presented as a United player without his third party ownership being resolved'. 'The Rojo mess sums up the untidyness of Uniteds transfer window following last years..

1138~~~
It did surprise me how quickly it went through given how long it took City to wrap up the Mangala deal.

1139~~~
But why are the BBC saying it has nothing to do with the premier league and rather work permit issues?

1140~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29000089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29000089</a>

1141~~~
Two completely conflicting stories in the press here! The BBC one is less sensationalist so for the minute I'm inclined not to panic about it.

1142~~~
Is he better than Lovren of Liverpool as he really impressed last year and was surprised we were not interested in him at the price.

1143~~~
Dunno but here's more from the ST Sports section today.

Duncan Castles: "Though United announced Rojo's transfer 11 days ago, the Argentian remains unavailable because PL rules state that he cannot be registered to play until the 75% of his economic rights owned by an investment fund at Sporting Lisbon has been bought out. Rojo's case has been complicated by an ugly legal dispute between Sporting and the players third party owners Doyen Sports, which intends to open a case against the Lisbon Club this week. The group is challenging Sportings actions in terminating Rojo's economics rights contract with Doyen 'with just cause' a few days before selling the player to United. Instead of distributing 75% of the transfer fee to the fund, Sporting aim to retain most of the revenue for their use. Because the case is complicated by alleged breaches of contract by Doyen <b>THERE IS NO TIMESCALE FOR ITS RESOLUTION POTENTIALLY LEAVING ROJO IN LIMBO BETWEEN THE CLUBS AND VAN GAAL WITHOUT AN IMPORTANT DEFENSIVE REINFORCEMENT.</b>"

1144~~~
Castles and Northcroft are both talking utter shite.

1145~~~
Haha, I keep hearing this but it's playing out before our own eyes, since last summer it's been clear that we have little or no due dilligence, and there's no clear plan in place at the club. Rojo still hasn't been able to play for us, so, someone somewhere didn't do his homework properly.

1146~~~
So when can he play?

1147~~~
Sportings attempts to end their contract with Doyen seemed laughable at the time to me. I just don't get how it coukd be possible.

It's like me buying a car on finance and just terminating my agreement, selling the car and pocketing the cash. Did they have any grounds to do this? Surely our lawyers questioned this, unless we got desperate and said to do the deal and leave them to sort out the mess.

1148~~~
Whenever he gets a UK working visa which could be today or months from now, but LVG thinks it should be resolved during the International break and he should be available for the QPR game....fingers crossed.

1149~~~
Only god knows

This transfer should be canceled

1150~~~
I don't understand why that should have any bearing whether we can play him or not, we've signed him for £16 million he's our player, any dispute between Sporting and Doyen should be sorted amongst themselves. I think there's a bit of confusion as to whats holding up Rojo getting a visa, is it this mess between Sporting and Doyen or is it the Court case back in Argentina there's been conflicting reports.

1151~~~
I'm maybe mistaken but according to the bbc everything is fine.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29000089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29000089</a>

1152~~~
Well Sporting have potentially sold a player that they didn't own. If I understand correctly. Perhaps Doyen ahreed to the fee but Sporting haven't paid them what they are due.

1153~~~
Why?? if we cancel it then we have to play the rest of the season (until Jan at least) with our current crop of defenders which have been a complete shambles so far, give it time, whether it's resolved today, tomorrow or a month from now at least we'll have a defensive reinforcement that we've been desperately needing and even though he may not be a world beater he's certainly a step up from what we have now.

1154~~~
Surely though we'd have been in talks with both Sporting and Doyen considering they partly owned him?? we should've had a payment plan worked out with the both of them and made sure the whole thing went through smoothly and Sporting couldn't pull a stunt like this.

1155~~~
That's what I thought, but the court case suggests not. It was suspicious how the deal went through as soon as Sporting terminated their deal with Doyen.

1156~~~
I dont understand what this investment fund is. Is it separate to Doyen? Is that what the court has to decide? And is that what the PL is waiting for before issuing a permit?

1157~~~
Anything new with this?

1158~~~
This is still rumbling on...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.insideworldfootball.com/premier-league/15350-rojo-s-man-utd-deal-stalled-as-criminal-case-and-tpo-create-perfect-storm?utm_content=buffer59be8&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.insideworldfootball.com/...al&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer</a>

Maybe we should be signing a central defender in case this one falls through.

1159~~~
He's received international clearance but not a work permit as of yet.

1160~~~
Hoping that this ends after the international break so we can see this kid play. Guessing the United Lawyers will be working hard.

1161~~~
Is he in the squad to play Germany tomorrow? Will be nice to get a good look at him.

1162~~~
What in satans ball bag is happening with this? Whys it taken two weeks for him to get a permit?

1163~~~
hopefully he will play, we can see how good he is

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/sa00_FxS9S/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

1164~~~
Because there is just more than a permit if the rumors are true. JUst hopefully it is all fixed by the end of the break.

1165~~~
Rojo starts for Argentina tonight along with Di Maria v Germany, still can't believe they are now Manchester United players amazing <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1166~~~
Where is he playing, LWB or CB?

1167~~~
LWB it seems, Fernandez and Demichelis start as CB's

1168~~~
Dunno, but he supposedly bottled someone in 2010 when he was celebrating his move to Spartak Moscow and an Argentinian judge has issued an arrest warrant. Or something, according to the worldwide fountain of facts aka The Daily Mail.

EDIT: not the Daily Mail, silly me. The Mirror via The People.

Cheers. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Would love to watch this but I can't miss Dæhli. And, you know, our beloved England...

1170~~~
I'm Irish so I won't have to watch England tonight <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> will keep a close eye on this match and of course Ireland v Oman

1171~~~
Are any of the games televised?

1172~~~
Great. Will mainly watch the Argentina game then!

1173~~~
Ireland on Setanta, England on ITV, and Germany on BT Sports 1

1174~~~
Thanks

1175~~~
Can't wait to see him along with Di Maria.

1176~~~
Pm incoming

1177~~~
Back to the work permit, is there an end in sight? I mean we spent £16m on a player that can't even play. Did the club not do its homework?

1178~~~
What's the full lineups?

1180~~~
nobody knows. I think the club thought it would be a lot easier to obtain his work permit. They probably didnt know about his bottle attack in Argentina too.

1181~~~
Thanks <a class="username" data-user="69151, @Annahnomoss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69151/">@Annahnomoss</a>

1182~~~
Doing well, as expected comfortable on the ball and getting involved with the attack from time to time.

1183~~~
As I understand it, the work permit is not the issue, but the visa is.

1184~~~
Think he started really nervous, misplacing easy passes but he is looking as one of the better players on the pitch now. Getting involved and that being up against a real quality opponent in Draxler.

1185~~~
He's limited in attack just like the world cup. Don't think he can be a LWB option like some think.

LB yeah.

1186~~~
Erm don't we need him to be a CB?

1187~~~
I agree. I can see him as a solid LB, similar to Abidal and Dani Alves' relationship. If he plays LB and is comfortable playing more central too, then it'll allow Rafael to get forward more knowing that there's still 3 defenders left behind him.

1188~~~
Yeah, ofcourse that's his primary position or LCB in a 3 but some were saying he can be shaw backup in this formation. I don't think he can.

1189~~~
Has he ever played consistently as a CB in a four man defence?

1190~~~
For someone who hasn't played a lot since the world cup, he looks solid. Think he can dispel doubts about lack of match practice when he gets his permit and slots into the team.

1191~~~
I think he played almost all of last season as a CB for Sporting Lisbon? Pretty sure I saw a few games with him partnering Mauricio in the centre of defence? <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a>

1192~~~
Yep, that's where he played at Sporting. I think by the end of his time in Argentina too.

1193~~~
Yes he can. Rather have him cover than Ashley fecking Young.

1194~~~
He looks very comfortable on the ball to me so I'm sure he can play lwb just fine.

1195~~~
He'll do worse if you want him to be your main creative outlets like we are asking our wingbacks to be due to not creating enough centrally.

See James in that role. Rojo seems pretty similar. 

Almost like playing Smalling RWB or Jones.

1196~~~
A big brown envelope should do the trick, if that's the case. That's how I got mine...<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">My application and all the supporting docs were packed in a brown envelope....</span>

1197~~~
He created the second highest amount of chances from a defender at the World Cup. I'm sure he'd do fine.

1198~~~
I think Jones and Rojo in a back three is a bit overkill. Both of them are very defensively stable with safe but non-creative passing. I can't see them finding ways to make our build-up stronger. 

Would like to see them playing together though in a back four.

1199~~~
Kept a clean sheet in a half against Germany, good enough for me!

1200~~~
Hasn't played that well for me, a lot of misplaced passes & easy giveaways

1201~~~
During the WC, his passing seemed to be very sloppy.

1202~~~
j´he is a CB, and should play there.

1203~~~
Watched all game. Only agree about the start when he looked very nervous, since then he picked up and played great. 

Seemed like it was playing as a LB which made him look a bit out of control the first few minutes.

1204~~~
Has he got his work permit yet?

1205~~~
Not a great match. Germany should have scored from one bad mistake and he does not appear to hurry back into position when caught.

In general I would say he looks quite comfortable on the ball for a (supposed) centre back though. And he does appear to have the tools to be a top player... looks like plenty of work to do though.

ADM is top class.

1206~~~
95% of his games were as CB in a 4 man defence with either Maurício or Dier as CB partners.

1207~~~
Conceded twice, any of them his fault?

1208~~~
He´s doing okay. You can see that he´s kinda "rusty" and needing a run of games. Some lack of playing rhythm

1209~~~
Watch again or see his stats post match


Neither.  First one a Romero fumble and the 2nd deflected off of Fernandes

1210~~~
Why the supposed? He´s a center back primarily. Yeah like i said in my previous assessments, alot of work for Van Gaal there but i think he can become a very useful player for United.

1211~~~
No. He does look like he'd do better as a CB though. Like someone say the only negative thing with him in this match has been getting back in position doing a sprint rather than jogging back. 

Still been great defensively overall with a lot of tackles/clearances.

1212~~~
The lad is a monster on one-on-one's. So fecking strong.

1213~~~
Supposed because I need to see with my own eyes his capabilities to play there at the top level. Different for you obviously as you are much more familiar with him as a player and in his preferred position. On the surface of things he doesn't look like your typical CB really, not a safe player... might just need a year or two more as seems to be developing.

1214~~~
Nope. He started a bit nervous as he hasn't played in a while. Then on, he's looked very strong. Powerful tackler.

1215~~~
Yep, he´s a very good man marker like i said. It will be a shame if Van Gaal just pushes him for another LB adaptation. Rojo needs to play as CB to take advantage of his full potencial.

1216~~~
*bump 

All good comments so far.

1217~~~
I always assumed that was the idea

He will be playing 3 centre backs and rojo will be one of them

1218~~~
it is slietly concerning me we have bought 3 players whose best psotion seems to be left back :s

1219~~~
In a back three he'll be LCB or maybe even CB. He's so strong and has a good spring on him. This may be a Vidic like signing.

1220~~~
I've looked at him specifically most of the match to get to know him more and I have the stats open as well. He has similar statistics as Zabaleta and higher passing accuracy than Di Maria. 

Like I said in the first minutes he went down a lot in passing accuracy but I think he's worked his way up. Last few mins he has gone down though slightly from being quite impressive in his passing statistics to "just" as good as Zabaleta.

Overall I think he's done well in possession and off it, even if I think he looks more comfortable as a CB.

1221~~~
His best position is CB. He played the whole of last season as a CB for Sporting and had a good season as well.

1222~~~
Why do you say that? For me he has all the caractheristics of a CB. What doesn´t really inspire me is his LB adaptations. I don´think he will need that much time. I think 6 months to a year under Van Gaal at the english competitive level will make him raise his game and evolve.

1223~~~
No, blind plays best as holding midfielder, rojo is centre back. We only have shaw as a proper all out left back

1224~~~
Rojo best is as a CB, Blind as a DM.

1225~~~
Rojo with another piece of good play. He's going to be great for us. I just know it.

1226~~~
not True
Daley's best position is in midfield. He has played there the last 2 years for Ajax and won Dutch footballer of the year playing there. He was used a let back at the WC because Holland had no other suitable player in this position.

1227~~~
Rojo's best position is cb according to people who actually seen him regularly.

1228~~~
Blind won footballer of the year as a defensive midfielder while as a left back he was only average for them. Rojo was at his best always at center back for Sporting as well. They all can play at left back so it's good to have cover, but would you say Smalling or Jones are right backs? No.

1229~~~
yet both played left back in world cup, and have spend a lot of thier career prior to last year playing left back.... i hope your right....but as hardly anyone on this forum has seen rojo play center back.... and is just hoping.... and van gaal seems to like blind as a LB.... ill wait to judge for myself, but i hope your all right!

1230~~~
Have we?  who?

1231~~~
Angel Di Maria dazzled with one goal and three assists as Argentina beat Germany 4-2 tonight. Fellow #new boy Marcos Rojo also played.

9:42pm - 3 Sep 14
I think this sums it up quite well (from the manutd.com twitter account)

<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1232~~~
If anyone sees a match compilation uploaded of either Rojo or di Maria, please post it!

1233~~~
Was he any good tonight?

1234~~~
I see some confusion in posts from some United supporters. Rojo is a CB period. He was a CB in the youth ranks and clearly prefers to play as CB. At Spartak he played some games as LB but i´ve read multiple interviews saying that he feels more comfortable and prefers to play as CB. Of course it doesn´t mean he can´t play as LB (as shown in the argentinian national team) but at Sporting he was always a priority for the CB position. The LB adaptation was more of stop-gap solution due to suspensions or injuries. Since we had very reliable LB´s when he was here (Insúa and Jefferson), he barely played there. When he did, he didn´t inspire me much trust. Of course the circunstancies at Sporting and Argentina are clearly different. Perhaps with United he can be more efficient in that adaptation (like in the argentinian national team).

1235~~~
They played left back since their countries had no other options there and they are versatile. But Sly and other Portuguese posters have seen rojo ever week, he almost exclusively plays center back. Very rarely does he play left back. 

Blind's agent said that van gaal told him he'd start in defensive midfield, somewhere where van gaal has played him before for the national team too. It's nothing to do with waiting and seeing, they are all versatile but primarily play in other positions.

1236~~~
I think Blind has shown his best form as a midfield anchorman. He played left back for the Dutch because they had almost literally noone else to turn to... hence Kuyt, and Buttner being cheesed off at not being selected.

Similar for Rojo and Argentina really. Only playing left back to fill a gap. The difference with Rojo is he shone in that position and it seems likely that for Argentina he will be a fixture there.

1237~~~
Sigh... you just don't give up do you? He's a DM. Van Gaal has also said he's a midfielder. Why did he play LB at WC? Because there's no one else good enough tactically in the Netherlands who could play that role.

As for "most of their careers" - Blind only played LB at first as cover for Boilesen when he was injured. He came through the ranks as at Ajax as a midfielder. So no, he hasn't played most of his career as a LB.

Rojo has played LB at Estudiantes, but he didn't play much at Spartak and at Sporting he's played CB for two seasons.

1238~~~
He had shady first and last 10 minutes and the rest of the 70 he played really well. Shady as in he misplaced a few passes and ended up with the same passing percentage as Zabaleta. 

Strong in the tackle, clearances and defensive play in general.

1239~~~
you maybe right... or maybe simply van gaal likes blind thier... dosnt rate shaw(complaing about his fittness), and does rate Fletcher(hense making him vice captain) and carrick(bigging him up in first press conference)

as for rojo... no idea, like most people ive never seen him play CB so no idea wat he's like, seems like an okay LB but thats all i know

1240~~~
Why? Because he looks short on composure and positional discipline which are vital for a CB. And conversely because he has more ability on the ball than the majority of CBs at least in England.. But the two attributes mentioned come more from top level game time than anything so am encouraged and I am sure LVG also is as I am sure he feels he can polish what looks to me like a rough diamond.

I expect a rocky period with the fans here though...

1241~~~
do you have a quote for his agent?

and it is wait and see, becuase we may end up with one playing left back and the other 2 not getting in the team... we don't know!

1242~~~
give up? ive hardly said anything... just that it worrying that we may have bough 3 players whose primary position maybe left back... we have no idea what van gaal has planned.

he may not rate shaw so has bought blind and rojo for that position... and to fill in other postions... we simply dont no were just guessing... and speculating... wats wrong with that?

1243~~~
It is wrong simply because Blind played most of last season in midfield and Rojo played most of last season at centre back. So it seems like a world cup biased stretch to suggest that either's best position is left back. It would also make no sense for us to buy them all if this were the case and LVG is not lacking in sense.

1244~~~
Composure i agree, i´ve said that from the start but i don´t have many complaints about his positional discipline. I mean i had complaints in his first year at Sporting but at the second year, fully settled and under the guidance of a very tactically strict manager, he corrected that flaw (still prone to the occasional lapses). He was our best defender and him, Maurício and William complemented each other very well, which shows tactical awareness and good positional sense. From the CB´s i´ve known at Sporting, he possessed some important attributes that you need for any ecletic CB pairing. He´s a very good man marker, he has the physical tools needed for that position and is very strong on the aerial game (both ends of the pitch). I think his game is suited for english football.

He will have a rocky period if Van Gaal uses him at LB adapted position. If he gets a decent runs of games as CB and settles i sense that he will become a fan favourite. The type of game he plays, strong, aggressive, no nonsense CB type, is usually very popular in the english game.

1245~~~
The rocky period I think will come regardless of where he plays. He has a mistake in him and it is very likely it will lead to a goal or two against. And he has a red card in him too by the sound of it.

1246~~~
How did he play tonight then? I gather he was at left back, for the brief period I saw of the game I heard the commentator say that he had quietly had a good game.

1247~~~
And about a dozen yellows per year <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Van Gaal will definitely have to work on that typical latin fire (mental note for card bet when he plays either Diego Costa or Joey Barton).

1248~~~
His passing and composure is already way better than any of our CB's. He will appear a great player compared to them.

1249~~~
Doesn't matter if he plays at LB for the national team. Ramos played at RB for the majority of his Spanish career to accommodate Pique and Puyol, the latter played at RB till about his mid 20s, Hoewedes plays at LB for Germany, Thuram at RB for France despite being one of the best CBs of his generation even at Parma and so forth. Rojo's primary position is at CB, that's where he's played for his clubs till now and that's where he'll play at United for the vast majority of games.

1250~~~
Just watched the post match analysis and they all thought he had a poor game.

1251~~~
By that logic we have no idea where Van Gaal will play any of our signings, even Falcao or Herrera because we aren't Van Gaal. Rojo is 100% a centre back, I'm not sure why you don't believe everyone else here. Just like blind is definitely a defensive midfielder. No maybe he's better here, no, he is a midfielder who can fill in at left back. You're saying maybe might be somewhere else,  but it just isn't. Their best positions are centre back for rojo and defensive mid for Blind. 

As for Shaw, he clearly rates him, just he wasn't fit in the first week. He's had a few press conferences since where he said how he's much improved in that regard and how he's now a role model in the dressing room. People took his one comment about not being fit enough yet too literally basically.

1252~~~
I watched it on and off, and he looked solid enough to me. Don't remember him making any bad mistakes and his passing looked crisp enough. Wasn't involved a huge amount in the attacking sense but that allowed Zabaleta to get forward more. 

He looked fairly comfortable to me all game though.

1253~~~
How did they get that conclusion they were 4-0 for 80 minutes weren't they and none of the goals were his fault. I didn't watch the full 90 minutes, maybe he gave the ball away a lot?

1254~~~
Not sure whether that was true or not at Sporting. But in this match he'd be worse in his passing than Evans and very equal to Jones.

1255~~~
I'm not sure mate, I didn't watch the full game either.

1256~~~
bollocks

theres no way he is a worse passer than Evans

1257~~~
Same amount as Zabaleta. The issue I think was that it was very compressed in to the start of the game and then the very end of the game. So maybe it stayed on peoples memories. 

Anybody saying he had a bad game are wrong though, at worst an average one but he was the most imposing defender on the pitch.

1258~~~
why does he cleary rate shaw? the biggest thing hes said about him was complaining about his fittness, he has been complementary about the work he did since, but making him train by himself is not a good sign when no other player had too.

i personally think blind is going to start at LB, as he has said he rates carrick, as praised him in his first press conference so will probably start when he he fit, an clearly rates Fletcher as made him vice captain.

as for rojo, if your saying he is defiantly going to start at cb ahead of other players ill trust you, but as i, like most united fans, have never seen the kid play center back, so literally i have no idea if he a CB or not.

all im saying is it isn't clear cut.

1259~~~
Why? Jones has had a great average passing percentage in both his long and short passing this season and his short passing has been good for a while.

In this game Rojo had a low passing percentage and his misplaced passes were often the "error" types. Like I said I have no clue how he did at Sporting with his passing, but in this game it was worse than what Jones has performed this year.

1260~~~
In my opinion i think Rojo is a better passer than Jones. Some people are forgetting that Rojo has barely played this season. He´s clearly lacking match routine and needs game time to improve his form.

1261~~~
The comment I made was that in this game Rojo's passing was below the quality of a Jones performance - as a response to people asking how he played.

1262~~~
I understood. What i said might also serve an excuse for that.

1263~~~
Of course of course. It is a good excuse, I said it earlier as well when making a longer comment about his performance that another reason he looked a bit poor was that he seemed unused to the LB position. 

The first 5-10 minutes he looked really off the mark and started off sloppy with his passing. Then he caught up and played great football until Argentina were already 4-0 up.

1264~~~
He looked decent tonight. As <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> points out; he's bound to be a bit rusty.

1265~~~
What position was he playing?

1266~~~
Left back, had a quiet game, which I suppose is what you want from your defender.

1267~~~
If Rojo can do a decent job as a LB and Jones can do a decent job as a RB, I think we should line up with Smalling and Evans at CB and we would have a very solid back line that can do a decent enough job in attack as well, they wouldn't be any worse than Valencia and Young as wing back (2/37 cross completed).

1268~~~
Nooo... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1269~~~
No no no none of this CB at fullback stuff again. We have Rafael and Shaw, lets use them.

1270~~~
Look I love Rafael to bits, 1 of my favourite utd player and wears his heart on his sleeve no doubt but he does get caught out of position at times and we can't allow that this season to be honest, as for Shaw I'm not buying into the hype around this kid, hes a top talent no doubt but 1 for the future. All I'm saying is would it work, would it be solid, because if it is then it what we need.

1271~~~
I'm not going to get into this.

I've seen it too many times. It irritates the shit out of me. Play fullbacks at fullback.

1272~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> alright treacle settle down

1273~~~
You wont find a sentence with more sense and truth than this one. No Jones/Evans/Smalling as fullbacks ever again.

1274~~~
Has Rojo got his work permit, or whatever it is that's holding things up, yet? (Sorry, too lazy to read back through the thread)

1275~~~

1276~~~
Good news and bad then, would it be something else if Anderson did suddenly kick on having a more mobile, comfortable partner, next to him.

1277~~~
So he still hasn't got his permit. I don't see how including him in the PL squad suggests "they think Rojo will get a work permit". Were we going to pay, what? £16m for him then not include him regardless?

1278~~~
Put it this way, I would rather have Rojo at LWB than Young or James at present. He is no doubt going to be a great LCB for us, but if Shaw isn't available he looks comfortable enough to slot in. 

I liked that he seemed comfortable on the ball. He was happy to dribble and pass on the move, even doing step overs at 1 point into the box.

Obviously for a CB that's a low priority, but for a ball playing CB it is important to not be fazed by the ball.

I've no idea if this guy is genuine, but sure he claimed Falcao had failed medical and would need to be re-evaluated the next day...

Meant to say that Rojo recently followed that guy on twitter, so he might know something.

I don't understand. This tweet implies that maybe he wasn't going to get one at all? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1284~~~
Hopefully! He just seemed a little suss to me, though aren't they all on Twitter!

1285~~~
This is great news if true ! Once Smalling regains his fitness levels, we'll have our full complement of central defenders for the first time this seasons. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1286~~~
Its about time, really looking forward to seeing Rojo play.
Our of all our new recruits, he seemed the most enthused to join us.

1287~~~
He was man of the match against Liverpool in that friendly and got on really well against Madrid, will most likely be our starting left back once he's fit and rightly so. People rave about Di Maria and Falcao but I'm equally happy we signed Shaw, tremendous talent and that's not even debatable.

1288~~~
Surely not <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/01/1409594393251_lc_galleryImage_Pic_Paul_Cousans_Zenpix_L.JPG" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/01/1409594393251_lc_galleryImage_Pic_Paul_Cousans_Zenpix_L.JPG"/>

1289~~~
Still cant believe we have Falcao....looking forward to seeing how LVG fits RVP, Rooney, Mata, ADM and Falcao in the same side <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1290~~~
He won't.

1291~~~
I figured, I think it'll be between Rooney and Mata for the #10 position.

(wrong thread I know!)

1292~~~
Rojo is a CB, period! He's not a left back just because he is left footed - some people can be very tedious. You've had countless people [who have actually seen him play] say he's a CB and you're still arguing. Christ!

1293~~~
They've seen him play 4 or 5 times at left-back for Argentina. He had never played football before that.

1294~~~

1295~~~
So QPR should be fun, we could have three debutants.

1296~~~
Not sure why he'd need to go to Lisbon to pick it up. Last we were told, he was at our embassy in Spain applying for it.

1297~~~
Huge sigh of relief. Now let's get cracking with some backbone in our defence.

1298~~~
I know what you mean, it doesn't seem real. We have a triumvirate as good as Madrid or Barca. Guess we never, EVER, dreamed of it.

1299~~~
United's embassy in Madrid? I like the sound of that. We should have them in all major cities. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1300~~~
Possibly four. Shaw, Rojo, Blind and Falcao.

1301~~~
Result! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1302~~~
+ Di Maria home debut too...

1303~~~
There's going to be some atmosphere at Old Trafford next Sunday.

1304~~~
Great news. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1305~~~
Looks tidy on the ball, shame he wasn't tested much defensively but from other vids, he looks to be tenacious in the tackle as well. Hope he settles and partners Evans in the long term. A proper silk and steel combination at the back, a la Rio and Vida.

1306~~~
I wish it was this Sunday but I'll wait a week to see mufc tear up QPR <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1307~~~
I can see him getting more than one red card this season. Hopefully, in the last few mins rather than in the first half. Some of his challenges seem to be an invitation for the ref to hand out a booking.

1308~~~
We'll be brilliant if he drops Rooney.

1309~~~
Yep, International football is losing its appeal, starting to hate them now.

1310~~~
Rojo looked good last night I thought - ball distribution was good, looked composed and has presence.

1311~~~
Extra week is good for us this time though with the amount of injuries we've got.

1312~~~

1313~~~
Is there a more 'official' source confirming he's been given his work permit?

Edit: Nvm, Adnan's one was good enough <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1314~~~
Now the Daily Mail is in on it. It's a media brief.

1315~~~
Yeah, the timing of these ones are great. The international break can sometimes can be beneficial for players fitness, recovering from injuries etc. I used to love internationals, now I find them boring as hell.

1316~~~

1317~~~

1318~~~
Yes finally. Good news

1319~~~
Shaw, Falcao, Rojo, Blind! That's 4 premier league debuts!

1320~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1321~~~
GET IN!

1322~~~

1323~~~
How long until he picks up an injury in training <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1324~~~
Good news, it seems like everything coming together for us.

1325~~~
Cock out

1326~~~
Glad that is sorted out, this has to be one of the oddest transfers we've ever been involved with.

1327~~~
Weren't we involved with something like this before?, i seem to have a memory from years ago where we signed some player and he couldn't play for ages because of something stupid that we didn't pick up on.

1328~~~
Relieved it's all sorted out now and he can play.

Cannot wait for the QPR game.

1329~~~
What is wrong with Herrera?

1330~~~
I am hoping we absolutely destroy that team. Make a statement of where this team can be.

1331~~~
We'll probably lose now!

1332~~~
he played against Swansea.

1333~~~
Well its going to happen at some point, it HAS to with the attacking players we have now.

1334~~~
I mean I thought he was injured?

1335~~~
he was, should be back for the QPR game.

1336~~~
What a relief!!

Oh and he was good yesterday, especially with keeping possession and not panicking when under pressure!

1337~~~
Great news. Hope he's involved on Sunday.

1338~~~
He played against Swansea <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1339~~~
80% Passing Accuracy. 0/2 long balls went to their address. Jones had 95% passing accuracy, 5/5 long balls on target. 

Rojo played as a LB, but I don't think it was one of his better games in terms of possession. He looked a bit off the mark at times in regards to his possession keeping even if he was great defensively.

1340~~~
Great news, can't wait to see him in action.

1341~~~
Given a bit of time that left side of defense could be very solid indeed. Both Rojo and Shaw have pace and strength in abundance.

1342~~~
Oh please don't - I think I'd actually have a cry if this happens.

1343~~~
My point with Rojo and it works with any defender is that the better defenders we have, and the better they play ..... the more our offense can focus on being offensive.

1344~~~
Rojo, Rojo Rojo, Rojo Rojo, Rojo

Got the permit

1345~~~
Rojo even when pressed by Germany didn't hoof/clear it long, but calmly found a teammate more often than not. Of course it helped that those teammates were as comfortable on the ball. Also Rojo was playing Germany, whereas Jones was playing ???

1346~~~
Don't Chelsea have two players without Visas, Wallace, and some winger?

1347~~~
I said the same in another thread. The fact that Evans and Smalling etc are not great at the moment combined with the panic and nervous hoofing they do, it rubs off on the other players and effects our overall play. Its the reason why we pass back so much, even when not under any pressure.
If our defence was good and the attacking players believed in the defence, they would express themselves and we would destroy many teams.

1348~~~
Would also be interesting to see the %age of passes Rojo made that were forward compared to Jones, it's always easier to have a high passing percentage if you're taking the easy option more often than not.

It might not show anything different but would be interesting nonetheless.

1349~~~
There was a Brazilian defender in the late 90s/early 00s, who we basically did sign but was refused a work permit. Short name, can't quite remember it.

I edited him onto FIFA and everything

1350~~~
Yay excellent news.

1351~~~
Celio Silva ? We bought Berg after that.

1352~~~
That's it. Well done.

1353~~~
And you doubted Woodward's acumen...

1354~~~
Wasn't there a bit of a kerfuffle getting Rafabio across the line too? Or was that Possebon?

1355~~~
According to the bastion of truth that is wikipedia, Rafael and Fabio signed in the January of 2008 but couldn't play until the July when they turned 18 so that may be what you're remembering.

Possebon had an Itallian grandparent or something so I doubt it was him.

1356~~~
Good stuff.

1357~~~
Hope he slots right in, can't wait to see him play In red!

1358~~~
WTF ? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'll be adding that to my vocabulary. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1359~~~
The legend that is Dong 'The Next Batistuta' Fangzhuo? Who couldn't play in the UK because of the work permit and had to be loaned around for ages before he could finally grace us with his presence?

What about Mame Biram Diouf, aka The One? Same issue if my memory serves.

1360~~~
Great news. Looking forward to the QPR game.... let's hope it isn't another Swansea....

1361~~~
Yeah, I mean look at our recent games where our defenders needlessly kept passing the ball to each other and DDG. And have a look at Jones next time, everytime Evans had lots of space but still didn't seem to have a clue what to do with the ball, Jones told him to give it to DDG. Every time he kept pointing to DDG as if Evans doesn't already do it all the time anyway. 

Btw, I rate Jones and he is still very young, but he needs to step it up now in order to fulfil his potential. My biggest hope with LvG was that he improves our young players. Now with Welbeck and Lawrence gone I at least hope Jones, Smalling, Evans (not young anymore) and Blackett improve big time

1362~~~
You could call it an argy bargy.

1363~~~
It's an Englishism. I use it a lot. Legacy of 11 years spent in Blighty.

1364~~~
We could have Rojo, Shaw, Blind, Herrera, Di Maria and Falcao playing against QPR. Ha. That's incredible. I'd like to say how unlucky it is for QPR, but knowing us we'll scrape a 1-1 draw.

1365~~~
But isn't that too aggressive of a term both in usage and enunciation ? "Kerfuffle" just sounds so.. I dunno.. Cuddly and soft.. Like a fluffy little muppet.. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Ah I see. Will be on the lookout for more of those. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1366~~~
is shaw gonna be fit?

1367~~~
I heard he was out for four weeks originally or am I wrong? That will have passed by the time the QPR game is to be played. I'm just assuming. Stand to be corrected.

1368~~~
I read an article the other day (can't remember which paper but it wasn't something crap like The Star) which said that he was likely to be available for QPR. It looks like all our players (apart from Carrick and Rafael?) will be available for the next game. Good to see Rojo getting a run out yesterday considering he's not been involved for Utd over the last couple of weeks.

1369~~~
I believe he's back in training already.

1370~~~
Been keeping himself fit whilst all this nonsense with his work permit has been going on.

1371~~~
yeah i heard four weeks too, i think that takes us up to the QPR game so would train after that game.... but....
 would be great if thats true where did you hear it?

1372~~~
i thought i read something in the daily mail....

1373~~~
He was training with us all the while till about the last early last week. He can play now.

1374~~~
Get in, so were going yo have 4 debutants available for QPR.

1375~~~
We were talking about shaw <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1376~~~
Epic... fail...

1377~~~
Great to see him get his work permit. Cannot wait for the game against QPR to see what formation LvG uses.

1378~~~
Why?

1379~~~
I have a good feeling about this signing. It's always great to see a lad over the moon to sign for the club as well.

1380~~~
That's for me...

1381~~~
Right ..... Good chat .... Have a biscuit!

1382~~~
I... did.

1383~~~
Was it........ Good?

1384~~~
Yeah, Bebe. We failed to pick up he was shit.

1385~~~
Manucho? Dong Fangzhuo?

1386~~~
Rojo: "I am desperate to get onto the field and play because I have not been able to step onto Old Trafford [yet]. I am very happy to be at Manchester United, a top team in the world, sharing a dressing room with players like Wayne Rooney, Robin Van Persie, Angel Di Maria and now Radamel Falcao. This is a very important step in my career as a player and as a person. Everything that has happened to me since the World Cup has been a dream."

Great stuff from the lad. Great attitude.

1387~~~
Yep, I love him already and he hasn't even played a single minute for us. A bit crazy, transfer muppet, says great things about United, already bought his wife and daughter a United kit oh and not bad at football, what's there not to like!

1388~~~
watched his compilation vs Germany, got me quite excited! Can't wait to see him play next week.

1389~~~
I can see this lad being a real cult hero. Seems delighted to be here and clearly a bit mental - great combination!

1390~~~
I think he'll be a fan favourite soon. I love the idea of Rafael, Jones and Rojo in the back line. All three of them are uncompromising and will fight for every ball and give everything on the pitch.

1391~~~
Why is him being "a bit mental" a good thing? Alarming number of people chiming with that addition.

1392~~~
becauses hes man utd and he'll do what he wants.

Seriously though, its probably because people think he'll fight to death for every loose ball and he'll put in some great tackles.

1393~~~
Vidic was a bit mental:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/iV7dVcBlRainq.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/iV7dVcBlRainq.gif"/> 

It's not a bad quality for a defender when you know they will fight for everything and leave nothing on the pitch.

1394~~~
I miss Vidic.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1395~~~
Maybe I'm just behind on the term. 'Mental' to me suggests irrationality, there's a difference between that and determination or being committed.

1396~~~
I was just thinking about that. The day we play with Rafael, Jones, Rojo and Shaw at the back will be insane. Or loco. Don't know how well it'll work out. They could be very very very wild and all, making very stupid errors. But those four combined with the likes of Di Maria, Rooney, RVP, Falcao, Mata, etc. will surely lead to something very special. Performing consistently immediately, I'm not too sure about that, but it will be extremely spectacular.

Can't wait for it to happen.

1397~~~
De Gea, Rafael, Jones, Rojo and Shaw have really big boots to fill. Sometimes the reality of us not having their predecessors kicks in hard. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1398~~~
I think Shaw has what it takes to show he is an improvement on Evra of last season over the next couple of years and depending on how he keeps developing, he may even be able to surpass Evra at his peak but the worrying thing is there's still a big question mark on the others.

1399~~~
It's Scottish.

1400~~~
Mental in England can often be used affectionately. Much like sayinf good ol' Roy Keane was a bit of a 'nutter'.

1401~~~
Our backline is missing a commanding no-nonsense figure like Vidic or even Rio. Ferdinand was extremely composed, assured, calculated and was never too aggressive or rash in his game and tackling but he had a sense of command and control over his area which belied his calm demeanour. Strikers didn't quite enjoy coming up against him as he basically had everything and was in control of the situation without necessarily being fierce. He could turn it up if he wanted to mind you, but it just wasn't his style.

As of now our defence looks rather fragile and weak. Evans, Jones, Smalling and Blakcett aren't exactly the authoritative commanding presences that our defence is screaming out for. Jones is more rash than commanding imo, although with age and experience he could grow into this role. Strikers nowdays are just itching to have a go at our shoddy and shaky defence nowdays and the fear-factor seems to have vanished. That is exactly why people feel being a 'bit mental' is a good thing because our defence really needs someone like that. Someone bullish who can take control of our defence, organise it and lead/inspire the others. Rojo looks like he has the mentality and qualities to do exactly that. Whether he is good enough and can cut it at this level remains to be seen but I certainly have high hopes for him.

No one wants a rash nutter like Sergio Ramos or Pepe but we could certainly use a bit of fieriness and bloody-mindedness that Rojo could provide. However, with these type of players, you have the possibility of them going over-board or lashing out times ala the old Rooney but that is the baggage that you have to deal with. Rojo has an extremely poor disciplinary record which is indicative of this. LVG is experienced enough and would be able to tutor Rojo into cutting out unwanted elements from his game whilst Rojo should naturally grow better with experience in this regard.

1402~~~
Mental: Does what he wants when he wants. Hard as feck. Never backs out of challenges and sticks his head infront of anything.

Sentence: "look at that mental cnt shagging the queen"

1403~~~
I'm just gonna say it here: I think he will surprise a heck of a lot of people this season. Has had a good World Cup in a unfamiliar role after an impressive season at Sporting at CB. For £16m, I think we have got ourselves a bargain here, and in combination with Blind, I think our team will look a whole lot more solid. One more world class midfielder and CB (or Evans growing into the role next to Rojo) and our squad will be looking a whole lot stronger, IMO.

1404~~~
He's a fighter, that much is clear, but I am glad to hear him described as humble as well. I think he'll bring some steel into the side and into the defense that is now Vidic-less.

1405~~~
He'll probably yell at a few people against QPR and this place will get a boner at how much for a 'fearless leader' he looks.

1406~~~
I wonder if he might start at LWB until Shaw is fit?

1407~~~
Makes a difference to the gormless Smalling I suppose.

1408~~~
Didn't LvG say Shaw had worked hard and got himself fit?

1409~~~
Will Shaw be fit for the Qpr game??

1410~~~
I believe so, yes.

1411~~~
Shaw would be a massive plus, having a player capable of playing the wingback role, allows Rojo to start CB too.

1412~~~
I hope so. Will be good to see him in action.

1413~~~
QPR at home should be a good game to make his debut, don't see any reason why he won't start.

1414~~~
is he cleared to play for us yet ?

1415~~~
Yes, he is now.

1416~~~
cheers

1417~~~

1418~~~
Its hardly our or Rojo''s fault that Sporting accepting such deal. Clubs should stop living beyond their means by bringing players they cant afford

1419~~~

36 pages about the Manchester United performances of Marcos Rojo in 2014/15...

1421~~~
So much tatoos <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Wonder how these people will feel at 50-60.

1422~~~
I don't know much about tattoos, nor would I ever get any, but someone once redirected me to this. <a class="externalLink" href="http://imgur.com/gallery/y8k0L" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gallery/y8k0L</a> Guess it depends on how you treat your body and how good the artist was?

1423~~~
I don't like to judge people but this is horrible.

1424~~~
Can't wait to see him play, hopefully he starts Sunday. Him and Herrera are my favorite signings from this summer.

1425~~~
Needs more Angel.

1426~~~
It's not the tattoos that are the problem.

It's that fecking cap while in some restaurant with your mother. That's just bad.

1427~~~
He's not the only one. There's another guy wearing a cap right behind him.

1428~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1429~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1430~~~
And he looks the spitting image of  Rojo.

1431~~~
Looking forward to seeing this headcase play for us. Gonna be a fans favourite.

1432~~~
Really looking forward to see him more. He'll get a run for few games too now probably before the United defenders injury bug catches up. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1433~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1434~~~
Yes, he has tattoos, probably a fecking criminal too no doubt. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

When he's 50-60 he'll feel like any other person would at that age - older. But he'll still have tattoos that are cool as shit. What a flaccid argument against tattoos that is.

1435~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1436~~~
I'm not arguing against them. I think the link I posted was proving that they look fine when you're old... I really couldn't care less about whether a player has them or not.

1437~~~
more hellboy, not you.

1438~~~
If he can stay fit he'll be an instant upgrade on Evans, Jones and Smalling, however well he plays.

Absolute joke that we're not 2 months into the season and yet those 3 sicknotes have already all picked up injuries.

1439~~~
That guy Carvalho is going to be in for a real surprise when this thing ends up in court. Like it or not, third party ownership is legal in a lot of Countries and he cannot hide behind that. Doyen sports is not going to invest that huge amount of money without having a water tight contract. Usually it's the people who like to live beyond their means who fail to notice the full disclosures in a contract.

1440~~~
Looking forward to seeing him play tomorrow. Hope he hits the ground running.

1441~~~
Must be my archaic eastern culture.

1442~~~
the argument against tattoos doesn't make any sense.

1443~~~
Nothing can come good after this.

1444~~~
Haha, reminds me of "I'm not racist but..."

1445~~~
Really annoys me this. Quite happy to take their money to buy a player they can't afford.

1446~~~
Or, "No offence mate, but......"

1447~~~
Haha, this was another thread first and was changed into the performances thread, thus the length.

And people aren't really sticking to the idea of "talk about their play in performance threads" while having a generic thread for each player as well. And having separate threads on any detail now, instead of megathreads.

1448~~~
It's getting very messy now isn't it.

1449~~~
Or no disrespect to ............ But

1450~~~
Is it? I mean is it? 

All I see are a bunch of old people who have tattoos who otherwise seems to be leading normal lives.

1451~~~
Just like you're entitled to your opinion that tattoos like fine, others are entitled to their opinion that they don't like the look of tattoos.

1452~~~
Hope he assaults Joey Barton.

1453~~~
Yep, they are. Doesn't mean you can't be of the opinion that you dislike their tattoos.

1454~~~
Looks like he has to play on Sunday

1455~~~
A positive forced upon us which is nice for a change.

1456~~~
Just hope he has a great start, otherwise the car wolfs will be all over him

1457~~~
I'm hoping this time next year people are more used to it and it works better. Making two threads minimum for each player than can be expected to be bumped regularly (genetic thread and performances thread) does take up a lot of space on the first page of the site and the United forum, so people will have to dig more.

I'm thinking right now they're too lazy to dig and just click the first thread they see with the player's name.

1458~~~
I think Shaw's been training for like 3 weeks now.

1459~~~
LVG said yesterday that LS is fit but not ready for 90 minutes.

1460~~~
Car wolfs?  Lord, that sounds frightening.

1461~~~
Well done <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1462~~~
he was incredibly big-headed and offensive about his opinion.

1463~~~
His thread not bumped? Thought he had a terrific debut half

1464~~~
Looks like he has an excellent understanding with Di Maria. Clearly a very athletic player. Would be very interesting to see how he performs as a centreback when Luke Shaw comes back into the lineup.

1465~~~
He's been good and bad. 

Had 2 dodgy moments like the One with De Gea and one where he jumped under the ball to be bailed out by Rafael clearance.

Still impressive debut.

1466~~~
I reckon shaw will come on for Blackett or Evans and rojo will move into the centre

Versatility <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1467~~~
Solid as hell this guy, no nerves, just getting shit done. Obviously has a great linkup with ADM on the left, but we will lose that when Shaw is back.

1468~~~
Has he won every single header?!

1469~~~
Clearly needs more time with the first to develop some understanding.

He's gonna have some serious conversation with De Gea about clearing the ball from danger.

1470~~~
A couple of errors but no nerves on him at all. Always looking to get forward and pass forward. Nice

1471~~~
Reminds me a bit of Gabi Heinze, less impulsive though. He doesn't jump in as much as Heinze did, he's just really solid.

1472~~~
Not the match to judge him on really but good to get him some minutes

1473~~~
Yes. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s14.postimg.org/xz3aje4ox/Untitled.png" src="http://s14.postimg.org/xz3aje4ox/Untitled.png"/></a>

1474~~~
Looks like he played accordingly with my descriptions. Aggressive, aerily strong and prone to the occasional lapse. Strong debut. Surprised he didn´t get a yellow, Van Gaal must be working his magic already.

1475~~~
Very dynamic player, coaches dream in terms of potential

1476~~~
He looks very good on the ball. A very Van Gaal esque defender.

Seems to have already struck a good relationship with Di Maria down the left. 

Shaw will find it difficult to get in.

1477~~~
I thought Rojo had an exceptional game and so did many of our players including Blind, Rafael, Herrera and Di Maria. Excellent home debut for all those players which will really boost their confidence. Finally we look like Manchester United.

1478~~~
Love him already. You can just tell how much he's loving playing for United.

Looks like a proper leader as well. Ws being very vocal with Blackett at times, pointing at where to pass it, I like that.

1479~~~
Very assured performance, looked a little nervy at the start but that's to be expected. I think he will eventually move inside with Luke Shaw at left back with Marcos partnering one of Evans, Jones, Smalling, Blackett.

1480~~~
He was too forward in left wing multiple times. Got me worried a little. Solid otherwise though.

1481~~~
Decent enough debut. I think he can do a good job at LB but I'd prefer Shaw there when he gets back to full fitness.

1482~~~
He looks fairly solid, good on the ball and carries a hint of aggression. I like to see that in our defenders. A pretty good debut for him and there'll be much more to come.

1483~~~
Solid in his defending and has a good chemistry with Di Maria on the left.

Love how chuffed he was when ADM scored.

1484~~~
Exactly, felt like watching Utd again.

1485~~~
I liked him, good debut. Nice and solid hope theres more to come.

1486~~~
Was really good, dominated the left side alongside Di Maria. Solid defensively, also contributed to our attacks.

1487~~~
I believe there's a lot more in his locker. It was a neat solid performance. Like it.

1488~~~
I still don't get why people assume Shaw will start and he will be moved to CB. If he is performing leave him to it and let Shaw win his place.

1489~~~
Because Rojo is primarily a CB and it's his best position, and he's probably the best CB we have.

1490~~~
Because he's mainly a center back and Shaw is class and will break in the team sooner rather then later.

1491~~~
Good solid start.

1492~~~
Our other CBs are generally crap?

1493~~~
We've lost our identity. <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

1494~~~
Especially towards the end when players were passing the ball here and there, just killing time..

1495~~~
perfect for the league. has a presence about him. really liked his runs into the box beyond di maria. if we had good CBs he would start ahead of shaw. 

that being said needs to be careful about being overenthusiastic about tackling. needs to be calmer. missed a header and put the back line in danger at one point against QPR. cant afford to that against bigger teams.

1496~~~
I thought he had a good debut, some nice link-up play with Di Maria, lots of energy and defensively efficient. If you look at the two errors he was involved in I think De Gea and Blackett were as much, if not more to blame.

1497~~~
Very good on the ball. Didn't really have to do much defending, although there was a few hairy moments in the game (not just him, our defence as a whole), but got forward well, kept it well and made some very neat passes. I like him. 

I think when Shaw gets back, I'm pretty sure Rojo will slot into where Blackett was playing today.

1498~~~
The way he links up with Di Maria, I don't think Shaw will have an easy time moving him from LB.

1499~~~
He will because Rojo will play as a central defender.

1500~~~
He's a bit good in the air isn't he?

1501~~~
Looking at Rojo today, and how much of a leader he seems, I think he needs to go straight into the middle as soon as possible. We massively lack any authority back there.

1502~~~
He's a beast, I love him!

1503~~~
Well luckily for him, he didn't have to make any real dangerous tackles at all. But he certainly showed everything else that you told us about!

Shaw certainly has a battle on his hands to get into the team. Or probably not, cuz you know that Evans is going to get injured soon anyway.

1504~~~
Even worse, our soul.

1505~~~
I really like the look of him. He's aggressive, strong and very classy and composed on the ball on the ball. He's quite a good passer as well.

1506~~~
That was a good, solid debut and I'm sure there is more to come. I didn't know he is that strong in the air so I'm confident he can play as a CB as well

1507~~~
Fecking love the look of this fella. Really impressive debut. Him and Jones could be one hell of an aggresive and effective CB pairing.

1508~~~
Thought he did well and think he'll become a top defender in time. By the end of the game he looked like it was too easy for him, he was literally winning everything that fell within his area and nonchalantly distributing the ball.

1509~~~
Reminds me a lot like Heinze in his play. Well Heinze in his first season. Very aggressive, good in the air and decent going forward.

1510~~~
There was one bit, where he nonchalantly won the ball off a QPR player, turned and looked to have a short discussion with Blackett before passing it. No hassle.

1511~~~
The only problem is that if you put the two of them infront of a Diego Costa, there will be red cards and injuries.

1512~~~
I really liked how he 'just gone on with it' no dilly-dallying around taking 15 touches a la fletch/evans, just won the ball and passed it quickly.

Good stuff!

1513~~~
Another who can be very pleased with their work today. Promising performance. Good to see.

1514~~~
Faultless with the ball today. Never tested defensively but great debut all the same. Lets hope he can defend aswell as he can play with the ball.

1515~~~
Rojo and Jones as a partnership if they stayed fully fit for 10-15 games would make us solid at the back again with Shaw and Rafael as wing backs we'd be great! Just getting Jones fit that seems to be the problem.

1516~~~
For Costa, hopefully.

1517~~~
Another good debut, but I loved him already before he had even kicked a ball for us <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Once his understanding with DDG and our other defenders improves, our defence will be great!

1518~~~
The other thing is that he seems to be super excited to play for us. Broke out into a massive grin at the full time whistle! Showed no nerves at all though. Confident passing from the first minute

1519~~~
He looked so happy when Di Maria scored <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1520~~~
Great addition to the team.

1521~~~
Didn't really stand out for me which is why at LB with a diamond in front of him I'd have Shaw in the side for his greater attacking threat

1522~~~
More games like that will do very nicely.

He'll be tested far more and by far better opponents but it was a really good start and like others have said, he was hugely happy when Di Maria scored. Hopefully he can gel with the rest of the squad and we get some good team spirit building.

1523~~~
Looks good defensively but it's obvious he is a CB.

1524~~~
Couldn't have asked for a better fixture for him to make his debut. Had very little trouble, apart from the cluster f*ck with DDG in the 1st half, I'm sure that was just debut nerves though, I'm not worried.

1525~~~
Looked solid overall and a character to boot. I like him.

1526~~~
It´s still early stages but with his caractheristics and the way he plays, i suspected since the start that he will become a fan favourite. To be fair, it was only QPR, i´m going to see what are the reactions when he has his customary disciplinary brain farts. Believe me, it will happen. Even with Van Gaal´s backstage work, it´s part of his personality, part of his blood. Like i said in previous posts, he has the ability to leave us fans delighted, only to throw it away with a stupid rash challenge. Rinse and repeat. Would have loved to see him getting the "hairdryer" from Fergie <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1527~~~
He passed the ball quickly and into good areas. Did pretty much everything you'd want from a standin leftback

1528~~~
I thought he was very impressive today. Deceptively strong and especially when tackling. I was laughing my head off when he knocked Sandro "the beast" over. I think he must have eaten all the nails that were left outside Carrington!

1529~~~

1530~~~
It was very clear that he's a ball playing center back but he's got the positional sense to be quite effective at left back. It's good to see that he can play there when we need to rest Shaw, else I think he would always start at CB. ABUs keep talking about our lack of pace in our back 4, wait until Shaw's in there. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1531~~~
Thought he was solid. Nice to see his desire to win the ball back, looks a solid addition to the back line.

1532~~~
Understated performance it would seem judging by this thread.
Got forward well as a FB and capable on the ball, had a few brainfart moments, most notably when De Gea came racing out like a twat he should have found row Z and trusted his decision making but he instead trusted his keeper. Youth. 
Clearly a ball player and did excellently well at LB, is he better at CB then Blackett though ? Blackett gets very little attention here despite him holding down a first team CB spot out of the blue, should be a good bit of competition for the position which is always good.

1533~~~
<a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> What do you make of Rojo as a leader?...From today he looked very much a leader type, taking control of lots of situations, talking with Blackett a lot and helping him with where to pass it and what not, is that something that is generally part of his game?

1534~~~
just saw that he retweeted something like 6 or 7 tweets from fans congratulating him to his debut and victory against QPR <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a guy.

1535~~~
Was excellent today. Feel like £16m for him and Blind were bargains. Obviously only time will tell but both had great debuts.

1536~~~
He's a lot more classy than Heinze and more athletic. Better defender - don't know but on the ball he's very composed.

1537~~~
His passing is excellent.

1538~~~
The lad is infectious. If you notice in the goal celebrations he was nearly always the first one there with a big beaming smile on his face, even if they were celebrating at the right side corner flag <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1539~~~
Not a tough game at all but thought he did well.

There was one mistake in the first half that could have led to a goal. Aside from that he looked classy, quick, strong in the air, and passed the ball well.

1540~~~
Very impressed by him, his distribution is excellent, extremely positive debut.

1541~~~
What I liked about him was that he didn't bomb forward every single time and thus risk getting caught out. Unlike say Evra in his final years.

I thought he chose his moments effectively and did very well to create space for Di Maria when needed. Also he looks like an excellent passer and not simply a fullback that overlaps and crosses.

Think Shaw will have a tough time getting in the starting 11 when everyone is fit and should we stick to the back 4.

You'd think the preferred back 4 will be 2 of Smalling/Evans/Jones with Rafael and Rojo as fullbacks.

1542~~~
Rojo is primarily a center back though so I wouldn't worry about shaw. Especially with our center backs always being injured, I think more often then not rojo will be in the middle. He's definitely capable of filling in on the left though. He's like a left footed jones, just more experienced.

1543~~~
He seems genuinely delighted to be at United judging by his body language. Him and Herrera. Someone on UWS said this:

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

His face when ADM scored too, priceless.

1544~~~
Absolutely. He was always the 3rd/4th to celebrate on the goals, even though he wasnt always so close. He just ran to get there, while others just jogged. It was great to see. What i noticed is that he always went to Rooney after the goals to put his arms around him and tapped him at the back of his head while smiling. Just brilliant

1545~~~
Lol first thing I thought was "feck he has a long right arm" haha

1546~~~
Was pleased with him. Looked solid enough and will most likely improve with time. He looked really good when he was passing the ball around, still had the odd bad defensive moment but hopefully that'll be sorted out as he plays more.

1547~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1548~~~
hahah, I thought so too, I was like - is he holding that Heineken or what. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>


Anyway in some future games I think he could be moved to CB as Shaw as LB I reckon.

All in all a good debut, looked composed on the ball, never complicated with the bqall, good going forward and good defensively. What I liked the most is that it seemed he enjoyed playing out there, especially on the left side with his pal Angel. It seemed like they would pass to each other endlessly  if they could. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1549~~~
Yea saw that! When he started jogging towards the Stretty he broke into a massive grin. He's loving it here

1550~~~
Good boy - great purchase. Still think he is better as left CB but he played a very solid gane.

1551~~~
I thought he gave a very solid performance. In a way I think the fact that three of our new signings (Rojo, Blind and Di Maria) got to the latter stages of the world cup definitely helped in raising the confidence in their team mates. All three played with composure and almost an air of "This is how it should be done" which really helped.

I know a lot of people are suggesting our defence is weak but a back four of Rafael, Jones, Rojo, Shaw (providing he plays like last season) could be very solid given a good run of games

1552~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUjIm2shfQU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1553~~~
Haha, I spotted that. Thought he was trying to catch up with a player in front of him but can't remember who.

1554~~~
Pretty good debut, obviously not tested too much and played a LB but I love his passing ability, he's good at it thus I think he'll do well as a ball playing CB at the back.

1555~~~
He's clearly a mad bastard.

I like him a lot.

1556~~~
The difference in his passing ability compared to our other defenders is astounding. Always willing to take the risk and play it forward. About 75% of his passes were forward. Very good on the ball, and he is a beast in the air. Going to love this guy.

1557~~~
Reports from Portugal seemed to suggest a performance of that magnitude yesterday would be a rare occurrence. Let's hope he kicks on and maintains this form.

Showed great physicality, work rate, pace, energy and discipline. As mentioned before, his passing was often exemplary. While Luke Shaw may be made to wait for a first team debut at left back, this could be a good thing for his long term progression at United and development under LVG. Immediately we have a great set of options on the left side and the pressure for Shaw to come in and be a world class left back have softened.

The man with 'Pride' and 'Glory' tattooed on his legs could easily become a fan favourite if this level continues.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/14/1410708065267_Image_galleryImage_Manchester_United_s_Argen.JPG" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/14/1410708065267_Image_galleryImage_Manchester_United_s_Argen.JPG"/>

1558~~~
He's the type of players that would die on the pitch for the team and his team mates - exactly what we needed. Let's hope he continues like he started

1559~~~
No, I don't think so. The Sporting supporter <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> said that he was probably their best defender last season and was consistently good. According to him, his only issue is getting too many cards due to rash tackles.

1560~~~
Yes, he is a very vocal and interventive player. At Sporting it was the same thing. On set pieces, he was always shouting and giving instructions to players. It´s part of his personality. The same personality he uses to intimidate the opponents. For him to be a true leader he has to learn to control his temperament though. He has to set the example but his disciplinary record is a big handicap. Let´s see how he does in England, under Van Gaal´s influence.

1561~~~
I noticed how Rooney went up to him after the end of the first half and spoke to him, clearly giving him props for his performance. I was really impressed with him.

1562~~~
Handled himself quite nicely yesterday. Impressed by his and Blind's performances yesterday. It was great yesterday, such a big buzz and it showed in the performances.

1563~~~
"<i>The confusion between David de Gea and Marcos Rojo may be due to the language barrier.</i>"

- Lee Dixon

1564~~~
Obviously. One speaks Argentinian and the other speaks Spanish.

<span style="color: #ffffff">bite.</span>

1565~~~
From this performance he's a CB playing LB, but looked comfortable throughout, good distribution, won headers, looked fearless. And kept things simple on his debut, which for me is a positive. Good start from him

1566~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Has Rojo got a chant yet? I reckon the Yaya chant would work with his name perfectly. But not sure if it would catch on because Citeh fans use it all the time.

1567~~~
I reckon Rojo is going to end up in the Gary Neville/Garbriel Heinze school of popularity. Not the worlds greatest in terms of skill, but the endeavour and emotion on the pitch are going to be really popular with the fans. 

I can already picture him running 60 yards down the pitch to celebrate a winner in front of the scousers...

1568~~~
Did he say that? 'kinell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1569~~~
Beast in the air, don't think I saw him lose one aerial duel.

1570~~~
Tbf hasn't LVG banned any language bar English being spoken?

1571~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a tool.
Yeah that Argentinian language is hard to comprehend.

1572~~~
Rojo panicked and yelled "parlez vous francais?" while De Gea hollered, "fur fecks sake, ge oot da wey, I cannae see!"

1573~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1574~~~
... And to think we could have had Vermaelen, definitely dodged a bullet. Think he'll make that 16m we paid for him look a bargain if he carries on at this rate.
If him and Blind carry on in the same vein, Utd will have went a long way to solving two of their biggest squad issues for less than a Mangala!

1575~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Did he actually say that? Dixon usually is decent at punditry to be fair.

1576~~~
nice to know he is good in the air.

1577~~~
<i>Marcos Rojo is a red, it's his surname</i>

1578~~~
A duo with Rojo/Smalling, aerial dominance.

1579~~~
Ay, from first impressions I'm glad we ended up with Rojo. Younger, fitter, more aggressive and more scope to improve. Plus I'm not a big fan of Vermaelen at left back.

1580~~~
United fans can once again love Argentina. The ghosts of Tevez and Heinze have been laid to rest.

1581~~~
This was discussed weeks ago. It's Rojo Rojo Rojo...... mushroom.

1582~~~
there's something lovably cnutish about him. Seems very passionate and like he's delighted to be here, and looks a suitably tough bastard too. I reckon he'll do really well here.

1583~~~
Has to happen <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1584~~~
Personally I thought he was quite good as a LB, if he can pass and move like that at CB it will be something to watch.

Jones and Rojo would be an intimidating pair to play against! <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

1585~~~
Yes, yes he did.

1588~~~
Did you also notice when we scored one of our goals, (it might have being mata's if I remember) after the players celebrated, Rooney and rojo walked away together but had their arms around each other laughing and joking, maybe Rooney is finally showing captain ability. 

God knows how rojo understands scouse. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1589~~~
To his credit he did feel pretty dumb and corrected it immediately afterwards though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1590~~~
Sounds very promising to me, we definaly need a vocal leader at the back. Cheers for the info <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a>

1591~~~
Very happy we got him instead of Vermaelen.  Hope van Gaal is too.

1593~~~
That was actually quite Evra-esque.

Maybe not as funny as Pat always used to be but good spirit returned with the pace of build ups.

1594~~~
We can't be sure he wasn't assaulting him there. Might have been having hallucinations of his neighbour back in Argentina.

Seriously though, like the look of him a lot and he seems to be a real character, probably will be influential in the dressing room after a while. Don't be surprised to see 'Pride and Love' tattooed on Shaw's chubby cheeks in a few weeks.

1598~~~
Very impressed by this guy - he looks like a top player.

I didn't watch the WC religiously, and didn't really notice him, but I was worried we had signed him on the back of a single good tournament which our manager happened to be around to see. Not the best way to acquire players. (I had concerns about Blind as well because of his connection with LvG). Sunday provided a lot of reassurance though.

Rojo looks such a talent that you wonder why he hasn't been snapped up before now. Where's the catch?

1599~~~
That's really good to see. He geniunely looks like he's one of those players who will really get the club and love playing for it. Something like how Evra was, and that was, as somebody mentioned, rather Evra like.

1600~~~
The bucketload of yellow and red cards he accumulated at Sporting. <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> pointed this out when we first got linked with him, that he is mint for four or five games then boom he does something stupid and is sent off, costs the team, comes back, looks good, rinse and repeat. Let's hope Van Gaal snaps him out such a vicious cycle.

You bastard, now I get this song in my head. And singing Marcos Rojo along it.

To be fair to Dixon and his quote, he laughed at himself being so thick afterwards when he realised what he said.

1603~~~
Looks aggressive and vocal. I like the guy.

1604~~~
I think someone whispered to him on his headset, doubt he realized his mistake himself.

1605~~~
Or maybe...

Best position: unknown
Marco Marco Marco-Marcos Rojo

1606~~~

1607~~~
Said this in the Rooney thread but they seem to be getting on well. I like that Rooney is helping him settle in.

1608~~~
All Latin pic.

1609~~~
YES! haha

1610~~~
His attitude is fantastic, I think he's going to be a big favourite here.

1611~~~
Absolutely fantastic how he settles and behaves at the club. Hugging Rooney all the time, being one of the first for the celebrations, smiling when arriving at OT, smiling during the warm up, smiling after the game and running to give Januzaj a hug, wife and kid with his United shirt after the transfer....some dont care for these things, but i like what he shows on and off the field.

1612~~~
He's got his wife and kid wearing a United shirt? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Awwww, that's awesome. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1616~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1617~~~
Plus his likes / following United on Instagram which actually started all those rumours and then once his transfer was confirmed he started liking United kits with Di Maria, Blind and Vidal!!!

1618~~~
Seems like a very likeable guy and looks like he is actually over the moon to be at the club which is great to see. On the football side of things he has started well, Sunday will be a bigger test for him at LB but I have faith that he will overcome that, I would like to see him moved over into CB once Shaw is fit though

1619~~~
Rather than a traditional chant I would love to see an old Trafford game of Marco Polo, obviously rebranding it to Marcos Rojo.

So basically a few people yell "Marcos" and the rest of OT responds "Rojo"

1620~~~
I don't know why I think that's such a great idea...

1621~~~
Why "Marcus" ? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1622~~~
I think it's sweet how he posts photos with his mum.

1623~~~
That's his new English name

1624~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1625~~~
Slowly becoming my favourite player, although only being here for a short amount of time. He's the type of player that just looks like he loves every minute of being at United, which is always a plus.

1626~~~
Shaw will be fit for the weekend. I hope he switches to CB and lets Shaw make his debut. Though, one has to say that he has a very good understanding with Di Maria. Something Shaw can pick up in short time because clearly Shaw is the better LB and the boy has natural passing ability too. Rojo looks built to be a mobile, strong CB.

1627~~~
Meh

1628~~~
I wonder if he is being advised to study Jagielka's game in an attempt to improve his own <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

1629~~~
That joke is so last year.

1630~~~
Story of My life pal.

1631~~~
Obviously he needs to study de Vrij.

1632~~~
Who is between Anderson and Valencia?

1633~~~
Andreas Pereira.

1634~~~
Give us Rojo back (watch Maribor´s equalizer and you will understand)

1635~~~
Strong in the air and comfortable with the ball at his feet, very good debut too mind. However its a different story playing LCB, I think he'll be fine but we'll never know until he plays. Shaw should be LB for me.

1636~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1637~~~
His daughter maybe be 5, but his wife is definitely a 9.

1638~~~
Enough joking around <a class="username" data-user="83479, @Señor" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83479/">@Señor</a> <a class="username" data-user="49749, @Ish84045" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49749/">@Ish84045</a> and others talking about his daughter - get back on topic.

1639~~~
I'm still wondering about where LVG is going to play him most. Is he going to play CB or as a backup lb/rotating with shaw?

1640~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> Leave our Rojo alone, we love him already! And don't be ungrateful, we gave you Nani and are paying his wages <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1641~~~
You guys are such creeps. 

Anyway, I reckon that he'll be a center back in the long run but for now he will get thrown into the LB spot here and there. I think he'll have achieved more than a few trophies by the time he leaves us. He'll be amazing.

1642~~~
We need some of that, for a little while anyway. During the last few months you could never really notice any passion or enthusiasm in our play and tackles but against QPR the players were putting in some hard tackles. It was great to watch.

1643~~~
LVG has got balls big enough to start a twenty year old in central defence in the PL, he will definitely play Rojo at CB and the rest is dependent on whether he can make the role his own.

1644~~~
Really impressive athletically, bit of a nutter in the violent sense and being to aggressive to come win the ball. Hopefully he'll be like Pepe and his good games will make up for his bad ones.

He does seem like he'll be good at chasing down balls when we press high and force the other teams to play longer, more direct football.

1645~~~
I thought Rojo had a effective, but quiet, performance in his United debut.  But that's exactly what you want to see from our defenders -- an effective and quiet performance.

With so much firepower up front I wouldn't expect to see Rojo launch forward very often.

1646~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1647~~~
Seems like a really genuine guy who genuinely loves being at the club and being with the other players. 

He'll become a fan favorite I feel.

1648~~~
He's a beast in the air.

1649~~~
Should move to CB once shaw is back to full fitness. Good in the air, comfortable on the ball. I guess he can be a huge success for us now.

Shame blackett might lose his place but reckon he will still get his chance as the season progress.

1650~~~

1651~~~
Having only seen him at LB and never at CB, this article is pretty damming  on his ability to play CB.

1652~~~
Apparently he's come on leaps and bounds at CB, especially last season <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> can confirm?

I'd say up until that point, he was a bit akin to a young Rio - subject to brain farts or lapses in concentration. The physique, technique and pace are all there to be a top CB. So let's hope he continues his improvement as a CB at United.

But it's probably fair to say that he's a bit more accomplished as a fullback, at this stage of his career. That's not to say he can't become a class CB.

1653~~~
People are very quick to praise him, he looked quite good last week end but made 2 or 3 mistakes. I'll wait & see him perform at CB before judging him. Love his passion & aggression though.

1654~~~
Horrible article from a clueless blogger. I already read some pieces from this clown Gonçalo Lopes and they were equally bad. Do english newspapers give article space to persons with no real references and indepth knowledge, just because they are portuguese? One of the biggest mistakes on the article is this part: 

"But to do a great job at centre back, he has to have an excellent covering defender at his side. Here in Portugal he did well because he played with a great partner, Mauricio - they conceded 19 goals in 29 games, the fewest in the Primeira Liga - who had more experience in that position."

Wrong. Totally and utterly wrong (and unfortunately has been proved by our defensive performance this year). The part about our defence being the best in Portugal is correct and due to three factors: First, our former manager Leonardo Jardim who is a very good defensive and tactical manager, who´s best asset is to setting up good defensive schemes (something we lacked in the previous years, was our achilles heel)

Second was William Carvalho´s beast mode year. Carvalho´s excellent performances gave stability to our defensive midfield and complemented our center backs very well, specially Rojo.

Third, it was Rojo´s obvious improvement from last year. This can be explained for many reasons. First a good defensive tactical setup, second the unbreakable Jardim´s trust (he used to say Rojo´s name was the first on the team sheet) on Rojo that gave him alot of confidence and finally the fact that Rojo was leading the line and proving himself in one steady position, the center back position.

You can ask any rival and they will say that Rojo was obviously our best defender. To prove my point you just have to watch how horrible our defence has been this year. It´s true that we changed our manager since Jardim went to Mónaco, but besides the purchase of Sarr, our defense is still the same with Cedric, Maurício and Jefferson. Maurício (the supposed defender who is hailed by this clown Gonçalo Lopes) has been the worst of the bunch. You just have to see his error against Maribor in the Champions League to realize that. Our media has been unanimous, i repeat Unanimous, in the declaring that Maurício has been missing Rojo´s influence and ability to cover him. Our messageboard has also been unanimous in wanting Maurício dropped from the lineup. Manuel Fernandes (a former Sporting glory and top scorer) said yesterday that Rojo was the only top class defender we had last year and his departure is having a negative effect on our defence. 

Finally to finish my post, i never disputed the fact that for Argentina, Rojo played well as LB. He clearly has the trust of the Argentine managers for that position. At Sporting, he was always better as CB period. I know that it´s different circunstancies but Rojo was our best defender as center back. The stability of our defence depended on that. I still mantain my opinion, Rojo is clearly better as CB and has all the tools to become a world class player there. He just needs continuity and stability in the team to achieve that. If you keep changing his position and routines, of course he is prone to mistakes.

1655~~~
Nah he didn't make any mistakes that I can remember.

1656~~~
Had 2 mixups one with Blackett and one with De Gea though on both occasions you could say he was at little fault compared to De Gea or Blackett.

But he did get caught under a ball on one occasion setting Hoilett free on the right which Rafael bailed him out of intercepting the cross pretty well.

1657~~~
Ah yes, the Rafael bailout was certainly his error. The first 2 weren't his, IMO.

1658~~~

1659~~~
He´s playing for the first time in a new team, with new teammates and under a new manager. Training aside, i´d be very surprised if he didn´t do some mistakes on his debut. You just need to remember Evra and Vidic´s debut to understand that.

1660~~~
Well you've just shit all over that Daily Mail douche. Insightful post mate, cheers.

1661~~~
Im actually surprised a big (although crap) english newspaper would give article space to a blogger. What are his references? In Portugal, the newspapers give article space to people with actual knowledge and references. People like former players, managers or specialist journalists. Of course you can still find the occasional Lawro and Merson but their articles are much better and insightful. Kinda like Eurosport copying my opinion from the site. You guys know that i´m a Sporting fan and a season ticket owner but what stops me from typing BS like this Gonçalo Lopes fella? Do they even check facts before posting stuff? I know it´s just the Daily Mail but it´s perplexing to me.

1662~~~
Cheers for the post <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a>, it's reassuring to say the least.

1663~~~
Stopped reading the article as soon as it said "Rojo struggles in the air". They clearly didn't watch the QPR game.

1664~~~
It´s only one of his best assets.

You can further see how clueless he is here:

Gonçalo Lopes: "He can still do it but not with the same effectiveness as in his favourite position of left back"

Here´s what Marcos Rojo said when he signed for Sporting <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=572213&amp;tm=27&amp;layout=158&amp;visual=49" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=572213&amp;tm=27&amp;layout=158&amp;visual=49</a> :

"O internacional argentino, que se assume como "um jogador aguerrido e de pensamento positivo", adiantou preferir jogar a central, "mas se o treinador precisar de mim na esquerda não há problema".

Quickly translating: " The argentinian international assumes that he is an "aggressive player with positive mentality". He said that prefers to play as center back "but if the manager needs me on the left, there´s no problem".

As admited by him he prefers to play as CB not LB.

Gonçalo Lopes doesn´t know what he is talking about.

1665~~~
Some very helpful posts there Sly. Great having knowledgeable fans of other clubs on here. Cheers

1666~~~
<a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> comprehensively takes apart Gonçalo Lopes. You should write a proper rebuttal to Lopes' piece on Rojo and send it to the Daily Mail. Who knows? They might come knocking on your door for a column next time around. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1667~~~
I doubt they would take a leftie as myself <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I don´t really care about the Mail. It just amazes me, they post that kind of inaccurate crap. I don´t expect that clown to watch all Sporting matches like myself but a quick google search or a visit to our forum and he would see Rojo´s prefered position and the evaluation from Sporting fans (and we are a nasty bunch in what concerns criticizing our own players, something typical of Sporting fans). If it was the Guardian or the Independent, i would consider it eventually. What i earn by the hour as Lawyer would be hard to cover as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> (just kidding)

<a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> Cheers for the post mate, it's good to get some insight from an actual week to week watcher of the player.

1670~~~
Thanks for the kind words gents. The reality is that this forum and the people on it, motivate you to exchange points of views. Like Arruda said portuguese messageboards (besides Forum SCP in my biased opinion) are too radical and aggressive. No real banter or rival club supporters allowed. Interaction is minimal. The way british people in general live and discuss football is a big credit to your nations and a big evolution from an eventful past.

1671~~~
I want to see him and Smalling play together as the CB pairing tomorrow. Insane pace, aerial dominance, and two great players in not letting the opponent past in a one-on-ones with a forward.

1672~~~
We play sunday mate but yeah would like to see them 2 partnered together at some point

1673~~~
I really hope he plays tomorrow, I was impressed by his debut for us and would love to see him as a CB now. It's going to be tricky for LVG if we, hopefully, stick to the 4-4-2 diamond now. Smalling, Blacket, Rojo, Evans up for two spots with Shaw being back(?) to play LB. It's pretty harsh to drop Blackett as he's been our best defender thus far but I suppose that it's how it will end.

1674~~~
We bought him for big money and he played well in his first game, there is absolutely no reason why he wouldn't play, so your hopes are in safe hands.

1675~~~
Been awful and looking uncomfortable with the pace of the game at LB.

1676~~~
I'm unsure about this lads positioning, twice today he has tucked in far too close to play and left a massive hole which has nearly cost us, both times he was essentially watching the game instead of keeping an eye on his winger.

1677~~~
Struggled today both in defence and attack. Should never of let Vardy get that ball over for the goal. His crossing hasn't been good either and that shot was poor. Had a massive chance with the header, which he should of buried.

1678~~~
Want to see Shaw at LB and Rojo to compete for one of the CB spots.

1679~~~
Positionally he is having a mare, I'd get Shaw on.

1680~~~
Has been pretty unconvincing. It reminds me of some perfomances as LB for Sporting. Let´s face it, one thing is to play a tournament as LB, another is to play a whole campaign in that position. I reiterate that i think it´s a waste of potencial to play him as LB. It can be a stop-gap solution but nothing more than that. The CB position is where he takes full advantage of his caractheristics.

1681~~~
Seems too keen to bomb forward. Ends up taking up taking a far too advanced a position for a fullback. His position is perfect for a wingback but not an FB in a backline of 4 players. Also getting targetted by Leicester too, they're doubling up on him too as Di Maria isn't really providing much cover.

Basically he's playing like a wingback rather than a fullback and Leicester are make the most of it

1682~~~
Been terrible today, but he's not a natural left back. Still, his positional intelligence and awareness leaves a lot to be desired at times.

1683~~~
See, this scares me, how can your natural position be centre half when you lack positional intelligence and awareness?

Terrible signing, said it at the time, we lost Rio and Vidic and this is the pile of shit we get in?

1684~~~
Not impressed at all thus far. Also culpable for the fourth goal, the pass he gave Mata was impossible to do anything with. Not to mention he's all over the place positionally. 16 million and a free Nani seems like a very bad deal.

1685~~~
Perhaps his lack of positional intelligence and awareness comes from the fact that he doesn´t have the routines to play in that position? Like i said (and unfortunately for you guys) he isn´t a LB. He´s a CB. Playing as LB is a stop gap solution. Not surprising that two years ago after he played a couple of games as LB our managers always put him as CB. I warned that the first real test would be an away fixture.

1686~~~
He looks like he doesn't give a shit out there today. How Shaw isn't getting a game is beyond me.

1687~~~
He's awful

1688~~~
Knee jerk central in here.

1689~~~
Shittiest player in the defence in today's game. Offered very little going forward too.

Why has Shaw not come on?

1690~~~
Well has to be one of the worst performance of a United player i can remember, he and Clattenburg were at the same level today..

1691~~~
Our worst player today by a long way. Even considering the Penalty Blackett gave away. He was all over the place, he caused our play to break down a lot and a few times I saw him jogging back casually when opposition players were running past him.

1692~~~
Very poor today. He may not be a left back but he should be doing a lot better, especially when they were constantly attacking down his side. Hope Shaw starts next week.

1693~~~
Maybe because this is his 2nd game and in his first he played well!

1694~~~
He was crap. Nothing going forward and got done one too many times.

Where was Shaw. Doesn't he like him?

1695~~~
Pretty useless today, both in attack and defense.  What does Luke Shaw have to do to get a match?

1696~~~
As soon as he took that long range effort in the first half I was like "oh, he's one of those is he?". Not convinced.

1697~~~
He was alright during the WC, but a huge weak link and bombscare during Argentina's WC qualifiers. I don't rate him

1698~~~
I think he's a better Centre Back than a Left Back. He was all over the place positionally today and didn't look to comfortable on the ball. Surprised Shaw isn't ready yet. I hope he puts this behind him and kicks on, but today he was very poor.

1699~~~
Kop out excuse, its not like he's never played left back. He was there at the World Cup. His lack of effort and desire to run back was actually more scarier than his embarrassing positioning. 
When he's at centre back is that what he does too when someone gets behind him, just gives up and casually jogs back.
He got roasted by Ritchie fecking De Laet, doesn't get any lower than that, I can take someone being a shit footballer but lack of effort drives me nuts. Good to see he has both.

1700~~~
Holy feck balls was he bad today! It was like he'd never heard of positional play.

1701~~~
Totally not convinced with him at LB, surely Shaw should get a game now.

1702~~~
Let's not be knee jerk. Too early to make decisions about him. The defence players here were crap and have been long before he arrived.

1703~~~
Wanted Shaw to replace him but obviously once we went behind attacking subs had to be made. Wasn't very good today. Defensively his positioning was bad, Blackett did well covering him often.

1704~~~
Wow opinions in here have changed massively.

1705~~~
Looked very weak defensively today

1706~~~
It isn´t an excuse it´s the sensible explanation. He played a Wc as LB in contrast with 2 years as CB, of course he doesn´t have the same stability and routine that he has in the CB position. It´s like having Smalling play as RB and then as CB. The difference is clear. The part about jogging back and lack of effort, there´s no excuse for that really, i agree.
As CB for Sporting i never seen him do that, then again our manager and defence never had this kind of meltdown like United showed today. He played in a safe enviroment with emphasis to defensive stability in 4-5-1. This tactical experiment by Van Gaal was atrocious. If that happened, who knows, perhaps he would do the same jogging back. But i´m on your camp, the lack of effort infuriates me on any player whether it´s a shit footballer or a skilled footballer. You have to earn the wage.

1707~~~
Play the guy at CB. No way he should be ahead of Shaw at LB.

1708~~~
With Evans out and Blacket suspended, Rojo will play CB next week and hopefully that's the end of him at LB. Absolute joke of a performance.

1709~~~
Is his positioning better at CB? 

It was like Evra of last few years was back.

1710~~~
second worst payer after van persie, he is not any better as leftback than jones as a rb

1711~~~
I'm guessing we will see him in his main position next weekend. Poor game today.

1712~~~
Agree. Why did he do well as LB for Argentina? The reason is clear, stable eleven, team with more quality that spends more time controlling the ball and the opponent and less time on their defensive end with considerably less pressure. It´s completely different circumstances.

1713~~~
Rojo out, Shaw in. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1714~~~
He was piss poor today.

1715~~~
Rojo to CB, and Shaw at LB. After Evans' injury and Blackett's suspension, we don't have any option anyway.

1716~~~
Talk about knee jerk. Last week he was the loveable passionate guy who we will all love, today his a piece of shite and is thick as shit!

Grow up!!!

1717~~~
Is it the same set of users calling him that or changing their tune or is it different users with different opinions saying different things?  Or is the caf some kind multiheaded hydra with hive mentality where the opinion of a few users dictates the opinion of everyone else?

1718~~~
That was truly shocking defensively from him, by a distance the worst performer on the pitch. You can pick out huge mistakes from him in every single goal, bar the Rafael penalty. Luckily he's got the physical tools so if someone can teach him where to stand and when not to overlap hopefully he can improve on this.

1719~~~
I said it in Daley Blind's player thread and I think the same applies to Rojo, perhaps even more so. A first Premier League away game against a side like Leicester is like getting thrown into a bear pit. He's played in big matches I'm sure but today will have been unique in its own way. 

Get him playing in his natural position and allow him some time to settle. Hopefully things improve.

1720~~~
Said before he signed that he was always likely to struggle to adapt to the PL at first due to his style of play. This sort of player is always likely to be exposed until they fully adjust and that was always going to take time.

Various reports when we signed him suggested he wasn't really United quality. That may or may not be true but it's far too early to tell at this stage. People already overreacted to his performance in the QPR game, it'd be stupid to overreact to this game too.

Of all our signings this guy is the one who's gonna need the most patience.

1721~~~
I don't think there is anything wrong in berating a player if he has a stinker and Rojo did have a stinker. He didn't have anything to do last week. He was at fault for the first goal because he shouldnt have let in that cross, he gave the ball away a few times and was he at fault for the 4th goal was debatable. Im also not saying he should be dropped for ever. Just that today he was a bit shit and he needs to bounce back.

1722~~~
He had a very poor game today lets not execute him for it. Calling him a 'pile of shit' already I mean come on.

1723~~~
Not seen the game today but even against QPR he got caught out a couple of times positionally but fortunately it led to nothing then. No idea how he is at CB But that LB spot should be Shaw's.

1724~~~
He looked well off the pace today - looked as though he was running through treacle, weak in the air and never close enough to his man. Still early days, but he's certainly not leadership material, struggling to see how he's a centre back to be honest.

1725~~~
I'm not really seeing that this guy is an improvement on Buttner if I'm completely honest.

1726~~~
...

1727~~~
The contrast from the QPR to this game is incredible. That said, Rojo was tested a lot more in this game today. Lets not forget it's his second game for us and is still adjusting to EPL football. Give the lad some time before we crucify him.

1728~~~
With Evans injured, Jones out, Blackett now suspended and Smalling thrown back in, it looks like a Smalling & Rojo partnership vs West Ham. Another test for him. Let's hope he can shake this off now and push forward again.

1729~~~
Looked good going forward last week and comfortable on the ball but wasn't tested defensively. Today he was tested defensively and was unconvincing but was equally as bad in attack. He wasn't alone as I thought Rafa didn't have his greatest game either and Blackett played ok but he should have covered Varney for that goal. As others have said I'm sceptical about him playing in the middle. Too soon to rate obviously but I think Shaw will be starting the next game.

1730~~~
First game performed well. 2nd match awful even before our meltdown. Early days for him. No idea if he'll end up being a solid left-back for us or a combative central defender, nevermind whether he'll be a starter or squad player. I think we have to recognise that players new to the PL are going to have days when the speed of the game overwhelms them.

1731~~~
I agree, he probably speaks no english right now as well, so he can't communicate too well with other defenders and that's bound to affect his understanding with them on the pitch. Plus, I didn't see too many of his team mates helping him defend on that left flank which Leicester were exploiting all game. Di Maria is not the type to track back constantly because he is trying to influence the game on the other end so you need Blind to help cover those positions and Herrera and Rooney should drop deep to protect the middle and right side. Its all about working as a unit, so we can't just blame one player for everything that went wrong. He had a bad game but we need to give him time.

1732~~~
At QPR he had no defending to do. He had the easiest start a player will ever have.

Maintain this lad will be a liability. Borderline David Luiz if played at CB.

Those brainless long range shots...

1733~~~
It might not be a bad idea to give him more than a few games before rushing to judgment. He was awful today, but surely you remember Vidic and Evra's first few months at the club. I swear, my 4-year old has more patience than some around here. It's fine to be upset about a display (I have a pretty negative review in the Van Gaal thread,) but rushing to such conclusions after 2 games is mind-boggling.

1734~~~
Dreadful today. Hoping for better at centre half.

1735~~~
I thought the idea was to play him on the left side of a back 3.

The 4-0 victory swayed LVG to keep 4 at the back.

1736~~~
Regardless of his performance and positional issues, next week we have little choice but to play him centre back with Shaw getting a go at left back. Blind needs to make sure he is giving the central defence as much support as possible.

1737~~~
When I said that he's not the answer to what we need I got criticized. Regrettably I was right

1738~~~
Disappointing today, hope he fares better at centre back. Was certainly culpable for one goal and possibly the decisive 4th, he look decent enough on the ball but oddly didn't seem to throw himself about, thought he would hack the lad down before the 1st goal. 

I'll be honest it's worrying that he was the cb of choice over the summer, considering Woody seemed to be pissing £s in every direction, surely we could have found someone better. Doesn't Jorge Mendes represent any defenders <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> ?

1739~~~
Lets get Shaw fit pronto. All i have to say.

1740~~~
At least you gave the guy a chance. 2 games and that's that, you're right.

1741~~~
You're so knee jerk these days. Did you think vidic would be crap too?

1742~~~
Poor game today but am interested to see him at centre half next week with Shaw at left back. Hopefully a better long term bet for us.

1743~~~
Probably.

In fairness, I did caveat my post by saying it's early days. I'm just calling it as I saw it - he looked rubbish today, and that's all I have to go by. He doesn't look like someone who's going to make a commanding centre half, but I'm always happy to be proven to be spectacularly wrong in such circumstances.

1744~~~
He was crap judging by today but by the same token judging by QPR he's mint.

I'd say: Listen to the Sporting fans who claim him to be twice the player when playing at CB, and also, not judge him on a match where the entire United team went to shit over a wrong pen.

1745~~~
It's one game. Why draw such pointless conclusions on the basis of one game? Players often take half a season adapting to this league.

1746~~~
I am not sure he should be playing fullback if I am honest. I got flashbacks of Evra charging up field and then just jogging back and not even trying to get back at various points.

1747~~~
I think people are forgetting he is a CB.

1748~~~
He is not a LB, should be doing better, but I can't blame him too much. First away game in the PL, with defense being shambles, and him playing out of position.

1749~~~
Just his second game. He's clearly miles better than Buttner.

1750~~~
It's not like he is incapable of doing the job. It's is not his favourite position, but certainly not one where he delivers a shambolic performance. He certainly is capable and has given better performances there before. He did not give a hit this game and we hope he gets better next. Hope LvG give him a earful.

1751~~~
Evra had an awful start to his Utd career but came good. Rojo has the quality, he will come right.

1752~~~
Was absolutely dreadful today. Thankfully Shaw is back at LB for WHU and he can slot in next to Smalling and Rafael keeps his RB spot.

Sort it lads.

1753~~~
Well unless there's an injury Rojo will start at CB vs West Ham and Shaw at LB. Let's see how he plays there and it is still early days. He was poor today though.

1754~~~
Shaw should be starting at LB once he is back to full fitness.

Things are not going to easy for rojo at CB too. I think we will have mares about him over the next few weeks or months, at least.Not that he got someone like vidic or a peak rio to help him to ease himself into PL football now.

1755~~~
He'll be alot better at CB, he played CB at Sporting and he was good at it. He has always been poorer on the leftback. Also give the guy a break, he is new to this club and to this league and the situation isn't exactly ideal to just settle in.

People having a go at him for one bad performance, Jezus.... I'd wish half of you were as critical to Smalling and Evans and Rafael if they make mistakes. Some guy on here even talking about him not being better than Büttner, fecking hell, go and have a talk to yourself. I have seen the lad on the world cup and based on those performances I think it is clear he is a solid defender and he can do alot better than what we have seen from him today. He just needs to settle in and needs a bit of time.

1756~~~
Really don't care how he performs at the moment, some players need time, just look at Evra and Vidic.

He was poor but nothing to suggest he won't develop.

1757~~~
I'd like to see Shaw start the next match. Rojo needs to improve his positioning. It was evident against QPR too - we just weren't punished.

1758~~~
Lad had a poor game defensively, but theres bugger all point crucifying him at this stage, plenty of time to improve.

1759~~~
I am not saying that he's shit. I am only saying that he's not the top quality CB/leader we need. He's more of a Silvestre then a Rio

1760~~~
I'd really like to see him at CB because I don't think its fair to crucify him just yet. He's absolutely incredible in the air and defensively pretty sound.

1761~~~
Apart from his positioning (as a LB anyway).

1762~~~
Clearly he should be playing at centreback. As promising as Blackett is, he can't be starting for us every week at age 20. Just doesn't have the experience yet. Rojo on the other hand seems decent in the air and is comfortable with the ball at his feet. It will also help him to have Luke Shaw to his left because Luke is our only natural left fullback.

1763~~~
Fair point, hence my caveat. But if we only drew conclusions after half a season then there'd be no posts on Redcafe until January. This is a forum - we discuss, criticise, praise and so forth. He was terrible yesterday and I called it. I didn't see the QPR game, but he drew plenty of praise after that - swings and roundabouts.

1764~~~
Yeah, that seems fair enough. He didn't look a very good full back yesterday. If he's been bought in as a CB, that's what he should be judged on.

1765~~~
No, we'd say things like the second and third bolded bits. We'd criticize and analyse performances. We wouldn't make sweeping conclusions about players' lack of suitability for their main position on the basis of one performance away from home in a new league. There's a lot of discussion that can happen without that.

1766~~~
Of course we can make sweeping conclusions, we're unimportant football fans on the Internet - stop being so self-important. I was raging after the game yesterday, as I'm sure a number of other United fans were - it was never going to be the time for sensible, balanced analysis. All power to you for being so level-headed.

In the cold light of day, of course he should be given time, and he will be.

1767~~~
I thought that once Evans was injured, LvG was going to bring on Shaw and move Rojo into the centre.

Awful game from him yesterday but he's still adjusting, I think he has the makings of a great CB.

1768~~~
People are being extremely harsh on the lad. Do I need to remind how piss poor Vidic and Evra were initially?

1769~~~
Two days ago: Rojo has a great attitude, gets stuck in, will be a fan favourite

Now: Rojo has a terrible attitude, spineless, can't believe we didn't buy any defenders

The lad's played two games.

1770~~~
Not everyone will do an Evra or Vidic. Obertan and Bebe were shite as well...and stayed shite.

He was rubbish yesterday, no harm in saying that. Hopefully he replaces Blackett at CB and Shaw plays at LB. That will be the time to judge him.

1771~~~
Lol gotta love the internet.

1772~~~
It's still this guy and one of the clowns as a support-cast for the two man centre-back partnership at the moment. Since our defenders don't really talk to each other ( other than in hospital ), I don't think that lack of ability to speak English is a huge problem.

1773~~~
I did find it amusing that as soon as he signed, everyone instantly had him as the first name on the team sheet practically.

In truth, he isn't really a different kettle of fish from what we already have in Jones, Evans, Smalling or Shaw - young players with a lot of potential but not the finished product yet. I didn't really think he was the TYPE of player we should have gone for - we could have done with a leader, and older experienced defender (like Vidic) who was reliable and consistent, and could organise the younger defenders that we have.

Rojo will still have a place in the squad I expect, but to me he really seems like he will just end up as a squad player for a few years before moving on. I don't see why we would or should place our trust in him ahead of our home grown defenders.

1774~~~
World cup final and contributed to them getting there? Bit of a difference to our current crop. Forums are ridiculous. We lose, hes no better than we got. So you've come to that conclusion in one game. Send your CV to LVG. You would save him millions if you can make that judgement in one game. Remember Vidic and Evra's first few games? What if Fergie went for a more established CB or LB instead of Evra and Vidic...what then? Or didnt trust Rio who was prone for making mistakes as a young player?

He's different to the others as they have had their chance and still not improved, hes just come through the door.

1775~~~
Zzzzz

Not everyone is Evra and Vidic, unfortunately.

Rojo might be just through the door here but he has played football before. He is a typical World Cup signing. He may continue to show the form that got Argentins to the final, he may not. I don't think his performances at Sporting put him in the top tier of promising defenders in Europe.

I don't think he offers anything more than what we have in Smalling, Evans, Jones and Shaw - except that those four are British and therefore more likely to stay, and can count towards our homegrown count.

In the scenario we were in this summer, there is no doubt we should have bought an experienced, older, reliable CB rather than another young prospect, when looking at the players we already had. I don't see how that is open for debate.

1776~~~
we'll see, he hasnt played as a CB for us, maybe he'll come good. 

Nevertheless we should go for a experienced quality CB in january TW.

1777~~~
ZZZZZZ

At the moment I trust a manager thats won everything in the game than a Monday morning manager. Lets be sensible rather than knee jerk after a lose and see how he shapes up after more that 2 games. Let common sense prevail. The point is (unlike you obviously) we cant all hit the ground running and we were not all born this big.

1778~~~
I would put more trust in scarecrows sticked into ground around 10th yard in the box than in our 'homegrown defenders'.

Actually, that's pretty harsh on Blackett, I like him. So everybody bar Blackett.

1779~~~
Thought this analysis was interesting:

1780~~~
So you agree with LVGs substitutions yesterday?

You agree with dropping Mata?

By your logic there we may as well close down the forum because there can be no debate, because LVG is utterly perfect and no decision he makes can be open to criticism or discussion.

1781~~~
I can forgive Rojo some errors, as I can Blackett. They are both young and new to United.

I do think Rojo has a natural instinct to get forward - I remember him marauding down the flanks for Argentina during the World Cup too - and I think the only way to curb this is to play him at CB, apparently HIS preferred position, and have Shaw play at LB.

1782~~~
Only when they are balanced and not based on a knee jerk reaction to a defeat. Hindsight is an exact science that many on here have the privilege to. Unfortunately he hasn't. We can all dine out on decisions when they go wrong.....

1783~~~
Very poor yesterday, though seems to have been told to attack at will which when playing against 3 up front is clearly dangerous.

I am worried that he seems to have developed a reputation as a player mostly on the back of a world cup, which is always a concern for me. I know Sly says he did well at Sporting last year, but well enough to be our replacement for Vidic or Ferdinand? I have my doubts. 

Fair enough that we need to see him as a CB though; I get that.

1784~~~
I have the same doubts and also I can't see a hothead be the composed leader we need for our back four, which is sorely missing in leadership. 

But - his reputation as a CB's got nothing to do with a decent World Cup. He played as an LB for Argentina but CB is his position, says the guys who've watched him, and I do hope that's where we've bought him to play.

1785~~~
He doesn't look like a typical CB though... let's see.

1786~~~
We can't say that until we see him there in my opinion, but I kinda know what you mean.

1787~~~
I've never been confident in Rojo's signing after seeing his disastrous performances, predominately at centre half, for Spartak Moscow. I had some hope that he'd have improved significantly after seemingly progressing well in Lisbon, however it's the same old story in terms of positioning and persistently wanting to attack. He'd be decent enough back up, just like Buttner, but since his move to Europe I haven't seen anything to say that he's worth pinning hopes on to become a regular first team player.

1788~~~
Our own David Luiz?

1789~~~
Those screen caps don't really say anything at all because full backs can get caught up the pitch at any time for attacking teams. Obviously he did have a stinker and looked very uncomfortable throughout.

1790~~~
I don't understand how you can interpret what I said as knee jerk. Rojo is not a world class defender; he is young and has potential.

This means he is roughly in the same bracket as our current lads who are also not world class defenders, but are young and have potential.

1791~~~
He looked like a center back playing at left-back in a new, fast league who had absolutely no protection from anyone else in the team due to our diamond formation and looked lost throughout.

Why do we keep buying players and not using them where we're supposed to fecking use them? A trend that's been around for years and years. Buy Shaw, a left back, and Rojo, a center back, bench Shaw and use Rojo at left back, use an inexperienced academy player at center back, get ripped to shreds.

Am I missing something here? Is it not completely fecking blatantly obvious in every way that having Rojo at CB over Blackett and Shaw at LB was like, fundamentally the obvious thing to do in every bloody way, yet once again we opt not to do it cause ... well feck it cause why not.

1792~~~
Ok he was poor yesterday but give him chance to rectify it in the next game before writing him off, it's his 2nd game in a united shirt and his first away game. Leicester were always going to put us under immense pressure after that pen but yesterday will be a good learning curve for our defenders, let's move on to the next game now.

1793~~~
I should think Van Gaal knows now that Rojo at CB and Shaw at LB is the way to go.

Remember though that Shaw was available only for the first time after his injury and that Blackett has been rewarded by LVG for solid performances, which given his situation (young, first time in the starting 11) is in itself something we should be thankful for (we may have a young player who has the potential to make it at this level long term). That LVG gave youth a chance should be seen favorably given what United has always stood for, but also because that is what he has always done, and for the main with a great deal of success (Barca, Bayern).

1794~~~
It did seem bizarre. Rojo was woefully bad though, both defensively and offensively. Maybe Van Gaal has assessed him in training at CB and felt he wasn't a great option there. That doesn't explain why Shaw isn't playing though. He has zero choice next week other than to play Shaw LB and Rojo CB so I can't really see anything else.

1795~~~
Have not seen the game yesterday but Rojo is clearly better as CB. He might be able to Play as LB in case Shaw is injured but otherwise I hope he will be played in the Position he is best suited for.

1796~~~
This is what I noticed too, going forwards at the wrong time and not spotting the danger developing behind. Worryingly, he also lost quite a few one on ones defensively, and forced Blackett to come and cover for him. Not exactly promising for a CB, but still, only his second match so need to see more.

1797~~~
I'm still angry about the defeat yesterday, but let's not get carried away with the "Rojo is crap" line.

There's room for criticism of Rojo, no question about it.  He was caught too far up the pitch too often, especially in a situation where we had the lead, and a good flogging for that is in order.  But it's also obvious that he's a quality defender and got taught a lesson yesterday about how quick and physical English football is.  It simply takes time for young defenders to get used to the pace of the game in England, as Evra and Vidic proved when they first arrived at OT.

On another note, there was a lot of talk yesterday about the ball being over the line.  I think it was, but I haven't seen any photos that prove or disprove that claim.  Could some PLEASE (again, if it's already done elsewhere) post that photo?  Thanks!

1798~~~
Playing at cb will give him less of an incentive to go forward. That should help out our defense and his performances.

1799~~~
He's not a fullback.. If anyone is to blame for his mistakes yesterday it's LVG for bringing on a poor CB in Smalling instead of bringing on a natural LB in Shaw and putting Rojo in in proper position.

1800~~~
LVG likes to have a cb pair consisting of a right footer and left footer.

1801~~~
Evans is left footed too.

1802~~~
No he's not. He's right footed, but is really comfortable with his left foot. That is why he played lcb in a 3-5-2 during pre season. He was more equipped to handle that role compared to Jones and Smalling.

1803~~~
You're right I just checked him saying he feels better playing on the right of the defense. Its weird because he played left back as an auxiliary position.

1804~~~
Not sure where I said he was. You've just described every young player at a top football club, which is a broad brush statement. Not all young players are created equally otherwise they would have all cost 27m. Isn't that what we paid for a young player with potential?

1805~~~
Yes that is what we paid for. My argument is, and always has been, that we already have an abundance of young defenders with potential and on this occasion should have gone with experience.

1806~~~
Experience of what? Just cause your older doesn't equate to better experiences. These so called young lads have played for the best team in the world, teams come to beat us every week, played in full stadiums, they have PL medals, played in big CL games and been to the World Cup. Were you going to match that experience based on who's available?

Your comments are too board brush and like I said these May be young but they have more relevant experience than most players out there....

1807~~~
Really keen to see how he gets on at CB at the weekend, this is where we could really do with him excelling given our current crop of CBs are prone to rolling over to have their tummy tickled when the going gets tough. 

Unfortunately he'll be next to the cowering Smalling at the time. Can't wait for Jones to get back.

1808~~~
Apart from the last 2 games, have only seen Rojo at the world cup. Based on that, he came across as a hard man who will play with cojones and can be dirty. Also, quick, strong and good in the air. As an Argentine defender probably has learnt the dark arts of defending. Once he settles, that persona might show through.
We need to see how he is at left centre back with Shaw outside him.

1809~~~
As much as I think we have overdone it in this area in the past - an older player with PL experience and leadership. Vermaelen would have ticked the boxes, personally I would also have been happy to give Vlaar or Medel a shot.

1810~~~
Really? Seems pretty pointless to me.

1811~~~
Not really been tested yet defensively, but looks composed on the ball.
I like the firmness of his passing. Nice and zippy; no unconvincing, bobble passes.

He's light-footed (unlike most of the others we have) while still solid which is also great for a centre back. Can turn well.

1812~~~
What worries me is he looks very one footed

1813~~~
All he does is square the ball at the back, ffs. C'mon Rojo!!!!

1814~~~
at least he doesnt look like a complete oak with the ball at his feet.

1815~~~
I think he's done ok, him and McNair seem to be helping each other showing good team spirit.

1816~~~
Not much to do today but seems both him and Mcnair messed up one or two offside traps. Can't really blame them because its a makeshift partnership. Other than that he seems quite solid and no nonsense.

1817~~~
Looked quite good at centre back, nothing special but playing well enough. Glad to see the communication with him and McNair. I'm sure Paddy's nervous so its good that Rojo is giving him signals and stuff.

1818~~~
Better CB than a LB that's for sure.

1819~~~
Looked commanding today and over compensated covering for Mcnair the other side first half too.

1820~~~
It's unfair to throw two CBs and expect a good performance. Hopefully Rojo forms a good partnership with one of Jones/Smalling/Evans/McNair/Thorpe.

1821~~~
He shat himself every time in possession when we needed cool heads. He was just hacking the ball anywhere and not even playing a percentage long ball into the channels.

1822~~~
Rojo was weighed, measured and not found wanting today. Reckon the likes of Evans and Jones might have panicked in that situation but he showed bottle today, especially as he was playing alongside kids (on pretty much all sides).

1823~~~
He was fine when he had anybody free to pass too and has decent passing percentages as well.

Panicked a couple of times when nothing was on in possession but for me Blind was panicking all over more.

1824~~~
He did alright, if Smalling or Jones can stays fit for a while Rojo and one of those two can become a solid partnership for the future

1825~~~
Jones played with Kids on both sides in a 3 too and lead them for a couple of games tbf.

1826~~~
I think it was a positive performance by Rojo. He isn´t a world beater yet but like i said he gives it all for the team. It isn´t easy to have defensive stability in an unbalanced team with most of the main defenders out injured. I think him and McNair (very interesting player) did very well. You could see him communicating all the time with McNair trying to lead the line. Was very good aerially and trying to impose himself physically. The tendency is to get better if he´s given a run of games as CB with a stable partnership.

1827~~~
Thought he handled the aerial assault very well and was tidy in his clearances. Baptism of fire for him today at centreback and he came through shining.

Now if we can get a settled back four with Rojo and Jones then im sure we will be able to keep some clean sheets.

1828~~~
He was good defensively covering the back as well as clearing aerial attacks. His distribution was poor though at times, but it was difficult with 10 men and players being nervous. Solid overall.

1829~~~
Very good performance, had to watch out for his partner in central defense and it was for the first time he's played with Shaw as well. It's quite clear that he's a CB and not a true LB.

1830~~~
Played well, looked solid, and appears to be one of the only defenders at the club who can actually head the ball. Also ended up completing more passes than any other player on the pitch. Million times better than his disaster of a performance last week.

1831~~~
I think the strength to his game is when the ball is on the ground. Doesn't seem to get done one on one, and he always managed to prod the ball away from attackers running at him. Handled West Ham's physicality well too. The whole back four did really. Being down to 10 men invited a lot of pressure, but I don't think we put much of a foot wrong defensively, other than De Gea flapping about.

1832~~~
Thought he played very good, like his composure and he won a lot of headers, duels. He took the lead.

1833~~~
I thought he did a great job of leading that back line today. Playing with teenage debutants on both sides and a young, out of form keeper behind him!

1834~~~
Well he´s playing at his prefered CB position, so he would obviously improve. I wonder where are those media pundit experts that were claiming he´s better as LB. I think most of the british journalists never saw him play besides at the World Cup.

1835~~~
That is almost certainly true.

1836~~~
Please explain bolded? Made 1 error in judgment, does that mean he's not inform. 

As for Rojo, he's a better central defender than left back, played very well today, held up well with Cole trying to batter him at every given chance.

1837~~~
Did very well today. Seemed to be our most vocal defender too.

1838~~~
Looks better at CB with Shaw at LB, that needs to happen full time now.

His distribution wasn't great but he was at least solid, which is all we need from our defenders right now.

1839~~~
That's more like it from Rojo.

1840~~~
What's to explain? De Gea is out of form. It happens. I'm hardly basing it on just one error of judgement, nor is it a controversial opinion.

1841~~~
Thought he played really well today. Some of his short passing is dodgy as feck though. Seems to pass to teammates when they don't want it.

1842~~~
Out of form how exactly. I'm asking you to explain as I just don't see it. Give me a clue, don't just say someone is out of form, then expect people to agree, give me some instances, not just because you say he is & don't have to explain!

1843~~~
I'm not explaining it here because this is the Rojo thread and should stay on topic. De Gea's thread is very active at the moment with many people discussing his drop in form so that would be the place for it. I gave a couple of posts in there from after the Leicester game if you want to take issue. Some overly harsh criticism too in my opinion.

1844~~~
This is my biggest problem with him. He's always passing to someone who is not expecting it. Hoofed a lot of unnecessary balls when we only had to keep possession. Hope he improves soon. For 16M we should have better. Relatively decent over all but has so much to learn. Specially positioning. He gives too much space inside the box to strikers. He better settle himself quickly in that CB role. We need him desperately.

1845~~~
A better CB than LB took responsibility today, thought he was pretty solid.

1846~~~
Hopefully he will improve in that regard with a consistent backline and once he's settled in more. Definitely a bit of a worry with him, but hopefully one that won't be as bad after he's been here a while.

Definitely looks like he should be kept at centre back though now Shaw is in the side.

1847~~~
Loved when he went straight to McNair, after McNair had put good pressure on one of their attackers and the ball eventually ran out of play. It's a minor thing, but I imagine it means a lot for a young player to get that sort of encouragement from a senior one. 

Thought Rojo did well in general today. Could've used a bit more calmness on that ball on a few occasions, but considering our defence today he did a good job. No doubt a big learning experience today for him as well, being the senior central defender.

1848~~~
Well I shall disagree on all counts, you brought him into the thread, you should explain if you're going to put it out there, I don't see him as out of form & I don't believe you've explained very well in the De Gea thread.

1849~~~
Okay then. Each to his own.

1850~~~
Considering most people wrote him off last week, despite having only two games for us (2 at the time), I thought he was pretty solid today. Once he gets a consistent partner next to him, I don't see why he can't flourish.

1851~~~
He organised the defense really well. I think he kept the Line, he also was telling players where they need to be positonally .  Made a crucial tackle in the first half which has gone unnoticed. He needs to be calmer though that will come soon with more games.

1852~~~
Quite like him.

1853~~~
I liked his performance today. Seems to be very vocal, we need an organiser back there.

Would it be fair to say he's not particularly aerially dominant? Despite being the Caf's whipping boy at the moment (for basically no reason at all), I'd like to see Smalling given a run alongside him to balance that out.

1854~~~
Actually, no. It's one of his strengths. He's usually powerful in the air, but I think he's still coming to grips with the pace and power of the Premier League. He'll come good. Remember Laurent Koscielny when he first came to Arsenal? Was rubbish in the air and now he's rather good.

1855~~~
Fair enough. He doesn't look the biggest and definitely lost a couple of headers today. To be fair he was up against West Ham's giant oafs, but they're the sort of cloggers he'll have to deal with in this league.

1856~~~
I agree. About his height, he's by no means short as he's 6'1 - 6'2 easy. What helps him is that he's got a good spring on him. Good ol' Pat was tiny but boy could he jump high.

1857~~~
1.86m which is about 6'1

1858~~~
He played well today.

1859~~~
I like him. Played well today! Judging him from a few games and his and his mrs' instagram seems a nice lad and enjoying England/United!

1860~~~
he was very confident and much assured at CB, did a good job even I feared a bit before the match. He can play there. Anyway we were looking quite short in the air on set pieces. Mcnair won some good headers but before their player took corner it wasn't like when we had Vidic and Ferdinand who you knew will most defenitely clear the ball maybe that is why van persie stay on the pitch, he is quite decent header of the ball on the first post but we are vulnerable in the air. De Gea never was a beast in the air and it will take a lot of time to handle this disadvantage...

1861~~~
Thought he defended well in tough circumstances. At the end of the day, as long as he is playing, that's all we can ask for, judging a foreign CB only a few games in is just stupid. He needs time to settle.

1862~~~
Rafael - Jones - Rojo - Shaw 

This would be first choice for me when everyone is fit. I thought Rojo did well today. He seems like a really nice person, always giving others encouragement and genuinely looks happy to play for us. Him Jones and Rafa have a real uncompromising tenacity and I think they'll compiment each other well.

1863~~~
One suicidal pass to McNair aside, I thought he looked fine today. It'll be a big boost if he can shore up one of the centre-half positions, as that is an area of far greater need than left back.

1864~~~
I like the combative nature of that backline, but the only worry for me is that Jones doesn't read the game all too well. It's always the last-ditch tackle with him, and whilst they are fine tackles, it can compromise the team many a team when your main central defender doesn't nip the problems in the bud in tight matches. Though, I am being harsh on him considering he's not all that bad at reading play, only that he needs to wisen up on that aspect of his game for him to be a truly world class defender, a la Terry, who plays a similar style.

1865~~~
I don't think it is always last ditch tackles with Jones. And I think his reading of the game is fine. Id say his biggest issue is fighting for lost causes and overstretching for things others defenders might leave but it's in his nature and he's like Rafa in that he's wants to win every single ball. He's still only 22 though and decision making will improve. Before his injury I thought he was our best player this season. Hopefully he can hit the ground running when he comes back.

1866~~~
Yup. Pretty much this. Given a consistent injury-free run, that backline has the potential to be something really special. Plus it's unbelievably young for the long term with an average age of about 22.

1867~~~
Hopefully he and Shaw keep fit and build a partnership. That balance between CB and fullback is crucial, that much is clear after the Blackett and Rojo combination last week. Understand each others game and weak points. Rojo should be comfortable knowing Shaw will make certain space available for him to play it out and when each other needs help especially on counters. Blind is also crucial in this also, so he too should play every game.

1868~~~
He seems to be taking on the culture and expectations of the club. 

He was supporting mcnair with high five and fistbumps.

Anyone catch Fletcher telling him to put away his imaginary Red card? 

He immediately dropped his hands. Good lad.

1869~~~
our defenders are just getting to know each other. we have a good group.

Yes. The club's culture will seep into them.

I have no fears about them.

Once they bed in....our forward players will destroy all before them without worrying about the defence.

1870~~~
Quite like him. Read earlier how he wasn't that good but I don't understand that. Thought he did well.

1871~~~
First time he's played a CB for us in the PL. He's done well and was a leader in defence. He organised and encouraged the defence. Hopefully Smalling is back for Everton, I think they would make a solid CB pairing. McNair also did well, at times he was positionally out of sync with the defence (too deep) but Rojo was constantly communicating with him and positioning him correctly.

1872~~~
Anyone seen any interviews with him? Does he speak any English? 

If you listen to ex-pros, the key to a solid defense is communication. Can't imagine a whole lot of chat between McNair, Rojo, Rafa, Shaw and De Gea, unfortunately. 

Hopefully it'll come.

I think what we really need is one bruiser CB. It's what we're missing, and there are enough teams in the prem for it to be a useful asset. None of our CBs are tough. At all. Jones is only tough on his own body, Smalling looks scared of his own shadow and Evans appears to being playing drunk this season. Maybe Rojo is the guy, by from Portugal reports are that he's more bark than bite.

1873~~~
Did everything well apart from losing multiple headers. Good positioning, pace and he doesn't seem to get beat on the ground easily. 

Thought his passing was okay. Correctly sussed out that Di Maria is the best player on the team and basically just hit it at his feet whenever possible, which is fine with me.

1874~~~
That is our best bet for a solid back 4 until we can get to January IMO, I think Jones and Rojo may be a bit too similar to be a full time partnership but you never know.

1875~~~
My Dad wants us to buy back Ryan Shawcross. I wasn't too sure what to think of that at first, but we aren't getting Hummels and who else is there from the top class bracket who will be available?

1876~~~
This crossed my mind as well. Youth Product, English, seems to love defending much like Vidic and an excellent fitness record (Missed a combined total of 6 league games in the past 4 years).

The downside side is he'll cost a lot, not the top quality we're looking for and on talent alone he's probably not an improvement on Jones. If we can get him for somewhere around 15m I'd buy him.

1877~~~
Yeah it's not the ideal solution as most of our fans will moan that he isn't top class and cite that he got shown up by Zlatan (most defenders do), but I think it could be a good medium term compromise. He would be good organising at the back - he's captain at Stoke, he missed just one game last season (but I'm sure we would find a way to break him) and he's massively suited to the PL which is our main focus this season. I doubt he would be all that expensive, he will be 27 by the time the January window comes along so I can't see it costing too much.

1878~~~
Really enjoyed watching him in cb today. He made some very clever interceptions and there is a certain air of certainty about the way he reads and sets himself up to challenge headers, it really oozes confidence to defenders around him, ala vidic. I also like the way he passes the ball, it's very accurate and hard. Those are just small things I noticed watching him today

1879~~~
Thought he was outstanding tbh. He looks better at CB than he does LB and I think once a back four (hopefully) of Shaw - Rojo - Jones - Rafael (Again, hopefully) establishes itself it will be very good. He was my man of the match for one very good reason, the leadership he shown. I sit in the east stand, so ofcourse that second half where we were under so much pressure our back four were infront of me.. He tried to organise the team every time the ball went out of play, or went back up the other end of the field. He was constantly screaming at the team to get out, push up, mark men.. Yes he had two debutants alongside him, but I still think for someone who's been at the club for two months it was fantastic to see.

1880~~~
Can Rojo speak English by the way?

1881~~~
I tihk he did very well and some of the criticism with his passing here is very harsh. Only his 3rd game for the club, first at CB partnering a youngster making his debut in a game with 10 men where the majority of the second half was spent defending around the area.
It was by no means a world class performance dotn get me wrong but he showed very good signs and confidence in terms of leadership, teamwork, aerial ability, covering his partner, composure, weight of pass. These are all things that have been missing in our other centre backs currently at the club for some time, its only one game but on the evidence I witnessed I certainly have more faith he can go on to be a good partner to Jobes for example rather than Johnny Evans that some people seem to really rate.

1882~~~
Played well. Looked much more at home at CB. I hope we now recover from our injury crisis and get a consistent partner next to him to build on.

1883~~~
Thought he was very good, and contrary to what many seem to have said in here, I think he is also noticably very good on the ball too.

1884~~~
I do think he is the odd one out in our rhythm, in terms of when we attack as a team or defend, he's quite often caught between, I suppose that will come..

1885~~~
1/1 tackle succes
2/5 aerial duels won
89% passing
4 interceptions
11 clearances
4 blocks
no foul

that's his performance from a statistical point of view.

whoscored.com rated him 7.7/10

I think he is be an improvement on Smalling for sure, if the same can be said for Jones and Evans remains to be seen. I have seen good things but bad things as well so far.

1886~~~
I thought he lost a lot headers. How tall is he? He encouraged young McNair throughout the game, which was great to see. Patting him on the back and high fiving him when did good. Positionally, he was caught out a few times. I agree with above, this will come with time. Stats can be misleading some times, but interesting nonetheless.

1887~~~
You'd want a central defender to be winning more headers than that. Hopefully just a one off.

1888~~~
He did well. Important part is that the team didn't crumble under the pressure - as they did with 11 on the field against Leicester.

Considering he played with 2 debutants, it cannot be easy to settle.

1889~~~
He looks a lot more solid at cb than left back

1890~~~
Eventually managed to catch the match this morning. Looked good. I'm happy with Rojo and Shaw on the left side of our defence. Hopefully he can stay fit.

1891~~~
One thing I like about him is that he seems very self assured. He looks like a player that belives in himself, and loves the big stage. Compare that to Smalling and Evans who just never quite look comfortable, never look like they fully believe in themselves, and need reassurance.

1892~~~
It looks like he has the attributes, I just hope he learns some English.  I assume he can communicate with Rafael because of the language similarities (or does Rafael also speak Spanish/Rojo Portuguese?) but I don't know how he can work verbally with Blackett, Shaw, Evans, McNair et al.

1893~~~
Only time he looked out of position was when Blind played a terrible back pass. Otherwise he looked assuring. 

The lack of aerial dominance across the back 4 is a bit of a concern though, especially on set pieces. I was hoping Rooney, RvP and Falcao would help in that regard but for some reason we have them stationed on the line for corners.

1894~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KwqYe3nK7xw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1895~~~
The only negative with him at CB is that we lack an aerial presence. I know he can jump but he still does lack natural height which means he will lose a lot of aerial duels (I think). We are a pretty small team all over really, it is a concern at set-pieces. Jones and Smalling back in would ease the problem though.

1896~~~
Rojo is taller than Jones...

1897~~~
Really? I was just going off my perception of them so I'm not totally surprised but Rojo looks so small.

1898~~~
Whenever I look at this thread title quickly, why do I always see 'Marco Polo' instead?

1899~~~
Our central defenders are a big concern aerially and it's been costing us goals for some time now. Smalling, when fit, has games when he's brilliant in this regard. Again, fitness is an issue hence we don't get to see this regularly. Jones is alright, but he still loses out on crosses. Evans verges on hopeless, Rio was more than hopeless, and it's something about Vidic that we do actually miss. I do hope Rojo can help with this but we'll have to wait and see.

1900~~~
Whut?

1901~~~
You should get that looked at, thankfully there is help out there.

1902~~~
Yeah, I really need to visit them.

1903~~~
The latter period of Rio's career was blighted by that back issue. His aerial presence was minimal near the end. He can't even jump properly these days. There was that first half of the season in Ferguson's last campaign, if you remember, and he and Evans conceded an exceptional amount of goals. Many of them were from crosses into the box. It would only shore up a little when Vidic returned after the New Year, improving the entire back line.

1904~~~
He was bad last season (weren't they all) but that's pretty much it. He was still great before that. Rio was a beast aerially.

1905~~~
He was fantastic in SAF last year in charge, in fact, didn't he get into the team of the year?

1906~~~
Like I said, I agree that he was up until his back started playing up. But I think it became an issue before last season, particularly when he was sandwiched between Evans and a very small Rafael. 

Rio got into that team, yes, but the first half of that season which I highlighted earlier was very poor. He and Evans were all over the place. Vidic returned after the New Year and played very well, settled the defence and put in some monstrous performances against the likes of West Ham and Stoke. The defensive pool to pick from across the league was terrible that year, and I think the return of Vidic played a big role in Rio's resurgence in form during that second half of that season.

1907~~~
He's been very composed on the ball today. Good first half, even if he hasn't had a great deal to do.

1908~~~
Yup really pleased with his and McNair's performance so far. Might be even better when Jones makes a comeback. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1909~~~
He's a centreback and I like the cut of his jib.

1910~~~
A mighty jib, indeed.

1911~~~
He's fecking strong is what he is. Immovable.

1912~~~
I love him. Seems a proper tough bastard who isn't afraid to give orders and impose himself, something we've sorely lacked in recent times.

1913~~~
Perfect so far today. Particularly his distribution.

1914~~~
Like a Vidic fused with a Ferdinand. No pressure. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">Obviously nowhere near as good.</span>

1915~~~
You never know though, he's only 24, which is nothing for a CB. If he turns out half as good as either of those two I'll be happy.

1916~~~
True. Vidic joined at the same age (I think?) and I could have never dreamed he'd turn out how he did. Rojo has had a better start so far.

1917~~~
Love the fact he's comfortable on the ball. He'll delay the pass and draw his marker in so that Blind can get free and receive it. Makes a nice change from Smalling ect absolutely shitting themselves when being pressed.

1918~~~
So because it´s hard to keep up with United fans, is Rojo still good after another weekend? And what kind of sorcery is Van Gaal using? Still no bookings for Rojo? Im pretty amazed with his disciplinary record so far.

1919~~~
I know everyone loves his aggressive style and his composure on the ball but he really is lacking in terms of awareness and positioning, IMO. We can't really afford to play him and Blackett on the same side of the defence because they both have that same issue - the Osman chance being an obvious example of this. Incredible lack of awareness from them both there.

1920~~~
Very good today. Needs to cut his risky passes but that's that.

1921~~~
Better than ever mate, commanding, strong, comfortable on the ball, and balls of steel to let the strikers run at him then lay it off when everyone else is free. 

Hope he keeps it up for the season.

1922~~~
Thought he played well

1923~~~
Awareness was indeed a problem with Rojo sometimes. But regarding positioning, i can´t find many faults from last year. I think he´s still getting used to playing in a defence where players are constantly changing and it´s just his second game (i think) in the CB position. Positional errors are bound to happen.

1924~~~
He's done the minimal amount of the defensive work with young McNair taking more of a leading role, so thats probably why he hasn't got into trouble yet.

He's played plenty of simple passes out of the back, one or two that havent been so good. But in general, tidy

1925~~~
I thought he was really nervy on the ball early and a few times his distribution was a little off. Was alright apart from that though I guess.

1926~~~
Thanks for the input. 

McNair is taking a leading role? Surprised by that. Was expecting the argentinian internacional to pick up that responsability. They have good chemistry between them. It will be a shame if they break up the duo when Jones and Smalling are back in contention.

1927~~~
Definitely not true for the West Ham game where Rojo made 4 interceptions to Mcnairs 1, and 10 clearances. 

Today they had a fairly equal share, but Lukaka targeted Mcnair more often. Likely that was a tactic though, and nothing to do with Rojo taking responsibility or taking a backseat.

1928~~~
That´s why i was surprised by what Ekeke said. I saw the West Ham game and i thought that Rojo was commanding the defence and player "guiding". Couldn´t watch this one. But like i said, there´s good chemistry in that duo. It´s also a credit to United´s academy. Never heard of McNair and he looks very mature with good composure, for someone his age. Looks like one for the future.

1929~~~
I thought the same thing. Martinez had probably pushed all of his strikers to do so.

1930~~~
McNair made 12.

1931~~~
I like him. Havnt really got any issues with him so far. Has settled in to a new league and an injury hit side well

1932~~~
I actually knew that, but the clearances was in response to your 'minimal defensive work' part which I felt was also unfair. You don't make 4 interceptions and 10 clearances through minimal defensive work.

It's all a fairly simplistic way of looking at admittedly, as it's all very circumstantial. But I don't think anyone can watch the two games he's had a centre-back and saying he's taking a backseat or leaving defensive work and passing on responsibility. Mcnair hasn't had the luxury of playing next to a Vidic or Rio granted - but he's atleast had Rojo talking him through both games constantly with words of advice and encouragement which he might have not got next to any of our other centre-backs. And it looks like he's got authority with what he's saying too.

I've been impressed if anything with him stepping up, not being passive - basically, leading somewhat.

1933~~~
I think its fair, but I do see your point.

Rojo is more aggressive and his interceptions are mostly from where he nicked in front of a striker to take the ball away from him, similar to how Koscielny does that at Arsenal. McNair isn't pressing forward trying to pinch the ball, he's tracking runs back and dealing with balls in behind.

Whereas the clearances are dealing with balls into the box. Perhaps I should have been more specific about taking the majority of the defensive work in the box

For example Vidic always used to take responsibility and clear the ball out more than his defensive partners. Thats what McNair is doing so far, which you'd expect the far more experienced and quite good in the air, Rojo to be taking over.

1934~~~
This.

1935~~~
Not convinced he has a clue where he is half the time.

1936~~~
He was good today but he isn't as commanding aerially as i thought.

1937~~~
He looked far more assured today at CB. Good game.

1938~~~
I think he didn't look as busy as McNair because Lukaku was targeting the latter all game, despite McNair having his number.

1939~~~
His passing is severely lacking I feel. Did well today defensively though.

1940~~~
If he had the balls to bring it out and get the ball into feet I'd be much more impressed. He panics in possession and too often plays the back pass.

I think his defending is okay. Most defenders will lose a forward once or twice a game so ive got no real issues with him in that sense but the unnecessary pressure he creates is annoying.

1941~~~
He's doing really well with the youngsters around him in my opinion. McNair has been busier because he is the one Lukaku felt he could target (worked out well for him ay? <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>) but there were times the camera closed in on Rojo and you could see him organising the line and holding the shape of the defence.

1942~~~
Does Rojo say "feck off"?

1943~~~
I think he did.

1944~~~
Not sure How accurate it is but A quick google translate basically says receiving love from Chinese fans 

Then he tells the to feck off?

Bit uncalled for tbh.

1945~~~
Good to see that the English lessens are paying off.

1946~~~
Not one of his best games at left back against Brazil. He didn't do much defending. The whole Argentine defence was out of sorts and they badly missed Garay. Rojo looks better suited to left centre back.

1947~~~
Agreed. He's nowhere near good enough at left back.

1948~~~

1949~~~
Listen again, sounds more like he says his own name. 

Roch-ho

1950~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/uVEWf3RSxF/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

Those trousers?

1951~~~
Maybe he is thinking that someone can pull them off? :P

1952~~~
..is there a bulge designed on those trousers?

1953~~~
Didn't van Gaal say he wanted to sign him because he was analysing Rojo's games at the WC and found him positionally brilliant?

1954~~~
WTF! Those pants!

1955~~~
It looks like he's shat himself <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1956~~~
Well it's safe to assume that Rojo and Shaw aren't going to buy trousers together anytime soon ...

1957~~~
He always had that kind of style. I once saw him in the Lisbon night and he had some kind of feckin black skirt with trousers beneath. Mind boggling.

1958~~~
Finally, some pants that won't choke my  python of a penis. Free at last!

1959~~~
Men like Rojo and myself simply need a generous crotch section, and I'll thank you not to point it out to everyone.

No one should be allowed to leave their house like that.

1973~~~
One thing I don't like about Rojo at the moment is how he overcommits on his aggression and pressure when defending. I don't know if it's just him or if today's defenders are like this, but his overcommitment has had him caught out quite often. Yes, it can work well as you prevent the ball holder from settling on the ball, but then, you rely on others to plug in the gaps. When Kompany pushed forward, he had a midfielder or full back fill in for him. Either that, or he fouled the opposition to break up their play. Rojo can't do the latter whenever we face long ball or counterattack at the moment when he overcommits, and sometimes, it results in us conceding goals (1st Ulloa goal against Leceister was primarily Rojo's fault).

Rojo does have promise, though. His passing from the back is decent, particularly his long passing, though he needs to build up more composure. He's also a good tackler and man-marker. Aerially, he has had trouble against big strikers, but I'm sure that he'll get used to that.

Overall, we've got a good modern defender. However, I'd like to see him control his aggressive style of play (the same goes for many of today's central defenders nowadays).

1974~~~
I do apologize, but thank you for sharing that with us, still <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1975~~~
When we signed Rojo I said the same thing, if we were going to sign a CB last summer it should have been a world class, established one.

Rojo ultimately didn't, and doesn't, offer anything much more than our other CBs and was simply another good prospect who could become excellent, or just become "good".

1976~~~
Luke Shaw disagrees.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/17/1410943017434_Image_galleryImage_September_17_2014_Septemb.JPG" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/17/1410943017434_Image_galleryImage_September_17_2014_Septemb.JPG"/> 

His jeans are tighter than mine's.

1977~~~
There are very few established, world class defenders available. Two of the biggest names didn't want to move on, and the rest were either injury-prone or coming back from lengthy injuries. As a result, there were very few reliable options available. Getting Rojo after losing 2 central defenders isn't that bad given that Michael Keane's now out on loan. Rojo's more established than Keane, Blackett, and McNair, and he has the advantage of playing through the whole World Cup campaign up to the final whilst Evans, Smalling, and Jones haven't even experienced all of the Champions League stages as of yet, so we can say that Rojo's more established than all but Evans.

Rojo needs to get used to the league as he's never experienced anything like the Premier League in his career. Let's see how he does after a while.

1978~~~
I really think that if Rojo wasn't left footed, we'd have bought someone else. But generally I agree with your sentiment.

1979~~~
Fair enough. I would have gone all-out and tried to get someone like Hummels or Varane. Personally I was never in the "we desperately need a new CB" camp in the first place, and would have been happy for us to put our trust in Jones, Evans, Smalling and Blackett. Im a big believer that Jones and Smalling have the potential to be world class, and in both cases they development has been hampered by being played out of position and not getting consistent gametime at CB in the last couple of years (thats probably a topic for a different thread however).

I dont dislike Rojo or think he is a bad player, just that we didnt need another mid-twenties, "good and can perhaps become great but might not" type of defender". Before the world cup I cant remember Rojo being mentioned a single time as a top prospect.

1980~~~
And that's where you're wrong. Hummels specifically stated that he would like to stay at Dortmund and Dortmund said they won't sell, plain and simple. We can surely offer an absurd amount for Hummels to tempt Dortmund (like in the region of 50 million), but what will that change? Hummels, as good as he is, is rarely fit to help us. And Varane? You think Madrid would sell their top prospect who is destined to lead their defence in the next coming years?

The thing is - the game at the moment is in serious lack of world class CB's, there aren't many which you can choose from and combined with our lack of CL, well,  it should have been expected.

No, they have been hampered by the constant injuries that they get. Granted, I think Jones is still amazing when he plays and he has the potential to be a world class CB still, but he plays so rarely that you just can't trust him with the position.

Our problem is not getting good defenders, IMO we have good defenders. Our real problem is getting defenders who can play regularly which each other and not get injured every second match. Rojo fixes that as, for the moment, he is immune to our defenders disease.

1981~~~
Wow, thats not a good look! I like slim fit jeans on a man but look in the mirror first.

1982~~~
Dumat aptly summed up our defensive issues here. Obtaining Rojo is a huge step towards moving away from an injury-prone defence as he can establish himself as a constant figure at the back. When we have that constant figure, our defence can become even more stable, and we won't face the repercussions of having defenders injured all the time.

My only gripe with Rojo has less to do with him and more to do with the style of modern central defenders who are all gung-ho in their approach (the only exception is Thiago Silva). Even Jones and Smalling are very much modern defenders in the way they play. The likes of Vidic (at his prime) and Thiago Silva nowadays are more balanced and controlled in their aggression and gung-ho style of defending. It is these sort of defenders that I prefer, and if Rojo can control his aggression and gung-ho approach, he can become one of the best defenders in the world.

1983~~~
After a shaky start he's been quality this game I think. Stepping infront very well to win it back early and taking control a few times when Shaw's been caught out.

Composed on the ball once more too.

1984~~~
Really good game, love how up for it he is.

1985~~~
He was probably our best player today. Great pace to nullify Berahino at times to the extent that Berahino gave up trying to outrun him. Good on the ball, he always finds a pass to a teammate.

1986~~~
MOTM for me today, did very well I thought. Didn't have much competition though.

1987~~~
I thought he was absolute quality. Made up for Jones being a chicken head.

1988~~~
He was good, Jones on the other hand...

1989~~~
Likewise. Won the ball numerous times. Unlucky for the goal.

1990~~~
Started poorly. Got better.

1991~~~
Class performance, decisive when venturing out to snuff out attacks, good aerially and aware of his surroundings. Put a no nonsense defender like Shawcross next to him and we won't be half bad.

1992~~~
Did really well considering he was our only centre back tonight and also had to watch left back.

1993~~~
I think he has looked really good at CB, we just need someone solid beside him./

1994~~~
He was poor for their second. 

Jones obviously takes the blame, because he's lost out going for the ball like that, but when he sees his defensive partner going to pressure the ball he has to drop. If anything, he took a step forward and tried to play offside, but you just can't do that.

1995~~~
Good perfromance I thought. We have no one to partner hi with though

1996~~~
He struggles under aerially balls, like he can't judge them and lets it bounce. On the deck though, he was solid and didn't put a foot wrong.

1997~~~
Bit of nervousness in the first half but looked great otherwise. He does need someone good in the air alongside him though. Jones - Rojo isn't a good partnership I feel.

1998~~~
He started poorly, but he was class at the end.
With Shawcross we'll be getting penalties every couple of games, no thank you.

1999~~~
Don't think he was at fault for the goal anymore than Rafael.

2000~~~
Getting criticised by Carra for Berahino's goal

2001~~~
As he should.

Dropping off when your partner pressure's is defending 101.

2002~~~
I thought Rafael was playing onside, irrespective of Rojo's position.

2003~~~
Extremely unconvincing defending his goal. Slow to react to danger like Sessegnon's goal today. He's good at reading passes into forwards and stealing the ball further up the pitch though. Plays a lot of long balls with few of them making it to the player.

2004~~~
Poor in the air today, looked uncertain and let balls bounce in behind him.

2005~~~
Started poorly, poor for their 1st goal but after that he was good.

2006~~~
Strange one for me. Did some good things but then at other times didn't look good at all. Seems to be the general reaction I have to most of his performances, there is not a lot of middle ground.

2007~~~
He must be struggling in a more physical football. I thought he was good aerially in Portugal but tbf most of the teams play with mobile strikers (or adaptations) who don´t really use the physicality like in England with the big, strong specialty strikers.

2008~~~
The thing was, in terms of difficult headers where your striker is backing into you.. he did well, it was the ones hit over him.. he seemed clueless, it was like watching Sunday league when the CB's panic when they let it bounce and a nippy striker presses them from behind.

2009~~~
The lapses of concentration. I warned about that. It´s not surprising what i have been reading from tonight's performance. Happened alot of times at Sporting. Doing very well, intercepting plays, controlling the opponents only to have lapses like the ones you exemplified, doing stupid challenges or failing with some positional issues.

2010~~~
You did mention it, I've followed your posts on him very closely.

2011~~~
Not totally convinced. I do think he will be a good CB, just that he needs to keep playing every week. I'll judge him next season.

2012~~~
Yeah, I've seen you mention that. I do like him and he does have a lot going for him but as you say, there were a few times tonight where he just didn't anticipate things quickly enough. Admittedly it was often due to feck ups originally made by other players but if he's going to become the defender we need him to become, he needs to be more switched on to those situations.

2013~~~
You can't pair a guy, who naturally isn't a centre back with Phil fecking Jones, who nobody knows what he is.

2014~~~
Only at the start of the match did he look a bit nervous dealing with balls in the air. Once he settled down he was excellent.

2015~~~
Like i used to like him at Sporting. Was our best defender and our defence is struggling this year since him and Dier left. The problem with United is the lack of form of some players and lack of stability in the defensive sector. Not only that, it´s his first year in England and he would always struggle in a much more demanding football. His first season at Sporting was average at best. In the second year, with a steady and organized defence, he did blossom and was our best defender. He will evolve, just aslong as United start gaining some stability and assimilating Van Gaal´s philosophy (whatever it may be)

2016~~~
Starting to develop an understanding of what's required in the English game.

2017~~~
But he is naturally a center back

2018~~~
Thought he was our best defender but that's not saying much. He looks very dodgy under a high ball but I'm more confident of him than Jones, who is like a dog chasing a ball around the field.

2019~~~
Not sure what the criticism is about he made 6 successful tackle and 5 clearances. Thought he was our best player beside Di Maria.

2020~~~
Absolutely, there are so many issues with us defensively and he's nowhere near the main one. The issue is we're looking for a great defender and a leader immediately which is a massive amount to ask of a reasonably young defender getting used to a new league. It's clear though that he has a lot of the raw materials to be a really good centre back for us for years to come.

2021~~~
Hard to judge him when he has a new face next to him each game. He is still adapting. He is either going to be a player we love or will become a liability, there will be no in-between. Thats why its important for the crowd to encourage him and not get on his back like the majority do when a player has a dip in form. Once you feel the crowd being negative towards you because it is such a big stadium it is hard to get out of.

2022~~~
I'm surprised to see people saying he was good. Thought he was poor, looked like Beckenbauer compared to Jones, tho.

2023~~~
I agree with <a class="username" data-user="63162, @goin4glory" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/63162/">@goin4glory</a> Rojo won his one on ones and brought the ball out with composure and decent passing. Considering he was playing next a fecking jacket potato with no sense of direction I thought he did well.

2024~~~
Funny, because now you mention it didn't we have Vidic, Evra and Ferdinand last season? One left, one was allowed to leave and one was told to go … hmmmmmmmmmm!

2025~~~
I thought he was very good tonight and was unfortunate his one error led to a goal.

2026~~~
He certainly isn't our biggest liability in defense, but I am not sold on him.

2027~~~
Vidic in particular was basically gone from when he got injured against Basel, he played a few games but he was never the same player, Ferdinand is clearly past it and seemed to be a bit of an issue in the dressing room while I'm not missing Patrice's refusal to do any defending. Losing them wasn't the issue, believing the likes of Smalling, Jones and, dare I say it, Rafael could become parts of another great United defence was the issue.

2028~~~
Thought he did well tonight.

2029~~~
Same here, he barely loses one and ones and is super composed in possession. If he had a steady partner next to him, we would look a lot better.

2030~~~
Is anyone else concerned with the fact he looks a bit weak? Once the ball is launched towards him in the air he seems scared and doesn't really know what to do. He also seems pretty useless in the air, I was told he has a fantastic, Vermaelen-like leap (best comparison for someone of similiar size). I haven't really seen much of it. I don't think he's "super-composed" either. He always opts for the easy pass which sounds good but seems to me like he doesn't want the ball. He's also very reliant on his left foot, in the same way Jones/Smalling are on their right, which leaves us a bit rigid in that sense.

2031~~~
I think he's been quite hit and miss to be honest. Haven't been overly impressed with him.

But I understand he's adapting to a new league.

2032~~~
I've noticed his leap when he's been forward for corners but he doesn't seem to be anything special in the air when he's actually defending. Bizarre.

2033~~~
Yeah, it's almost like he doesn't want to be aggressive in his defensive duties. Perhaps not to overcommit?

2034~~~
I think he's adapting slower than most of us would like. He's been great when I've seen him play for Argentina.
If the rumours of Pique are true, they'd be a great pair. 
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2035~~~
Considering the like of Anderson/Nani were given over 5 years to establish themselves in the first team, i think i'll wait until after one season to make a assessment on Rojo.

I'm not knocking those who have doubts mind, i just think he need time to adapt and any mistake can be forgiven in his first season.

2036~~~
I'd love Pique back, there is a real shortage of quality defenders at the moment... It's like players have decided there's nothing they can do to nullify the likes of Ronaldo and Messi and have decided to contribute to other areas.

2037~~~
What I see in Rojo is a less rash version of Jones with a left foot and without the ridiculous facial expressions. Rojo and Smalling IMO would make a decent CB pairing. If we could get Rojo to be more composed on the ball and be able to play it too, he could nullify how poor Smalling is on the ball (ala Rio and Vidic). Defensively they could be a solid partnership (as long as Smalling stays fit).

2038~~~
He's going to be very good

2039~~~
Considering he's still adapting to the PBL and the ever changing players next to him, I think he's doing fine. Small lapses in concentration as said before, but if he gets a stable partner with which he can team up & get a really tight connection with, I think he'll be very good.

2040~~~
Not poor throughout but not stellar either. Still the better of our two centre backs though. This season will go a long way in helping our defenders gain experience and mature (hopefully). Exciting times ahead though I would be thrilled if we brought in one quality experienced one

2041~~~
I don't know if I'd want Pique back here, whenever I watch him I find him quite prone to make mistakes. The kind of mistakes our defense are already making way to many of. I think we need someone more solid, and someone who's more of a leader than I think Pique is.

2042~~~
Looks easily our most vulnerable defender today. Gave the ball away just outside the box with a sloppy pass, took Willian on in his own half and gave him the ball for a counter and had a header straight to Oscar too. On another day we'd have been punished 2 or 3 times, he's lucky he hasnt been punished yet.

Needs to do a lot better and fast

2043~~~
Bailed out thrice today. Twice by Smalling and once by De Gea.

2044~~~
Seconded. He's got a touch of carelessness in his play. He's basically Silvestre, minus the crossfield passing ability.

2045~~~
One minute he looks like the most composed, in control defender on the pitch. The next he looks like an absolute mess.

He's a strange one is Rojo.

2046~~~
But put in excellent tackle on Hazard as he was tearing through from midfield.

2047~~~
Mistake waiting to happen!

2048~~~
I've said it before all season but this guy is pretty suicidal on the ball. I'm all for trying to keep the ball but use it wisely and release at the right time, not 4 seconds too late

2049~~~
He's been at fault for every major Chelsea threat. Not a good 60 minutes.

2050~~~
He's capable of being a decent defender I think, but like our entire defence right now seems to be prone to largely individual errors. He's one of the main culprits for it in our defence certainly.

2051~~~
He's horrible. Just steps away from the tackle and lets the opposition player run through everytime.

2052~~~
He's not convinced has he? Sticks too close to his man on occasions, loses his man completely on others. Smalling bailed him out numerous times today.

2053~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> yes, he's horrible.

2054~~~
Defensively at least. I'm sure he's a lovely bloke. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2055~~~
He's wank.

2056~~~
Accident waiting to happen, I shit bricks whenever he's near the ball.

2057~~~
Wow, I didn't notice that much wrong with his game today.

2058~~~
That was his worst game, but that doesn't mean he's 'wank' or 'horrible'

2059~~~
He was awful. I'm yet to be convinced he's good enough.

2060~~~
He seems overawed. I think he can be quite useful eventually.

2061~~~
This, apart from his very first clearence I thought he did fine.

2062~~~
He did fine, had some bad moments but he had a decent game. But people branded him 'accident waiting to happen' and will stick with it no matter what..

2063~~~
He made at least two mistakes which would have given Chelsea a clear run in on goal.

2064~~~
Sometimes he makes risky passes and stuff that's true, but defending is all right imo. 
He should quit those kind of passes and make it simple.

2065~~~
I thought he was very solid today. Smalling was okay but the jury for me is still very much out with him

2066~~~
He makes me uneasy. I hope he can improve but I have the feeling that he's always going to be a bit rash.

2067~~~
He's the weak link. I know this forum hates Jonny Evans but we'd be much better with him beside Smalling today. A better defender and better with the ball.

2068~~~
Over-critical. We conceded one to Chelsea from a set piece.

2069~~~
Smalling was comfortably better than Rojo.

2070~~~
I'm sure that Portugese member will write up a block of posts on how he's much better than this and everyone will agree. "Great post"

2071~~~
Silvestre MkII

2072~~~
I havent been overly impressed by Rojo so far. I stand by my previous statements that if we were going to buy a CB, we shouldve gone for experience (preferably PL experience, like Vermaelen). I would have Smalling and Jones as first choice - Rojo is a useful option to have as he can cover LB as well when Shaw gets tired, but im not convinced yet.

2073~~~
He's good with the ball at his feet but has an annoying habit of taking risks with his passes. We already knew that when he signed him so hopefully LVG can coach some of that recklessness out of him. There are times when he looks vulnerable and that's usually of his own doing.

2074~~~
He's looking better every game imo. Understandable, given his transfer I suppose. I expect him to only get better and better, and a settled partner at center half will only help that.

2075~~~
He was poor, but not half as bad as the reactions here...Drogba was clearly stronger than him but there's no shame in that.
His passing around at the back always looks dangerous and today he gave it away once or twice too..hopefully it can be coached out of him.


I remember that DDG for the 1st few months gave me the same kind of jitters that Rojo does now- but we never did concede an important goal from a DDG error, and so far Rojo has been the same. 
If he follows the same trajectory, <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2076~~~
He'll come good this guy.

2077~~~
In addition to his errors and brain farts, he's not very dominant. He's smaller than the average CB and he doesn't time his jumps well. He's around the same height as Jones but a) Jones is built like a tank and b) he's got a better leap. Rojo is like Evans, but about two inches shorter.

2078~~~
Pretty harsh opinions in here. The lad's only just joined us. He can pick out a forward pass pretty well and has most of the attributes you'd look for. Raw in some areas and hopefully he will look a bit more assured under the high ball soon and cut out the little errors he's been making. Other than that I think he's been okay. Not great but reasonable given he has only just joined and is no doubt settling in.

I think the main thing I like about him however is that he is fit and available for selection, which is a luxury with our centre backs. Give him time and we'll have a better idea what he's made of in a couple of months.

2079~~~
Does anybody else heart skip a beat whenever he gets the ball or gets put under any sort of pressure. 

He seems a decent player but tbh I wouldn't say he's a starting 11 player, a bench/squad player yes. 

Still hope to see 2 new world class CBs in the January/summer window.

2080~~~
He's just not my cup of tea. A complete live wire. I don't think I'll ever come to like him. I like my CB's stable and solid and he just isn't that type of character.

2081~~~
Growing in the role. Loved the way he manhandled Terry that one corner.

2082~~~
I don't think he was as bad as a few people are making out, but agree in the fact he isn't the most convincing of defenders. He will get better though I'm sure the more he adapts, whether he is the man to lead us getting in to the Champions League is another question. A new CB is still badly needed IMO

2083~~~
Give him half a season at least. I think he come good and form a top partnership with Smalling.
He was a little off today but he can improve and get better. Its still a very new league for him and it will take some time getting used too. He's more or less had a different partner every game, once he has a regular pairing we'll see the best of him.

2084~~~
Doesn't really look like a shrewd investment at the moment, and (I'll stick my neck out to say) it doesn't look like he ever will be.

2085~~~
Doesn't look convincing at times and can cause nervy moments for the entire defense. He looks assured, strong in the tackle before suddenly making a silly judgemental error. I think he has all the physical and raw defensive qualities but just needs a bit more awareness, consistency and concentration to become a very good CB, kind of like Jones if you think about it. It's not like he is a David Luiz and doesn't have the positioning, anticipation or intelligence, he has it but just needs to more consistent in these aspects and develop them further. What do you guys think about using him as a defensive midfielder? Has he played there for Sporting before <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> ?

2086~~~
I just see a general lack of intelligence and awareness every time he plays.

2087~~~
Yeah 9 games is enough in a brand new team, country and lingo..out ta feck you go Rojo

2088~~~
Surprisingly poor in the air, given he's quite strong and good all around physically. Alright on the ball but takes too many risks at times. Has potential though, and defending on the ground he's quite good, just so far at least he's been found wanting with long balls.

2089~~~
some people on here are so critical, like they were promised a world class CB. Jones, Smalling and Evans are shite too and they had years to prove themselves, they cant even stay fit for 3 consecutive games. To jump this thread for every mistake he makes and to come to conclusions after some games when his partner changed every fecking game is unbelievable.

2090~~~
Agree with most of the comments in this thread on his performance today.  He looked the most vulnerable defender in the back four and has a mistake in him.

Personally I would prefer any of the other centre backs to start over him.  I hope Van Gaal's preference for a left footed centre back is not going to mean he's an automatic starter if fit by default.

Long-term obviously it's way to early to judge him but at the moment we need to get a run of results together and that's going to be optimised if we start looking more solid at the back.

2091~~~
Thought he did fine today. I've been fairly happy with him. Not sure what the fuss is about?

2092~~~
He hasn't even played 9 games because he wasn't with us at the start of the season. The jury's still out on him for me, but I'm willing to give him a lot more time as he obviously has at least some of the right attributes and is quite highly rated by some. Would be nice for him to play in a settled defence as well

2093~~~
He was giving away possession on the edge of the box carelessly and getting caught in possession on the ball thus putting the team under unnecessary pressure.  I don't think it is overcritical for people to highlight this when the rest of the defence were generally very solid.

2094~~~
I think some people have slightly too high expectations of him because they are desperate for a world class centre back. Rojo was never that purchase to be honest, and considering modern prices we didn't really pay that much for him. He was more of a punt, because we weren't able to bring in someone like Benatia or Hummels. You can tell he is a decent footballer and seems to have some of the raw attributes that mean he might develop into a top class centre half, but he isn't one yet and I doubt he will be at least for a couple of years. What he hopefully will be is reasonably good and reliably fit. I imagine top of our summer shopping list will be the top class defender we are wanting. 

He's worth sticking with in the starting 11 as you never know when Evans, Smalling or Jones will decide to turn up to a game and what we really need is some stability back there.

2095~~~
Nah think people are being over critical. Playing best team in the league can't expect a perfect CB pairing with new players and injuries every week. I wasn't concerned at all for the majority of the game. Of course Chelsea will create chances just like we did because they are a good side. What are people expecting exactly?

2096~~~
Don't think he was too bad today and I see improvement since he has been here. I'm sure he will continue to get better.

2097~~~
I thought he was mostly good today, he's excellent in one on ones and was mindful of the ball over the top more today than he has been. It's very early days, I think he needs competition for his spot but I prefer him with Smalling than with Jones.

2098~~~
Still only 24 and still getting to know the league and the variety of players that will be his defensive partners, every couple of weeks...

2099~~~
Looks a bit dodgy but he is quick and tenacious and strong, pretty decent on the ball, he lacks decision making and some of his passing goes astray. He would probably do better with a competent CB partner. Not sure he will ever be world class and certainly no where near Rio standards at 24 years old and if we're honest those are the heights to which we must compare. He will improve but I don't think he is the long term solution. Better than the alternatives.

2100~~~
This was one of our better back 4 games this season.

Chelsea had their moments (like Hazzard walking through them), but the defence did well enough today as a group. More efforts like that the better off we'll be.

Happy to see Smalling back today, the lad did well

2101~~~
Astonishing that some fans have such short memories.  Perhaps Gary Pallister or Rio Ferdinand early United careers are too long ago for some to remember but even as recently as 2006, Evra and Vidic also took half a season before they found any sort of rhythm and authority.  

Thats not to say that Rojo will go onto to make contributions like this group of club legends, but I think he he done well so far, given the flux of the team and our relative lack of competitiveness.  

Personally, I have a feeling he still has plenty of potential to fulfil and will show us much much more after the new year.  He needs time, encouragement and consistency around him.  Am sure Van Gaal knows what he is doing.

2102~~~
Likewise, on evidence I have seen so far, Im also more than happy to give him a lot more time to prove his worth.  Given his circumstances and the uncertainty in the first team, he has done OK so far.

2103~~~
There's definitely a very good defender in there somewhere, some of his careless passing scares me to death though.

2104~~~
Long term he's surely only going to be seen as Shaw's backup, did ok today though tbf.

2105~~~
I'm with you.

2106~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2107~~~
He'll only get better with continued play time. Thought he looked nervy at first today but grew into the game and had a good partnership with Smalling. That ball he gave away almost gave me a heart attack though!

2108~~~
I agree with that. He's probably around 4th in quality of our ranks of centre backs.

2109~~~
I think he looks very good on the ball and with his interceptions and when has to put in a tackle and is also a very good passer of the ball. However, he gets caught out every single time a long ball is played over the top. He just has no idea what to do with it and it's going to cost us one of these days. He also has a habit of playing really dangerous passes near our box.

2110~~~
This.Has got more involved each game. Good distribution. Getting used to the physical nature of the PL. People should try and remember what Vidic, Stam and co were like in their first few games. What's that his fourth game. Hardly, like he is the weak link and everything is going through him.

2111~~~
This last point is massively under appreciated on here. Look how Rio and Vidic were able to play as a partnership game in game out and build up an understanding. Our remarkable run of central defensive injuries (and the fullbacks!) has not allowed Rojo to do that.

2112~~~
So, when Evans is back fully fit, does Rojo retain his place at LCB?

2113~~~
Yes, mostly because Evans is right footed and Van Gaal wants left footers on the left side of defence. 

Strange to understand why Rojo has tailed off so much in the last two matches. He was really good alongside McNair against West Ham and Everton, worked with the kid and really helped shepherd him through the games. 

Today he looked, at times, like he'd lost his head. Maybe its the fact he's having to learn how to play with new centre halves every game...? Hope he sorts it out before next weekend.

2114~~~
Yes.

1) Because Evans isn't left footed so will never be considered competition to him by LVG.
2) He's been better than Evans this season.

Anyway, I wasn't convinced about the signing but he's growing on me. Still has adapting to do, but he's settling in well and a lot quicker than the  supposedly world class Mangala from the same league.

2115~~~
Jury is still out about him, but I hope he'll pull through. Great on the ball and has a keen eye for the game, but takes a lot of risks and basically, needs to feck up really bad once to get a reality check I'm afraid. I hope he'll settle down as a centre back and LvG will take his reckless streak away (kicking & screaming if need be)

2116~~~
Still such early days, he is doing fine for the moment.

2117~~~
Give him time ffs. Some of the posters on here seem to make game to game decisions about every player. Some players don't hit the ground running, Evra and Vidic always came to mind on these subjects.

2118~~~
Evans is two-footed.   He's certainly strong enough on his left to play on that side of the defence.  Hence why he used to play left back for Northern Ireland as a youngster.

2119~~~
I reckon thats part of the settling process, things you'd get away with in Portugal get punished at this level. Once he gets used to that and becomes more confident under the high ball (and he can't not considering he has to deal with it 90 times a game) I think he'll be excellent.

2120~~~
Does some silly little errors atm and his passing needs to improve. But did put in some good interceptions. I keep saying it but we need to play the back four so they can gel, he would benefit hugely from not having to change center half partner nearly every game.

2121~~~
That was the main issue when i gave my opinion about Rojo. Like i predicted United fans will need some patience regarding Rojo. More demanding football league, the pressure of playing in a club of United's stature that is in a transitional period, lack of a stable defence, all this plays a part in Rojo's first season evolution.

He played once as DM in pre-season. The results weren't encouraging and we never tried playing him in that position again. I think it's a waste playing him as LB and trying him as DM makes no sense when you have more capable options. Enough inventions. Just stick him on defence. He needs a stable center back partnership and continued trust till he fully adapts to the club and the league. Of course if he doesn´t perform, he should be benched.

2122~~~
Two-faced performance from him I'd say. Some stupid, silly errors he's done today that thankfully didn't cost us because a) Smalling saved him b) he was fast enough to correct his own mistakes. He's done fine though with some good tackling, blocking and coping with Matić/Drogba's physicality as well as Hazard/Willian's dexterity. He's alright in the air when defending as well and that came in handy today. I like him on the ball as well, bar one or two misplaced passes he's far better at it than Chris and his atrocious hoofball.

I like him though, the only CB that's not constantly injured so far in and is putting rather good performances overall ( at the CB that is ). If we're to build some stability at the back then he's easily my first pick because rest are unreliable and constantly injured.

2123~~~
He's a bit sloppy at times. Since Jones is prone to similar sloppy moments it helps Rojo to have Smalling with him I think because he is calm and composed. Not convinced by Rojo yet but I'll give him time.

2124~~~
I actually like him. He has concentration issues, but there's a good defender there. I reckon he needs a leader next to him. Will turn out fine IMO.

2125~~~
David Luiz without the shooting ability.

2126~~~
I dont particularly rate rojo but have to agree.  Vidic says hi.

2127~~~
I´m not saying he will ever reach his level but some of Rojo's criticism reminds me of the Ricardo Carvalho first year thread on Shed End forum. The crying about Gallas made the forum unbearable.

2128~~~
If he turns out half as good he'd still end being a fantastic defender. Especially with the standard of modern defenders.

2129~~~
Scares the feck out of me. Hope for some big improvement in the oncoming months.

2130~~~
David Luiz was mostly very good for Chelsea with the odd brain fart. I can see Rojo being the same. I'm not one of those who think David Luiz is a joke.

2131~~~
My point wasn´t about ability. My point was about the lack of patience towards some players in the first season at the club. Some of the Carvalho criticism in that first year was very unfair. Found it funny how some forum members had to "swallow their words" during the following years. Some wanted him out after 6 months! Look how it turned out <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2132~~~
I've just thought about this, I have been a member of that site since it was formed (2006), Carvalho joined Chelsea in 2004. Are you thinking of another Chelsea forum?

2133~~~
The one that had Loz as moderator. That Shed end forum wasn´t formed in 2006. In the Ranieri days, it was already around. This one here <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theshedend.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theshedend.com/</a> The kick Carvalho out to play Gallas debate was amusing. They loved Paulo Ferreira though

* sry for the off topic

2134~~~
I was a member (since 1997!) of a site called the "Chelsea Supporters Registry" which pretty much shut down in 2006 (it stll exists as a broken, crappy site). A few of the reguars (including the excellent Loz) set up The Shed End, which has ben going ever since.

Anyway, back to Rojo. He has a really shitty tattoo of a diamond on his neck.

2135~~~
a couple of dodgy passes at the start. the he settled down and was fine.

2136~~~
I used to read the forum in the first two Mourinho years (too much free time in Law School). It was amusing. Then i got bored. It wasn´t a big forum but it had quality.

Yeah that tattoo is as bad as his crotch pants collection.

2137~~~
Thug life innit.

2138~~~
I recall when we bought Evra and vidic both looked off the pace but by the end of the season they were worth their weight in gold.
I would give Rojo till the end of the season before branding him "a mistake waiting to happen"

2139~~~
There were at least three occasions where he got caught next to a teammate and let the opposition player run through (case in point being Hazard's burst through for the 1v1). Needs to sort that out and clear everyone out if needs be.

2140~~~
He has been very poor so far, he is quick and quite strong but doesn't seem to have positioning skills to succeed at CB in a top league. It's still early days and he is only 24 but it's nonetheless worrying because we needed a quality defender from the get go.

2141~~~
He's not been very poor at all. Absolute nonsense.

2142~~~
Very poor is probably stretching it but he has been poor.

2143~~~
Everyone has been better than Evans this season.

2144~~~
I think he's been fine, and is improving. People just need to think back a few years to Vidic and Evra's first seasons here. He's at a further disadvantage in that he spoke no English when he arrived. He hasn't been poor, but part of me thinks he might be committing himself a bit less because LvG spoke about improving his discipline when he arrived as I think he got a few red cards in Portugal. Also consider that his CB partner has been chopped and changed almost every game. It's beyond ridiculous and far from ideal that he hasn't been able to form a solid partnership with someone at the back. He was also half the price of Mangala and looks twice as good imo (famous last words before the derby?! <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>)

2145~~~
Personally thought Rojo has done alright! Not a world beater but for someone settling into a new league and a team with lack of cover etc, no solid partnerships. Think he's done well.

2146~~~
It seems to be true what we've benn told from Protugal. Sometimes he has bad positioning and is to hasty at times. I like his attitude, no nonsense defending / tackling a bit like Vidic. Hopefully, at 24 he should, he can still improve on hs game.

2147~~~
He had some brain farts, misplaced passes,but overall he has been fine, certainly not very poor. 
And surely having a differend CB partner hasn't helped him at all. 
I think he'll improve.

2148~~~
What positional problems are you talking about? The only errors I have seen him make have been with the ball not without it. Funny enough, I am actually very confident in him with the ball on his feet. He plays these lovely passes between the midfield lines that I used to enjoy from Carrick in 12/13.

2149~~~
I've seen a lot of positives. Good in the tackle, calm on the ball, good carrying it out, good distribution. He's a natural footballer and natural defender. 

His positioning is the only thing that has let him down at times for me and that will improve when he gets a more permernantly partner and improves communication. People forget that as a Centreback you are never working alone. Everything you do needs to be reflected by your partner so if he gets drawn out to close someone down or make a tackle, his partner needs to be ready to come across and cover the space behind him. Similarly, if he steps up to play the offside trap the whole back line need to be on the same wave length. Any individual mistake being made in defence so far is only being amplified by the fact the rest of the defence aren't sharp enough to cover for the error. 

Vidic at his peak used to step up to go for a header or make a tackle just inside his own half and Ferdinand knew to position himself accordingly to sweep up should it go wrong. so far this season there's been a few times where that hasn't happened and it leaves the acting defender looking worse than they actually are as the opposition seems to be scoring with every chance they get.

2150~~~
I just watched the Neville/Carragher analysis on our game and Carragher highlighted Rojo's involvement in the goal with how he took Terry out of the equation. Not sure if it was intentional but it was smart play.

2151~~~
Exactly. The fact he's been looking in any way competent with a different CB alongside him in almost every game he plays is huge credit to him. You couldn't dream up a more challenging scenario for a CB who is trying to bed into a new team, in a new league. He's been coping admirably IMO.

2152~~~
I agree with it mostly but more than just his positioning, I feel how he turns off at times or does not realize danger till very late is what concerns me about him more.

2153~~~
He has a risky pass in him, which perhaps comes from being rushed into a pass.
Entirely agree, joining a new team and settling in is hard enough at times. A new league, a new language, and no stable partner must make things incredibly difficult. No wonder he looks a little "lost" at times, but when he has to defend 1 on 1 or make an interception he does really well. I have been pleased with him so far, apart from a few loose passes he has been OK.

2154~~~
He will make mistakes. That comes with the territory for all centre-backs at a new club/league. Remember Vidic's first few months at United? Like I said, though, the fact he hasn't made <i>more </i>mistakes despite the turmoil in our defence (constant changes to formation and personnel) this season does him a lot of credit.

2155~~~
He is playing with a new partner almost every game, knows very little English, new to the league and the club.

He has been good so far, could be a better yes but what he is going though would be very hard for any Center back to do.

2156~~~
Not denying any of it. And I totally agree with what you say about Vidic but he came in January and that is always tough for any player, let alone a CB who has just moved country and does not know the language. Also, mistakes are made by the best and I am hopeful he will iron them out but I was just pointing out the deficiencies I noticed when he has played. Case in point, that time when Hazard was through on goal, he was caught watching the whole play instead of anticipating it or preparing himself to at least block Hazard's progress. Hazard just skipped past him while Smalling tried a last minute tackle. The whole thing made me feel that he was caught out there and that is something which I have noticed a few times with him.

2157~~~
In my opinion, playing at CB requires the greatest level of adjustment when coming to the Prem. Much more physical with a lot of long-balls, so I reckon he just needs some time to adapt.

2158~~~
Usually I would probably hate his type of player if he was playing for some other team, but as long as he stays fit I am happy with him. That's how low standards Smalling, Jones and Evans have set<span style="font-size: 16px"> up here with their injuries.</span>

2159~~~
Fair point, this. We'll have a much better idea of how good, or bad, our defence really is when we've managed to get them playing for a proper run of games. We just need to pray that they can remain fit. 

I quite like Rojo so far. He's not without faults but the raw materials are there.

2160~~~
How does everyone compare Mangala to Rojo from THIS season's performances?

2161~~~
Precisely. Barring the Leicester game, he's appeared fairly confident too. Also easy to forget that he's still only as old as Smalling. Still at least 3 years from his peak IMO.

2162~~~
I've only watched him for two games and both times he appeared a bit worse than Rojo. Obviously it's too early to pass a judgment on him either

2163~~~
fwiw, Vidic & Evra didn't look united quality this soon into their united careers...

2164~~~
Vidic was also 24 when he signed for us, iirc.

2165~~~
Physically there is no comparison with the portuguese league. Portuguese football technically it´s very challenging but not in physical terms. In England players are much stronger. Like i said previously, in Portugal most of the teams don´t play with a big physical unit up front. it´s mostly mobile forwards or even adaptations. Another thing is that Rojo played for Sporting (and since we are a big club) most of the teams (except for Porto, Benfica and Braga) play in very defensive setups and center backs (excluding the set pieces) have to deal with counter attack football. I think he was more comfortable with that.

2166~~~
Haven´t been following Mangala's career but there has been some echos in the portuguese media about him struggling. Yesterday there was an article in "A Bola" about Allardyce criticizing him and saying they were exploiting his frailties. Also blaming Pellegrini for the lack of tactical support. Last year in Portugal Rojo was better than Mangala. Garay and Rojo were the best centerbacks in the league.

2167~~~
That's interesting. How come Mangala was like triple the price as Rojo then? Not too much younger either?

2168~~~
I still think Rojo makes a lot of errors in games. Thankfully they're the sort of errors you'd expect from someone who's new to the Premier League, namely misjudging the speed with which he'll be closed down or a bit of weakness in the air. Hopefully, they'll improve in time.

2169~~~
Well Mangala played a very good first season at Porto and was decent in the Champions League and EL which probably inflated his value. Mangala also came to Porto after a succesful spell at Standart Liége. Rojo didn't play in european competitions to prove himself and inflate his value and came to Sporting after a unsuccesful Spartak Moscow stint. Rojo only had one very good season of domestic football and a positive campaign in the World Cup where he got into the tournaments eleven. Mangala had a higher release clause and Porto are known to drive a very hard bargain. These are the main factors behind the different values. If you ask me both were over valued. I´d value Mangala at 15 to 20 million euros and Rojo at 10 to 15 million euros. We know how the market works these days.

2170~~~
That's great to hear and will hopefully put an end to this crazy idea that we're converting a full-back.

2171~~~
Rojo was always a center back by nature mate. In Argentina he plays there but anyone who follows his career knows that he is more comfortable as center back. I´ve been trying to dispell that notion from the start in this forum. There's alot of misinformation about Rojo's position specially the english media. Lazy journalism. I think i've already translated a Rojo interview of when he got transfered to Sporting but i'll put it here again:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=572213&amp;tm=27&amp;layout=158&amp;visual=49" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=572213&amp;tm=27&amp;layout=158&amp;visual=49</a>

Translating the important part:

"O internacional argentino, que se assume como "um jogador aguerrido e de pensamento positivo", adiantou preferir jogar a central, "mas se o treinador precisar de mim na esquerda não há problema".

The argentinian international who assumes that he is "an aggressive player with positive mentality", admits that he prefers to play as center back, "but if the manager needs me in the left there's no problem".

2172~~~
we should have signed both, Rojo and Garay

2173~~~
Benfica got 2,5 million for arguably the best center back in Portugal. What an amazing deal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2174~~~
I think Rojo has the talent and will need to put on a bit more muscle to take on the heavyweight strikers in the league. 

Remember that Evra and Vida also struggled for a good 6 months before they found their feet and took them another half a year to truly take-off in the PL.

The boy needs time and I think he'll come good.

2175~~~
I think he will do well for us eventually. I really warm to him, he seems to have the right attitude, plus I don't think the unsettled back centre back pairing helps matters.

2176~~~
Saying he's been partnered by evans , McNair , jones , blacket and smalling  and doesn't speak any English he's not done too bad . 

He's not been injured to , which for a United centre half is rarer than rockin horse shit.

2177~~~
This key quality automatically makes him a good signing so far. Imagine if he hadn't been here.....

2178~~~
True, the mind boggles. To have had to take on the role of the rock at the heart of our defence so early, the one guaranteed starter surrounded by a sea of ever-changing often inexperienced faces at the back, well, who would have believed we'd be so reliant on him? He's done well but I want to see him when things have settled before making my mind up.

2179~~~
Needs time but I like him. If we can get through enough games and he gets the time he needs, he'll be a player for us for a long time.

2180~~~
Dont hold those orange boots agaisnt him. Socks by the ankle,now thats a different matter.

2181~~~
He's done well enough. I'm astonished that some are saying he's been 'very poor' or 'a mistake waiting to happen', yet fail to take into context that he is a new signing, in a new league and is yet to play in a settled defence with a different centre back partnering him every week. He's not without his faults, but he's got some positives in his favour too.

If he cuts out the careless square passes, improves his focus and concentration, while not struggling against aerially or dealing with balls into strikers feet, he could become a very accomplished centre back for us.

2182~~~
he stays fit for more than 2 games... so for that alone he has to be given a nice long stint at centre back to make it his own.

2183~~~
Not much to do then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2184~~~
Well one of those shouldn't be too difficult <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2185~~~
Just starting in a new league I think he's doing well. Sometimes in key moments he looks a little nervous but he's a tremendous athlete and he's very good in the air. I think he will grow in confidence and dominance as his time here goes on. He's a very good defender and I like him a lot.

2186~~~
Eh? Thats the shoe. The new nike has a built in sock liner.

2187~~~
This really winds me up, and shows how much people take the media at face value. Some were doing the same with Blind and saying we'd signed 3 left backs. My mates dismissing United as top 4 contenders just after the window shut because we "Didn't sign a midfielder or a centre back" was particularly annoying.

2188~~~
Apparently Rojo has a beef with Aguero. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sergio-aguero-marcos-rojo-embroiled-4550726" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sergio-aguero-marcos-rojo-embroiled-4550726</a>

<b>Rojo said he would mark Aguero in the match “with a degree of firmness.”</b>

Should be interesting to watch

2189~~~
Just as long as he doesn't get himself sent off I'm all for a bit of tension.

2190~~~
the "who would win a fight" poll at the end <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I voted Rojo <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> 
I don't mind that as long as he doesn't do anything stupid and gets sent off.

2191~~~
This poll is ridiculous, Aguero has absolutely no chance.

2192~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2193~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what a fecking soap opera.

2194~~~
Hope he's better than semi concentrating on the job!

2195~~~
The part about Aguero cancelling a coaching clinic that both he and Rojo committed to was hilarious. Aguero cancelled at last minute, and Rojo said 'maybe he's scared' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>! Rojo's plan B to football was probably boxing<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2196~~~
he has been a very good signing for us. he has the occasional lape of concentration/mistakes. but overall he does his job well. Language may be an issue too.

2197~~~
Aguero is a bit of a drama queen!

According to Argentine gossip he is not happy that his gf gets on well with her ex (who Rojo invited to the dressing room). His gf and the ex have a girl together, so not out of order really that they get on well imo.

Then Aguero's father is now the "manager" or whatever of his gf and accompanies her on concerts. Reason according to gossip for that is Aguero being jealous and not wanting his gf to be on her own <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He needs to grow up <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2198~~~
My opinion on LvG goin for Rojo; is that Rojo came to his attention during the WC playin at LB, but heard that he can also play at CB.

So Rojo was our back-up option to Vermaelen - who was a friggin rediculous target in the 1st plac, given he never played in 2 seasons at Arsenal, due to injury or serious loss of form.

That to me, doesnt give great confidence in LvG's ability to assess defenders to bring in from the outside. He already knew Evans, Smalling & Jones were injury-prone, yet decided to roll with it. Massive mistake!

The jury is very much still out on Rojo. One things for sure though - he's nowhere near the standard of Rio or Vida & thats what we needed. Proven quality CB's should have been the priority for LvG..

2199~~~
Nice one - Rojo will be under the spotlight for the match today & the question of "intent", will not be an issue with the ref!

Also, for all we know, Aguero may have good reason to hate Rojo's mate. He could have been treating Aguero's girlfriend like shit (when he was with her). Most of us would have a beef about shit like that - if thats the case though.

Wish Aguero would just come out & say something regarding the matter, but there's most likely legal ramifications in him doing so... all parties are high-profile etc..

2200~~~
Big test for him today.  Playing against top players in a highly charged atmosphere.   He's got a reputation for being a hot head so will be interesting to see if he shows that side to him.  I've not seen it so far in his United career.

I would not be surprised if we set up with a formation that gives Rojo and Smalling some more protection than normal with City having Aguero in such good form.

One of the players I am very interesting in how they cope with this match. Really hope him and Smalling impress.

2201~~~
We don't know if Vermaelen was a serious target though, it could all just be speculation. Quotes from Rumenigge suggest that for LVG defense doesn't take priority which seems feasible considering our summer transfers. It appears to be something that comes with the LVG package so to speak.

However, personally I feel like Rojos done very well  at CB so far, all things considered, and I believe that I'd still think so even without the context. We were looking for a good left-footed CB and supply was low.

Even if he knew the full extent of Evans/Smalling/Jones' hazardous tendencies you'd still Believe that enough of them would be able to stay healthy enough to occupy a single spot in defense also considering we're playing a smaller amount of games this year. They're all very talented defenders so to just discard them would be reckless IMO.

I think that the only proven quality CB who was up for grabs this summer was Benatia who's right footed and perhaps therefore didn't fit the profile. Besides that he allegedly didn't want to come here since we couldn't offer CL football, so there's also that.

2202~~~
Carragher and Neville thought we were signing a left back who can also play centre back in Daley Blind and then in the same discussion criticised Louis van Gaal for not looking at a central midfielder.

I could not believe it, they were commenting on his football ability yet completely unaware of the position he plays.

2203~~~
It's like criticizing Americans for driving on the left-hand side of the road...

2204~~~
In Russian press there were a lot of talks about how this figure is far from the real one - as Benfica should've pay some big percentage of this transfer back to Real

And I thought that the official amount was 6 millions, not 2,5?

Mixed feelings towards Rojo's performances so far. While I applaud him for having played with someone different alongside him almost every game, he is very prone to silly errors which can be quite costly. Thankfully most of the time someone has covered. I can certainly see why Argentina were using him in the full back position as right now, it looks like it suits him more. 
That said, I'm hoping that by the end of the season we'll have a much more settled defense and he'll be at the heart of it

2206~~~
He's looked average at best so far, but it's very early days and he's been part of an ever changing back line so far. Hopefully, we'll play the same defensive unit today as we did against Chelsea, which will help in continuity terms.

Before we go too overboard in criticising Rojo, worth pointing out that Mangala has been significantly worse and he cost double.

2207~~~
Rojo is a decent player. He's tough, fast, fairly talented and pretty versatile. However he's no better to what we already have and with so many young defenders around we needed a leader.

2208~~~
Add left footed and experienced and it was/is good to have him as an option in the squad.

2209~~~
Official ammount was indeed 6 million. The question here is that Benfica only had 50% of the rights. The other 50% belonged to Real Madrid. So it was 2,5 million each and 1 million to the agent i think.

2210~~~
Nope. 6 million to Benfica (40%), Zenit paid around 15 millions overall (and rumors are that the actual amount was bigger).

2211~~~
Nope. Don't base yourself on rumours. I'm basing myself on the Benfica CMVM (Lisbon stock exchange) report, that every PLC has to do in Portugal.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dn.pt/desporto/benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=3991366" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dn.pt/desporto/benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=3991366</a>

"O Benfica oficializou, <a class="externalLink" href="http://web3.cmvm.pt/sdi2004/emitentes/docs/FR50998.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">em comunicado dirigido à Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários (CMVM)</a>, nesta quarta-feira, a transferência do central argentino Ezequiel Garay para o Zenit, numa operação que vai render apenas 2,4 milhões de euros aos cofres da Luz.



Ao contrário do que foi inicialmente noticiado, os seis milhões de euros não correspondem aos 40% que o Benfica detinha, mas sim à totalidade da transferência, confirma a Agência <i>EFE</i>.

Assim, o Real Madrid vai receber três milhões de euros e o Benfica Stars Fund 600 mil euros, detalha a Agência <i>EFE</i>. O Benfica, recorde-se, pagou 5,5 milhões de euros por Garay e encaixou 1,175 milhões pela alienação de 10% do passe no mesmo ano."


Translating the important part:

"Benfica made the Garay transfer to Zenit official with a CMVM stock exchange report this wednesday, in an operation that will only get 2,4 million euros to the club.

Contrary to what was recently reported, the six million euros don't correspond to the 40% that Benfica had, but to the total transfer value, reported the spanish agency EFE.

This way, Real Madrid will get 3 million euros, Benfica stars fund will get 600k euros."

Hope this settles it.

2212~~~
Thanks! Interesting.

2213~~~
There was big unrest with Benfica fans because of this deal. The Garay thread in the Benfica forum was full of insults towards their president. There is a pattern in some deals made by him. Selling or loaning players to clubs that are either building stadiums or football related infrastructures since he has a big construction company. It was the case of loaning an argentine player Fariñas to a club in the United Arab Emirates, loaning and selling players to Granada and Atlético Madrid among other examples. Dunno if he has some kind of interest in Zenit's new stadium for the russian WC. I would bet he does.
When you analyze the Benfica Garay deals (Benfica purchase from Real, the sale of a percentage to a fund ran by the BES bank and finally the sale to Zenit), you get to the conclusion that Benfica had a net loss of 1.9 million euros. Which is puzzling in a player that was arguably the best center back in Portugal, a starter in the Argentina team and a player who was attracting interest from Bayern, United and even Barcelona in the end. Of course most of the Benfica fans suspect some kind of foul play in this deal.

2214~~~
He is an upgrade on Buttner as an actual left-back option.
And he is decent enough for us to have a squad-position while having the raw talent there to become world class (don't think it's likely at all though).
I said it before, before our summer-transfers, we had Buttner & Evra on the left-back position, now we have Shaw, Rojo & Blind, there is no need to moan about that at all.

We needed a leader as a centreback, yes, and we still do, but we did need more numbers at CB after losing Ferdinand & Vidic while the rest of the lot are all injury prone. And we still needed another left-back, so Rojo wasn't a bad move for us at all, just not the only one we needed.

2215~~~
Got the ball but the player as well
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OOg5ZZBH1Pp/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2216~~~
And another one bites the dust.

2217~~~
McNair and Blackett to start the next game?

2218~~~
Looks like a dislocated shoulder - probably out for 6 weeks at least.

2219~~~

2220~~~
He was holding his shoulder, so it could well be. Didn't look like a minor niggle.

2221~~~
My initial thoughts were collar bone.

2222~~~

2223~~~
And the curse continues. Ridiculous at this rate.

2224~~~
He's a fecking nutter. Far too rash.

2225~~~
A bit of a stupid way to get injured. Had no need to go sliding in like that. Was like somethin Phil Jones would be at

2226~~~
A very good passer, but he seems worryingly shite at actual defending and his injury about summed it up.

2227~~~
Injured himself going in recklessly ala Jones. Could have been worse, should have been sent off for the clear penalty on Toure. Did make one or two good blocks at times, in between costly mistakes

2228~~~
Unlucky United and Rojo. Rojo's only "serious" injury in his Sporting career was also in the shoulder. He got injured against Benfica and missed two games.

2229~~~
Not sure he should be starting for us tbh if all our fit. (Not that will ever happen.)

2230~~~
This guy isn't a central defender. Buy two quality centre backs and this guy will be nothing more than backup to Luke.

2231~~~
He looked out of it on the stretcher, what do they put in those canisters? Shame he's injured but what the hell was he doing? Him and Jones will hurt themselves more often than they get injured by someone else with that type of play.

2232~~~
He is a good defender but he didn't need to slide out like that. Its a shame he's been hurt now, he was deservedly a mainstay in our team.

2233~~~
Oxygen?

2234~~~
Played well against both City and Chelsea, hope he's not out for too long.

2235~~~
I didn't use a smiley but it was meant to be a joke, he kinda looked high as they carried him off.

2236~~~
Shame about the injury, we need the bodies.

2237~~~
Haven't been impressed by him at all and I thought he was really poor today. Shame about the injury though.

2238~~~
Good one

2239~~~
Not a pen. He definitely got the ball first and Yaya dived. He was lucky the ref was close and got a good view. On another day it could easily have pen.

2240~~~
Looked like a dislocated shoulder, hopefully nothing too serious than that.

2241~~~
Van Gaal said his shoulder is out (according to NBC Sports).

2242~~~
I'm really worried about his lack of composure when defending. He always seems in such panic.

2243~~~
I thought he was decent before the injury

2244~~~
Tackle from behind. Cant do it,  denied a goalscoring chance.

Wish it wasn't but it was a clear penalty

2245~~~
I didn't really think he looked all that during the WC and I've seen nothing to shake that belief. Hopefully I'm wrong, though.

2246~~~
He was excellent as LB in WC. I thought LvG bought him because of his fetish with 3 CB system early on, which Rojo would be suited in that system as LCB. 

Agreed that we shouldn't buy him as our CB 'savior', though.

2247~~~
He strikes me as a player who needs time to settle in. Being thrown into the fire on day one was never a good idea.

2248~~~
He certainly wasn't too bad today. Ridiculous to say it was a nailed on pen when he got the ball, though it was certainly risky.

Still, we didn't concede with him on the pitch.

Has that Jones rashness leading to injury though - injured himself with a wild lunging challenge into no one.

2249~~~
He's like all our other current senior defenders moulded into one.

2250~~~
Yup, denied a chance by getting the ball..

2251~~~
We are cursed. Fergie went to the cross roads and made a deal.

2252~~~
Never a penalty IMO. I thought he did well today, hope his injury is not too serious.

2253~~~
How long does a dislocation mean he's out for? Guess it depends on any ligament damage yes?

2254~~~
I can't shake the feeling that he's just a bit crap. He just looks like somebody who will never be good enough to play for us regularly. Also his hair is crap too.

2255~~~
Annoying to lose him to injury as well. All things considered, he hasn't done too bad. Consider just how badly our defence has been decimated since the start of the season. We're also in the process of bedding in new players and understanding a different system of play. It would be a big challenge for even the most experienced defenders to slot in seamlessly. We have to give him a fair amount of time to adjust to the league before we make judgements. He has got ability but that reckless streak needs a bit more coaching out of him. He's got a tendency to lunge at the ball or pass it out carelessly from the back.

2256~~~
Lots of passion, but an absolute car crash of a defender. The challenge in which he got injured was just utter wreckless.

2257~~~
Certainly not a calming influence.

2258~~~
I have the exact same feeling. His passing is a bit erratic, he looks prone to a rash challenge, and his lack of confidence with his right foot is a major concern.

2259~~~
You know what it is... he just doesn't <b>look</b> like a centre-back. I mean visually... it just doesn't look right. Whether its his build, height, hair or whatever... there's something not quite right.

He needs to be bald.

2260~~~
Hope he isn't out for too long with the dislocated shoulder. No surgery required on that injury at least?

2261~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He certainly never was that for Sporting. It's about his playing style. He is always too aggressive in the disputes. Our previous manager tried to calm him a bit but he said in an interview that it's part of his argentinian blood.

2262~~~
One of the worst defenders to play for us. In fact, he doesn't look a defender at all. Can't position himself, can't tackle, can't head, let Yaya run ahead of him without any effort, is a terrible passer of the ball. Doesn't have one reedeming quality.

2263~~~
I thought he did decent and nullified Aguero for the most part. There were two times however Kun got away from him and De Gea saved him. But other than that, he looked decent. I think hes getting better with each game as a CB and its a shame he dislocated his shoulder. His own fault for being rash in that.

2264~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/english-soccer/louis-van-gaal-confirms-marcos-rojo-suffered-dislocated-shoulder-1.1985271" target="_blank">http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soc...s-rojo-suffered-dislocated-shoulder-1.1985271</a>

2265~~~
6 if we are extremely lucky. 

Could be talking between 10 - 14 weeks to let that injury properly heal

2266~~~
Some extremely harsh posts on him. If you see him as a future squad player, providing backup to the LCB and LB position.. he will still be a cult figure at this club. I just don't think he's starter quality at CB for a club this size, but he is not that bad to the point he's not good enough. More signings are needed so that he can learn his craft at a slower pace.

2267~~~
Jury is still out, but I understand he's adapting to a new league.

2268~~~
Came in way to late like a shit brickhouse... He and Smalling have to be the biggest accidents waiting to happen of any CB pairing in top flight football. He and Smalling out for next game might be a blessing...

2269~~~
I thought he played quite well today, he keep Augero quiet for large parts of the game. Saying that he could easily have been sent off today.

2270~~~
He definitely should have been sent off, he was okay, bit hit and miss to be honest, like most of his performances.

2271~~~
Yeah, if Rojo is the answer we are in trouble.

2272~~~
He doesn't seem to have a brain.

2273~~~
That's too harsh and wrong too.

Sure he could have been better till now but that's completely OTT.

2274~~~
Personally get the feeling he'd be doing a lot better with a solid CB beded in beside him, he's new to the PL and has had 3-4  different players partnering him.
Granted he should have been sent  off today with a penalty but just personally don't think he's quite as untalented as some are  writing.

2275~~~
Just looking more and more unlikely to ever make it here, I'd have him for depth at the most but he's never a starting player for a title challenging side.

2276~~~
He looks like a good player to me

2277~~~
Man, based on performances so far, I stand by each and every word of that. I haven't seen anything from him that a decent defender should do. McNair instantly looked better than him, inspite of committing a couple of errors himself. 

I don't get that defender vibe from him. Is he a natural defender? Or one of those converts?

2278~~~
I actually thought he did okay today <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> yet another different CB partner and more often than not got the better of Aguero and Jovetic. Rash way to get himself an injury mind.

2279~~~
Same as Smaling and Jones then

2280~~~
How on earth have you come to that conclusion? So far he has looked like a complete train wreck.

The thing to cling to is he might adapt to the league. So far he looks well out of his depth.

2281~~~
Same here, decent at least and still young.

2282~~~
I thought so too. He doesn't seem to make the game saving tackles that get on the highlight reels but by and large he gets the job done. Just checked out whoscored for his stats too, and while it doesn't tell the whole story, he does clock in some decent figures for aerial duels, tackles and interceptions. Probably not the next Vidic/Rio but I do think there's a bit more quality in him than we realise.

2283~~~
Even if he got the ball first?

2284~~~
Again, people seeing what they want to see. He did alright today in impossible circumstances.

2285~~~
I havent gone through the rules with a fine tooth comb, but I can remember a couple of seasons ago they clamped down on all tackles from behind and all of them were supposed to be punished whether they got the ball or not.

2286~~~
You may be right, but it just seems there have been many tackles lauded as great where the defender, from behind, wrapped his foot around the attacker, nicking the ball first. I seem to remember Heinze executing one of these in his first season for us.

2287~~~
Yeah that kind of untidy tackling was typical Heinze.

2288~~~
Jones is 22. He has an excuse. If he's still like that in a couple of years, then I'd worry.

Smalling most definitely does have a brain, today's antics not withstanding. What most people doubt about him is his ability on the ball, but that seems to be getting better.

Rojo always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. There's a world of difference to the other two.

2289~~~
Everyone seems to be being extremely harsh on him. I'd much rather he was playing than any of our other centre backs at the moment. Which is a shame because he obviously won't be now.

2290~~~
But am I imagining it, or was there not a tackle for which he won universal praise (at least around these parts,) that fit that description? I honestly don't trust my memory these days.

2291~~~
I think people are being harsh. I think he looked alright today.

2292~~~
I liked him mostly because he was the only fit CB we had, and now he did a Jones, shame. As for his defending, you only need to look at his "marking" of Aguero when Aguero and de Gea colided to realise he is far from great defender.

2293~~~
There are some crazy overreactions about. He had a decent game before he got injured.

Smalling did too for that matter, other than 2 terrible decisions that are all anyone will remember.

2294~~~
He is getting better every match it's just a shame about the injury as he will be out for a while now unfortunately.

2295~~~
So out for anywhere between 6 and 14 weeks? I know he's got a rash streak but I think he's shown some positives and is currently our best option in the LCB role. Given LvG's insistence of having one left footed CB does that mean Blackett is set for a run of starts?

2296~~~
He looks like a bad version of David Luiz (or like a left footer Phil Jones) and has looked so in every match he has played at LB. No idea if that is just temporary (new league, team, language etc) or that is his style of 'defending'.

Break the bank for Laporte and we will have fixed half of central defense for 10 years. He's arguably the best young CB on the world and would instantly be our best CB. Still think that it was a bit dump for us to not sign Benatia on the summer, which would have fixed the other half of central defense.

Hoping that Rojo completely changes my opinion, but in these matches for us (and for Argentina in WC and Copa America when he played as a left back) I have seen nothing to suggest that he may become e very good central defender. 

Again no idea why we didn't sign Garay who would have been cheaper and is easily better than Rojo.

2297~~~
I'd rather have a player who's overly aggressive than one who's too passive if i'm honest. I Think that it's easier to reign it in a bit than it is to pull it out if it doesn't come naturally. He's still young, his decisionmaking will improve. It's an important trait to have in the PL as the tempo will force you to act on instinct and to make quick decisions. There was one time in the game where Aguero went through two players and was going 1 on 1 vs Rojo where he just put it all on the line and made a good challenge to keep him from going free with De Gea. Another player might have been more passive, stood up and got outrun but Rojo won't. Sometimes it'll work, sometimes it won't but wih time i'm confident that he'll make the right decisions more often than not. He could very well be our next Vidic, the question is if we can find a Ferdinandesque player to compliment him.

2298~~~
laughing my fecking ass off at this friend. "Bad David Luiz" and "Our worst defender ever".

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2299~~~
I don't really understand why he's not getting universal praise tbh. Been doing very well in ridiculously testing circumstance.

2300~~~
Rojo was the back up plan for Vermaelen - that says it all about our defensive recruitment policy under LvG.

He seemed to forget who was gonna replace Vida & Rio more importantly too. What planet was he on, when every man & his dog was saying how shite & injury-prone our defence was.

To me, he was cocky & just thought he had a magic wand to make non-United standard defenders into world beaters.

So f*cked off with LvG about this!

2301~~~
Because with every great defence that made United great, we compare the new defence. 

So, how do you compare our new defence to the other great defences of previous years - most recently, the defence that massively helped get us to 3 Champions League finals in 4 years?

2302~~~
Obviously worse. But thats such an utterly irrelevant factoid that I have no idea why you'd bring it up. Lest we forget that the 'the defence that massively helped get us to 3 Champions League finals in 4 years' was comprised of two players in Evra and Vidic that most people thought were utterly shite for at least the first 6 months of their career at the club, despite getting their starts in far less trying circumstances than Rojo has.

2303~~~
I'm starting to change my mind about rojo, i think he's a really good defender and in time will prove a lot of people wrong.

2304~~~
He did OK today but that's about it. 'OK' seems to be his level. I think he will make a good squad player, he can play the two positions and can do a job but he's not good enough to be starting 40+ games a season imo.

2305~~~
Agree with that!

2306~~~
Blessing in disguise.

2307~~~

2308~~~
Wahey

2309~~~
Evra and Vidic struggled with the pace and physicality of a league they joined in midseason, whereas Rojo just seems to not be very intelligent. I just don't see a first team player in him long term.

2310~~~
Yeah he's no leader like Lovren.

2311~~~
And again, another person randomly brings a Liverpool player into a discussion about a United player. Strange that.

2312~~~
He's about the same level as Sakho who last year you lot were hailing as the second coming...

Give it a rest. That wasn't a part of any "discussion", it was a dig at a United player and people replied in kind.

2313~~~
Aye, its a shame we don't have excellent defenders like Lovren, Skrtel, Toure, Johnson, Sakho.

2314~~~
Why doesn't he seem intelligent to you? And why does that matter? Terry strikes as as thick as pig shit, but he's been one of the best defenders in the league for nigh on ten years.

2315~~~
Footballing intelligence, I mean. Messing up offside traps, getting caught out of position and diving in recklessly to challenges.

Granted, he's not the only one on our books who's guilty of that, but at least someone like Jones has the excuse of lacking playing time at CB. Not to mention several years on Rojo.

2316~~~
Nah. He's been better than Lovren, but Sakho was better.

It would've been a blessing in disguise had he been injured. He's an average/poor player and Smalling, Jones amd McNair all are/have looked significantly better.

Yes, we have shit defenders (still think Sakho is good). I don't see the relevance to my comment on Rojo though.

2317~~~
I don't think thats to do with intelligence though. I just think its a lack of understanding with the players he's playing with. Case in point, I slated him on here for West Broms second, because he should have dropped off when Jones went to challenge, but I don't think thats because he's not intelligent, just a lack of understanding that Jones is an idiot and would go to challenge for that ball.

I think he reads the game quite well, which is pretty much the only criteria of being 'intelligent' I really care about, he doesn't seem to take unnecessary risks with his passing and if he can form a partnership with <i>anyone </i>you'll see the decision making improve.

I respect you're actually basing your opinion on a tangible observation on what he's doing on the pitch though. Far too many posts in here have people writing him off with no justification.

2318~~~
I think Rojo is a match for Jones on this score, but I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I see him as being of a similar quality to Silvestre.

I don't care about any other kind of intelligence either.

2319~~~
As a Liverpool fan what do you expect?

2320~~~
Time will tell I guess, todays injury scare was very Jones like. I think he'll need leadership alongside him to bring out the best in him long term. Unfortunately no one offers that.

2321~~~
yeah i think he is awesome really, particularly his performances in the last 2 matches have been outstanding.

2322~~~
I have been training handball when i was younger and my friend dislocated his shoulder and trainer came and fix it when my friend was in shock. He was able to play handball pretty soon.

The other example which come through my mind was one of the ski-jumpers who dislocated his shoulder when he fell and there were people who could fix it straigth away. He was able to jumping the next day.

Is Rojo example familiar? i was confused when some people was talking he would be away for half a season.

2323~~~
Didnt rate much before and certainly dont since i've seen him in the EPL, not for a side aspiring to be title winners within a few seasons anyway.

Average passer, rash and offers little in the way of confidence to the back line. Oddly enough a poorer version of Luiz is probably an apt description, in that his positional awareness and lack of sense will see him give so many goals away.

Also, has he not actually injured himself or what?

2324~~~
Going a bit far that. He is improving, which is certainly a good sign but I would hardly say his performance has been "awesome". Anyway, glad his injury does not seems to be too severe.

2325~~~
Must be referring to his tackle on Toure.

2326~~~
Hope the injury isn't too bad. We need the bodies in CB because we just can't get them all fit.

2327~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2328~~~
I can see how he plays overrall and don't make judgements based on a few rash errors he might of made.
Overrall he looks like a good player.

2329~~~
He's looked very much like I imagined he would when I'd never seen him play.

2330~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2331~~~
Anyone has a video of the Toure tackle?  Seems to be a consensus that it should have been a pen though I felt that he actually got the ball

2332~~~
Looks weak, fragile and always close to a big mistake. I saw him during the WC and wan't impressed by his positionning as a left back, but he's even worse at center back.

We really need to have good center backs to be closer to the top sides. If our midfield can match them, if our forward can match them, we must have good defenders, and Rojo is not

2333~~~
Before this game I thought he was just another Phil Jones except he could stay fit for a period of time. Not even that silver lining anymore.

2334~~~
Why do people dislike him so much?

Sure he can lack concentration at times, but he is great at 1 on 1 defending, and intercepts the ball really well. At times Aguero had him 1 on 1 and didn't get passed, that is all you need to know.

His passing is also pretty solid, apart from a few dodgy ones 9/10 he finds the forward pass into other players well.

2335~~~
Grandeur.

2336~~~
I think we should allow him a season before claiming he's shit. He has talent, but he just needs stability, and the time to adjust.

If he looks the same next year, then I guess we can ask real questions. I think a lot of people are being very impatient. Even with Falcao people are like 'waste of money' 'injury prone' etc etc because he's missed a couple games and hasn't been 100% when he has played.

2337~~~
feck me, some right bells in this thread again.

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2338~~~
Some hilarious overreactions in this thread. "Worst defender United have ever had" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Jesus wept.

2339~~~
I thought the Toure tackle was fantastic. If he did nothing, he would have been critisced for not getting stuck in, as it was he made a last tackle, won the ball and saved a certain goal.

IMO, he is a step up on Jones and Smalling but he won't be a starter when we add some class in January (here is me hoping).

2340~~~
I feel the same. He is a better Phil Jones, I don’t trust him much. But his passing is quite good I think. Boy still has time so I’m not really bothered.

I think he underestimates the strength of the opponents quite a lot.

2341~~~
I like him. Sure he has a little way to go, but he's only just started in this team and is part of a defense that never has the same personel - a recipe for inconsistency. I've seen enough to believe he'll become a very good defender for United.

2342~~~
I seem to remember people saying that about Vidic in his first 10 games at United. Look how that turned out.

2343~~~
I don't get all the hate, I think he has been wonderful for us despite the kind of players he has had to play along side.

2344~~~
I rate him, i also think he is our best defender in the squad right now and we should stick with him for the future too. He is good with the ball and decent in the air, he didn't really make any mistakes so far(or at least i don't remember) and he is still young. If we can get someone like Chiellini or Laporte then fair enough but otherwise i wouldn't take him out of the team even next year. 

The bigger problem is the right side of the defence, now that is the position where we have to strenghten.

2345~~~
Looks like it might not be too serious:

2347~~~

2348~~~
Telegraph running a story as well, although they went with three months instead of six. Guess that makes The Independent twice as good. Anyway, assuming it's just speculative articles to make them some money.

Edit: Also, why would they come up with their own translation for the tweet, when the tweet actually included an English text? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Idiots.

2349~~~
I agree 100% he takes the ball. This should be regarded as perfect tackling NOT a fecking foul. Exactly like Fletcher's wonder tackle on Fabregas back in CL semi vs Arsenal. We badly missed Fletch in that final and for nothing.

2350~~~
A bit bizarre that Rojos saying its nothing yet papers are still reporting he could be out for 3 or 6 months

2351~~~
...<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>...

2352~~~
He goes through the player to get the ball, on the Touré one. It was a definite pen (and red) for me.

2353~~~
Which journo will up the ante and declare that his arm fell off?

2354~~~
Frankly penalty appeals are becoming utterly bizarre now,  we used to always hear stuff that if this happened outside the box then it would be a free kick but now it's the opposite. Even the Fellaini incident would barely qualify for a free kick and you have Aguero going down like crazy. Football is now becoming like Field hockey where attackers are actually looking for feet inside the box to win a penalty

2355~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that's a quite spectacular bit of fecktardery.

2356~~~
The article in the Indo also includes this gem.

You what?

2357~~~
He didn't go THROUGH Toure to get the ball. He sniped the ball from between his legs. Great tackle. I like Rojo, hope he's not out for long. 

And remember, just before Rojo hurt himself one of the City players went flying in with a two-footed challenge on of ours which went unpunished. Also, three of their players should of been booked in the first half alone before Smalling got his first yellow. And every ref knows Aguero is looking for the touch on his leg to go down. Maybe one of the tackles that lightly touched his foot could of been a penalty, but I thought the ref did a great job not falling for Aguero's trap.

2358~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2359~~~
Out for 3/6 months depending which paper you believe.  Injuries will happen in football though and you just have to have cover ready to slot in.

Could be a golden opportunity for Blackett as our only other left-sided central defender (I think?) and LVG seems very keen on this

2360~~~
Such BS, lazy journalism this...  Marcos Rojo ###COULD### be out for up to 6 months...  It's like saying, 'Marcos Rojo could have a gender reassignment operation and change his name to Sally', 'Marcos Rojo could fly to Australia and battle crocs in a new TV show called Rojo vs the bush'.  What they mean to say is, 'we have no idea how long Marcos Rojo will be out for, but it's Monday and we're still a bit hungover from the weekend so instead of actually, you know, doing journalism, we'll just make up some bs to fill some lines in our crappy outdated little papers."

2361~~~
It's obvious that the journos don't realize that Rojo had an op last night, he'll be ready for Saturday.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s14.postimg.org/hqadtq10x/captain_america_the_winter_soldier_12.jpg" src="http://s14.postimg.org/hqadtq10x/captain_america_the_winter_soldier_12.jpg"/></a>

2362~~~
game aside, i didnt like Rojo spouting off a few days ago about how he could bully aguero and dominate him. Clearly that was going to backfire

2363~~~

2364~~~
Hopefully!

2365~~~
There is something to work with in Rojo. He does make mistakes, but also manages a lot of commendable defending.  If he can sort out his positioning in preparation for the ball over the top and calm himself down he could very good, because he intercepts and tackles well. A lot of ifs and buts, though, admittedly.

2366~~~
Plus he looks a tough bastard. Jones, Smalling and Evans just don't have that presence.

2367~~~

2368~~~
Out for a month or so according to this...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://tn.com.ar/deportes/esencial/marcos-rojo-la-lesion-no-seria-quirurgica-pero-se-perdera-los-partidos-de-la-seleccion_541669" target="_blank">http://tn.com.ar/deportes/esencial/...e-perdera-los-partidos-de-la-seleccion_541669</a>

2369~~~
God, so who to believe? Maybe we should send him to Wenger for some injury prognosis ...

2370~~~
i believe the player, the papers and journalists nowadays are just a total waste of time.

2371~~~
I don't rate him all that highly at the moment but to lose him for six months (or even 3 months) would be a disaster considering how fit our other CBs are. Really hope it is just the few matches.

2372~~~
I'm not sold on Rojo. He's not the proper solid centre back we need. Most people seem to not realise his injury was a result of yet another brain dead piece of defending from him.

2373~~~
So he's shit after he's played 5 games? He hasn't even had a full season yet, and you lot are writing him off as usual.

2374~~~
So much negativity about Rojo it is unbelievable. What exactly has the guy done wrong?

2375~~~
He hasn't really done anything major wrong (from what I can recall). He has just had a few moments where he looks a little uncomfortable and nervy. It's too early to make a judgement on him though. Far too early.

2376~~~
Agree. I remember making that mistake with Evra's first few appearance. 

Not saying he is going to be as good as Evra was for us, but you can't judge at such an early stage.

2377~~~
I dont think anyone is writing him off. I too am not yet sold on him - he is decent, sure, but an actual, definite upgrade on what we already had (in terms of ability, not fitness)? Not so sure.

I would rather we had gone for experience in the summer and tried to get someone like Vlaar. Fitness, consistency and experience - someone that the likes of Jones and Smalling can play alongside and learn from.

2378~~~
Looking forward to LvG clearing up exactly how long he is out for at the presser tomorrow.

2379~~~
The defensive problems are still getting worse!!! unbelievable.

Good luck at the weekend Carrick

2380~~~
He didn't clear much up last week. Nothing regarding the timeframe of Falcao  or the defenders if I recall.

2381~~~
I would imagine a couple of weeks to let the swelling and bruising go down. 

If it was just the shoulder coming out of the joint it will be painful, but hopefully no lasting damage.

2382~~~
The hacks need to ask him, specifically. I can't recall Fergie doing into too much detail with regards to injuries unless asked either.

2383~~~
In normal circumstances I'd probably have plenty of reservations over what we've seen from Rojo so far but I've been slightly swayed by the thought of how bad things would've been if we <i>hadn't</i> signed him (or, worse, if we had signed Vermaelen instead).

Even if he doesn't prove to really be what we need he'll at least be a decent squad player, something we actually also desperately need given how threadbare we are in defence.

I mean I can't imagine we'll ever come to think of him as a <i>bad</i> signing given how much mileage we're probably going to get out of him. Even at worst he'll still be useful.

2384~~~
Has he even played for Barcelona this season?

2385~~~
No, he is now going for surgery.

2386~~~
hahaha, this is like Vidic and Evra all over again...Not saying he will be anywhere near them, but give the guy a chance ffs.

2387~~~
He's out for a while, but he does not need surgery according to our own website. LvG expects him to be back within 6 weeks. 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Nov/louis-van-gaal-previews-crystal-palace-visit.aspx?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

2388~~~
Hopefully he spends the time out working intensely on his English. Gets himself as settled into life in Manchester as quick as he can.

I don't think Rojo is the answer, but he's not had the best circumstances to come into, and he's not shown to be any worse than what we have either.

2389~~~
The worry is how easily it seemed to pop out. Was just a sliding tackle, with no contact with anyone other than the ground. Be just our fecking luck if he turns out to have some sort of permanent instability of the joint.

2390~~~
proper start to a United career; at least for a CB.

2391~~~
Get to be truly acquainted with the medical staff.

2392~~~
Of course, shouldn't be surprised. Glad we dodged that one.

2393~~~
We need to give this guy a break, maybe not the answer but he is consistent or was<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

2394~~~
Finally found a postive with the signing and the player, he injures himself in a positive way. Now, that's a relief.

2395~~~
Good man Veron!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rojo-man-utd-interest-huge-8116920" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...tball-news/rojo-man-utd-interest-huge-8116920</a>

Marcos Rojo has revealed it was a 'huge surprise' when he heard Manchester United were interested in signing him in the summer.

Rojo emerged as a target for Louis van Gaal after his performances for Argentina at the World Cup. And even the 24-year-old says he wasn't expecting the Dutchman to come calling.

The centre-back was so desperate to secure a move to Old Trafford that he threatened to go on strike at Sporting Lisbon.

And Rojo, who is currently sidelined with a dislocated shoulder, says it was something he was willing to go through with until former United midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron stepped in.

Rojo said: “It was a huge surprise when I was told United wanted to buy me.

“I was in Portugal when my representative told me. He asked me to stay calm but I could not. I started living this dream.

“I could not think of anything else. I would call him every day, but when it seemed the transfer would not happen then I refused to work with Sporting.

“That was when Veron played his part in the process. He was like a strict father to me, scolding me.

“Veron called me one day when I had refused to train with Sporting and said ‘Do not be stubborn. If Manchester United wants a player then they will not let you escape.

“And so I went back, and the transfer went ahead.”

2396~~~
Just made me wish we had Veron nowadays in our midfield. What a player. Wrong time though.

2397~~~
Rojo was in the training video put on the official site today and in the back of a picture from last Friday's session too. LVG pulling a sneaky one with his fitness?

2398~~~
I never believed that

He simply didn't try hard enough in his spell with utd and lost his form.

2399~~~
Probably can do running to get his stamina up but, probably not much else for at least a few more weeks.

2400~~~
Don't believe it. I think he will be fine to play in a week or two and he is already training.

I already stated an example when Rojo got injuried. When i was in high school i was training handball and my friend dislocated his shoulder. Coach runned to him to help him and somehow fixed it. And my friend was playing handball a month later already. And hanball is much more contact sport than football.

I don't know what he did but suprisingly two months later i was watching ski-jumps and one of the jumpers fell and dislocated his shoulder. And he did compete the next day.
The comentator said the next day that one of medicine stuff fixed the jumper's shoulder while he was in shock and this is why he can jump just one day after the incident. I am no doctor to know more about it but i knew these two examples with dislocated shoulder.

It is probably important how bad the injury is but it looks like it can be sorted quickly.

2401~~~
Hope so - would be nice if we have him back at least for Southampton off the bench and then ready to start against Liverpool. Just think LVG will want to be extra careful because the last thing is want him out for an extended period because he comes back to early.

2402~~~

2403~~~
Fantastic news!

2404~~~
Nothing new there. We have already seen pictures of him training. 

On another note Jackson really is clueless. Apparently Herrera has been "demoted" to the reserves and has struggled with the pace of the Premier League despite the fact he was one of our better players before he got injured.

2405~~~
Someone posted a video of training yesterday, and Rojo was involved, so it's not surprise. Great to have him back, though. Except for Jones, we now have all of our centre backs available. I just hope they can stay fit now.

2406~~~
What kind of training is he doing though? It's not difficult to run around with a sore shoulder.

2407~~~
Yeah he's probably doing non contact stuff.

2408~~~
Aye, probably doing non-contact defending. Or, as it's known in the trade, playing centre back for Arsenal.

2409~~~
Isn't it possible to dislocate your shoulder and be completely fine only a week or so later? It would be a massive boost if he were to return early. Not only do we need centre half's but we could do with him at left back given Shaw's absence.

2410~~~
I dislocated my shoulder and was back on the pitch in four weeks.  "Completely fine" takes a little longer than a week, but I would think four weeks should do the job, especially for a top athlete who has access to the best medical care in the world.

2411~~~
Surprised to see Rojo starting today. He recovered very quickly.

2412~~~
He's been calm and kept it tidy, decent return for him.

2413~~~
Took this many games for him to get booked (feel free to correct me if i'm wrong). This clearly is Van Gaal's influence on him. Very surprised with his disciplinary record so far.

2414~~~
He was very good today, I thought.

2415~~~
Good performance, especially after coming back earlier than expected. He seemed oddly composed in contrast to his early season appearances where he seemed nervy and lacking confidence.

2416~~~
Best game so far. Passing and defending was super.

2417~~~
Barley noticed him all game tbh.

That is a good thing, Did the job and made a hard challenge.

2418~~~
And it was smart yellow on top of that.

2419~~~
He actually seems to be quite mature, at the moment at least. I don't get why people say they're nervous when he's playing, he tends to look pretty solid to me, and made some very good forward passes today.

2420~~~
Great game from him. He's a shoe-in for one of the CB positions, and for me the best option we have there. People say he worries them, but other than looking a bit nervous in his first couple of games he hasn't done much wrong... certainly compared to the others who seem to have a bet on who can get injured/sent off/dropped the most in one season.

2421~~~
He had a great game today. Was a little worried first half when he kept pushing forward a lot, but he seemed to fine with Carrick pulling in.
Him and Smalling if they can continue this partnership will be great.

2422~~~
Honestly neither he nor Smalling came under any real pressure all game. He looked decent enough but lets get a bit of perspective on it, we were in control all game and had very little defending to do.

2423~~~
I think he will form a good understanding with Carrick, kinda like the one he had with Carvalho at Sporting since Carrick and Carvalho are very similiar players.

2424~~~
He is a good ball player. It's when he has defending to do that scares me. 

Today he had to do none. Looked very good.

2425~~~
I think he's a good player to have in the squad but I wouldn't draw a line under his name as the answer to the LCB position, I'd like to see some true competition brought in for that spot as opposed to just Blackett.

2426~~~
I like him very much! Good thing he has recovered quickly.

2427~~~
Immense today, makes so much difference to have him at the back imo, he's damn good with the ball and always tries to play it forward/keep it low when starting building from the back.

2428~~~
Got a yellow against West Brom I think

2429~~~
Rojo didn't look out of sorts at all in this match. His defending, whenever he was called upon to it, was very good and composed, and he looked settled in defence alongside Smalling. He was also very good at passing the ball around, and he played much better than he did at the beginning when he looked somewhat shaky.

He still has those one or two moments where he presses too hard and loses his man. A couple of times, Aluko went past Rojo too easily because Rojo pressed Aluko too hard. The yellow was also a result of that. van Gaal has done a great job controlling Rojo's aggression, and I give credit to Rojo for playing less instinctively. However, he still has those very few moments of over-aggression that I'm sure he can eradicate, especially under van Gaal.

2430~~~
He looked really comfortable and composed today and like he enjoyed his football too.

2431~~~
Can't remember anyone having to do any defending today so can't really comment on that side of things but he brought the ball out from the back beautifully today.

2432~~~
His hairstyle really annoys me.

2433~~~
I liked that challenge on Aluko. Nice bit of strength and aggression.

2434~~~
Isn't Evans a LCB now?

2435~~~
Very composed on the ball. Like the look of the crazy fecker.

2436~~~
Looks like brickhouse.

2437~~~
He's strangely the most confident player on the pitch but he gives me a heart attack every time he gets the ball.

2438~~~
I thought he was a bit shaky on 1v1, overall still a decent performance, especially he might not fully fit.
The good new is our CBs looked comfortable playing the ball forward, no more bizarre backward pass to De Gea.

2439~~~
that is when defenders like him get praise.. I ve said it elsewhere. Van Gaal is really clever applying this passing style as our defense can be really shaky at times with a lot of changes in the line up of the back for. He knows that if we keep the ball the opponent will have less time to threaten us get tired. We have good defenders but still they need a lot of work to develop some understanding between each other. Its obviously hard when we have so many injuries in that resort but they are all very good on the ball which is why we play this style and of course its because we dont have the perfect players for counters. I mean Van Persie and Mata are not those types. Even Rooney is quite slow to counter attack. Fellaini. So we play this and we are getting better at it and players like Rojo benefit from it and gaining confidence which is what we need atm.

2440~~~
Him and Smalling is probably the best CB pairing we can put out, even when everyone's fit. They compliment each other quite well and i'm excited to see them develop together.

2441~~~
I think so too. Smalling is a very calm and composed and can be a good influence for Rojo when he is beside him. Neither were really tested defensively today but was still a good performance from Rojo.

2442~~~
He's actually right footed and I think the most likely to be moved on.

2443~~~
Ofcourse, there had to be something to be annoyed abut.

2444~~~
It was a good game for him to come back into. Thought he looked sharp and composed. Big test for him during the week though (if he plays).

2445~~~
Surprised this wasn't a post made by <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a>

2446~~~
I thought he looked a bit shaky against Aluko at times but generally did a fine job. He's definitely not a "safety first" defender and will never give you the feeling of security there was when Vidic was there but he seems very talented, unpredictable and completely mad. He reminds me of Heinze but without the elbows. He's great.

2447~~~
His passing from the back was a reason we managed to keep the tempo up high and retain the pressure through out the game. 

Yes he is a little risky at times, but his style of play is very important for the way we want to perform.

2448~~~
This. A consistent partner that communicates and covers well will be instrumental for the way we currently play. 

I find that he passes forward like a left back, pacy and into feet. There's a risk of interception infield but he pulls it off the majority of the time and it kickstarts our attacks well.

2449~~~
Cheeky bugger, claiming that goal. Don't think he got a touch. Good on him!

2450~~~
Played really well today. very composed, I hope the goal was his.

2451~~~
He's been good so far!

2452~~~
I think he's turning into a very, very good player for us. Very impressed with what he does.

2453~~~
I love him.

2454~~~
If Rojo-Smalling can stay fit we don't need to recruit a CB in January. Very assured and balanced partnership, if not world-beating.

2455~~~
It was his goal, his hair touched it apparently (photo).

2456~~~
So Rojo survived Stoke? Good to hear.

2457~~~
Barneylfc will still try to tell us he's shit.

2458~~~
Very very good tonight. Don't think he put a foot wrong.

2459~~~
Why mention Barney specifically? I remember plenty of United fans saying the same. For example Leroy the red. You guys need to be more patient. I still mantain my stance. He will become a fan favourite.

2460~~~
Very composed game from him, promising signs from the Smojo partnership.

2461~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2462~~~
I think most United fans have seen that he is steadily improving.

2463~~~
I really like him. Has those audacious moments, he's not a slouch, he's forceful, he tries to play the ball and he's not too bad at defending either.

I think he's got a mistake in him...but he's not quite David Luiz so it's fine.

2464~~~
Cheeky cnut with that goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Love the guy though, he's my #1 CB easily. Composed on the ball, he's like a fecking bullterrier chasing his strikers all over the pitch making them literally cry. There was a fantastic moment showing his technical ability around 70th minute or so, he's blocked or kicked the ball up in the air, DDG wanted to claim it but he showed him to go away and killed the ball on the ground to start an attack from the back. 

Great player to have.

2465~~~
Good game from him.

2466~~~
Van Gaal will work on that. He already did his work on his disciplinary problems. He will be a very useful player for United.

2467~~~
He's getting better each game now. Still has this reckless streak, but I feel it's a part of his charm now. I like my defenders tough.

2468~~~
His distribution forward to is impressive, not afraid to hit a players feet even when they're man is near which opens up space.  Still don't think he'll be the world beating defender we need but he's good.

2469~~~
I sure hope he turns out to be Vida 2.0 in essence. Different type of players obviously but like Nemanja he could be one to take our central defense up a notch after a less than ideal start to the league, alongside Shaw = Evra. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

It's ok, good is enough for now. The era of defensively rock solid defenders seems like a thing of the past. Rojo is more of a defender/ midfielder hybrid with his rather excellent distribution, something that seems to be in vogue these days. Once he gets a more extended with a central defensive partner, I wouldn't be surprised in he turns out to be a Godin level player somewhere down the line.

2470~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I like it! Keep those two playing together.

2471~~~
I really like him. It's difficult to build up much of an impression on the basis of a mere 90 minutes, but he genuinely seems to love it at United and his manner on the pitch seems to indicate that.

2472~~~
I've been pretty happy with him all season. Today he was excellent.

2473~~~
Played well today, maybe even his best game for us so far. Definitely getting better

2474~~~
Impressed with him today.

2475~~~
He was very good, loved how he was shamelessly trying to claim the goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2476~~~
That's what made me like Rojo at Sporting (excluding his antics when he left us for United). He gives his absolute all for the team, is always incentivating his teammates and is a positive player even when things aren't going well. I see he has been working on his disciplinary problems (with Van Gaal's influence) which was something that made the supporters adopt a bipolar stance in relation to him. He's maturing with this new experience at England.

2477~~~
He's a very direct centre back. Always looking to take the ball forwards, even if it means putting the shits up us supporters. Really liking his style.

2478~~~
I don't know why but during the match, I wanted him to kick stoke's players in the teeth to show them who's the boss. 
 Another solid performance. Hope he can stay fit

2479~~~
88% pass accuracy, plenty of balls forward, failed just the most difficult ones.

Him and Smalling work very well together. As soon as Chris stopped being forced to play it from the back and he let Rojo take care of it, he's been getting a lot less abuse about his shit hoofballing.

2480~~~
Love this guy.

2481~~~
I hope he can keep improving at this rate because it's almost visible game by game. Imagine the potential <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I also like his no nonsense approach to tackling. He seems to enjoy taking ball and man, like an old fashioned center back.

2482~~~
He's incredibly likeable. Today was easily his best performance so far for us, and it looks like him and Smalling are starting to build a really nice partnership.

2483~~~
He's the defender we've needed to sign and LvG has spotted him and signed him. I love him. Hard as nails, composed, excellent at passing the ball long down field, and he's got good aerial ability. Not perfect but another solid game tonight and him and Smalling should be our first choice pairing from now on.

2484~~~
I know he's a bit inconsistent but the one bit that is consistent is his composure on the ball and rather than hoofing it ala Rio (good lord could he hoof!) he aims low passes to available feet.

2485~~~
Might've outsmalling-ed Smalling today. Excellent game.

2486~~~
He struggled vs the more top teams and at LB but has done well otherwise so far.

2487~~~
He looked so happy when Mata's free kick went in, I hope he isn't too disappointed when it gets confirmed as Mata's goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Was goal. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2489~~~
Thank you Arsene, thank you Vermaelen and thank you Barca!

I love ball playing + aggressive + vocal CBs. Oh and great to have a crazy Argentinian fan favourite again at OT <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2490~~~
You forgot Woodward <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2491~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Haha! And Sporting!

2492~~~
I think it was in the first half when Stoke's player played a pass to Dave's way and their striker was nowhere near and them, close to each other sort that out with absolute ease, let the ball to dave...Seems like they are building nice cb partnership.

As for Rojo I think this was his best match of the season. Great on the ball had some attacking trips out of defense and one succesfull crossfield pass I remember and defensively very solid, great tackle in the first half in the six yard box from the cross.. 
He and Chris needs to stay fit for at least 10 matches..

2493~~~
And Nani!

2494~~~
I like him a lot.

2495~~~
Very good performance today. Definitely has all the attributes required to become a top defender, he's just 24 though so you'd expect the inconsistencies and occasional lapses in concentration. Has the potential to be a very complete defender though, as he's very big and strong physically, quick, a good passer and good at bringing the ball forward. Just needs to be more dominant in the air if I could have one complaint so far, which will come as he adjusts to the league more. Very pleased with how he's been since he joined though.

2496~~~
Great today!

2497~~~
I've still no clue whether he's going to be brilliant or a complete liability, but I like the cut of his jib.

2498~~~
Nothing wrong at all with his performance today and has stepped back into the starting XI with ease after an injury.  His distribution from the back is really excellent and he definitely has a certain charisma and energy he brings to the team which is fantastic to see.

2499~~~
Reminds me of Heinze.

2500~~~
I want to see where he's at next year.  He's still settling in. Hopefully no more injuries.

2501~~~
Very impressive today.

2502~~~
It's at Old Trafford, though. Granted, Stoke have a good away form this season, but still, they've never got a result against us at Old Trafford, and it's not like a cold, rainy night at Stoke. That's where Rojo's real test comes. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Anyways, Rojo has really improved from the beginning. He's become much more disciplined in his approach, and this is starting to bring out the best in Rojo. His ability on the ball is also unmatched, and it helps us so much when we need a defender to play the ball out. His aggression coming into check has made him a much better defender, and now, we're starting to see the potential in Rojo.

I remember how, at the beginning, Chelsea fans thought he was just like David Luiz. I hope they watch this and see that he's in no way like David Luiz with these recent performances.

2503~~~
He's improved a lot since the start of the season. Great to see. His passes and general build-up play is a joy to watch most of the time. He'll become better on that aspect when Blind returns.

2504~~~
Very good today. Him and Smalling look like they make a good partnership. Will only get better too as they get more used to each other.

2505~~~
It would seem that he and Smalling learned a lot from the City game.

2506~~~
A very good game and it was a good test for him. Worked really well with Smalling, especially when playing out from the back I thought.

Mata's goal though <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2508~~~
Fixed. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2509~~~
There's no comparison between the two games. Stoke offered nothing going forward for 85 minutes, meaning Rojo and Smalling were never tested. They also had no width whatsoever in their game, despite knowing United play wingers as full backs. We'd be in trouble if we played City last night, no matter what progress certain individuals may have made.

Still, Rojo will certainly benefit from playing in the same CB partnership for more than 90 minutes.

2510~~~
He' is getting better and settling in nicely. You can see that he (and Smalling) play with a lot more confidence which is great to see

2511~~~
Was he offside? Mark Hughes is moaning about it (obviously) but I don't remember seeing it, and it wasn't mentioned at all on the replays on the stream I was watching.

2512~~~
Pubic hair in it. A bit of his body is offside, so technically he probably is but there is nothing in it.

2513~~~
I agree, but both have been much less rash in the last 180 minutes of football (aside from Rojo getting drawn in with Bojan)

Either way, I'm happier with both and can see the first signs of what might turn into a decent pairing.

2514~~~
Well maybe his disciplinary problems in Portugal were presumably down to stricter refereeing?

2515~~~
I love how he's willing to go forward as a CB and can also pass a ball!

2516~~~
Looked really comfortable yesterday. No problem with positiononing, defended good, passed good and went up front a few times too. He plays with a lot of confidence and it shows.

2517~~~
Definitely this. He looks perfectly comfortable on the ball and passes really intelligently; but for some reason you can imagine him making a complete hash of a back-pass or clearance and it being very costly. The weird thing is though he hasn't actually done anything to suggest he's liable to have a complete lapse in concentration.

Maybe it's just that he's a tattooed Argentinian so rashness is assumed as part of the package.

2518~~~
Love a bit of left footed centre back, me. 

I also like the fact that he tries to pass the ball vertically to our central midfielders as much as possible. Think he can really turn into a world-class defender here.

2519~~~
Great game from him yesterday. Very composed and likes bringing the ball forward and also finding players in advanced positions instead of blindly hoofing it. He's hard as nails too.  

He's a really likable player and I hope he continues to improve.

2520~~~
He did gift the ball to Willian against Chelsea but luckily Smalling had the pace to stop the threat. Didn't he also try a one two with Mata in a ridiculous position against Leicester which led to Blackett getting sent off?

2521~~~
I still can't escape the feeling he's just not very good.

2522~~~
He belongs to the Sergio Ramos and Pepe category of defenders. I think if he bulks up a little bit more and improve on his aerial ability, he will become a very good player for us. He's the type of defender we need to play a high line.

2523~~~
Our refs are indeed crap but nothing excuses some of Rojo's behaviour in some sending offs. That's why i said there is clearly Van Gaal's influence on him because most of the times (at Sporting) his Argentinian blood and guts approach got the best of him with some very nasty challenges.

2524~~~
I've suppressed the memory of the second half against Leicester, but I do recall a last gasp Smalling challenge vs Chelsea. Still, for someone who has come from a pretty poor Portuguese League (defending wise especially) he has done surprisingly well. You look at Mangala who was twice the cost and was far more highly rated and so far it seems we've got a bargain.

2525~~~

That's not true at all. I've said it multiple times. Our league has one of the lowest goal scoring ratios. It's mostly a boring defensive football league. The phrase "park the bus" from Mourinho comes from portuguese football nature.

Fair enough. I still maintain you'd expect a steep learning curve due to the quality of the League and difference in physicality etc. He's done really well in that sense.

2527~~~
I just did a slight correction about your assessment of portuguese football. But i understand what you implied and you are correct in thinking that players normally take longer to settle when moving to England from a less competitive enviroment. But i've always said from the start that i thought that Rojo had the tools to adapt well to English football because of his physical and aggressive nature. What i didn't expect was such a quick change regarding his disciplinary woes. But of course moving to a bigger club and with a more intimidating manager plays it's part. Since he was one of our best players, our board and manager would usually cut some slack when he started with his antics. I don't think United will let him do that. The moment he gets sent off stupidly, there are plenty of players to replace him at the starting eleven. Last year at Sporting, when he screwed up, we had Dier and that's it. He would usually return instantly after the suspension.

2528~~~
Were his disciplinary issues him making bad tackles, or him throwing a strop? If it's the former, then his lower red card count could also be because English referees tend to let a lot more things go than elsewhere in Europe. Something that would earn him a card in a normal footballing country wouldn't even be a freekick against him in England.

2529~~~
Very stupid tackles and even agressions. To be fair when mixing Argentinians against Brazilians something bad is bound to happen. Portuguese league has alot of brazilian footballers. The strop was just when he wanted to move to United.

2530~~~
I love how he gives big Dave a hug every time we score <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2531~~~
I actually really like this guy not just as a player but just him in general. Celebrates every goal with passion especially big goals or even saves or blocks in close games. Looks like he is loving playing for us and to be honest he has been a bit of a suprise. Type of player fans take to if he is performing very quickly

2532~~~
Yeah im starting to like him too.
Hes not an AMAZING defender but who is these days?
Hes very capable with the ball at his feet and physically he has everything a defender needs
He wasn't helped at times by the lack of consistency in our defence.
A lot of that parts missing from his game you'd expect to at least improve with age and experience though.

He occasionally gives me a heart attack with some risky passes and i wish he'd cut that shit out
and theres a couple of other rough edges that could be smoothed out but im pretty happy with him, 
and hes young so theres room for improvement too.

Not the A list defender i'd love to have at the club but a more than capable partner for one if we ever get one.

2533~~~
That was after the end of the match though.

2534~~~
He is so good on the ball, super comfortable. Pep would have loved a player like him in his team.

2535~~~
Why are all South Americans so good with the ball regardless of their position? Why are British CB's so shit with the ball? Do they not train at all with the ball and just win headers all the time? I know they are usually big guys but come on, is it that hard to develop defenders that can run with the ball a little and pick a pass? Pisses me off.

2536~~~
I can't remember seeing his pace being really tested yet, I'm intrigued to see what it's like.

2537~~~
We had at least two of them, arguably three, already in our squad when we signed Rojo.

2538~~~
it was a strange one. Definitely not what Hughes was saying in that it was clearly offside. 

I believe the rule is that if any part of your body is beyond the last man then it is offside but in this case, although Rojo was beyond the last defender's torso the defender had his left arm outstretched beyond Rojo. Would love to find a picture of it.

2539~~~
Same here. Not someone who inspires confidence in fans with his style. Too Phil Jones-esque for my liking.

2540~~~
It's any part of your body that can be used to score a goal, so arms don't matter.

2541~~~
Ah yeah, true. So just offside then.

2542~~~
As long as the other defender is good at reading the game and organizing the defense, Rojo will be fine. He isn't the best at reading the game, but he is good at making late challenges and very good at passing. Not very confident on him, but he offers a lot to the team.

I think that a defense of Smalling-Rojo might work well. Smalling is good at reading the game, and both of them are very fast. Wouldn't like to see much Jones-Rojo because both are very similar in their style and neither is calm. While Evans has always been good if he played with a partner who is better than him, but not as good if he's the leader.

Currently our best partnership in my opinion is Smalling-Rojo.

2543~~~
British defenders only learn how to tackle and hoof the ball up the pitch.

2544~~~
Well, up until a few years ago, England had the best collection of centrebacks in world football. That was because they were actually trained how to defend first and foremost.

Now we have Cahill and Jagielka.

2545~~~
Rojo needs to improve his positioning and heading before I'm totally sold. He's not been bad, but I haven't seen a top class defender in him yet. Smalling's not far off, though.

2546~~~
No. The centre half's we have produced over the past two decades rival any nation on earth. Distribution was never a problem either.

2547~~~
It's not a change of tactics in England, it's just a steep decline in quality.

2548~~~
Neville's comments about a change in training methods is telling. Not to mention the fact that the next generation on England players looks significantly more comfortable on the ball than the last.

Part of it will definitely just be a bit good/bad luck. But I think there's been a shift in the way teams play in the Premier League, and that's reflected in the emphasis away from defence.

2549~~~
Thought Stoke was this lad's first really good game for us. Very pleasing to see and hopefully he keeps it up.

2550~~~
I was going on about British defenders as a whole. Johnny Evans is excellent with the ball.

2551~~~

2552~~~
Really? Have to say I got the opposite impression of him.
Showed great positioning against Stoke which was my biggest concern as well. Good with the ball and very calm. Good passing and brave.

2553~~~
The style of football in S.America and Spain etc are completely different. In England we generally play kick it long football and use pace/power/height at a young age, where as continental style teams are taught to keep the ball and pass/move and be comfortable. 

We are learning more in England these days and young teams are definitely getting more used to the idea, but it's just the impatience of the English which I think gives it that "get it up by the goal as quick as possible" feel.

2554~~~
Don't want to stereotype the opinions, but one does half get the feeling that a lot of people don't rate Rojo because of misinformed opinions (many of the same were convinced Blind wasn't much cop and was a left back before revising the stance) and the preconceived notions associated with being an Argie defender (typically famous for rather rash, hot-headed, crude, workmanlike defenders in the mold of Samuel or Heinze). Yet he seems to be more Ayala in his perception of danger, good mobility, and slick skill on the ball. Still a bit raw but Rojo has all the tools to blossom into a gritty yet calculating ball playing center-half, provided he's willing to listen to Van Gaal (which he apparently is).

2555~~~
Heinze was fairly decent for us, so it can't be that.

And it's not pre-conceived notions. He IS a bit rash in his defensive play. Look at the way he got injured against City. Jones would be proud of that.

2556~~~
I'm not talking about individual opinions though.

2557~~~
It wasn't even just that tbh.
Some players at youth level were overlooked because they were not big/strong enough especially as defenders. So sometimes players progressed for their physical attributes more than their footballing attributes.

2558~~~
My opinion comes from watching Rojo playing at my club and not from any preconceived notion or stereotype. At Sporting he was rather rash and hot headed and his disciplinary record proved that. But it appears he has change his ways so far. He seems to have matured and his experience at the world cup and the premier league helped. I think my assessment of him was fair and his career at England so far (minus his disciplinary record) is showing that. Perhaps i was overly optimistic since i like Rojo but for someone playing his first year in a much harder league, in a team in transition, struggling defensively and with an injury crysis, i think he has done alright. I see Rojo as someone who thanks to his versatility, physical power and characteristics will be very useful for United. Just as long as Van Gaal keeps putting him as CB and only use him at LB as last resort.

2559~~~
This is almost exactly the point I was trying to make though Sly. I can understand your POV because he displayed errant ways at Sporting because the proof is in the pudding. But like you said, and from what I've observed that's drastically changed at United. Yet he's still being associated with the kind of player he was at Sporting, rather than the kind of player he is now where he looks rather calm and calculating at the middle, leads the team in interceptions and has great passing ability, and largely hasn't been a great liability considering he's playing in a much chopped and changed back 4, didn't have a load of rest after the WC finals, is still adjusting to the new league and missed out training time through injury. Considering that he's been quite excellent.

2560~~~
We could again lose scored goal, because of him being offside. He's terrible at that. Should stay at the back during free kicks.

2561~~~
His defending is more of a worry for me, don't rate him at all.

2562~~~
He has yet to convince me one bit.

2563~~~
We need better quality defenders if we have any ambitions of getting back to the top.

2564~~~
Refuses to learn not to play risky balls in his own half, again and again he gives opponents the chance to break on us high up the pitch

2565~~~
Thought he did well defensively to be fair, its his passing when players don't show for him thats the real worry. Needs to learn when to go back to De Gea or get rid instead of trying to thread the ball through the eye of a needle in his own half.

2566~~~
He needs to be more composed on the ball and look for better options for distribution. It's like he has been to the Rio's hoof it high boot camp during the Summer. 

Also some lapses in concentration which is not good.

2567~~~
Said it before and I'll say it again. Dumb. Dumb player.

2568~~~
Seems to have two modes. Calm as you like, got everything under control, could be smoking a pipe and drinking a glass of cognac kind of defender. And hyperactive, OCD kid who looks down at the ball screaming 'What the feck is this and what do I do with it?!

He's a strange one. I like him. I think.

2569~~~
Complete mixed bag from him today but good to see him finishing the game strongly.

2570~~~
Thought he defended well at times. Especially when he was 1 on 1 against the tricky Southampton attackers.

2571~~~
He's doing okay, for me. Very ropey first half, but you could say that about 8 or 9 of our players. I'm sure he wasn't expecting to see a new face (or two) next to him every game either. It's hard to blame anyone in the defence right now with the constant rotation and mid-game tactical shifts. I firmly believe that we will be fine once we get some continuity at the back, but I'm also fearing it will just never happen with this group of defenders.

2572~~~
Wrong thread.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2014-2015-performances.394651/page-86#post-16808256">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marouane-fellaini-2014-2015-performances.394651/page-86#post-16808256</a>

2573~~~
He had to defend today and he looked awful. Surprise, Surprise!!

2574~~~
He did. He's very good at pinching the ball from an attacker as its played into them and he won the ball a lot

Unfortunately thats when he'll pass it back to the closest opponent.

2575~~~
Plays better in a two man defence.

Are <i>any </i>of our players accustomed to a 5 man defence?

Blind is the only one I can think of.

2576~~~
He's left footed and stays fit more often than not. That's all he's bringing to the table.

2577~~~
He's just horrible in possession. Thought he was decent defensively.

2578~~~
Just too sloppy and laid-back for my feeling. Needs to up his game against Pool

2579~~~
He scares the life out of me. Said it in the match thread but he seems so stupid.

2580~~~
He was terrible on the ball but was solid defensively.

2581~~~
His passing has been superb in recent games but was diabolical tonight. Can only assume he went down with the 352itis that consistently turns decent defenders into hapless cloggers.

2582~~~
Everyone were horrible on the ball today. The team was clearly frazzled, Rojo included. We were losing possession stupidly all over the pitch today from brainless passes to crazy attempts of dribbling. He had his second worst performance for us tonight. He really needs to work on his heading and overall timing. I won't draw any quick conclusions from this game either as it was a collective brain fart from management to player performances.

2583~~~
At times he looks really good and then at times he looks terrible. Not sure what to make of him yet, his passing in the 2nd half was terrible though, did not see the first half. To me at the moment, he is looking like a decent squad player, subject to change.

2584~~~
His worst game of the season. Far too casual and complacent.

Silvestre Mk II.

2585~~~
He was doing the same. Running into players, losing the ball and passing to thin air.

2586~~~
Most of our players were nervy tonight. Rojo's performance was no better or worse.

2587~~~
Ridiculous to brand a player this or that mark II based on tonight's game. We played a system that allowed no one to perform to their best, no definitive judgement should be made on a player based on tonight.

2588~~~
Defensively he was ok but his passing must improve.

2589~~~
He is a better passer than he showed tonight based on his earlier performances. No one was finding their man tonight, probably because we were really thin from midfield and up.

2590~~~
He needs to remember he's playing as a centre-back, and not left-back. Cut out the risks by playing simple.

2591~~~
Its not just tonight that he plays suicide balls midway in his own half

2592~~~
Defended well thats it.. Terrible on the ball..

2593~~~
He definitely overrates his own ability on the ball.

2594~~~
He's an interesting player. Either he looks good or bad. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground.

2595~~~
He usually picks out a pass better than our other defenders, his issue is that he more or less always looks to play a ground pass forward no matter what. Needs to see when it's not on or doesn't have the time and just get rid. RVP and Fellaini can bring down a ball well after all.

2596~~~
Doesn't have the footballing intelligence to be a ball playing defender for a top side.

2597~~~
He played good vs Stoke and bad today and all of a sudden he's stupid, dont have a footballing inteligence, terrible passer, terrible defender ( some say one thing the other 2nd thing ).. Ah football fans..

2598~~~
Has time to work on it though.

2599~~~
So what was it? 

Defending or passing?

2600~~~
You mean not everyone has the same opinion? Bloody football fans.

2601~~~
No, I mean football fans jumping to conclusions..

2602~~~
He's so erratic that you never feel you can fully trust him.

2603~~~
Passing first and foremost, bad defending could be blamed on whole defence but hey, they were playing in a formation they're alien to and when you add those three numbers you'll get 10.

2604~~~
I thought he defended well.. Passing well not his strength..

2605~~~
From the games I saw ( all except today's one ) I agree, he tends to go for risky passes lots of time and misplaces passes a lot. If he gets that better he'll be good for us cause I think he is a good defender although he panicked in some games and was out of position. Generally I think he's not that bad as some puts him out to be.

2606~~~
I think I've got the opposite opinion to many on here strangely. I think he's a poor defender who's seriously lacking awareness and concentration but on the ball he's very promising. He occasionally tries a little too much but he's easily our most composed defender on the ball and 9 times out of 10 he backs that up with a good ball which injects a bit of urgency and direction into our play. I think he's our only defender who does that on a consistent basis. It's just that he occasionally gets a little carried away and today more so than usual.

2607~~~
That pretty much makes him our best defender.
I actually quite like him tbh but staying fit is enough to make him better than our other options

2608~~~
Agreed I see him becoming a solid defender..

2609~~~
I actually didn't mind his game too much. Think he has the attributes to be a solid defender. Plus he isn't made of glass like our other CBs... and some of his passing is sexy for a defender.

2610~~~
By forming an opinion on what they see. I'm not seeing a good player. Are you?

2611~~~
He'll get better. It was infuriating to see him miss passes and run straight into opposition so high up..

2612~~~
Sums up my thoughts fairly well - he has a tendency to try take too many risks for a centre half.

Still not.convinced.that he was the right signing for us but hopefully as he adapts to the league he will become a top player.

2613~~~
Sums up my thoughts on him too.

2614~~~
I am.

2615~~~
I think he is decent.

Prone to being a bit dense at times but better than having Evans in there.

2616~~~
Decent at best and shocking positionally.

But he can stay fit, so that's a plus at this stage.

2617~~~
What happened to Evans he stiffens up each time he gets the ball?

2618~~~
He will get better, it's hard to criticise any of our defenders at the moment.While we've got lucky at times and have a fantastic keeper we still have the fourth best goals against record in the league. Considering the injuries we've had in that area that's quite remarkable. 
Rojo wasn't the best last night but he wasn't terrible, the midfield didn't move which meant the passing options were limited, Fellaini, Mata and Rooney gave the ball away in dangerous areas far to often putting the defence under more and more pressure.

2619~~~
No player of ours look comfortable in the 3-5-2 system, so I don't really blame him. That's on LvG.

2620~~~
I think Southhampton pressing him so hard made him a bit nervy. I still believe he'll come good as soon as he learns to calm down those Argentinan nerves and has a solid backline to play with.

2621~~~
I agree with that. His ability on the pall and passing accuracy are probably his best and most noticeable qualities. Seemed to completely desert him last night, as it happens but that's only one game. Been excellent on the ball in his other recent performances.

He's definitely a bit flaky, defensively. Strong in the challenge and good one v one but very impetuous and keeps getting caught under the ball. 

He actually reminds me of Koscielny and Vermaelen from a few seasons back. Hopefully he turns out more like the former.

2622~~~
I'm not sure I'd say he's "poor", definitely not really of the sort of quality we want though, defensively. But I do feel that he has the traits required, and can certainly be moulded into a much better defender. He's only 24 after all.

2623~~~
Felt a little bit to him yesterday, he wanted to play football but there was never an outball ahead of him, no one wanted the ball in tight areas which led to risky passes and spending too much time on the ball. More movement and bravery from the players in front of him and it would've been a different story.

2624~~~
He seems to get into a fit of panicking sometimes when he gets the ball, there was a time there near the end last night when he got  hold of the ball at the back, was on his own with all the time in the world but by the time he had figured out what to do two Southampton lads nearly had him closed down. I was shouting at him on the telly to bull toe the fecking thing as far as he could or up into the clouds but instead he played a dangerous enough pass. He could do with them same tablets I'm on to calm his nerves a bit.

2625~~~
Has looked decent at Old Trafford, but has been all over the place in away games. Not the only one you can say that about though

2626~~~
I agree with this. The amount of times an attacker would ghost round the back post when he was tracking back centrally and he didn't even bother to look over his shoulder every time, poor awareness but on the ball his passing is quite sharp I feel although sometimes he holds onto it too long.

2627~~~
I actually quite like him. I don;t know what his interception stats were from last night but it felt like he was constantly nicking the ball from in front of the Southampton attackers and I don;t remember him being beaten one on one all game. Made a few risky dribbles out of defence but in general I think he has a lot of potential. Constant changes in system and personnel clearly don't help.

2628~~~
Not sure he can speak much English yet. He will still have nerves but like the team is just getting by game by game. Baring RVP and De Gea, everyone was poor. No fluidity or continuity of partnership. I think this season it's all about players throwing themselves at the ball rather then great defending. When we're not controlling the ball, we're as soft as anything but it'll come.

2629~~~
Yeah like others have said, agree with this assessment. 

However, I'm not quite sure how much of a poor defender he is, if that makes sense, and I'm not sure whether or not he has the qualities to become decent with a lot of coaching. He's got youth on his side I guess but he's a bit of an enigma to me.

2630~~~
He has seemed a fairly poor defender to me since he arrived here. Am yet to be impressed. He is good with the ball, but possibly tries to do too much with it.

2631~~~
I agree that his passing has looked very good recently. I thought him and Smalling were starting to build a good partnership in the last few games also. However again Rojo seems to be a victim of a poor system, combined with multiple different defensive partners.

If we could play 10 games with the same system and the same centre back duo I think he'd hugely benefit. Bearing in mind he's 24, has arrived from a poorer foreign league, has been played LB, CB and LCB in two different systems and has played with a different partner almost every week, his 6/10 Cafe average is pretty damn impressive I think.

2632~~~
I personally thought Rojo was especially poor last night.  Constantly gave the ball away, caught in possession and had to sprint to defend.  Once, he wasn't all that concerned about covering and if Pelle or whoever took his chance better last night...it would have been a draw or worse in the end.  There was a cross at one point he watched go over his head to a SH player...fortunately nothing came of it.  He was the worst of the bunch for me.

2633~~~
7 interceptions, 6 tackles, 9 clearances, a blocked shot and 4 aerials. That's 27 defensive interventions - absolutely immense. (Compares to Evans (4), Smalling (4), McNair (6), Carrick (6), Valencia (7), Young (10) and Fellaini (15).)

2634~~~
I like him, will become a very solid defender for us IMO.

2635~~~
It's hard to believe we were watching the same game. His defensive statistics were immense (7 more interventions than the other 4 CBs combined). He misplaced 5 short and medium range passes - too many but not unusual against a team pressing as hard as Southampton were (Carrick also misplaced 5). His was never dispossessed of the ball. He wasn't perfect but it's hard to see where "worst of the bunch" could have come from (I'd actually suspect that he was one of LvG's "three players that played well").

2636~~~
Seems like a terrific athlete and he's excellent on the ball. Definitely some potential there.

2637~~~
I don't know what his stats were but he was awful in my opinion.  On the left hand side he kept giving the ball away...he passed it to the opposition and then jogged back to barely bother the SH striker...

Is this a stat that you are quoting about him not being dispossessed of the ball?  Or opinion?

2638~~~
He is our worst defender in the air. Overrated with the ball, kept giving it away against Soton. Good athlete. Too rash and aggressive. Imo Smalling should play with either Jones or Evans but I don't think LvG agrees with me.

2639~~~
Agreed. He will develop into quite a player in the coming years.

2640~~~
I thought his tackling was fantastic yesterday. 

He also has the ability and confidence to pass forward into feet, unlike our other defenders.

2641~~~
Thanks <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Thats an awful lot of interventions in a team that was all over the place. He's rightfully criticised for some of the things he does but he's not often given enough credit for the good things he does.

2642~~~
I thought he was the best of the bunch last night.
Him and young had a good handle on our left side i thought. He did give the ball away in stupid areas but it seemed to me
that he didn't start doing that till pretty late on in the game - last 20 mins maybe (at least giving the ball away unnecessarily).
Whereas evans and mcnair had been doing it throughout the match.
His ability in the air is ... a bit questionable for me but its something that i think a lot of cb's have a hard time with initially when they play in this league.
I hope it improves.
If it was 5 / 10 years ago i'd probably say hes not good enough etc but the standard of defending isn't that high these days
and he seems to me to be as good as it gets really.

The chances of having more than one of them fit at any one time seems pretty slim these days.

2643~~~
It's a stat - which, of course, means it's the opinion of the Opta observer. They aren't infallible. 

You seem to be a little obsessed with his passing failures while ignoring his overall defensive contribution. I suppose I'm leaning in the other direction.

2644~~~
Rojo is still fairly raw and will need to improve, but he has the necessary talent to work with. He is still settling in a new league and country, and things have not been easy for him with a very unstable and ever changing defense to work with.

It seems he is not made of glass like the rest of our defenders at least.

2645~~~
I like Rojo and hope he does well.  I'm not saying I took notes or anything...I just remember an awful lot of mistakes...not just by him but by the entire squad.  I may have very well missed the things that he did well, but the things that stick out in my mind...the things that upset me the most, were his passing failures and being dispossessed.  My recollection was that he did quite poor.  I do see that I am in the minority.  I do agree with the majority in saying that the 3 at the back has to be scrapped and for us to get a win away from home playing like that is a definite positive.  I am just disappointed at the way we could not seem to get it together.  Cheers

2646~~~
I think this is what was supposed to be the case. I dont think theres any actual evidence on the pitch though. He's no more composed than the rest, including a 19 year old CB

2647~~~
Maybe we should give him a season before saying he's shit on the ball and that. Bloody hell...

2648~~~
I think he's the most composed CB with the ball by quite some way. The difference being that he tries to get the ball moving forwards. Now if you want I'm sure he could play those lovely sideways passes or knock it back to De Gea like the rest of them do if the stats aren't looking good but I like the fact he plays on the front foot. He doesn't have the advantage of knowing the language yet and to move into a defence which has been like a game of musical chairs and lacking any kind of leadership I think he's done well.

2649~~~
You can't call someone who gives the ball away so much 'composed with the ball'. That's just nuts.

2650~~~
He smashes the ball high into the air often, which is not composed defending

I think some are getting confused with adventurous passing and composure. The first is not the second. He's as panicked as McNair is, he just tries flashier passes

2651~~~
Well I am. I haven't looked into depth with this in terms of stats but when I've seen him play he has the most confidence out of our centre halves with the football. I would imagine he plays a lot more forward balls into more attacking areas of the pitch. Now I'm not saying he's Paul Scholes here I'm comparing him to the rest of our centre backs. To me he looks the most comfortable on the ball. I'm sure if you asked him to he could be just like Evans and play the easy ball all of the time but I doubt that's what is being asked of him.

2652~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2653~~~
Playing the ball forwards doesn't mean they are comfortable on the ball. It just means they are more adventurous with it. And this can also backfire when he often tries it just in front of his own box in a careless manner.

2654~~~
To be honest, even though he didn't play very well yday, he was the only one able to play the ball out properly, finding either Young, Rooney or RVP quite consistently when under pressure. He took too much time on the ball at times (because he wants to pick a pass, instead of hoofing and got caught). Some of that though was due to lack of movement/showing for the ball in midfield.

TBH I like him, he needs to improve but he has the making of a good player.

2655~~~
He's not very dominant aerially. Sometimes he doesn't even challenge for the ball and let's it bounce which is almost criminal.

I'm hoping he's just acclimatising to English football, but some serious work needed there.

To give him his due, he's been quietly impressive and effective in many games since Leicester. Shaky as hell last night though.

2656~~~
New to the league and country, we need to give him at least a season to settle in. His a strong guy unlike our other defenders and look how quick he came back from his injury, went straight back in guns blazing!!!

2657~~~
Quoting my post from the Mcnair thread.

Thought he was best of our defenders frankly and most involved defensively even though he had his poor moments.

I am taking a liking to him now though still not fully convinced. But there's something there.

2658~~~
Wtf was he doing trying to run through the middle with like 3-4 Southampton players there? He continuously tried to run into groups of Southampton players. I've been far from impressed with him so far. He is good at 1v1 duels but other than that his defensive game is shoddy at best imo. He was also way to narrow at times and left Young completely exposed and isolated against Long who had the pace and aerial beating of Young. Why Rojo never tried to spread wider and help Young I don't know. You could see it on the right side with McNair/Evans trying to back up Valencia but Rojo just left Young to deal with the left side by himself most of the time. 

This 352 shit just isn't working, Rojo has no clue what he is doing half the time and neither do the others.

2659~~~
It is tough to decide who our worst player on the night against Southampton was, but I think Rojo might have just about secured that accolade, for me.

2660~~~
Rojo disappointed me on the ball. Either he hoofed it far up the pitch or tried to play a pass that wasn't open. He was also sloppy a couple of moments. His mistakes on the ball were the cause of a few of Southampton's dangerous moments.

Defensively, he was better, though he did have 2 moments where he lost awareness of what was happening around him. He looked more defensively assured in this match than he did on the ball, though. It did seem like it was more due to the 3-5-2 causing him issues with a lack of options for him to pursue, but he should still be more careful than force things through if they are not possible.

2661~~~
He's brave and reckless, could be great alongside a steady leader-type center back

2662~~~
To be honest based on what we know Jones/Smalling/Evans are capable of, Rojo is possibly our worst CB. Fortunately, he'll have plenty of time to improve given that rest of them are always injured.

2663~~~
I'm not sure that is true, in fact I'm sure vs Southampton he was the one finding Rooney, RVP, or Young.
He is very aggressively/borderline reckless and sometimes positionally suspect and dwindles on the ball when he doesn't see a pass on (hence why the hoofing comment is baffling).

One thing you can't really fault him for is his use of the ball.

2664~~~
You really, really can. Unless passing to the sky or an opposing attacker is our "philosophy"

2665~~~
Yes because thats what he usually tends to do 9 times out of 10 he'll either sky it or give the ball away.

2666~~~
He just needs to do it 1/10 times and its far too often.

2667~~~
Interesting thing about that statement, is that its entirely your opinion.

2668~~~
Ok.

2669~~~
90% Pass completion and it's still not good enough. Tough crowd!

2670~~~
Our worst cb? I think a big plus is that he isn't a walking fecking bandaid. He hasn't been nearly as bad as people make out. He has the most appearances, and according to someone in the match day thread we have the 5th best defence in the league. He and De Gea have been the only constants in that.

2671~~~
He's rash, positionally poor with questionable awareness. He looks calm on the ball until he uses it. I'd say all of Smalling, Jones and Evans are better although Evans has been worse this season.

That said, he still has plenty of time to improve and is playing in a new league.

2672~~~
That wasn't just his fault though. Southampton pressed us hard while we showed no movement in midfield and attack, so it was easy for them to force us into those kind of situations.

The difference between him and them is that he'll actually be able to progress and develop as he's not injured 40-70% of the season. They all have their weaknesses but atm Jones and Evans are definitely not better.

2673~~~
Southampton was a freak a match, pretty much all of our players bar a select few were genuinely awful (despite winning).

As for Rojo, whoever said he'd compliment a more disciplined CB was spot on, I'm still a big fan of his.

2674~~~
A clearance isnt a pass. Which is the whole point

2675~~~
If the 10% goes to an attacker in our final third then you're right. It isn't good enough.

2676~~~
He did a good job finding them, but when they weren't available, he shouldn't have forced the issue. When we struggled with the setup and Southampton's pressing, Rojo shouldn't have to force things through. Out of all of our defenders, I believe that he's the best passer, but he needs to be careful with the choices he makes. Sometimes, players won't be available, and you have no choice but to put it back to your keeper and restart the build-up.

The hoofs forward did seem like Rojo was forced to do them as he had no other choice, which is fair enough, and I would say that that was more due to our setup than Rojo himself, but the times when he was sloppy and gave the ball away were his fault. For example, when he tried to flick Fellaini through with Davis and Tadic closing him down in the second half, Pelle could have scored from that.

Overall, our team setup and players taking a nervous approach is the major reason for our poor performance, and that caused Rojo to make mistakes as well.

2677~~~
I mostly agree with akash, I'm not convinced so far. He's had some good moments ... Anything to make me think he's an improvement on what we already had (Jones, Evans, Smalling, McNair)? Not really. On their day Jones and Evans are comfortably better than anything Rojo has shown, only they're injured too often to ever build up any sort of form. Rojo looks clumsy a lot of the time - and I could forgive that in the Leicester game when he was at left back (even though one of his plus points is supposedly his versatility) but he's thumped the ball at oppostion players/ into touch when under not much pressure too many times since then. 

I'm not saying he sucks and won't come good, I vividly remember the shambolic starts Evra and Vidic had to their United careers, under very similar circumstances. Making the transistion from a weaker league to the Premier League as a young defender, in a United team that itself is in transition. Of course he needs time, but at the moment I don't think he should be considered first choice. Our injury record at the back means he probably will be playing almost every game though so it shouldn't take too long before we can tell if he's the real deal or not.

2678~~~
I think like Jones, Rojo has his good points. But its hard to compliment them when he's giving the ball away in his own half so often. Its easier to appreciate the good things he does when he starts to do the very basics of being a defender, ie. dont give the opposition the ball when we have 1 defender and a goalkeeper behind you. Its suicide and we deserve to conceed a goal every single time he does it.

He's also older so less time to correct his many rough edges and he's also proven less for us than Jones has

2679~~~
You're making it sound like he's giving the ball away several times in every game. He did it what, two or three times against Southampton who were relentless in their pressure and suddenly its a thing with him?

He's 24 years old, he could have 10 years left in him. Phil may be 2 years younger but with his injuries he might never actually correct his rough edges and instead end up Evans .2. Due to his injuries Rojo might actually be the one with more time on his hands. What has Jones actually proven for us? He's never really established himself in the team.

2680~~~
Have you not watched him play before?

I've mentioned it previously. Its not sudden if its a pattern.

2681~~~
This sums him up for me as well.

2682~~~
Yes, actually I have. Go figure.

If you're talking about performances dating back to his Sporting days then i'll concede. But based on his performances for United, no, I don't see this pattern that you're talking about.

We can talk about the mistakes he made in the Southampton game but on the flip-side, he's also the player that accomplished the most defensively.

2683~~~
You should watch him then

2684~~~
Or maybe you should drop the arrogance and find some substance for your arguments?

2685~~~
I cant make you watch the previous matches, but maybe you want to read previous posts in the thread about him giving the ball away prior to Southampton

2686~~~
It was a problem in his early performances but it was definitely improving enormously before the Southampton game, the Stoke and Hull games in particular his distribution was excellent.

2687~~~
We have quite a few players on our team who can boss a game like nobody's business when they are afforded time and space. Someone's technical ability only comes out when he's being pressured and pressed like Southampton did.

2688~~~
His distribution was fine against Chelsea and his (limited) display against City, I'd put more weight on those performances than one away at Southampton.

2689~~~
Exactly what I'm talking about

2690~~~
Heart always skips a beat when he has the ball at his feet, I don't think he's a first choice CB quality even though he's not done anything majorly wrong yet.

Maybe if we sign a world class cb then he will settle down

2691~~~
Sounds an awful lot like you're quoting yourself to add validity to your argument.

2692~~~
Sounds a lot like me talking about specific incidents in the Chelsea match rather than brushing the match under the carpet in a list with others where he's been fine, which obviously wasnt the case and if you read this very thread you'd see several people mention it. But who reads the thread they post in? Lets just assume everyone has been fine in every match

2693~~~
It's almost as if people with an agenda repeatedly and consistently act in a hyper-critical manner because of said agenda.

Quoting your own interpretation of an incident isn't strengthening your own argument, it's repeating it.

2694~~~
Note to self: Remember to use emoticons, irony does not convey well on chat forums. <img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/>

2695~~~
Not simply good enough to be a long term answer to our CB problems, IMO. He has panicked under pressure, misplaced passes at crucial moments, and possesses average positioning. Bravery and athleticism are not enough to make you a first-choice centre-back for a team of our ambitions. He can 'do a job' for now, but he'll always be lacking when it comes to teams that press and in the big games, too. I see him as being backup to Shaw if and when we get some proper defenders into the squad, is all.

2696~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/United-Uncovered/News/2014/Dec/Issue-97/Marcos-Rojo-exclusive-interview.aspx?utm_source=UU20141212&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=CI&amp;utm_campaign=newsletters&amp;qsut=www10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...ontent=CI&amp;utm_campaign=newsletters&amp;qsut=www10</a>
He is absolutely determined that was his goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2697~~~
Its bringing specific incidents where Rojo made mistakes into the conversation. You can't and won't

2698~~~
Despite how nervous I get when he's on the ball I can't help but love him. Don't know what it is.

2699~~~
I'm exactly the same mate. Kind of in the same way I loved Buttner mind <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

I'm confident he's a lot better though. I think.

2700~~~
I really liked Buttner too and thought that he left too soon, and now I really like Rojo too. It's perhaps not so strange considering they're basically the Dutch and Argentine versions of eachother. Both in appearances and playstyles.

But above that, they both seem like great guys who look(ed) like they couldn't be happier playing for any other team than United. It's rare and therefore special to see players who are truly commited to and loves their club these days. I can't say that this is actually true but that's the vibe I get/got from them.

2701~~~
Aye I'd say you're on to something there. I think we're all forgetting at times that Rojo is in his first year in England playing in a defence where he (and DDG if you include GK) have been the only consistent features for the most part. A fecking hard situation for anyone to settle into, never mind a South American with an inability to speak English. If we can get Shaw (and Rafael, but he's walking a tightrope atm) fit, along with a solid and experienced CB alongside him I think we have the makings of a great back 5 again. We'll see his best next year, I'm sure of it. His relative solidity and consistency now is a bonus as far as I'm concerned.

2702~~~
I agree with you. And here's the thing for me, wether we like it or not he's our only dependable defender right now. He's performed well for us under very difficult circumstances. To people who say that they don't see him as our long term CB, remember Evra and Vidic when they first came here (It's a worn arguement but still valid). Give him and the team some time to settle and it will become clear wether he's good enough to be a starter for us.

I'm so tired of some people who feel urged to stamp players as failed signings based on a few games with barely any consideration for circumstance. I've seen it this year especially in the Shaw thread after his first few games. You can see it in the Falcao thread right now. Zaha's another one, although to less controversy.

2703~~~
Systematic bias. That's why you don't quote yourself in an argument.

2704~~~
He's not been terrible so far. One can only assume he'll get better as he settles in so I imagine he'll have an OK career here.

2705~~~
I thought Rojo really improved our defending since he came into the team. We were horrible before he started playing for us!

2706~~~
Been a bit more impressed with him in recent weeks, he's done well to return so quickly from the injury too.

2707~~~
He will develop into a fantastic defender over time imo.

2708~~~
Based on what?

2709~~~
My qualitative assessment of what I've seen of him so far. He'll be one of those who started off a bit shaky, much like Evra when he first arrived, then gain momentum after he's had more time.

2710~~~
That sounds more hopeful than anything tbh. I don't see anything in his game that suggests he's going to become a fantastic defender. Hopefully, you're right.

2711~~~
I think Rojo has a big upside and room to develop. He's still quite raw and adapting to the new environment. Once he has a year or so, he will be fine. If we buy a top defender this summer, we will be in good stead for years.

2712~~~
He seems a bit too weak at the basics to ever be anything above decent in my eyes. His concentration and anticipation levels are pretty low and his aerial ability is very suspect. Hopefully with a whole season in the league he'll grow, but I'm not very convinced.

2713~~~

2714~~~
Musical chairs. Evans comes back, Smalling gets injured. Jones back and Rojo gets injured.

2715~~~
This shit will never stop, will it?

2716~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2717~~~
Probably because Jones tackled him , lol.

2718~~~
What's van Gaal doing in training on a Friday? They need to chill the feck out.

2719~~~
It sort of works out nicely since all of them can't play at the same time anyway.

2720~~~
That's one way of looking at it, just don't mention form, consistency or partnerships I guess <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2721~~~
Same shit, different day.

2722~~~
wtf!!
I was hoping to have Rojo, Shaw, Smalling and Rafael back for the last week of dec and 1 week of jan.
That is a hell of a busy period, with visits to Spurs and Stoke.
I hope Rojo got a small injury.

2723~~~
Any news on what his injury might be?

2724~~~
Whoever we buy also becomes Injury prone in our defence.

Shaw and Rojo both out twice already this season and they were barely injured at their previous clubs.


Cue us to sell one of our CB's and him to become a Injury free beast somewhere.

2725~~~
This is as good as certain.

2726~~~
One defender comes back, another one gets injured. Hope it's nothing serious.

2727~~~
Nah. However - by definition - he won't return until one of Jones or Evans get injured. So, I guess he'll be out for the next 3 games and then him and Smalling will replace the injured Jones and Evans.

2728~~~

2729~~~
That sounds promising. I feel that Van Gaal in the past month or so has become very cautious regarding injuries, understandable really.

2730~~~
I can live with that. Let's hope he's back for next week.

2731~~~
He reminds me of Davide Luiz with his defending without the same level of skill set. Let's hope he'll be coached to be a lot better than we've witnessed so far at United.

2732~~~
Luckily he doesn't seem half as crazy as Luiz. Against Southampton he was slight erratic when trying to play it out, and he's had one or two games where the defending side just wasn't brilliant but for the most part I think he's done well for us in the circumstances (three different positions in an injury hit back 3/4).

2733~~~
I think that's unfair.

David Luis was an outright liability who charged out of defence and was clueless positionally.

Rojo's had a mixed bag, but hasn't looked like a complete liability. My biggest criticism is that he needs to attack the ball in the air more. Letting it bounce is criminal in this league. I think this can be overcome with coaching.

2734~~~
Yep, I read Rooney was passed fit to play Stoke but van Gaal felt it best to go on the side of caution. Hopefully it's the same with Rojo and he'll be available next week.

2735~~~
I see him as a vaguely similar Argie version of Phil Jones. Also, a hit reckless in the Luiz mold, but definitely a talent who will continue to develop over time.

He's David Luiz without the flair going forwards, without the great goals, long passes or freekick ability

Like Luiz he wants to be aggressive and win the ball the first chance he gets. He's good at this and intercepts the ball often from attacking players waiting for the ball to feet.

However thats his one mode, hunt for the ball. And if he doesn't get there in time or the opposition is wanting him to dive in front and try and steal it, we're going to have problems. We also do have problems with his inconsistant distribution

I've got no doubt that if Luiz was our player and Rojo was at PSG, posters would be upset that our good CB David Luiz is being compared with Rojo. It just happens to be the other way around, and he happens to be the worse player

2737~~~
Mentioned the David Luiz comments before:

Again, I hope that we haven't seen the best of him and he was actually a lot better since I made that comment (a month before) but still not that good.

Saying that, only Smalling (on occasions) has been good for us this season, while Rojo is currently our second best CB.

2738~~~
I dont agree with Luiz comparisons one bit. Sure he had some mistakes and his positioning and passing should be better but in some games he really defended well. I guess he's not some well known football name so people criticize him too harshly sometimes. 
Also he doesnt have just one mode as Ekeke has said...

2739~~~
Any update regarding Rojo?

2740~~~
I hope he's back for Boxing Day, he may have his flaws but he adds more than Evans.

2741~~~
Yep, despite his flaws I feel more secure with him at the back than with our other defenders.

2742~~~
I only feel that with Smalling.

2743~~~
You always feel Marcos's defending is committed, while the others are just panic stricken.

2744~~~
Need him and Smalling back ASAP.

2745~~~
What is his injury problem? The only semi serious injury he had at Sporting was the same shoulder injury he had at United. He wasn't injury prone at all.

2746~~~
If our record with injuries is anything to go by, his leg has probably fallen off.

2747~~~
A very common injury: Unitedtitis

2748~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ok i get the picture mates. Perhaps it's just precaution, plenty of games coming up.

The Argentinian picked up the injury in training before last weekend’s <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/Dec/Manchester-United-vs-Liverpool-Premier-League-match-report.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline">3-0 win over Liverpool</span></a></b> and did not recover in time for the trip to Villa Park.
While speaking to reporters at the Aon Training Complex on Friday, van Gaal was asked to provide an update on Rojo and Rafael. "Rafael is not injured," the boss explained. "He was already fit last week, but I have to select and I have to compare.
"When I have more players fit, I have to select. You will have to wait and see, of course. I have to compare. Rafael? I can take him in the 18. Rojo? No. We have five injuries and one [Marouane Fellaini] is ill, so they are not coming up. Rojo has a rectus femoris [thigh] injury."

2750~~~
Thanks mate

2751~~~
No wonder our players are getting injured, look what they're up to in their spare time.

2752~~~
Playing with the bumpers up?

2753~~~
Literally thought it would be impossible to get injured while bowling until I saw this clown.

2754~~~
Whatever, we're much better without him.

Still can't understand signing him solely on his WC performance.

2755~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
That isn't Rojo. Good try though

2756~~~
That being his mate, you can only imagine the tackle Rojo put on the ball when he put his phone down.

2757~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I know it's not, but there's no doubt Rojo gave it a go as well. He probably took ADM with him and said try this, that's why his pelvis is not attached right to his leg <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2758~~~
I take it you're not fans of his. Bloody hell...

2762~~~
Can he play Left back for us Sunday?

2763~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> £200,000 a week. Who let that go online?

2764~~~
Just saw that. Seems like everyone is sweepstaking Uniteds wage bill this year. 

It may well be true, but people are plucking bullshit figures from every angle.

Some believe Falcao is the highest paid player at the club which is obviously bullshit.

2765~~~
I'd hazard a guess Rojo doesn't even earn half that.

2766~~~
I agree. As long as he's taking home more than Jonny Evans, his wage is justified.

2767~~~
Their football section should be closed for a few days for writing this! Words fail me!

2768~~~
Just a quick question for those with better memories than me, last time Rojo played did we use a back 4? I ask because I think I am right in saying we haven't played the back 3 with him and I am wondering if his absence as the only true left footed CB bar the rookie Blackett, is the reason we aren't using a back 4. LvG did say in a recent set of comments that Rojo along with Blind and Di Maria were fixed in his team.

2769~~~
I thought this yesterday and couldn't be bothered to double check it. He played against Southampton away in a back three, but I think that might have been the only time.

2770~~~
I remember Rojo's debut (I think) against QPR, was in a back 4, he was on the left. He wasn't great but it was one of our better displays and he showed he could do a job on the left.

2771~~~
He followed that up with the nightmare against Leicester where he was....not very good to say the least.

2772~~~
Really do wonder if LVG is waiting for Rojo to be fit, so he can get that Smalling partnership up and running again. These 2 together were probably the most solid we've looked all season. He must be back soon surely?.

2773~~~
If we're playing 3 at the back i think he's crucial, he's much more comfortable on the ball than our other CBs.

In the long run, 3 CBs only works against a lone striker if one of those CBs can step into midfield on offense and look comfortable.

Personally I'd like to see more of him, give him a run with Smalling or Jones.

2774~~~
I don't think that Rojo is the answer. He is at a similar level to the unholy trinity of Jones, Smalling and Evans, in my opinion.

2775~~~
It's because we're able to spend like feck now that people are making up figures. It's not like we had to lure him with wages, he already went on strike to come here before any deal was made.  Funnier wage bill is Falcao, he's goes up and down from £370k to £200 with each article <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2776~~~
well if he is at the same level as Smalling then he surely is lately becoming top center back and if he is the same level as Jones than he surely still have top potential even may quite possibly turn out to be the dumbest footballer ever played for us.. Evans is an example of ruined man due to drop in confidence, he may never find it again but once he was the best center back in the premier league but he is the one who I would get rid of in the summer.. Anyway all of our center backs are injury prone but if two can overcome it I believe we have got two great center backs which is sometimes enough.

When I look at Cahill coming to chelsea from Bolton then I think any of the three can make it but they need to stay fit. Rojo was part of the best defense in the World cup so I guess he has got something in him and he started to look good when was paired with Smalling.  It's just about making partnership for more than 2 games. And never looking like worse defender than Evra in his first season.

I only hope we will start to play with 4 at the back again once Marcos the Red is back..

2777~~~
Was he the LCB in that back 3 with Carrick as the center? I honestly can't remember. That kind of nobbles my theory though. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2778~~~
Back 3 of Rojo, Smalling, McNair. Evans came on for Smalling after about 15 minutes and Carrick dropped in their for McNair before half time.

2779~~~
Impressed today. Was very aggressive against the likes of Zamora and Austin.

2780~~~
Glad he did well. Good to see him back after his injury.

2781~~~
He was my M.O.M, had a tough day out there and came out of it looking pretty dominant. Did not let Zamora bully him and his presence was much needed. 8/10

2782~~~
Great performance by him. Won the majority of the aerial battles against Austin and Zamora.

2783~~~
Very good performance, good to have him back.

2784~~~
Had one hair-brained moment as per the norm which could've cost us a goal, but I was encouraged overall by his play today.

2785~~~
Good to have him back.

2786~~~
I must have missed that between switching streams, what happened?

2787~~~
He ran into Carrick and QPR fecked up a 3 vs 1.

2788~~~
Carrick ran into him. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I've always been told that the player going forward has the priority.

2789~~~
I am so happy we have him, our defence looks so much better with him despite some of his flaws, but then an Argie defender without some brain freeze moments wouldn't be an Argie defender! Thank you Arsenal for rejecting our offer for Vermaelen!!

2790~~~
If Phil Jones had of committed that stupid foul outside our box and ran into Carrick to set QPR through on goal then he would be crucified on here. I haven't seen anything from Rojo that says he is any better that Smalling or Jones yet.

2791~~~
Thought he had a really good game. Kept Zamora more quiet than Evans ever has!. Made some great interceptions and his passing is always a bonus. 

Smalling and Rojo for me again like last time please.

2792~~~
He's capable of that one brainfart per game but he's tough, good in the air, solid on the ball and quick.

Took the physical battle to Zamora and fecked him over. Great to see.

2793~~~
Phil Jones had a better game IMO. Made a daft pass early on but that was his only mistake. Rojo made a terrible error with Carrick and gave away a very stupid freekick.

2794~~~
Thought he was great today. Looks tough as nails and fearless. I like!

2795~~~
Aside from the miscommunication between Carrick I thought he was great.

2796~~~
He was absolutely excellent today (bar the one mix up with Carrick), I'm pretty sure Zamora was in tears at one point? He completely dominated him.

Edit: Also Whoscored's Motm for what that's worth.

2797~~~
Dealt with aerial balls far better than he ever has before. Big improvements.

2798~~~
Very good game from given the two Wally's he was stuck with back there. Won his battle with Zamora for the most part and is the only CB who looks comfortable in possession.

2799~~~
He will be a fantastic player for us. His anticipation is great. And he bullied Zamora.

2800~~~
Brain fart aside, i thought he was great today. Marked his players tight, won a lot of balls and dealt out some punishment

2801~~~
I don't think he's brilliant (certainly isn't as good on the ball as he obviously thinks he is), but he's the only one who isn't a complete and utter wimp, and should certainly be starting every game at the moment, given our current options.

2802~~~
Was really good I thought. Whether that is down to our usual idiots at the back or just because he is good I don't know.

2803~~~
I'm probably of the same believing as this, feel a lot safer about the defence with him in it.

2804~~~
I was pleased with him today, his silly mistake of running into Carrick(?) apart. Hopefully he'll stay fit and established himself. I loved what he did when he shoulder barged a QPR player off the ball to stop him from joining the attack too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2805~~~
I think he was really slow to get back at times, just strolled back behind the play but wasn't too bad today. 

He also ran into Austin really late off the ball which a cnut of a ref wouldn't have hesitated to give him a second yellow for.

2806~~~
Still worries me a bit that he will loose his head. That thing with Carrick

2807~~~
Jones made more than one daft pass. 

Not much distance between him and Rojo in the pecking order for 2nd choice behind Smalling, IMHO...

2808~~~
He's not very convincing is he? Ideally we shouldn't have both Jones and Rojo playing together.

2809~~~
Good to see him back, looked a bit shaky but should ease in quickly hopefully.

2810~~~
Liked his fighting spirit against Zamora in particular and I do think he has a lot of qualities. Doesn't leave me entirely convinced in terms of decision making and you can see why he's been used as a full-back at times where his lapses are less likely to be decisive.

2811~~~
Thought he was very good, would have been my MOTM if it wasnt for that feck up with Carrick.

2812~~~
Could just be down to Communication issues due to him not speaking English, or to not being assertive enough yet as he's the new kid, let's hope so at least. Maybe you could ask that Carrick should take charge more in those kind of situations aswell as the senior player.

2813~~~
For a player coming back after weeks of being out, I thought he was decent. QPR were constantly putting high balls into Zamora, and I can't imagine he's the easiest to mark - he's a strong lad. I felt Rojo give as much as he got.

2814~~~
Yeah im fairly certain there is a language barrier at the moment. That said, he strikes me as a bit of a loose cannon.

2815~~~
I thought he looked pretty convincing against a player in Zamora who essentially tries to bully every CB he plays against. Rojo seemed to be the one dishing out the bullying this afternoon. Good performance.

2816~~~
I certainly agree on the latter point. I think Rojo could be a capable defender with someone calm and assured along side him though.

2817~~~
He'll make a good squad player, doesn't seem the type to strike up a solid partnership with another defender with his kamikaze moments.

2818~~~
Scares the shit out of me. With him it feels like something stupid is just around the corner. 

Neither a good defender nor very good with the ball at his feet.

2819~~~
Good performance, he's a hardy bastard.

2820~~~
He is solid. Glad we've got him.

2821~~~
Don't think he's good enough as a part of a 2, as is no one else of our CBs (Smalling aside).

2822~~~
A bit shaky today, but it’s to be expected.

2823~~~
Thought he was good. Possibly even Man of the Match as there weren't too many standout candidates.

2824~~~
Really? Didn't think he was shaky at all. Handled Zamora perfectly.

2825~~~
I should have worded it better, he made a few unforced errors today which is understandable given his game time lately, but overall he played very well.

2826~~~
Yeah, when he and Carrick both failed to collect the ball, nearly cost us a goal.

2827~~~
It really should have cost us, we got very lucky there.

2828~~~
I think Rojo might be another player to get labelled or have a stereotype like Rafa being rash and De Gea being bad at crosses. Rojo was brilliant today, very solid. Won nearly everything against Zamora who's a very good target man to be fair. He did some good covering for Blind a few times , stepped in well. The mess with Carrick was his only big mistake, which was a communication error not a bad decision. He's a lot safer than our other defenders for me, and the best on the ball (Jones is good too). When/If we ever get a solid back 4/3, and he gets his English up to scratch - he'll do very well for us.

2829~~~
Excellent defending, mediocre passing and one massive error. A classic Rojo game. 

From a 24 year old CB, that's not bad. If he can cut out the one surreal mistake he finds a way to make, he could really give us 5-7 years of excellent CB play, and 24 isn't too old to shed that from his game.

2830~~~
Brilliant defending, he bullied Zamora and there's not many out there who can do that.

2831~~~
He's still adapting. Looked better than both Jones and Evans today. Made some mistakes, kept trying to make overlapping runs when he really should have been in position. But he's fearless. It's hard not to love that about a player.

2832~~~
Really hope he keeps the same attitude. Now he's a bit crazy, but in an amusing way. I can't help but like him a lot, he really is fearless, got a bit of that smart Argentinian dirtiness in his game. As long as he doesn't go primadonnna like Sergio Ramos he's a brilliant player to have in our squad.

He also did one of his famous Rabona's today. Although not in open play, he used it to pass a ball back to the right wing where a throw-in was given. Couldn't help himself.

Posted it before, but this is still easily one of my favourite moments of the World Cup

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SaB-1m_XhEM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2833~~~
Far more likeable version of Heinze. Not superb yet but got character to aim for the top.

2834~~~
Best defender we've got.. And that's saying something.

Always feel there's an error waiting.

2835~~~
Voted him my MoTM. I have been a critic of him (and still am) and he had one or two errors but was pretty good otherwise. Still think he should be paired with Smalling. Smalling's composure alongside him would be a good help.

2836~~~
He looked good this game. Hopefully he keeps progressing would love him to cement that LCB spot leaving us to bring in a quality partner for him.

2837~~~
For me, he was the most solid player among our defenders. He held the line well, but I really didn't like the way he got mixed up with Carrick and allowed that odd-man rush.

2838~~~
So whose fault was the Carrick thing? Rojo was the one facing forward but Carrick should have been more assertive as the CM and vice-Captain in taking <i>his</i> ball.

2839~~~
I thought he was very good. Looked in control of whatever he had to deal with. Just a good solid game.

2840~~~
Skysports gave him man of the match. Was he really that good?

2841~~~
No. I'd have given Wilson MOTM for his late surging runs and his clinching goal.

2842~~~
He seems to polarize opinion on here - either (i) too rash, prone to lapse of concentration and ultimately not good enough, or (ii) is a tough bastard who is a bit of an all rounder and settling well into the team. 

I'd probably go with the latter, he has that fire in his belly, temperament to battle away against the top strikers. His got a lot of the physical attributes pace, strength, decent height and aerial ability to deal with both the quick forwards and strong ones. The worry is that he is prone to the odd lapse of concentration but Rio Ferdinand at a similar age was having problems with that. Rojo is still only 24 and it can be drummed out of him with plenty more games and experience. 

Most of the current players in the squad lack of bit of tenacity and grit and Rojo brings some of that.

2843~~~
I like him to be fair, him following his striker to the bloody half-line reminds me of what Vidić always did and neither Jones nor Smalling do as often, of course it was a bit problematic in the second half as you want your CDM to cover for the CB while he's on the hunt and we didn't do that but that's there to master really.

He's aggressive, can play the ball, I'd say he should always be a starter for us whether 5 or 4 at the back. Still think him and Smalling are our best CB partnership at the moment in 4 at the back.

2844~~~
What is this. He's already a good defender. A bit rash at times but still. Doesn't get bullied, good in the air and good tackling. Also his positioning is quite ok. And he is probably the best defender on the ball we have. Wtf is this about.

2845~~~
Glad he's back. Our best defender and should only improve.

2846~~~
Still not convinced, it was QPR.

He looks a bit of a lunatic and potential hot head.

2847~~~
Ill take that. With Jones and especially Evans you <i>know</i> something stupid is just around the corner. Rojo looks a bit wild at times but i cant remember him gifting the opposition any goalscoring chances like Evans does every single game.

2848~~~
Yesterday he ran into Carrick and QPR had a three on one situation.

2849~~~
That was hardly all on him though. Carrick was the more at fault of the two imo.

2850~~~
Needs to sort out a few areas in his game but generally I'm impressed.

2851~~~
Him and Smalling is the way forward I think. He covers for Smallings lack of ability on the ball and Smalling's got enough common sense to constantly look out for any brain fart from his partner, along with defensive ability to rescue a situation.

2852~~~
Im liking him more and more.

2853~~~
Im in the Rojo fan club. He clearly loves being here, always hasa smile on his face and is a bit of a nutter.

I think he could really flurish with a run of games next to  another CBso he can actually develop a partnership.

He is by far our best all round defender.

2854~~~
Not sure about that. Rojo was facing play IIRC and the defender should always make the call. I think that Rojo is a decent player. I am not slating him. I just find it interesting that he gets a pass for doing two things that Jones would get crucified for (Carrick situation & stupid freekick).

2855~~~
Agree with this partnership being our best option. Rafael Smalling Rojo Shaw as a back for should be the way forward. Still not ideal, but it's the best we have ATM.

2856~~~
I think this will be our future imo.

No coincidence that our best run of form/defensive game was when these 4 and Fellaini played.

2857~~~
So Rojo was right ? It's Carrick who should have stopped.

2858~~~
Really like him and in difficult circumstances this season he has steadily got better. He has a lot of raw potential, I'd have loved it if he could have a season bedding in next to someone like Rio Ferdinand.

2859~~~
No Rojo should have called the situation and attacked the ball. They both pulled out in the end.

2860~~~
Both of them were facing play, whilst Carrick was marginally closer to the ball. Rojo made some weird movement with his arm as if to say im getting out of your way - although noone but them knows who actually called what.

2861~~~
This is right. They are easily the best defensive pair. 

And I don't mind that he's a nutter. Too often we're too fecking passive as a team

2862~~~
Yeah me too, Vidic was as much a nutter than Rojo and he is seen as one of our best centrebacks.

2863~~~
Scary..<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Then you seem to have missed games where he left the ball criminally short in dangerous areas or passed it straight to the opposition. He panics under pressure and is bit too erratic with his defending. He is a squad defender, who can be useful as back up CB and LB. I am sure we'd would be looking for an upgrade to play at LCB.

2864~~~
I see Rojo is the new Rafael. 

His enthusiastic style of play is leading him to be seen as some sort of rash liability. 

I wonder how long it will be until the tide turns and people realise that's not really the case.

2865~~~
Given that Rafael is still blamed for those things, you'll be waiting a long time

2866~~~
I like him a lot, not scared by physical players and good on the ball. The rest of his game will improve with time as the league is new to him and he's had injuries.

2867~~~
not too bad. a better option to have over Blackett & McNair. Don't think he is any better than our existing senior CBs - only played less here so his flaws aren't so clearly pounced upon

2868~~~
Pace <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2869~~~
Because he's only been here five minutes. Jones has been here years and is still making the same mistakes.

2870~~~
I think I read somewhere recently that LVG said he was fixed in the team along with Blind. I think that speaks volumes about what he thinks of him if true.
To be honest I really like him, making a few mistakes but thats normal for a new defender to a league.

EDIT:

"ow the players are coming back and I will have a full selection of players within three weeks, I think," Van Gaal explained.

"Normally, we should then play better because a lot of players who were also fixed in my line-up - Daley Blind and Di Maria, for example - are now coming back.

"Marcos Rojo, for example, was also fixed in my line-up. I didn’t have the chance to build up with the same players. I hope that I can do that now, but you never know

2871~~~
He will be picked because he is our best left-footed centre back. I think it's as simple as that.

I have been impressed with some of his work so far - more than in the World Cup, he's definitely a centre back IMO. We just need to keep him fit and choose who his partner should be.

2872~~~
Well, yeah, dah, our only left-footed CB.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Well, if you don't count Tyler Blackett.</span>

2873~~~
Rojo is two years older than Jones, has experience of playing in four different leagues and he is an experienced international, one who has played in a World Cup final.

2874~~~
Its more the passing to the opposition that Rafael has never been known for and Smalling has been chastised for

2875~~~
That doesn't change the fact that he's in an English team barely speaking a Word of English whilst also playing at the highest level of competition in his career bar one WC and being new to the team which is far from settled.

2876~~~
His our only defensive player who looks like he won't be bullied, yes his made a couple of errors but his passion he shows is what I like and he aint taking no shit!

2877~~~
Smalling doesn't get bullied either tbf

2878~~~
Zamora got all kinds of wound up being in Rojo's pocket.

2879~~~
When Vidic and Evra arrived here, did they look good immediately?

2880~~~
I haven't said that he doesn't look good. I just don't think that he looks any better than Jones.

2881~~~
I really really like him. I don't get why people don't think he's a very solid defender? 
What's the complaints about?

2882~~~
That he has a bit of 'David Luiz' to him, and not just in the sense of having a terrible haircut.

I hope he gets a good run of games the second half of the season so he can show if he is one of the answers at CB going forward next to that superstar CB we'll supposedly sign...

2883~~~
Even if a player is experienced coming to the Prem is difficult, especially for a defender. Jones has had long enough in the league and at Utd to show more than he is showing.

2884~~~
Careless passing to opposition attackers and things like trying to take on a Chelsea attacker on the half way line, losing the ball and leading to a counterattack. You know, the suicidal stuff that undoes all the good work he does for the rest of the game. 

If he cuts  the crazy stuff thats inexcusable out, he definitely has an upside with his interceptions and being a better passer than our other defenders

2885~~~
I don't think he's anywhere near as crazy as some make out. He takes risks, yes, but that's what the modern defender now does. I think it's a case of being so used to very static defenders for a whole season and a half that seeing someone like Rojo is a real big shock. Sort of similar to how Young has looked like a half decent player as a LWB, it's often hyperbolised since we've seen him play horse shit prior to that.

2886~~~
He's got an eccentric part to his game, but that really shouldn't take away from his solid potential and ability as a defender. Let him be eccentric, he's only 24. He's obviously got very good foundations as a defender, just like Vidic did when he first came, but age will hone him into a much wiser head. I feel he is by far our best centre back.

2887~~~
Smalling is a miles better out and out defender. Just not the same ability to pass the ball

2888~~~
He's fine. Its the link to Pique or Pique like CB that worries me.

2889~~~
Not a huge fan of his, but he has really picked up in his aerial ability from the start of the season. He kept winning aerial battles, both in and outside the box against QPR. That was really encouraging to see.

2890~~~
I like him. And his wife/gf is absolutely gorgeous.that's worth something, surely.

2891~~~
I like Rojo. It was nice to see him dish out the bullying to Zamora who is exactly the kind of front man who usually tends to give our soft back line a hard time. He's young and will only get better with time and coaching. Him and Smalling looked pretty good earlier in the season imo.

2892~~~
He seems to be the Argentinian version of Silvestre ie a player with good technique but no brains. Maybe we can do like Mickey and move him to the LB position were he can do minimum damage.

2893~~~
Yepp!

2894~~~
Just checked her pic. Surely we can't allow to let him go based on that alone! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2895~~~
What the feck is actually wrong with some of you. This guy has arguably been our best CB alongside Smalling this season. No idea where all this hate comes from.

2896~~~
To be fair I would only keep Luke Shaw (due to potential) in that crappy defense made up of overrated and injury prone players. This is, in my opinion, the worse defense we ever had in the past 30 years. No wonder why the likes of Rio, Vidic and Evra were able to keep this drivel out of the first team for so many years.

2897~~~
Been our best player so far, love him

2898~~~
If you need a positive from that half he was it. Probably our most forward thinking player as well which tells a story.

2899~~~
Really really growing on me. 
Fantastic so far!

2900~~~
His improvement in the air, in just 6 months, is fantastic. A real positive. At the start of the season he was letting balls bounce all over the place, but now he's attacking everything, and not letting it drop. He's putting Jones to shame tonight.

2901~~~
I love him.

2902~~~
Easily our most dependable defender.

2903~~~
Starting to get to grips with English football, and it's showing. Only decent player of the half.

2904~~~
The Argentinian side of him is out on show tonight!

2905~~~
Our "playmaker", it is sad we have to resort to him for positive passing. When he had to do it, he did it well.

2906~~~
Confident on the ball and looks up for the physical contest, comfortably our best player in the first half.

2907~~~
I really like this guy, he can be a little rash at times, but I think he can go on to be a top player. Hopefully he stays fit between now and the end of the season and continue to improve

2908~~~
He's really starting to settle in, our best defender.

2909~~~
Been our best player so far. He's getting better game by game.

2910~~~
Yeah he's been good. Looks like a proper defender, and I'm sorry for calling him like Jones at the start of the season. Way ahead of him right now.

2911~~~
Perhaps the one decent performance from those that started? Defended well, used the ball much better than Jones. Confident about the left centre half position with him.

2912~~~
Same. I'll be disappointed if we sign someone to take his place, him and Smalling as a partnership could be great.

2913~~~
He's worse on the ball than Jones. We need better footballers if we are to push on.

2914~~~
our best defender at the moment.

2915~~~
Early on in his United career Smalling looked really calm on the ball, and I'm pretty sure he looked very good earlier this season when he was partnered with Rojo. I wouldn't be bothered if we replaced him with someone better, but I wouldn't write him off just yet. The biggest problem I have with him is the injuries.

2916~~~
He's a little warrior. Wasn't taking any shite from their big boys. Some rugged challenges, and he brought the ball out really well. That diving headed block for one of their crosses was ace.

2917~~~
I don't care if it was just Cambridge, he looked solid as fook tonight, when the likes of phil jones, one player a lot here rate as our best CB, was a calamity.

Really hope he can show these performances in the PL now, because he was great tonight, in fact the only real positive thing I can draw from it.

2918~~~
My MOTM, love to see him next to a leader and organizer, we need to find him a Rio.

2919~~~
The only positive about tonight along with Herrera. I have liked him from day one and am liking him more and more with every passing game. Our best defender despite being completely new to the PL and in and out of the team because of injuries.

2920~~~
I do like his attitude, even if he does scare me a bit. He did well today. I'd like to hope him and Smalling (provided he can actually get fit) should be our first choice CB pairing for the rest of the season.

2921~~~
I agree Rojo and Smalling in my opinion are our best centre backs.

He has a very good left foot, lovely distribution and importantly tries to play the ball on the ground to feet, impressed.

2922~~~
In amongst the shit recently he's been playing very well.

2923~~~
Looked really up for it. Uplifting and impressive performance.

2924~~~
He's 6ft 1 

I don't get why he gets called little so much. 

Agreed with the rest though.

2925~~~
Deserves credit tonight, some people haven't been all that impressed with him but I thought he was really good.

2926~~~
Fast becoming one of my favourites.

2927~~~
Aggressive, not fecking around, had to playmake like 50% of the time, very good performance, even if it's just against Cambridge, you can't say the same thing about rest of our players.

2928~~~
He is deceptively tall. He never looks like a big presence on the pitch for some reason, even though he's not exactly short. Still, I normally expect centre backs to maybe be a few inches taller than he is.

2929~~~
Was very good tonight. The sort of muck and bullets game that suits him. Would have suited Phil Jones too if he hadn't put his boots on the wrong feet.

2930~~~
Vidic-esque character.

2931~~~
I think its the hair, I see a picture of him and think he's short too. Then you see him play and not many are taller than him.

2932~~~
Perceptions regarding Rojo's lack of stature can be misleading.

Marcos Rojo : 187 cm
John Terry : 187 cm
Ricardo Carvalho : 183 cm
Laurent Koscielny : 186 cm
Nemanja Vidic : 189 cm
Jamie Carragher : 184 cm
Jan Vertonghen : 189 cm

More than adequate height for a central defender. Plus Rojo's rather athletic with an Ayala-esque leap ergo he can add another couple of inches in an aerial duel. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2933~~~
Tough fecker and good on the ball too. Happy we signed him so far.

2934~~~
Impresses me almost every time he plays. I like him and he's had a good start to his United career.

2935~~~
Improving every game. Good to see.

2936~~~
Was up for the battle tonight, against a physical Cambridge side. Thought he was solid. Really good performance from Rojo.

2937~~~
Very good again tonight. Cements my idea that him and Smalling could form a really good partnership if he can stay fit. He's only going to get better too.

2938~~~
I think we've found the long term successor to Vidic. Sadly, I don't think any of our other CB's are up to the task of replacing Ferdinand.

Rojo and a new CB could be the foundations for a brilliant pairing for years to come.

2939~~~
I was thinking, having a young Rio Ferdinand would help a lot. I think having a ball playing defender next to him would see a really good partnership develop and provide good balance especially as there is so much space to exploit. Thats why Jones had so much space, but he cant really kick the ball, or pass, or cross, or shoot.

2940~~~
He has a mistake in him ala Vidic. Needs someone next to him who isn't a complete liability like the rest of our defenders. Partnered next to someone like Godin and our central defence would be perfect.

2941~~~
Slowly emerging as the best performer of the summer gaalacticos.

2942~~~
I don't think he has world class potential but he can still do a job for us

2943~~~
He's not really like Vidic. Vidic's main quality was being a one-man-team against crosses into the box. He'd win everything and protect the skies.

Jones makes more clearances, Smalling wins more balls in the air

Where Rojo comes out on top is making more tackles and more importantly, playing a lot of passes. Which is more Rio than Vidic.

2944~~~
You never know tbh. Vidic hardly looked like world class potential in his first season but yeah he was more of an exception. 

I'm pretty sceptical of Rojo too but it is his first season in a foreign league and a fluctuating defense, so I'm willing to save my judgement on him till next season. That's not to say he gets a free ride till then but I hope people don't write him off and be patient with him. Though, not to Anderson levels of course <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2945~~~
I liked the fact that many thought the "long ball style" and big lumps of Cambridge would cause Rojo a problem. If anything he actually enjoyed that style of defending more!. He won so many tackles cleanly it was great to see, just needs to cut out the pushing with his arms when attackers are holding the ball up.

2946~~~
I have been pleasantly surprised by him. A lot stronger in the air and the tackle than I was expecting and of course very comfortable on the ball.

He still has the "David Luiz" factor in the sense that he can be a bit erratic but if he continues at this level then he is our best centre half in my opinion. Of course its still early days and Jones/Smalling/Evans all looked similarly good when breaking through.

2947~~~
I understand this argument about Rojo, but remember when Ferdinand was around about that age? He had the odd blunder in him as well. He was a phenomenal defender on his day but had a goof up or two in him in his younger days. In comes Vidic and the moment he turned 27, he looked a totally different defender. Safe on the ball and powerful in the air.

Rojo has the potential to be this. He's really powerful physically and has a good spring on him. Not to mention he's excellent in the tackle and is especially good with one on ones. L'est we forget that he's really, really quick for a CB. He has the potential to be a monster of a defender for us. Remember, it's his first season in England! He's done remarkably well for a new lad at this level.

2948~~~
With Rio it was concentration problems. He'd switch off and get caught out with is more like Jones than Rojo.

Rojo's trouble is with decisions. Not passing the ball to the opponent. Not trying to dribble an opponent in a situation where, if he wins the ball he's got 1 defender to beat and hes onto the goalkeeper. His actual defending has almost always been fine, its the suicidal moments where he puts a chance on a plate for the opponents that have ruined his season

For me he's gradually got better with his defending and defensively I now trust him more than Jones who continues to make the concentration errors every other game. But he still needs to prove he can be trusted not to gift wrap attacks to the opposition players like he has done previously. When other teams play us they'll look at Rojo (and Jones) and say this guy will give us chances if we pressure him and that'll spur them on.

Smalling is the one CB we have that opponents will not want to play against because he doesnt give you that chance. Yeah he might give the ball away with his passing more than another CB, but not in a terrible situation.

Rojo and Jones might win the ball more often over the course of a game, but as a striker you'd gladly trade losing the ball a couple of times to tackles from Jones and Rojo, for when they cock up and give you a good chance to run at the goal and shoot. You only need that one chance to do your job.

2949~~~
Yes, we need patience. I think he's generally been offorded it because he's made a lot of errors this season. On the other hand he's done very well but I don't think people will turn a blind eye to some of his mistakes next season, if he doesn't stamp them out. All and in all he's been a big positive.

2950~~~
Like? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> I would hardly call less than 5 mistakes in half a season LOADS.

2951~~~
It'd be interesting to know how many mistakes each of our defenders have made, and possibly how many each has covered for someone else's mistake. Wouldn't be surprised if Rojo was nowhere near as bad as loads of people seem to think <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2952~~~
According to Squawka hes made 3 defensive errors and Evans has made 4. Jones and Smalling 0... not sure how true that Jones and Smalling at 0 figure is tbh

2953~~~
Jones passing the ball to the opponent at least twice every game does not count then?.... Those stats mean feck all

2954~~~
Have we been watching the same Chris Smalling?

The one ive seen spoils a run of good games with one absolute howler. You can even see it in his face. I cant explain it but he seems to go back to Maidstone in his head and is half a second off the pace with everything he does. Most opposition fans i know relish playing against him on the off chance he has one of those games, im sure players do too.

Rojo is comfortably our best defender at the moment imo.

2955~~~
Its a shame Smalling can't stay fit, as I think Smalling Rojo would form a great partnership.

2956~~~
Yeah as <a class="username" data-user="24815, @Godfather" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24815/">@Godfather</a> says, that's clearly rubbish <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2957~~~
They did. It was our only real consistent run of good attacking and defense. They are both very athletic which helps, and being opposite feet gives good "balance".

2958~~~
Think he's probably been our best CB so far this year. Looks a decent signing, think LVG likes him too.

2959~~~
He's made about 3 howlers in 5 years at the club. He's very anti-howler, he's a consistant good CB

2960~~~
Agree that Smalling isn't error prone at all, particularly compared to our other centre halfs. He's a steady solid defender.

2961~~~
And that's why he and Rojo looked like such a quality partnership. Hopefully Smalling can get over his injury problems, if they get a good run together over the rest of the season then we might not need to go for a world class CB, and instead buy promising players as backup if we want to replace Evans/Jones (or buy no-one, sell Evans/Jones and trust Blackett/McNair as backup... lol).

2962~~~
I think you misunderstood... he doesn't make Evans style errors, but every now and then he'll have a game where the opposition strikers run rings around him.

2963~~~
Only at RB where he's clearly a fish out of water

He's the complete opposite of what you describe as a CB. Players have already said he's the worst player to have to train against and Smalling has rarely ever let us down in his real position. He's very consistant. Up until this season he was also available more often than Jones and Evans but this season he's had a couple of injuries.

I get it, he's not flashy. In fact he's the very basics when we have the ball. And he's not going to be a top class CB like we hoped he might be, as a replacement for the aging Ferdinand. And this season he's had a couple of injuries and got himself suspended with a mistake against City. All valid critisisms of him

But making howlers? No. Being a player that opponents want to play against? No. Having rings run around him? No. Just no, not in this reality.

2964~~~
Don't agree with this either. The only times i've ever been let down by Smalling was in his games at RB when his distribution and ball carrying let him down which is understandable as its not his position. The only other time was his sending off against City which was totally out of character, and frustration i have at his tendency to get injured which again you can't really blame him for.

He's a solid and consistent, albeit unspectacular and quite limited performer.

2965~~~
Would back him against Costa... in a fight at least...

2966~~~
Considering he has had an injury set back since arriving, I think he has settled well.  Still slightly rough around the edges, but given his lack of hype when he arrived, he is up there with Blind as the best purchase under LvG.
I hope he can cement his place in the LCB position and I think LvG likes him there.
If memory serves, he and Smalling were looking almost competent together before the latter crocked?

2967~~~
Yes they don't mean shit because they don't suit your argument

2968~~~
Work in progress for me. I think we won't see the best in this lad for a couple of seasons. I think he'll be a beast of a player by then.....

2969~~~
Awwwwww...

2970~~~
Very cute <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2971~~~
I know he's had a bit of a rough start but I hope this guy turns out to be massive success, You can tell this guy see's United as the pinnacle of football, would love to see more players like that here.

2972~~~
Am i the only one who thinks he's actually pretty good, and hasnt been as bad as people think he's been?

2973~~~
He's been very good in the last few games, the comments on the whole tend to reflect that too. I'm inclined to be optimistic towards him. Even if he just ends up being a solid squad player if we bring in one or two top class defenders in the summer.

2974~~~
I think he has been great.

I have singled him out on occasions for specific errors but overall, for a foreign player to come in, have to deal with an injury, play in a ever changing defence, I think he has been great.

Still a long way to go for him and those around him but I have no complaints at all with him.

2975~~~
true indeed. there were some mistakes for sure but at least he is improving.

2976~~~
Perfect squad defender really. Can cover both Center back and left back. We need to hit the market and purchase a starting center back.

2977~~~
He's getting better and better. I'm starting to really like him.

As an aside, his wife is gorgeous <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2978~~~
No your're not the only one

2979~~~
Proper hard bastard, not even wearing gloves when making a snowman.

2980~~~
I agree with you, he's no way a finished product, plus he'll benefit form an elite defender alongside him, once we get one that is.

2981~~~
No. I think he is very underrated.

2982~~~
turns 25 in march..wonder how much improvement we can expect at that age. First he needs to get used to the PL but looks already the best of the bunch we have.

2983~~~
Well defenders do mature a bit later than more attacking players, partly because I think it's position where you need to have a deeper understanding of the game and be cerebral in terms of manipulating and containing opposition players, many of whom can outmatch you in terms of sped, agility and skill.

Someone like Pepe, who IMO has been one of the Top 5 defenders in Europe over the past couple of years was often calamitous when Real first signed him at age 24 and got better once he  got more experience, became calmer, grasped the mental aspect and subtle nuances of defending instead of just relying on physical traits. Once you do that, the game slows down and you can make better decisions naturally instead of rushing into things - a trait which is lethal for defenders at the top level.

Others like Puyol or Thiago or Carragher or Carvalho or Ayala would fall in the same bracket of defenders who kept progressing and improving into more complete defenders beyond their mid 20s. Rojo is a very gifted defender from a physical standpoint but he still has lapses in terms of coverage, overconfidence and concentration, things that Van Gaal can improve by repetition and thorough game planning. Infact we're seeing signs of improvement already in terms of his anticipation and the development from Sporting in 2013/ 2014 to the World Cup to the start of his United career to now.

Might sound deluded but he seems a very quick learner and IMO Rojo in his late 20s and early 30s can be as good of a player as Diego Godin is now, if not slightly better given his superior athletic skillset.

2984~~~
hope your're right. Surely he is not at his peak yet but how good he can become will be interesting to watch over the next months. A proper defender to his side would even make look better at this time. Hummels next to him would be excellent. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I like the no nonsense defending Rojo shows at times, a bit like Vidic. Hummels is that type of player who can start play from the back and defends more by his positioning and reading of the game, a bit like Ferdinand.

dream stuff of course, but to come to the point: I think Rojo can become a no.1 choice defender for us.

2985~~~
Oh my. A tandem of Hummels and Rojo would be brilliant indeed. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2986~~~
Nope. He's been great considering it's his first season. I'm hoping LvG soon will go with Smalling-Rojo as our CBs, so we can see them both flourish.

2987~~~
can see a rafael hummels rojo shaw backline if properly supported with a defensive midfielder being fecking golden for us for years to come tbh.

2988~~~
You can see Rafael not getting injured consistently?

2989~~~
Hey now, lets not jump to an impossible scenario here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2990~~~
I like him. He has his moments where he completely forgets how to play football, but he's generally okay. In no universe should Evans ever get a game ahead of him, unless he regains his 2009 form. Rojo, for me, is the first choice centre-beck (alongside Smalling). He's one of the few players in the team with some balls & a nasty streak, like Rafael, De Gea and RVP. He doesn't take any shit. Correct me if I am wrong, but did he not face work-permit issues because he almost went to jail after he smashed a bottle on someone's face while in Argentina? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> We need more of this.

2991~~~
Well, half of it would be anyway.

2992~~~
Oh yeah, so endearing...

2993~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2994~~~
He's our best defender. Plays the ball well, is aggressive, fast. Can do the lot. Perhaps need to work on his communication - that'll improve as his English improves though. 

Sign a more experienced player to play next to him and well have a very strong back two.

2995~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> because I genuinely want our players to hit people on the head with bottles. 

There won't be many people who disagree with the notion that some of our players are simply too 'nice'. It was even leveled at Carrick for a few years, before he reached a new level in 12/13.

2996~~~
Chance has come for him to make amends for that debacle.

2997~~~
Cutting edge of wit right here.. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2998~~~
People have been calling for someone like Dragovic to come in and I think that we already have Rojo who's got just as much potential and is just as good, if not better. A simple Youtube video doesn't mean much if that's the barometer by which many people in this forum speak so highly about Dragovic.

Yet, if it's video compilations... a Youtube video of Rojo this year will tell you that he has similar qualities and has been rather good for us. I agree with this video but we've seen him play consistently so we can vouch for that. He looks rather good in this one. Excuse the horrible music.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SboqBpRzYDI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2999~~~
No you're not. Hasn't really been noticed a lot this season , which is a good thing for a defender.

3000~~~
Early days and all, but I really like how the left side of our defense is shaping up with Rojo and young Shaw. One aspect that sometimes gets overlooked in favor of centerback pairings is the chemistry between defenders on the same flank working as a combination. If they can develop further and even come close to replicating the Vidic + Evra tandem on the left side, we could be set for years. Good complement of athletic qualities and defensive awareness, hope some of tactical and positional nuances get ironed out soon. 

As an aside, I like how Rojo is developing as a leader in terms of shepherding the backline. One would imagine a newcomer being timid, especially one with a tenuous grasp on the language. But he really seems enamored by the club and is one of the first to celebrate a goal. Hard not to root for a player like that !

3001~~~
Surprised to see that he struggled with the pace of Nugent today. Other than that he was very good.

3002~~~
Rojo is going to be a great signing. He's tough and has settled in a lot faster than usual. Love his passion and dedication to the team...plus his obvious defensive abilities. He feels so much like a real United defender.

3003~~~
I thought his pace to recover was excellent.

3004~~~
Normally I think so too, but he did struggle against him a couple of times, and he's no Walcott. His recovery pace against Ulloa wasn't even that impressive tbf. He has a lot of grit though and never gives up. I like him.

3005~~~
Did well again today. Doesn't scare me so much any more.

3006~~~
Got caught ball watching a few times but recovered just fine. Gritty player and he will only get better once he settles. Hopefully LVG sticks with a defensive partnership of Jones/Smalling for the long run. That way an understanding can be built up between the three.

3007~~~
Another good game from him, seems to really love playing for United and starting to develop a bit of leadership skills also. Hope he can get a partner that sticks.

3008~~~
Another good game from him. Looking more and more composed all the time. Doesn't shy away from a 50/50. He takes a clattering and bounces back up. Always seems to look for a pass and keep play moving when a lot of defenders would just hammer it away or into touch. Big fan of him.

3009~~~
Well, ever since he bought out his contract with ms13 he seems a bit more composed on the ball.

3010~~~
Always liked him!

3011~~~
Always liked his passing out from defence. He's not shy of playing a tough pass.

3012~~~
Didn't have that much to do, but he looks like such a solid player. I really like his style, and he's great at bringing the ball out of defence.

3013~~~
Completely agree with this. He's in very good form at the moment.

3014~~~
Another solid performance from him, he's doing really well for his first season in a new country and league.

3015~~~
Apart from when he rifled it at Shaw today from like five yards, I thought he was solid again.

3016~~~
I think people don't always take this into consideration when judging him. I think he has been a success so far in his first season, seems to be getting more and more comfortable each game. I like him.

3017~~~
The most unsure signing of the summer (at the start), but now he is starting to show a lot of composure. Really starting to like him.

3018~~~
Solid performance! Looked easily the better defender of our 2 today.

3019~~~
I think his composure is underrated.  Really doing some good work back there.

3020~~~
Really delighted to see him earning more and more composure every week going by. Keep up the good work.

3021~~~
He's improved a lot over the last 2 months which is a nice change from of our other CB's going backwards. Hopefully, he can stay injury free and kick on from here.

3022~~~
I am convinced he's gonna be a star for us. He'll cement that CB place for good. The only problem I have with him is that he takes unnecessary risks. For eg, there are many instances where he will try to pass it to a well marked player and lose possession. Can easily be avoided but it kind of frustrates me. He always puts one of his teammates in danger by passing the ball at the wrong time. Minor flaws that can be ironed out. He doesn't hesitate to get stuck in. Makes some crunching tackles. Didn't have much to do but did well overall.

3023~~~
Rojo + 1 please.

Admirable how well he's done all things considered (injuries around him, constant formation changes etc.)

3024~~~
Yeah, I mean two of our best ever defensive players, Vidic and Evra, both took longer to settle than he has and had a rockier start. I think when we get him the right RCB partner next season he'll develop even further as him and Shaw are already looking quite in sync on the left side of defense.

3025~~~
I think I'd believe in him more if he shaved his hair all over. He doesn't look like a defender at the moment.

3026~~~
He brings a calmness to the back. When it's Jones and Smalling - there is always nervy moments but Rojo seems to have a natural ability to avoid the nervy moments

3027~~~
Really? I think the haircut and the neck tattoo make him look like a real tough cookie.

3028~~~
Which cookies are the tougher ones?

Chocolate Chip, Butter Nut?

Or are the tough cookies those stale with experience?

3029~~~
I like him.

He'd be grand with an assured leader alongside him, more than good enough IMO.

3030~~~
This is exactly why I love him. He has the balls to start an attack from the back with passes like that, just like Rio and Vidic did for us. Obviously he's not going to have a 100% record with it

3031~~~
Has been in good nick recently. More solid now, than he was at the beginning of the season where he looked overawed and shaky. Understandable since he's in a new league and still adapting to the culture. 

His passing and composure has improved a lot as well. Just needs to play in a settled system and defense, for us to consistently see the best of him.

Hope he maintains his own levels and doesn't get injured.

3032~~~
Rojo + Jones was what I hoped for, and I'm liking it.

3033~~~
Much rather Smalling.

I think the reason he prefers Jones now though is because he runs forward with the ball. 

Hasn't got the foggiest what to do when he gets there but at least he carries it forward and breaks the lines.

3034~~~
Me and my Dad laugh at Jones for this all the time!

I prefer him to Smalling because he's better on the ball. In Jones and Rojo you have two players who play as if they would die fighting for the cause.

3035~~~
That's all Rojo needs, if we get someone like Hummels or godin then rojo will be a very good CB

3036~~~
Let's just get him a partner who can play more than 2 games in a row.

3037~~~
Problem is that young Phil would be quite happy to take all his teammates with him.

3038~~~
I felt both our center backs lost concentration towards the end of the match and there were a few more errors but prior to that, quite a solid game.

3039~~~
Been impressed with him lately after a shaky start IMO. Still think it should be him and Smalling as our first choice CBs.

3040~~~
He was good again with limited defending to do though.

It's amazing in possession though, two CB partners, when Rojo gets the ball, you can almost see his brain and what he is thinking, he knows his next step, where to take his touch, the reasoning behind a pass etc.

But when you see the ball coming to Jones, all I can see inside his head is a monkey banging cymbals together.

3041~~~
Mark Red. What's not to like really. He can actually pass a football on the ground and is a feisty little lad too. Impressed with him.

3042~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Christ. It's funny until you realise it's true.

3043~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That was brilliant. Like, what the feck was he doing?

3044~~~
In my opinion, yesterday was his second good game in United's shirt.

My averate rating for him rose 0.4 just for this one performance. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I would vote him 3rd best player on the pitch, maybe 2nd joint with van Persie. Blind obvious winner.

3045~~~
Great signing.

3046~~~
Haven't got a clue. The look he got from Shaw was priceless, though. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3047~~~
He's getting better. I think he is becoming a bit more dominant. We have to get Shaw and a RCB playing with him every week though.

3048~~~
Was he crying after he scored?

3049~~~
I really like him, I think he'll be a top player for us eventually.

3050~~~
Love him! And it has nothing to do with the goal he just scored.

3051~~~
Same here, on both counts.

3052~~~
Having another good game with the goal as a cherry on top.

3053~~~
Fast becoming a bit of a fans favourite.

3054~~~
His progression is really good to see.

3055~~~
He's looked better at LB today than the last time he played there for us, must be worrying for Shaw with new CB's likely coming in that Rojo is seen as one of LvG's certs regardless of the role.

3056~~~
He's a good fit here.

3057~~~
Improving every game, great to see!

3058~~~
How has his partnership with Smalling looked today?

Edit: never mind, just realised he's at LB

3059~~~
That's what i said all along. Glad he's scored. Hopefully he keeps improving as he keeps adapting to the club and a more demanding football. He's doing better for you guys than what he done in his first year at Sporting.

3060~~~
I like Rojo, glad he got his goal tonight.

3061~~~
He's been really good, love everything about him. Always smiling, always trying and he loves being here.

3062~~~
Our best defender imo, like how he's competent at Lb too, put in some good crosses.

3063~~~
Along with Blind, becoming one of the first names on the team sheet.

3064~~~
Very Heinze-like. Hope it doesn't end as badly...

3065~~~
Very happy for him to get his goal, quickly becoming a favourite of mine. He and Blind have probably been our best signings, ironically they're also the cheapest <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3066~~~
there's always just been something about him. He actually looks like he gives a shit, like he wants to take responsibility. He tries to encourage the young players, tell others where to pass, where to move, what to do etc. he's not afraid to be aggressive either. It's refreshing to see because for the last 18 months our squad have largely been a bunch of pussies.

3067~~~
Yeah, another player who grew on me really fast. Can't see him doing a Heinze though.

They situation was pretty rare.

3068~~~
Same here, has a bit of passion to his game and wouldn't back down to anyone, cockiness as well which I like

I really look forward to seeing our new players in the UCL next season, if we make top 4 which I hope we do.

3069~~~
It's really weird (to me) that people write in these mega threads about performances rather than the post match thread <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
PS Really like Rojo, so happy he's off the mark!

3070~~~
Same here, its like buying a race car and having to wait 1 year to test it on a race track<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>, Rojo looks Champions League ready.

3071~~~
The thread is called "Marcos Rojo 2014/15 Performances"... what else would you expect people to talk about in a thread specifically about Rojo's performances?

And I'm pretty sure talking about all 14 player performances in one match thread<i>, </i>alongside discussing the team's collective performance and all the other stuff specific to that game, would be far more of a mega thread than this... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3072~~~
Reminds me of Puyol.

3073~~~
I really like him, him and Blind are fastly coming my 2 fav players

3074~~~
I think he has a very good chance of cementing that left CB played fantastic today.

3075~~~
He is lovable character from every picture he uploads on instagram he looks happy. Hope he can transfer the happines on the pitch and do his job well. I like him but he should start as CB his crossing is very inconsistent..

3076~~~
Class, Him Shaw and Blind are proper united signings.

3077~~~
I like him a lot, seems to love it here too. Hope he keeps progressing.

3078~~~
He got unlucky with his shoulder, but a lot of the time he seems to be on the good side of nasty challenges. Left a Cambridge player in pain after a subtle challenge tonight. And I like his instagram account.

3079~~~
He's quickly becoming one of my favourite players at the club. He's improving each game and I admire how much he gives a shit.

3080~~~
Along with Blind a clear first choice for LvG and merits it, very good again today.

3081~~~
Think he's been one of our better and more consistent players this season. He's an automatic starter when fit, get someone like Hummels etc next to him and he'll look even better.

3082~~~
Really starting to improve with every game. His first few months he seemed to get beaten in the air a lot, and though he is strong physically, it took him a while to adapt to the league (as it takes many players). Been doing really well though lately, and he's still only 24 which is nothing for a center back. Delighted for him to get a goal. Hopefully he can stay fit and form a partnership with someone.

3083~~~
He's done well against Cambridge and was solid at the back for much of the match and good going forward (other than the two horrible crosses at the start of the second half).

One thing that's concerning me about him so far is how he's poor at aggressively marking a player. This is an ability that many modern defenders possess, and the best ones are those who are great at aggressively marking players. Rojo, however, has often created spaces for the opposition because of this, and he's also been beaten often as a result of his aggressive marking. He's improved aerially, and he's shown himself to be a good marker and decent, positionally, but he's still not good enough in aggressively marking the ball holder. He needs to improve in this aspect if he is to not give away chances.

3084~~~
I probably like him more as a fullback than as a CB. He isn't half bad attacking wise(I will ignore those two shit crosses because he has proved he has good cross in him).

3085~~~
Danger of overhype here.

Has made a reasonable start at United but he seems to be forgiven all manner of mistakes due to his attitude.

3086~~~
It's only Cambridge but I thought he was very good again. It was nice to see the fullbacks creating so many problems when they were overlapping and getting balls into the box. He's probably our best defender LB or CB.

3087~~~
The Cambridge game certainly didn't hurt my impression that Smalling-Rojo should be our first choice partnership by some distance.

3088~~~
He's better at CB, although he can play resonably as full back, he's wasted at LB. He explores his full potencial at CB. And like i already said multiple times, he has expressed that he feels more comfortable at CB as it suits him better and his characteristics. 
You have a highly rated player in Luke Shaw for LB but have clear problems in the center of your defence. It's better to have Rojo settle as CB and move him occasionaly to the LB position to cover some absence rather than play him regularly in that position.

3089~~~
Yeah, I know we have Shaw there who I rate very highly, I am just ignoring it and talking about Rojo in general. I am not really fan of Rojo type of defenders, that's why I don't rate him that highly on CB, but I like him on fullback.
I am not sure van Gaal would buy him if he wasn't that good with the ball at his feet, and I hate when central defenders are rated mainly on their on-ball abilities. Saying that, I like Rojo in general, I like his mentality, his determination, few other things too, and considering he is here just for few months he is more than good, but I think he should improve defensively.

3090~~~
Pundits have started calling him "Rokko" He'll always be "Roho" to me.

3091~~~
Agreed.

3092~~~
Nah its like Roger, but with an o. Rojo.

3093~~~
Really don't get that. Where have they picked up this pronunciation? Argentine's actually have a pretty soft form of Spanish. I think they're getting mixed up with the sound the 'o' makes of 'jo' when it precedes it. Its not Rokko. The first 'o' sorta comes out of the throat which makes it sound pretty hard to Englishmen, but the jo is 'ho' not 'ko'. His name should be said 'rOho'.

Back to the subject, Rojo's been immense since returning. At the moment seems to be the best centre-half we have and the most able to play out from the back while being solid. Turning out to be a bit of a bargain.

3094~~~
You're right. If Smalling, Jones or Evans made some of the same mistakes he made they'd get a lot of stick

3095~~~
The J is silent in Spanish. Its Roho. You probably also pronounce the J in Jose Mourinho and Jalapeno don't you? Its not correct sir

3096~~~
They are wrong

3097~~~
It's not silent if you pronounce it. Otherwise it would be Ro-o and ose.

3098~~~
Jose is actually Portuguese, and they pronounce it differently to the Spanish, don't they?

3099~~~
Yes

3100~~~
Yes. That's not the point. If you pronounce either name in either language, non of the letters would be silent. Silent means not pronouncing the letter at all, not pronouncing it differently.

3101~~~
You're being too technical, you get the point yo. Its Roho, its Hose (Jose), its Halapeno peppers. Phonetically the J will sound like an H but its still correct to say its a silent J.

3102~~~
Question now becomes, how does "Roho" become "Rocko"?

3103~~~
What in the name of feck was he doing just then?

3104~~~
he miscontrolled it, but then surely got bundled over first.

3105~~~
I love this guy

3106~~~
Just when he has a couple of games where it looks like he might have improved on the important things, he has a ridiculously poor touch and lack of composure on the half way line. Its so annoying watching Rojo and Jones risking the points for the most minimal of gambles - even if he had managed to take the touch and get past Sakho, whats the point? A couple of yards gained. Instead he should have been getting rid of it first time.

3107~~~
Rojo and De Gea the best United players in the first half. Really liking him.

Little too much of the McNair and Jones style heavy first touch when being closed down.

3108~~~
Our best CB for sure.

3109~~~
Poor control but how the feck was that not a foul on him? Phil Neville then saying it was 2 fouls by Rojo.

3110~~~
Feel sorry for him and Jones because they are being strung out to die in this type of formation. Just letting the west ham players get free runs at them whenever they get the ball back.

LVG needs to take off a striker and throw on another midfielder to shore up our possession. It will take the pressure off our centrebacks.

3111~~~
Thought he had a good half apart from the yellow card incident. Wasn't impressed at first but I'm warming to him.

3112~~~
It was a poor touch but the West Ham guy clearly run straight into him.

3113~~~
Said in the matchday thread but that yellow was hilarious. The best we'll get all season.

Took out two players on a break. Both yellow card offences but would have been harsh to show both.

Apart from that he's been our best defender, if not best player on the park excluding De Gea.

3114~~~
Playing with Jones is like playing on your own.

Poor bastard.

3115~~~
56% passing accuracy from 16 passes in that first half. Only Januzaj had less at 54%

3116~~~
I must be watching a different game. He has given West Ham two runs on goal and his passing has been awful.

3117~~~
Poor today, there's no way you can pair him and Jones, both require a calmer head alongside them.

3118~~~
Yeah, I thought he was a bit reckless today. On a scale of 1 to Jones, I'd say it was about a Three Quarters Jones.

3119~~~
A calmer head doesn't exist in the United defensive ranks, well maybe Blackett but he plays like he is stoned.

3120~~~
He was very good today, considering we had no midfield.

3121~~~
He's so rash at times him - Jones is so unsafe.

3122~~~
I think Smalling and Rojo has looked a decent combination.

3123~~~
Poor touch for that error in the first half, but he was blatantly piledrived into by the opposition striker while Rojo was the one trying to play the ball. If Clattenburg wasn't clinically stupid it would have been our free kick so can't hold it against him too much. Other than that did pretty well against a tough, physical opponent in Sakho.

3124~~~
I agree. Smalling's red at the Eithad was out of character, usually he's pretty controlled and that would suit Rojo more I think.

3125~~~
A disappointing performance I thought, after his decent few anyway. Should have played with Smalling I think because of Smalling's height. Jones was a bit all over the place too.

3126~~~
Not his best game but still the best of the CBs. Coped well with endless long balls to West Hams powerful and fast forwards and was there to cover Jones going walkabout a few times.

His mis-control moment was poor but i like the way he made damn sure if the ball was through one on one there was no way the player was going past him.

Definitely needs a calming influence next to him, but otherwise our best defender.

3127~~~
Apart from the 1 dodgy touch I thought he was solid again. Valencia and Sakho are speedy and full of energy, they are a defenders worst nightmare. He actually handled them really well, and won a fair share of headers too. 

I agree that I am amazed Smalling didn't start too, what he prefers in Jones I have no idea.

3128~~~
He seemed to be playing itching powder in his shorts tonight, disappointing showing from him.

3129~~~
Not that great of a fullback. Whenever he moved towards the middle of defence, he defended well.

3130~~~
Play him at centre half or not at all.

3131~~~
decent cover for left back. Much prefer him at center. I really like him as a player.

3132~~~
We really need him at center back, he's much better there and he's much better than the alternatives. If Shaw is out I'd much rather see Blind at left back and Rojo at center back. Evans was terrible today.

3133~~~
More clearances, more interceptions and more aerial duels won than any other player on the pitch.

Looked like a centre back covering at left back though.

3134~~~
Obviously better at CB, didn't contribute much to our attack at all today. However, he won most of his duels and was very solid defensively, so I think he did quite well again.

3135~~~
He is consistently decent....a great player in the making

3136~~~
Hope that we don't ever see him at left back again as it means Evans will be at centre back. It will be nice to see Shaw back.

3137~~~
I like him... I dislike Evans..

3138~~~
Still remains one of the first names on the teamsheet for me.

An ever-present in an ever-changing defence, and doing very well.

3139~~~
That leaves us without a midfield though. I'd even play Blackett just to keep him in the centre and to keep Evans away

3140~~~
That's true but I think I'd still rather see a midfield of Fellaini and Rooney than Evans at center back, and hopefully Carrick won't be out much longer.

3141~~~
Definitely is a CB I think. Hopefully Shaw can stay fit now because with them both on that left side I am very comfortable when we are defending.

3142~~~
Am I exaggerating this or is he really that good when faced one on one with a forward? Like he seems to stop forwards running at him with ease.

3143~~~
Do not move Smalling - Rojo partnership at any circumstances. They seem to be the one and only solid pair of CBs we have. I trust them and I would rather play Young as Leftback if that means Evans doesn’t play. 
Yeah he seems comfortable in one on one situations.

3144~~~
Really like this fella, he's still a bit clumsy at times but out of all our signings he's come on the most.

3145~~~
This guy's alright

3146~~~
I thought he was poor tonight, him and Smalling both looked like they had Evansitis when the ball came towards them on the deck.

3147~~~
Has Rojo been a big improvement on our other CBs? He's a big improvement on Evans obviously. He can pass and he's added steel at the back (Evans of course is the two footed passer but he's always been physically weak) but he's been on par with Jones and Smalling. Decent season but I expect improvements next season.

3148~~~
I still don't rate him that highly. He seems just as error prone as Smalling and Jones, without the long term potential of either.

3149~~~
Rojo is 24. Jones is 22 and Smalling is 25 so what you say about long term potential is obsolete. They are all at a similar stage in their careers, however with Rojo being a much better player than both - its gives the impression he is more experienced.

3150~~~
And Smalling being a better defender. So it will be interesting.

3151~~~
Debatable!

3152~~~
No, he's not.

3153~~~
Not in my opinion. They do make mistakes, none of the to many, but Smalling has games where he totally dominates, or where he is the only one holding the defense together, while Rojo doesn't. For now, I would say the reason for that is that Rojo is an all round better player, so he tends to go more forward, or to play with more risks, is more adventurous, and that always leaves space behind.

3154~~~
I agree with most of your post but what game has Smalling totally dominted? id like an example of this as i cant recall. Munich away last season he did well, but so did Buttner.

3155~~~
I like him but I don't think he had a particularly good game yesterday, though he wasn't alone.  Preston were pressing forward and it looked like we were tossing around a landmine back there.  Even Blind was not particularly good with it.

3156~~~
Well given Vidic and Evras' first few months were less then convincing i will reserve judgment on him for the time being. I can't really say he's done anything to make me doubt he wont make it with us, he's been solid and slowly learning the english game, probably getting better with every game. Who knows how good he could be for us.

3157~~~
He's not much better than Smalling and Jones. If anything he's at their level. Once the new boy shine wears off people will notice how error prone he is. He's made some mistakes that none of our other CBs would get away with on this forum.

3158~~~
Yeah, I'm not sure about that either. Smalling can have great games but mistakes like the one against Burnley for Ings goal aren't that uncommon for him and he often looks nervy when he plays. No need to pit them againt each other yet though as Smalling along with Rojo is not only our two individually best CBs atm but also a very good partnership, and they are both still young and able to improve.

On Buttner, I wish he'd stayed to be honest, he was showing great improvement and would've fit well as LB option and as LWB when we use that. Rojo reminds me alot of him. Not shedding any tears over it though obviously, luckily Young has been able to and done well to cover for Shaw when he's been out.

3159~~~
Looks like he would be the perfect partner for the World Class CB we buy in the summer

3160~~~
Buttner was showing great improvement and Rojo reminds you of him?? Buttner was exposed regularly as naive positionally and I don't think many mourned his departure. Rojo has been commendably solid in a desperately unsettled defensive landscape this year without looking commanding enough to suggest he's a long-term solution to our problems in there. I agree himself and Smalling look our best bet.

3161~~~
I also think he's treated with more patience due to all the acclimatizing he's going through. Jones and Smalling are english and have been here for 3-4 years with another couple of years of PL experience before that so they won't be excused as much..

3162~~~
Not in playstyle, but as being seemingly really nice, humble guys who couldn't be happier playing for any other club than United and who're always ready to give 110% for the team. I know he wasn't mourned and that I'm part of an extremely small portion of fans who Think so, but I think he could've had a future here as a squad player. As I said though I didn't lose any sleep over it and I think that it was his own decision to leave anyway.

I agree that Rojo will have to improve if he is to keep his position long term but I'm hoping that he'll be able to develop with time as Vidic and Evra did as I really like him and I think that he might have some leadership qualities aswell.

3163~~~
Does he have a brain? So rash and reckless.

3164~~~
He's escaped the wrath this season, people like to pick on Jones, Evans and Smalling but this guy cost 16 million and is on about 200k a week and he's one of the worse defenders I've seen in a United shirt.
No composure, no positional awareness, he never attacks the ball, he never closes anyone down, I don't know if its because he 'looks' like a good player that maybe that somehow obscures people's view of him.
But you see the RVP, Di Maria threads being bumped and people attacking them, what about this guy? at least Di Maria and Rvp have done something at some point this season, this guy has been coasting along all season defending badly and getting injured.
I know there's been some issues with his family back home in Argentina but he lacks the basic things you expect in a centre half. I don't know the statistics but I'd be confident in stating we concede more goals when he plays than when he doesnt.

3165~~~
You cannot play him and Jones together in my view, he was slightly better than Jones today but not very good, at least he got his punts to Fellaini on the mark.

3166~~~
I don't agree with you Leroy for the most parts, he attacks the ball well and never seems to be taken on. Yes his positional awareness needs some work but put him next to a player with leadership in defence and we'll see him blossom. He is also the best passer from defence,

3167~~~
The old 'put a player next to him' thing. Which is a fancy way of saying 'this supposedly good defender can only look good when he's having his hand held by a much better defender'. If that's the case, why did we sign him for 16 million and pay him 200k a week?

Every time a cross came in today he was nowhere to be seen, he always manages to be behind the ball when a cross comes in, he just cannot anticipate things at all. Evans is a better passer than him and it's not that hard to be a better passer than Smalling and Jones.

3168~~~
<a class="username" data-user="45020, @Leroy The Red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/45020/">@Leroy The Red</a> I'm fairly sure Rojo is not on 200k a week.

3169~~~
Yeah but saying he's on 200k a week helps exaggerate his point.

Evans lost his balls some 18 months ago and has forgotten how to pass.

He is probably closer to 200k a month than week.

We need a leader in defence, everyone of our current defenders will benefit from it, it isn't hard to see.

Yes he need to work on his positioning to make it as a defender in the highest class but I'm willing to give him some time.

3171~~~
it was leaked by a cleaner and that is supposedly his weekly wage packet.
You guys are acting as if that's not believable <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this the club that spent 28 million on Marouane Fellaini, that chose to make Wayne Rooney the highest paid player in the country, that chose to pay 18 million for Ashley Young with one year left on his contract.
We've proven that when it comes to stupid wages and stupid transfer fees we are the most retarded club in the world.

3172~~~
He's not very good. Doesn't help that he thinks he's Messi when he has the ball.

3173~~~
Paying 200k a week for Rojo would be criminal. I think 70k a week is more likely. Di Maria is on 150k-ish.

3174~~~
<a class="username" data-user="45020, @Leroy The Red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/45020/">@Leroy The Red</a> you mean 200.000 Yen a week

3175~~~
He cost 20m when you include Nani's wages.

Thank god for you, Leroy. I got called an idiot for saying that he is one of the worst defenders I have seen in a United shirt. A Buttner who cost 5 times more. 

I, wholeheartedly agree with everything in your post. He is a terrible defender and is only played because the manager has this stupid LCB/RCB rule. His much touted passing also doesn't redeem him because he continuously makes stupid and dangerous passes to opposition attackers to put us under pressure. He is as bad a Blackett. Neither of them have any redeeming qualities. Cannot believe that these guys are regulars at Manchester United.

3176~~~
Yeah another one of his idiosyncrasies that could cost us a top 4 spot.

Like Buttner, seems to pay more attention to his tattoos and haircut than his defensive work.

3177~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3178~~~
Meat head. I see nothing other than a lad that gets stuck in. He hasn't got a football brain. Positionally he's clueless and overrated on the ball.

If it was actually possible I'd get rid of him with the other three dross CB's next season. Every single senior CB at this club is shit.

3179~~~
That's why him and Jones shouldn't play together. He's slightly better than Jones, so should start.

3180~~~
He's great on the ball but still too rush and not convincing in defense. King smalling sitting on the bench is baffling when Jones and Rojo play. We could have been much more solid. We are so week in the air without him also.. BUt I am giving Rojo time he can turn into a good player if we give him time. Evra was much worse in his first season..

3181~~~
If he's not good than what does that make our other CBs?

3182~~~
Not left footed.

3183~~~
Smalling is better than him for a start. Comfortably better.

Jones is just about better as well but he thinks he's Ronaldo on the ball so that's another issue. Right now we're playing 2 CB's and both think they are better than they actually are on the ball.

3184~~~
She saw his wage slip and took a picture of it and it did say he was paid £200,000.

The thing is, wages are paid monthly, so that would imply he is on around £50,000 a week.

3185~~~
Utter crap. May be except Smalling.

3186~~~
He's a good defender, it's his first season in the PL and you want him to be Franco Baresi? Give it time ffs!

3187~~~
200k a week. fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3188~~~
200k a week. Sure <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3189~~~
200k a week <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3190~~~
Its mad how such an average player can be on 300k a week.

3191~~~
Reckon we should give McNair a £250k a week contract.

3192~~~
I agree. He has started to show his physical a bit more now. I think he looks very comfortable with Smalling, not so good with Jones. I don't like him at LB, so if he isn't going to play CB, he should be dropped.

For me Jones and Evans have regressed significantly this season. I put that down to the fact, LVG expects the CBs to think when they have the ball, seems to be too much for these two.

Based on who we have at the moment and their performances to date, Rojo would be the first name on the team sheet for a CB position.

3193~~~
Wait, he's on 350k a week? That's absolute madness!

3194~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
That was a mirror article, wasn't it?

3195~~~
200k a week and an extra £50 or so from exclusive image rights is what I heard.

3196~~~
It was quite a deal for Sporting. Sold this guy for 16 million and got a player twice as good for a year free of charge. Has to be the deal of the century? 

I've been a bit ambivalent on Rojo but there's no doubt we overpaid hugely. In a really strong United side, he'd be a bench warmer at best.

3197~~~
I like him, but I can't believe he's on 400k a week. You couldn't make this stuff up.

3198~~~
I don't know why we're paying this guy 500k a week ffs.

3199~~~
I heard his Nike deal was better than Messi's.

3200~~~
£200k per week? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Do you not understand money?

3201~~~
"Overrated on the ball"?? He pulled off a nutmeg in his own half today. That's what £800k per week gets you. He's fecking ace on the ball.

3202~~~
Lad's nutmeged Robben. We're probably not paying him enough at 1m a week.

3203~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at the wage stuff. Not his best game. But he has been alright up until this performance I think so I won't write him off after a bad one. Hopefully picks his level back up quickly though. Having the Smojo partnership back would probably help. He has looked a lot better when playing with Smalling IMO.

3204~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3205~~~
He has got better since he first joined but he always looks like he's got a mistake in him.

3206~~~
You dont seem to need one to be be a first choice CB for LVG. We're looking for athletic, aggressive players who have a few extras on the ball... Also have to be rash and give opponents chances to attack by being careless with the ball

3207~~~
Hardly considering they're severely missing him at the minute.

3208~~~
Rojo 'megs Gomis
<a class="externalLink" href="http://streamable.com/f58g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://streamable.com/f58g</a>

Twat! Liquid football.

3209~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> no Rabona though?

3210~~~
The gif cuts off, but I'm 70% certain he Rabonas it 40 yards out to the right to McNair, which rolls out for a throw in.

3211~~~
well obviously Rojo's fault then, McNair tries everything to make him look bad.

3212~~~
Bit kneejerk here today innit? He did not have a good game and should work on his positioning and rash challenges, but I still think he can come good.

3213~~~
That is just how this place works really.

3214~~~
Stupid missed passes yesterday, really has to cut that out. But otherwise he had Gomis in his pocket for most of the game.

3215~~~
To earn Marcos Rojo's weekly salary, it would take you 619 years.

Marcos Rojo earns your annual salary every 0.4 seconds and wipes his ass with it.

3216~~~
Yesterday was his first dodgy game in a good while. The nonsense on the previous page isn't really justified. 

He looks better with Smalling, though.

3217~~~
Compared to his colleagues Rojo had a pretty decent game. There were moments but he kept the score from being worse. He kept his head as just about the everyone had gone to sleep 15 minutes before the end. Rojo is coming good as he adjust to the PL, he finds space and doesn't commit early.

3218~~~
My theory is that Rojo would be absolutely shat on if not for a couple of reasons; (a) he's a new signing, so avoids the grievance that others have towards Evans/Jones/Smalling where the fact that they haven't progressed from being very highly rated youngsters is held against them, (b) he's got a Latin name and is covered in tattoos so people think he's some sort of ball-playing, composed defender that is in vogue.

He gets a lot of praise from some elements, but I don't think he's very good at all. 

My main gripe is that he's not imposing enough at all. He's 6 feet nothing, average build and doesn't attack the ball in the air. Smalling and Evans are taller, whilst Jones is built like a tank and is more aggressive in the tackle. Kevin Davies constantly kept manipulating him and kept the ball well away from him, and he couldn't handle him (see build up to their first goal). When the ball is dropped on top of him from deep he very rarely gets a big header away. Then there's the positional mistakes, silly tackles and suicidal passes out of defence. He's also rash too, I'm thinking of how he managed to dislocate his shoulder in a slide tackle.

He's not crap, but I'd honestly rather Smalling/Jones at the back. Rojo should be CB/LB cover at most for us. He reminds me of Silvestre, but two inches shorter, with less pace, and without the crossfield passing.

3219~~~
He doesn't have the physical gifts of Smalling but I think he has handled himself fairly well. I think in the QPR game in particular he played Zamora brilliantly.

3220~~~
Really agree with you. For example Gabriel Heinze wasn't tall or robust but he was damn agressive. Rojo is nothing like that. He will be destroyed by Drogba at his peak (when Vidic was monstruous too).

At United we have a benchmark in modern years of CB in Pallister-Bruce and Rio-Vidic.... 

Rojo is just not good enough and is just slightly better (for the moment) than Smalling/Jones/Evans. We need something better than that. 

I think that Gomis outplayed him too many times this weekend, and he never gives us the confidence we need at the back

3221~~~
The only reason he is here is because he is left-footed. Not good enough for a club which wants to be at the top of the English premier league

3222~~~
Its not surprising, some people wait ages for a player to have a bad game to then unload on them and go OTT.

3223~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He is a 24 year old centre back playing his first year in the premier league, and so far has done very well IMO.

 I wonder what the opinion of Vidic was after his first year?.

3224~~~
Vidic was shit mate. Knew he would be after 6 weeks, he didn't adapt quickly enough. Same goes for that Evra lad. Waste of money, both of them.

3225~~~
People keep repeating this kind of stuff over and over again. You made your mind didnt you. 

it seems some people bash him just cause he's not well known or some big name CB everyone wants. They dont care if he is playing good or not.

3226~~~
The extremes to which opinion on him varies is indicative of our season as a whole. I think for a first season in a new league and country he has done pretty well the majority of the time, and will only improve when we get a more experienced partner next to him.

3227~~~
I mean, first season in a new league, new country, can't speak the language, in a team that by LvG's admission lacks balance, without a stable back four for most of the season, going through a transition period after a disaster of a season under Moyes. But yeah he's shit, and will never come good despite him putting some impressive performances and probably being our most consistent CB. I don't get people on this forum at times. He's done well so far all things considered and I love his attitude on the pitch.

3228~~~
I don't like seeing him paired with Jones in the center of our defense.

3229~~~
I dont get some people on this forum too and recently it has been beyond crazy here. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3230~~~
In your opinion he has done well. I don't think he would be playing for us if he wasn't left-footed based on his performances so far. His decision making is not good enough, too rash. Also his situation is nothing like Vidic's, who was scouted for a long time and came to us and started performing well soon enough. But then again I don't really like the Vidic/Terry type of defender and Rojo is in that mould. So there is that.



That is a baseless accusation. I just don't think he is good enough based on his performances so far. He is not getting as much scrutiny because he is new, and his flaws are getting swept over. I don't think he will be a starter for us very long, especially if Van Gaal ieaves

3231~~~
I don't like seeing Jones paired with anyone to be honest. Should be Smalling and Rojo for the rest of the season, but LVG clearly favors Jones for some reason.

3232~~~
How is he in the Vidic/Terry mould?

3233~~~
He isnt in a Terry/Vidic type of defender at all. 

You dont think he would play if he wasnt left footed. Who would then play, Jones and Smalling?

3234~~~
Rojo is our best centre back. Between him and Shaw, the left hand side of the back four is strong. We just need to work on the right hand side.

3235~~~
Yes, Rojo looks the better of the two at this time. What I meant is that they both seem the type of defenders who need to play alongside a commanding CB, they are players that play with the heart, not with the head, if you know what I mean.

Maybe Rojo just needs time to adapt and learn the language and he can actually be a cool head in the back, but for now I think it might be better if we played only one of them alongside a more composed CB.

3236~~~
Playing Rojo with Jones is utter lunacy. I couldn't think of a worse defensive pairing if I tried. They both have the exact same strengths, and weaknesses.

Rojo has steadily improved this season, and started to look rather good, but he looks considerably worse with Jones (and vice versa)

3237~~~
solid defensively but so poor going forward, would rather see winger Young there than center back. Shaw should be the first option tho..

3238~~~
Probably our best signing this season

3239~~~
Love him! At least one Argentinian who has settled in!

3240~~~
Very solid today.

3241~~~
I like his passion, looks proper happy to be here unlike some other Argentine.

3242~~~
Probably his second best game in the LB role for us, passed it well and didn't give any joy down his flank.

3243~~~
Good game but it's obvious he prefers to play as a CB mixing it up with the opposition strikers.

3244~~~
Genuinely think he's going to be a class defender. Its understandable that defenders need time to adjust to the physicality of the league but he's shown plenty of quality so far. His versatility is quite helpful as well, as he can be very decent at left back when we need him to be.

3245~~~
I agree, and what impresses me most about him is that he always appears fully committed to the cause...he seems to have a genuine passion for the club despite only being here a short while. I think longterm he can go on to be not only a top player, but a great servant to the club that the fans will really grow to love and appreciate.

3246~~~
Yeah, he's shown that he's not your typical reckless South American defender. He's shown good composure and awareness in his defending, and he's grown into the physicality and tenacity of the English game. Defensively, he's reliable and solid, and with his versatility, he can go forward and put in some decent deliveries from the left.

I don't think he'll become our first-choice left back as he's a more natural defender than attacking player, but he does look to be our main left central defender for a long while.

3247~~~
Pretty pointless but thought it was pretty funny. Love the guy, so passionate <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3248~~~
Nice to see a player reflect how we feel when we watch the game.

3249~~~
You think he can still improve massively?  He turns 25 this month which is still fairly young but I think he is like Heinze, he will always be passionate and rash and have his dodgy moments.

3250~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I guess his wife and kid wisely get out of the house when the football is on.

3251~~~
I think under LVG he can. Perhaps a good balance of his passion and LVG's love of discipline?

3252~~~
I thought LvG in the past was widely regarded to not really care about defenders tbh.

I do think Rojo could become quality but i do worry that we essentially have 4 CBs who require a more disciplined leader next to them. Would hate to see his career/reputation suffer because he has to play next to a different subpar defender every week.

3253~~~
Huh?

3254~~~
I think with a top class CB alongside him he will look alot better. He has had quite a few CB partners and this cannot be helping his development.
I always thought he do well playing with Godin.

3255~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7QPZtLpVKM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
He's clearly passionate about his football team, Estudiantes. Unsure about his choice of attire though...

3256~~~
We signed Vidic at the same age. Safe to say he made vast improvements in the following years.

3257~~~
How old were the likes of Vidic and Evra when we signed them ? He will definitely improve, especially as suggested above, he's paired with a quality CB partner like Godin.

3258~~~
Been our best defender this season. I didn't instantly take to him, but I believe he's gradually improved as the season has progressed. One of the first names on the team sheet, for me.

3259~~~
Same goes with Smalling, who currently looks better

3260~~~
And that's him when he's happy <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> you can imagine how angry he would seem when we lose! Great to have that type of passion in the team though, he seems a winner to me.

3261~~~
Why is he wearing a Barca shirt?

3262~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Our mad bastard.

3263~~~
Because he's South American and a good chance he probably supports them.


Our best defender. I love Rojo.

3264~~~
I think we can be happy that we got him in the end. He is certainly one of our best buys so far. I think the likes of Herrera and Shaw will justify their price-tag at some stage as well. Shaw is already a decent left back for us and sound defensively, he just need to improve going forward which he certainly will.

3265~~~
so what he is wearing a barca kit, hardly a rival. love his passion!

3266~~~
Rojo and blind are our two most important buys this season IMO.

3267~~~
He's a maniac, good player to have in the squad but I cannot see him as the bedrock of the enxt United title contesting side.

3268~~~
I actually think his last two good performances have been at LB, he was better there tonight than at CB.

3269~~~
I think it's because he's actually direct, Shaw would be good if he could actually stay fit, but that looks an impossibility.  Not surprising though, considering his age. Anyway, he is by far and away our best CB and LB at the moment. That's so depressing.

3270~~~
I'm not entirely sure if he's any good at actually tackling...

3271~~~
far better than Smalling or Jones.

Jones should never of came on, we should just shifted Blind to left back.

3272~~~
He looks another substandard defender to me. I don't think that he is great on ball either, as was claimed at time of purchase.

3273~~~
He's crap.

3274~~~
What does crap mean to you? You seem to think everyone is crap.

3275~~~
Still not sure what to make of him other than he is performing better than Jones

3276~~~
he is very good

3277~~~
Not really an achievement that.

I admire Marcos' passion and seeming desire to play for this club but I am yet to be convinced he is a central defender (or left back) to take this club forward. That said I'd keep him around as backup whilst selling both Smalling and Jones.

3278~~~
I think he's decent by virtue of looking a lot less shit then the rest of our centre-backs... I also think this is a false barometer on which anyone should be judged. As I said, I'm not actually sure what he's good at... (it's definitely not heading) it's probably something, but I've just not seen it... yet.

3279~~~
Should be competing with Shaw for the LB spot and we should sign 2 new CB's.

3280~~~
Everyone? Nope. Rojo is crap though. Rash, poor positioning, think he's good on the ball except he's not. It's a toss up between him and Jones as to who's the more clueless defender. Rojo might just win that battle.

3281~~~
His rashness is frustrating. Needs to calm down as he seems to commit himself to tackles that don't need to be made. Maybe he is better than our other CBs but it's minimal imo. None of them are really any good.

3282~~~
I think it would do wonders for Rojo if he had a calmer head next to him. He has the makings of a modern top class defender and his rashness is something that can be coached out. Certainly our best CB anyway and the only one likely to make it here imo.

3283~~~
One of the only defenders we have who does his job without any fuss. Nothing to see here.

3284~~~
He is by far our best defender (which might not mean much), but I am much more confident with him than the others including Smalling who is decent, but very overrated here.

3285~~~
His positioning isn't poor.

3286~~~
Get a proper partner for him in defence. Enough of this smalling,jones nonsense.

3287~~~
Awful then. Take your pick.

3288~~~
That play he made just before half-time against two Arsenal players was absolutely magnificent.. Once he learns the language and gets more familiar with the forwards in the Premier League, he's gonna be a hell of a player.

3289~~~
He's not going to be the world's best defender but he's got guts and determination and that in itself is a joy to watch in a season full of indifference. Watching him send Santi Cazorla up in the air last night was sadly one of the highlights of the season for me. Terrible tackle but occasionally great to see.

3290~~~
Indeed. I wonder if he'll be in the side if we buy new defenders. Rojo + one calm leader type would work, I think.

3291~~~
That tackle was classic Rojo. When i saw it on the highlights i had flashbacks of the times he did it on our stadium. I was petrified everytime i saw him do his typical two footed lunges.
Tbf i really miss him. Our defence is shambles currently. He was the boss here and from what i´ve seen in United games he is the least of your defensive worries. I mean Smalling and Valência were abysmal yesterday.

3292~~~
It's good. He's seldom found all over the pitch in the way you find Jones. Positionally, the rest of our centre halves are quite solid. They tend to lack elsewhere, noticeably heading, decision making and conviction, the latter of which can stem from a lack of confidence.

Rojo defends well most weeks. When he steps up for an interception he usually gets it right. He has the odd rash moment but that's a part of his game he's clearly trying to keep in check.

3293~~~
Yeah, I enjoyed the challenge, I'll be honest. Shame it didn't put the lad off the pitch, as harsh as that sounds.

3294~~~
I'd rather he takes the ball with that much power instead of the player but maybe that's just me.

3295~~~
Think he's still adjusting to the pace of the league, I keep forgetting he is also just 24 so there is still an air of rashness in him.

3296~~~
He's by far our best CB and best left back. And he's not that great. Which tells you everything you need to know about our defense.

3297~~~
Yeah, he's been good for a while now. Looks like a decent bit of business.

3298~~~
My biggest concern with him positionally is on balls over the top, he seems to struggle to read the flight.

3299~~~
When Phil Jones is the calmer head in a CB pairing it's a little troubling. Nice on the ball as usual and a good athlete but that rash streak makes me antsy.

3300~~~
I think he was pretty good today.

Very assured in posession too.

3301~~~
Another really solid performance from him. His passing was superb again today. Lot's of nice cross-field balls.

3302~~~
I thought he was excellent today, apart from that cheap foul given away to Weimann

3303~~~
Jones was getting caught up the pitch way too much and Rojo bailed him out numerous times. Don't let that one tackle late on get in the way of that.

3304~~~
He lost Benteke on the corner for the goal and gave Villa their second best chance with that stupid free kick. People seem to see what they want to see.

3305~~~
Very solid game from him, there was a moment I liked where Villa lumped up the ball and it was two Villa strikers charging against Rojo. Rojo just sweeped away the ball from Benteke (?) with ease.

3306~~~
He also made a fantastic last ditch tackle against agbonlahor when he was 2v1
With benteke alongside. Jones had gone walk about and left him stranded. If he mistimed that it was a red. So yeah people can see what they want to see.

3307~~~
Phil Jones isn't allowed to make a misplaced pass without getting slated. If he had done what Rojo had today the Phil Jones thread would be at the top of the page.

3308~~~
He was excellent I thought. 

I must the one of the few that isn't convinced by the Jones Smalling partnership, so I don't mind Smalling coming back and replacing Jones for next week

3309~~~
Was rubbish on the ball today I thought... Not assured in his passing at all.

3310~~~
Thought he was quite decent today, obviously a bit rusty in terms of his touch and movement but it'll come with match sharpness. He will be a quality player for us in the longer term IMO. Acclimatizing to the frantic pace and odd angles of the Premier League can be daunting for an import, especially from a considerably weaker Primeira Liga.

Plus he didn't have a good off-season to recuperate from the World Cup strain, played in a few matches for Sporting, had to face the buyout and visa shenanigans, has gotten injured a couple of times, and never consistently played in a settled backline. Not the ideal circumstances for a new addition unaccustomed to language in an area of the pitch where more than any other position, communication and trust is paramount. Given more time, he'll be alright.

3311~~~
Great shot, it was a bullet. 

Can't defend for toffee. Terrible defender.

3312~~~
Seems to be very hit and miss on the Caf!

3313~~~
One day in an important match, we're gonna need a goal and will be in dire need of some inspiration, and he's gonna shoot and it's gonna fly into the top corner.

One day.

3314~~~
I generally prefer Rojo as the one next to Smalling, but today Rojo and Jones were much for muchness. Both fairly good, but with the occasional mistake.

3315~~~
He can't defend.

Genuinely bemused as why after every Phil Jones game, his thread gets bumped about him being rash while Rojo seems to get away with his moments of utter buffoonery.

3316~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well as "fideo" means "noodle" in Spanish, he has just decided that it must be "fide" in English instead of "noodle"

3317~~~
it was a back pass. spanish dave was the one that needed to stop it. he is a rash defender , he and phil need to get sorted.

3318~~~
It was two mistakes. Firstly Rojo lost his man who got a shot at goal and then De Gea. The power of the shot is irrelevant to Rojo's mistake.

3319~~~
no it's not. it rolled under him, not into a corner like a well placed pass. . not hit clean at all. dave got caught flat footed. and TBH phil was marking no one at all.

3320~~~
Thought opinions would be a bit more positive as we didn't really miss Smalling today with both Jones and Rojo putting on decent performances. Considering how weak we've looked in Defense over the season it's nice to see our cbs all performing well. 

He wasn't flawless today but he wasn't bad. The collective needs to take responsibility for the situations quoted. No one went over to cover the space behind Rojo when he moved over to the left which lead to the challenge on Weimann, and the corner shouldn't have made it to Benteke. That's my opinion anyway.

3321~~~
Thought he was fine today. Don't think he was helped by Jones at times, not that Jones did poorly but I don't think the understanding was quite was it has been. In saying that, it was good enough and they got the job done.

3322~~~
I thought he was fine. I actually thought Jones was alright too. Maybe I need to re-watch and re-assess how they did though.

3323~~~
He was fine again!

Btw what would happen to him if we get Hummels? Would he lose his starting place (assuming Blind would be available as LB)?

3324~~~
I'm still not convinced, one minute he looks great, then the next he's all over the shop. I can see him being a great squad player for us over the next few years, rather then a genuine first XI player. 

He's very rash, but in a completely different way to Jones.

3325~~~

3326~~~
What a load of shite <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The most ridiculous thing here is the claim that Rojo is on £200k a week. Do journos even try any more?

3327~~~
What a load of nonsense. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3328~~~
Did we get him for just 9m euros? + nani on loan.. but still 9m is a pretty good price .

3329~~~
It was £16m + Nani on loan for free (£5m worth of wages). And then £100bn per week in wages.

3330~~~
What is the tweet in the first post then?

edit: nevermind. Just scrolled down
Pursuant to the fulfillment of obligation which arises from the provisions of Article 248, no1 al. a) of the Securities Code, A SPORTING CLUB DE PORTUGAL, SOCCER, tells SAD to reach agreement with Manchester United Football Club Limited for the acquisition outright of sports rights and 100% of the economic rights of the player Marcos Rojo for the total amount € 20,000,000.00 (twenty million euros), payable in three installments: € 10,000,000.00 paid immediately and two installments of € 5,000,000.00 each, paid on 1 December 2014 and July 1, 2015.

3331~~~
read it in the morning, stopped at 200.000/week.

3332~~~
What a load of rubbish. I want my 5 mins back!

3333~~~
You must be watching a different CB than I am. Rojo has been excellent since he arrived all things considered and I think he'll be our best CB by a distance in the next few years.

3334~~~
People keep repeating he's rash despite the fact he hasnt been rash for a while. But same old 'not convinced, he's rash' posts. 
He's been very good for a while now and that's the only truth.

3335~~~
His last two games of note were yesterday and arsenal (correct me if I'm wrong). Yesterday, he lost Benteke for his goal but was generally OK. In the other game, he should've have given away a penalty for pulling back Welbeck and also made a borderline red card tackle coming through the back of a player.

I can't see how he's been excellent where especially in big games, he's made big mistakes which he's gotten away with.

3336~~~
Dont remember those. 
Didnt say he has been excellent, he has been very good.

You mentioned one big game and then said he made big mistakes in big games.

3337~~~

@ 3.30 for the penalty incident. It doesn't show the replay where you can see Rojo has hold of his collar. It's his positional mistakes in the first place and could easily have given away a penalty. He also got a yellow card, where he absolutely scythed down Santi from behind on the edge of their area. Can't find the video but anyone who remembers will call it a very rash tackle. Sort of an orange card.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dM_4Sil3BM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

@ 2.05. Here's Rojo getting away with a stone wall penalty and red card vs City. Very similar mistake of losing his man with the ball over the top.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/smalling1es8t.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/smalling1es8t.gif"/> 

Made this mistake against Chelsea too, which Smalling bailed him out with.

These are the ones which stick in my mind, and that I'm thinking of

3338~~~
Maybe she can tell me how the feck I pronounce his name this week...

3339~~~
You actually read it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I read the title and closed the link.

3340~~~
Cant see anything from that Arsenal replay. 

Chelsea game, ok he made a mistake. 

As for City, it was still early days and you could argue he was on the ball first.

3341~~~
The ball should have never arrived at Benteke but I agree he should be closer. Vs Arsenal it was never a penalty on Welbeck who went down far too easy and it's never a red on Santi.

As for the goal vs City that's when United where down to 10 men thanks to Smalling. You could make a much longer list of mistakes this season made by Smalling/Jones than Rojo. It's not only Rojo's job to be tracking midfield runners especially when a man short. 

As I said in my post all things considered he's been excellent. New team/country/language been forced to play in a variety of positions with a number of different partners. He's quick/strong/good on the ball/ in the air and very good in the physical battles he has to face week in week out. I can see us being the best defensive side in the premier league next season.

3342~~~
I did indeed <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> I kept reading in the hope there might be something slightly interesting anywhere in that piece, but I should have known better ...

3343~~~
The Welbeck one we'd be livid if wasn't given for us. Very similar to the Rooney one yesterday. But he did struggle against Welbeck running in behind him, a couple of times he lost him on the spin, and it was purely luck there.

I'm not saying Smalling hasn't made any mistakes too, but I would say people turn a blind eye to what Rojo does. He was all at sea in that City game - if you remember how he injured himself too, it was leaving his man to run out wildly and miss a slide tackle. We looked better with Carrick and McNair in there, although McNair did make a mistake on the goal. In any case, Smalling has comfortably been better than Rojo this season (IMO, and that extends to our other CBs not a knock on Rojo)

I still struggle to understand how you can say he's been excellent though. Strong? I think he's a bit lightweight and not very dominant. Doesn't win stuff in the air with any authority. He got muscled around by Benteke yesterday (him and Jones). Kevin Davies also caused him problems with his strength. He's been OK on the ball. Very rash when he goes to ground and doesn't have much composure (which may be language barrier related when it comes to shouts from the rest of the team in his defence).

There are lots of mitigating circumstances, clearly our defence isn't easy to play in with the chopping and changing, but I haven't seen anything special in him. Let's not forget he was second choice to Vermaelen coming in too. I'm not convinced LvG bought him to be first choice in a back four. Maybe a LCB who could cover LB/LWB in the 352, but a back four is different.

3344~~~
Rojo is incredibly aggressive for a CB and I have yet to ever see him be pushed about by anyone. His passing accuracy is excellent and he's very capable of bringing the ball forward into midfield as we saw yesterday with his attempt on goal. You call him rash but to be honest all the of the best  ball playing CB's in the world get called that from time to time, Ramos/Pique/Koscielny etc all have plenty of red cards to their name and have given away plenty of penalties, it's the nature of the role. If you want a front foot defender it's part of the deal, I'd rather have him than an 18 yard box CB like Terry/Cahill who can only ever make blocks and clearances. Aggression is a great quality in a CB and his qualities are exactly what we need to build on and become an elite team in europe again.

3345~~~
Very well put, and i agree

The trade off for having an aggressive ball winning CB is that they do make costly mistakes at times and they do take chances that can be perceived as "rash". That being said, i think Jones and Smalling have been very good of late and i don't think none of them are nailed to a CB pot just yet

3346~~~
I like his ability on the ball and his shooting/passing but he needs to be more solid as defender first, we don't need David Luiz. I often don't know what to think about him as he always has a good game and then makes one or two mistakes, he's like Jones little bit of rashness and insecurity is there but hopefully he can cut it out from his game.

Considering it's his first season I think he's been decent for a newcomer and he also looks like he likes it at United and fights for the badge which is always a good sign

3347~~~
What a shot from him yesterday!

Looking forward to his second season, hopefully besides Hummels!

3348~~~
Exactly. People talking about his rashness make it seem like he's Ginter or David Luiz. He's been more composed than many make him out to be, but of course, we cannot deny that he still has some aggression in his game. Just look at the foul he conceded against Weimann that led to the Okore header in the second half. He still has his moments where he pushes up at a ball holder and loses them somewhat easily, but in general, he's been a much more composed defender than he ever was. van Gaal has definitely helped Rojo read the game better and make up for his physical limitations (he's still weak in the air and struggles against big, strong players).

Well said. I will also add on that aggression in itself is a very risky, and often dangerous, quality in a central defender. However, if a central defender can control that aggression, that defender can be very tough to play against. Very few defenders have reached that level nowadays, though, and it will be difficult for Rojo to reach that level. However, I'm sure that, under van Gaal, he can at least come close enough to that level that the likes of Boateng, Thiago Silva, and Hummels (before he got worse) as he's shown some good defensive nous during his Sporting days.

3349~~~
Interesting bit of man management that LvG brought him on, you rarely see a defender switch just to give minutes to a player.

3350~~~
Was waiting for something to happen between him and Aguero.

3351~~~
Sure it wasn't for a Jones niggle?

3352~~~
He didn't seem to be carrying a knock and LvG said he'd made a mistake trying to get all his players minutes as it left us short when Carrick had to go off.

3353~~~
Do they dislike each other?

3354~~~
They've had beef in the past.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.givemesport.com/518252-sergio-aguero-embroiled-in-bitter-feud-with-marcos-rojo" target="_blank">http://www.givemesport.com/518252-sergio-aguero-embroiled-in-bitter-feud-with-marcos-rojo</a>

3355~~~
Yeah a bit pointless for me as well. I can see why Fellaini and Mata were taken off - to let the crowd show their appreciation but we could have done with that extra sub!

3356~~~

3357~~~
Great stuff.

3358~~~
I love these guys. In terms of characters, we've got an immense group together at the moment.

3359~~~
Do we also discuss his performances with female fitness instructors in here?

3360~~~
Video analysis only.

3361~~~
Rooney might not have been involved much, but his movement kept them occupied and his 35 touches were all important to the overall performance.

3362~~~
The fitness instructor? Rooney's movement helped Rojo's performance.

Excellent, what a captain and a man!

3363~~~
What a joy to watch. Full credit to LvG, coaches, captain Wayne as well as each and every player for making us a fantastic and truly United team. One of the few things that no money can buy. Awesome!

3364~~~
What has happened to him? Is he injured? Haven´t been following football in the last month and this thread hasn´t been bumped so i guess he isn´t featuring much

3365~~~
He's injured, it's ankle problem I think.

3366~~~
Thanks mate. Never got that type of injury at Sporting, just problems with the shoulder. Surprised he has been missing so many games. Wasn´t really injury prone at Sporting.

3367~~~
He's been injured as often as Phil Jones this year, and off to the copa crappola or whatever its called this summer,
another along with Shaw that you'd hope could actually stay fit for more than a few games running next year.

3368~~~

<a class="externalLink" href="https://instagram.com/p/2jkxjboHkG/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://instagram.com/p/2jkxjboHkG/</a>

Back in training it seems.

3369~~~
Shame about the injury problems but overall an okay first season for him in my opinion. Looking forward to see if he will kick on next year.

3370~~~
That kind of positive injury record was never going to be tolerated at United.

3371~~~
He's been pretty good in some games and pretty dodgy in others. In his good games he looked awfully composed and solid. Other games, not so sure. I do think the best is yet to come from him.

3372~~~
Sounds like his first season at Sporting. His second was very good. I do agree with you, i think he will be better next year after being settled to a new country and more demanding league/club.

3373~~~
The game he hurt the ankle in was where he tried to play through it I think, so that might have prolonged things, he's back in training but lacking "match rhythm" as LvG likes to call it. At this point I imagine we'll keep him out until the end of the season as he's going to the Copa America.

3374~~~
I thought the injury which was keeping him out was fractured ribs.<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Or was that Ander?

3375~~~
They seem happier about cones on the training ground than Scholes used to be about trees.

3376~~~
That's Rafael isn't it? Got a knee in the ribs in a u21 match. Herrera had a rib injury earlier in the season which was the start of him being out for a long time.

3377~~~
Didn't Rafael fracture his face? I'm so confused, too many injuries this season.

3378~~~
Rafael fractured his cheek, recovered and made minutes for the u21 again where he got a knee in the ribs and fractured those. He's out for the season.
Ander Herrera played 1 match with a corset this season, that was when he had a rib injury. He didn't do too well and got dropped for a long time after that.
Rojo has an ankle problem from the last time he played, guess he hasn't recovered yet or van Gaal is extra carefull with him.

3379~~~
Had a couple of those brainfart moments again but he's certainly an aggressive competitor.

3380~~~
I thought he did well tbh.

3381~~~
Not convincing at left back. Just doesn't have the technique or passing ability to play there regularly for us. Blind would be a better option except that we have no midfielders that can play a holding role.

3382~~~
Our weakpoint today

3383~~~
*cough* Blackett

3384~~~
Had less problems. Says it all. Why do you think LVG took him off after he almost let Walcott through to score?

3385~~~
I'm at a loss as to why he was taken off, lack of match rhythm perhaps?

3386~~~
Yeah, just got back from injury I suppose.

3387~~~
Yeah, that's what Van Gaal said after the game.

3388~~~
Didn't Blackett and Walcott come on at the same time?

3389~~~
I thought he was our worst player for a lot of the game. He did some good things before he got subbed off though. I thought he struggling a little bit physically as the match went on but a lot of other people seem to think he was fine so I am not sure.

3390~~~
really bad passing especially in the first half when the rest of the team was playing well. Think he had to be taken off as he wasn't 100% match fit and we needed fresh legs to deal with the fresh legs of Walcott.

3391~~~
I was just happy they didn't start Walcott. We would have been in trouble.

3392~~~
Can't understand why people would complain about him, especially given that he's not a left back. Played well imo, 4 interceptions, 5 tackles (1 failed), 77% passing rate's not that bad too, overallped Young whenever it was needed and positioned himself well. Not to mention that he bailed us out in the second half when David got off the line too early and got lobbed by Giroud I think and Rojo cleared it from going in and some minutes earlier he did this last ditch tackle when our CBs were sleeping and I think Cazorla was going 1v1 with DDG.

3393~~~
I thought he was ok. Very aggressive on Ramsey. 

Think he will improve next year.

3394~~~
I've great time for him, he gets stuck in and rattles who ever is near him from time to time and it's no harm to have a bit of that going on at the back either. He was doing alright yesterday too prior to being subbed. Overall he's had a very good debut season for us and now that he has that out of the way I'd expect him to be a lot more savvy when it comes to PL football and we should see a better player next season.

3395~~~
He isn't a left back. It's the same as judging Jones or Smalling when played out there.

Thought he did fine. Not 100% fit though.

3396~~~
Lost a bit of pace, or maybe not 100%. Previous remember him being quite rapid, but seemed to be treading through mud at times today.

3397~~~
Woefully caught out of position a fair amount of times yesterday - our weak link I'm afraid.

3398~~~
He was terrible. He's been terrible every time he's played at LB, as far as I can remember. Offers nothing going forwards and constantly out of position defensively. He's brave, quick and strong in the tackle but he blatantly isn't a fullback.

3399~~~
I really like Rojo for some reason, he's not the most refined CB but I think he will do well for us in the pong long term. He did well when he played a few games in a row, but like the rest of our defenders his season has been interrupted by injuries.

3400~~~
having 10 men (playing without a striker all match) and him at lb which he's not - not a fair shout. and then to top it off blackfriars came on.

3401~~~
He seemed really slow yesterday? Certainly in the second half. Maybe he still has an injury lingering but he looked like he couldn't run properly.

3402~~~
I'm still not entirely sure what his strengths are.

3403~~~
Yeah, he was carrying an injury. If we had any better options I doubt he'd have started.

3404~~~
He's not very good. Hasn't been for most of the season.

3405~~~
I don't get the complaints here. When playing CB, he has been quite good .... especially when next to Smalling. Yes, he isn't an ideal LB, but that save off the line yesterday was crucial.

3406~~~
Its the fact his name isnt flashy enough. Some have made an opinion about him in the beginning of the season and are stuck with it.

I think he had a good debut season.

3407~~~
Too early to judge him yet, he's one that has potential to really kick on with a season here under his belt. Interested to see how he'll do next year.

Also I assume he'll be heading to the Copa America in the summer? Normally wouldn't be a desirable thing but he's not played much recently so will be good for him to get the games. Plus he'll get to train with Messi.

3408~~~
One game left and I'm still unsure about Rojo, not a good LB and not that good at CB either. I can still why some Sporting fans were surprised by our interest in him.

3409~~~
He looked a bit overweight last night when I watched.  Hope he kicks on next year.

3410~~~
He's been ok. I'm definitely fine with him as a backup already, and I have a gut feeling he will improved quite a bit. Still we definitely need a new CB

3411~~~
VG was planning to bring him in for LCB position with 3 at the back it's is best position IMO but we changed to 4 at the back and I'm not convinced with him at CB yet, but he has some time to improve, he's like Jones type of player they can rotate with Smalling who doesn't need to change his game because of this..

Rojo's definitely not left back his attacking play really sucks.. we will see I'm not writing him off just yet..

3412~~~
I wasn't sold on him at the start of the season and not 100% on him now, but he really has improved.

3413~~~
Surprising really, his name is "Red" so what more could they ask for?

3414~~~
No, he fractured his heart when he seen Valencia was now the regular RB.

3415~~~
He's sloppy on the ball and can work on his positioning but I think the key attributes are there.  He can cover ground quickly, is good in 1 v 1, and does well to support the CBs when on the left.  He's handled the transition to PL well IMO and I look forward to seeing him improve.

3416~~~
I mean he wasnt so well known.

3417~~~
His debut was at leftback and he did fine, and from what I saw defensively we went to shit when Blackett replaced him.

3418~~~
That was against QPR though, wasn't it? Who were absolutely dreadful at that stage.

3419~~~
I'd really like to think he's not an LB, 'cos he was truly awful yesterday. I did not have any complaints about his performances at CB earlier this season though.

3420~~~
How does any of that explain him being too lax on the ball and losing it? Or not playing offside correctly? All things he does at CB too

3421~~~
Rojo at left back is a different player to Rojo at central defence. At left back, he's more aggressive and careless in his defending. Whilst we still see some sloppiness in his game, he's more composed and defensively aware when playing in the middle than on the left. I would certainly say that he's better off as a central defender where he shows the promise to become a great defender, but he should never go to left back unless we have no other options, even from the U-21 roster.

3422~~~
I like him and think he has been good. He's young and will certainly improve.

3423~~~
Well Rojo let Walcott step on the field, right ?

3424~~~
Hard to believe it's not Buttner, Rojo is as shite though...

3425~~~
LB he is poor. CB I believe he is better than Jones and should partner Smalling if nobody better is brought in.

3426~~~
you original post was something like "worst player on the pitch" - i think the strikers were shit on a stick. and no lb and cb are not the same position and he's just back from injury and blackett was dire. so no rojo was not the worst player on the pitch for united v le arse.

3427~~~
I said he was our weakest link today, which he was. Normally its Valencia on the other side

Blackett was brought on for a reason

3428~~~
I thought he was better today, especially on the ball.

3429~~~
I don't rate him at all. He's pretty much a slightly worse Phil Jones, but at least Phil fills our home grown quota.

Waste of money.

3430~~~
I like him at cb, its difficult to make individual opinions based on this season, because EVERYONE bar De Gea, smalling and carrick(make a case for young and fellaini but bleh) has been dire if were honest.

Moving forward with Smalling + New signing (otamendi/hummels) + jones + rojo would be pretty decent i reckon, its just important we get a decent midfield to protect the back 4 more.

3431~~~
All he'll be is a decent backup at CB.

3432~~~
I think that Young is better at left back than him. I'm not impressed with him at all really. He resorts to lazy punts upfield too readily for me too.

3433~~~
He's only just 25 and just finished his first season in England after a difficult transfer. Although he hasn't exactly shone, he was £16m and is a decent squad player. That's what £16m buys us these days.

3434~~~
Like him at centre back, but not left back tbh. Doesn't like up well with the winger and mid ahead of him.

3435~~~
Manchester United's Marcos Rojo has had a good first season with the club and appears to have settled in really well. There's been no suggestion of any issue with manager Louis van Gaal and that would still appear to be the case but Rojo believes the Manchester United manager isn't the warmest of characters, something which has been suggested previously but doesn't always fit in with how some players see the Dutchman. 

Rojo has travelled to Argentina to join up with the Copa America squad, the tournament starts in early June in Chile and Argentina are expected to do very well. Having got to the World Cup final last summer and lost so painfully to Germany, Argentina have a lot to get over and winning the Copa America would go a long way to making the World Cup final more of a distant memory.

Whilst on international duty, Manchester United defender Rojo has been quoted by <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.pasealaliga.com.ar/la/divisional-b/1266-marcos-rojo-estoy-ansioso-porque-llegue-el-s%C3%A1bado" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pase a la Liga</a> in Argentina as saying about his club manager<b> "Van Gaal is distant, very cold but has a lot of experience, he's great coach and you learn a lot. Sometimes he seems very demanding."</b>

Rojo said that Van Gaal is very honest, which helps players to know where they stand with the manager. It's been mentioned several times throughout Van Gaal's career that he sometimes has problems with South Americans, the cultural difference in terms of style could be what leads some players to believe he's cold toward them.

3436~~~
Terrific rabona cross from him yesterday: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.rpp.com.pe/2015-06-20-argentina-vs-jamaica-marcos-rojo-regalo-rabona-en-vina-del-mar-noticia_809283.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpp.com.pe/2015-06-20-ar...lo-rabona-en-vina-del-mar-noticia_809283.html</a>

3437~~~
I used to get slaughtered for saying that we needed more than just the flavour of the summer to sort the defence up. Our defence need a leader, someone who can organise it and stand up to be counted. If we can't find a player like that than we might as well strengthen the RB (a strategy which is needed either way), bring in a quality GK (since DDG is leaving), add a quality young CB (Stones?) and hope that the defence will gell together just fine

3438~~~
Think this guy is a bit under-rated on this forum.

Hopefully he wins the Copa with Argentina.

3439~~~
How has he been going in the copa america so far?

3440~~~
Magnificent. He's been playing left back for Argentina and has linked up really well with Di Maria down the left flank. I also agree with the poster who said he's underrated.

3441~~~
Also I have to <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at people saying he isn't a left back.

3442~~~
Yeah, underrated big time here. He was solid for us and he's excellent for Argentina, in both left back and centre back.

3443~~~
Apart from the first game where the whole team looked a bit off he has been great in yet another big tournament. In his 2nd season in the EPL he is only going to improve. Always plays with a lot of passion and enthusiasm too and is a joy to watch.

3444~~~
Yesterday he was a bigger character than Otamendi who had few mistakes plus one serious that led to a goal which was quite surprising. Very lively performance, he can be tough and dynamic in the same time and that tournament is providing him with precious experience before new season.

Van Gaal can play him where he wants as he more and more becoming a definition of a versatile defender.

3445~~~
People not convinced with him at lb obviously don't watch him for the Argies. He's been brilliant there for the whole tournament and had a decent WC there too.

3446~~~
He hasn't looked great there for us to be fair. Personally I'm fine with him playing some games there when needs be.

3447~~~
To be fair to those people who are concerned about Rojo at right back, their concerns aren't baseless. Whenever I've seen Rojo defend as a left back, more often than not, he's looked to charge at the player he's marking immediately rather than direct him to a less dangerous area before winning the ball. Too often have I seen him charge at the ball holder too soon/be flat-footed in his defending as a left back. At times, he does defend against the ball holder properly, directing them to a less dangerous area before winning the ball, but more often than not, he decides to try to win the ball immediately as a left back, which, more often than not, leads to a dangerous situation if it doesn't go well. I've seen this happen in the Copa America as well several times, further highlighting this fact.

However, when he's not defending against a ball holder, his positioning and awareness of what's going on around him is top notch. He knows what happens around him, and he can sense dangers quite well. His decision-making may have looked bad with us at times last season, but otherwise, his decision-making is normally quite good, and he's very good at suppressing the dangers. This is why I'd prefer him to be a central defender than a left back. His defensive nous and sense is much better utilised as a central defender than as a left back where man-marking is of a greater importance. This was especially well-highlighted against Paraguay, when Argentina's midfield defended poorly as well as Otamendi, whilst Rojo did very well in preventing Paraguay from exploiting the weaknesses on the left side.

I really think he can do very well as a central defender. He may be a bit too rash at left back, but as a central defender, his composure, defensive nous, and decision-making can make him a tough defender to get past.

3448~~~
He is a left back, and he is better than Shaw there.

For same strange reason he doesn't play there at United

3449~~~
He's definitely not.

3450~~~
Shaw is a very good LB.

3451~~~
I´ve wrote this about a million times and it has come from Rojo´s own mouth. He´s a natural CB and prefers to play there. He won´t say no to the manager if he puts him as LB but he isn´t as good there.

3452~~~
Why are you laughing when Rojo himself has said that? He can play there but he isn´t a natural LB

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ojogo.pt/Futebol/1a_liga/Sporting/interior.aspx?content_id=2676174" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ojogo.pt/Futebol/1a_liga/Sporting/interior.aspx?content_id=2676174</a>

<span style="font-size: 18px"><b>"Preferi o Sporting para ser central"</b></span>

Translating it says he prefered to join us to play as Center back since he used to play as LB at Spartak and didn´t like it.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=572213&amp;tm=27&amp;layout=158&amp;visual=49" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=572213&amp;tm=27&amp;layout=158&amp;visual=49</a>

"I prefer to play as Center back but if the manager wants i can play in the left."

3453~~~
Of course it's laughable. You have people as recently as May saying Ashley Young is a better left back than a starter in the World Cup final in that position.

3454~~~
He has looked a lot better at LB this Copa America than he did for us this season. He looks a lot more natural and relaxed on the ball, and his positioning is a lot stronger. Solid communication is probably helping with that.

3455~~~
Well that´s different and i can´t argue with that since i haven´t followed his United career as closely as his Sporting one but i was just mentioning his personal preference and remember very well him saying that he was a natural CB and prefered to play in that position. He wasn´t brilliant at Sporting as LB but could help out in that position. In relation to his World Cup performances, he did play well and was praised by Simeone and got into the World Cup best eleven. I did mention it in my first posts in the Rojo thread. The circunstancies in a strong Argentina NT help that.

3456~~~
I think he is a better LB in big games where his passion and tenacity makes up for his deficiencies in that position. He loosens up a tad and it makes him a better full back for it. For the international team he never fails to look top quality.

Too often I saw him when playing at LB for us look very limited going forwards almost because he had to think rather than play instinctively as he does when he plays for the National Team. When you restrain the natural flair he does possess on the ball, he becomes a shadow of the player he can be. 

Love having him in the squad though, a very useful talent.

3457~~~
Rojo´s career at United has been on par with what i expected. He will slowly "conquer" the fans with his passion and versatility. I just didn´t expect some many injuries. He certainly wasn´t injury prone at Sporting.

3458~~~
I expected rojo to be buttner 2.0 but he is actually a very underrated CB. Till January he was our best CB and he probably is the best at the club now after smalling. He is positionally sound, quick enough, is a good passer of the ball and is a very good tackler. His only issue is that he gets a little too enthusiastic at times and gets carded for that

3459~~~
As much as I think Smalling has come on and was our best defender last season, I just feel, if we had a big European match, Rojo and a new signing would be the first choice, I really see him having a good career at United.

For a first season, I thought he did very well. Settled quicker than Vidic did from memory. Vidic was a January transfer though to be fair.

3460~~~
Can he speak English yet? I thought at times he lacked communication, which that would of been a big part of.

He's the same age as Smalling who still gets talked about as potential. For me Rojo has a much higher ceiling.

3461~~~
He's slightly worse than Jones at CB who has 2 years(?) on him but it was his first season at a new club and learning how to be injury prone.

3462~~~
Sorry but this is nonsense. None of Rojo, Blind or Young can hold a candle to the potential Shaw has to offer on that position.

I agree with most of you that Rojo should be mainly played as CB. If we do not get an absolute top CB like Ramos or Hummels I would go with Smalling/Rojo/Jones and would give Mc Nair and Blackett some chances.

3463~~~
no

3464~~~
How can you quantify potential?

I'd say he should be our cover/competitor for the LB role. He's too short and not enough well built for CB. If Shaw's potential is that great than he would have no trouble keeping Rojo on the bench

3465~~~
Nah

3466~~~
He's 1.87 m tall. That's taller than Jones (1.85 m) and both of Ramos and Otamendi (both 1.83) who we've been linked with and are considered world class CBs.

3467~~~
He's our best CB.

Does anyone know if he can speak English yet? A few times, especially his first few games it looked like he couldn't communicate well.

3468~~~
He is?

3469~~~
He's not.

3470~~~
He really isn't

3471~~~
Matter of opinion fellas.

Just don't see it whatsoever with Smalling like the rest of the caf. Think his athleticism gets him severely overrated on here.

3472~~~
One does not simply not get injured at Manchester united.

3473~~~
We don't really know how good he is yet. Between the injuries and playing in two different positions and it begin his first season in a new league, none of us know for sure. Lets just get behind him and hope he turns out to be great.

3474~~~
I'd also say that Smalling's better at this stage. Smalling+Rojo would be my current pick but there really isn't much between him and Jones when they're both fit. Think he could turn out very good though.

3475~~~
He really isnt, he's rash and his positioning id quite poor. It's his first season tho so he might improve.

3476~~~
He's bloody inconsistent, that's what he is.

3477~~~
Then we're in more trouble than we think.

3478~~~
So what are Rojo's qualities?

3479~~~
If you were going to argue that Smalling is not our best CB, then I would think Jones would mount a better case after last season than Rojo.

3480~~~
He's above Jones on the list for 3rd CB (hopefully bringing in a new one that's better) if we take away nationality, but Jones will probably be preferred because he's English and good enough. 3rd for LB also before Blind and Shaw.

Very good squad player for United to have, can be a starter if he continues to develop.

edit: HE'S BETTER AT CB THAN LB, HE IS A CB WHO CAN PLAY LB IF ASKED.

3481~~~
Not in football though. 

He is a 25 year old who doesn't have the basics of defending right. Don't believe we are going to see too much improvement.

3482~~~
Ever thought that the guy who's picked to start in the WC and Copa finals might understand his position(s) better than the "experts" on the Caf?

3483~~~
Blasphemy!!!

3484~~~
The irony of that is Rojo's athleticism is where he excels.

3485~~~
I don't really think van Gaal cares for nationality a great deal. If that's the case, we might have signed Clyne instead of the impending arrival of Darmian.

Truth is LVG probably rates Jones higher than Rojo. I personally prefer Rojo, but it's nothing to do with whether a player is English or  not.

3486~~~
In terms of how comfortable he looks on the ball and his general passing competency I would rate him above all of our other cb's (not a massive amount of competition there).

3487~~~
He's a worse player than Jones, never mind Smalling who's quite comfortably our best CB. He's rash, gets caught out of position an awful lot and not as good with the ball as he seems to think he is. Seems to regularly feck up easy passes in his own half, a trait he shares with Evans. Gives me flashbacks of Buttner.

3488~~~
I'd argue he is better then Jones, In fact he is considerably better IMO. Buttner? That comparison doesn't even make sense in the slightest, Yes he wasn't too good for us last season at LB in the few games he played there but at CB he was pretty good, Hoping he will improve more this coming season to.

3489~~~
Flashbacks of Buttner? Where did you get that from..The tattoos and the hairstyle?

3490~~~
Rojo's our best centre back? When did this happen?

3491~~~
He scares the hell out of me when he's defending. Like Jones, eveything will be fine and he'll be having a a good game, but there's that moment of madness in him that could cause problems. The amount of times he recklessly goes to ground needs to stop.

3492~~~
Who said this?

3493~~~
Previous page.

3494~~~
Jones is younger and the better player. He reminds me of Buttner because they both tend to look completely clueless when they defend while really fancying themselves with the ball at their feet. Rojo was lucky Evans turned to shite for reasons unknown or he would have been 4th choice.

He scares the feck out of me when he plays.

3495~~~
If he doesn't have the basics of defending right, then I wonder why I'm not a footballer...

Yeah, at left back, you may have a case with his more rash style and more flat-footed defending, but in the middle, he hasn't demonstrated issues with his defending at all. The only flaws I've noticed on him in the middle is his weakness in the air and his mistakes on the ball. Otherwise, most thought that he and Smalling was our best central defensive partnership for much of last season.

3496~~~
I wonder too, you do have a penchant for writing essays on them. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

I disagree, I see too many flaws in his defending and positioning. He wilts under any kind of pressure and is behind the play most of the times. You need to watch the first half of City games to realize what I am talking about. He is very weak aerially and his tackling is erratic. Even his much touted passing hasn't impressed me at all; has a tendency to leave the ball short or pass it to the opposition in dangerous areas.

If we are handing out the best defensive partnership award for last season, which we really shouldn't as none of them were very good, then it has to go to Smalling and Jones.

3497~~~
He'll be offloaded next summer.

3498~~~
He gets beaten by pace many a time and his only solution for this is pulling the player back which is pointless as it will be called for sure.

3499~~~
He's the new Silvestre ie a fast and reasonably technically gifted player with zero positioning. We should use him as cover/competition for Shaw as LB were his lack of positioning wont bother us so much

3500~~~
I still think he will kick on from here. For a foreign players first season in the Premier League, I though he handled it very well. Will only improve on this season.

3501~~~
Some incredibly harsh and forgetful posts in this thread of late. Rojo had plenty of good games last season. He didn't convince everybody all of the time, but a brief look through the thread marks make for much better reading than some of these past few posts.

It's easy to forget that he was bought into a chaotic defence. We were switching between three and four at the back, his playing partner would change every week, Wayne Rooney was his defensive midfielder and he could barely speak a word of English.

Rojo was an understated, fairly reliable constant for much of the past season and it's likely he'll look even better next season given we'll most likely be playing with a settled defence in a better team shape.

I'm a stickler for positioning, too, and it was generally good at centre half. It would tend to go awry at full back if anything.

3502~~~
overall I agree, but this did not last even a full game

3503~~~
No, it's actually utter bollocks that's being spouted here. Rojo was fine for us, at times doing as good job as Smalling who was our best defender last season.

3504~~~
It seems some posters had a opinion on him when we bought him or based that opinion on his first couple of games and are still stuck with that opinion and wont changed it. That and they repeat same old cliches we've been hearing since last year.

3505~~~
Glad there are at least some people who saw what I did last season. Rojo had a decent first season and was our best centre back after Smalling.

3506~~~
It's not a cliché if it's true. Rojo is an undeniably rash defender who tends to get caught out of position a worrying number of times. Jones does the same, except he has more games where he looks completely imperious in defense.

He might improve or he might not. No harm in pointing out his blatant flaws in the meantime.

3507~~~
All this stick because you want a shiny new toy......Evans is shite, have a go at him but why Rojo....McNair and Blackett ain't going to make it here, we have 3 defenders there that can/should be replaced or play out of position and Rojo ain't 1 of them.
I would be very content with our defence if consisted of Smalling, Rojo, Jones + Either an experienced defender like Ramos/Hummels/Otamendi or a young and talented defender like Stones/Rekik/?.

3508~~~
I see that we agree on certain things about Rojo's defending as a central defender. However, I disagree that he has fundamental defensive flaws or poor positioning. His positioning, awareness, and reading of the game is very good as a central defender, but we don't see that often when he's a left back as he seems to play that role more like a wing back than a proper defensive full back. Yes, he's aerially weak, but I put that down to him adjusting to the league in the first season. Surely, he hasn't faced that many aerial challenges in Portugal as he's faced here, particularly as he's often played as an attacking left back during his younger years as well. His mistakes due to wilting under pressure as well as sloppiness on the ball are two things that I believe he can grow out of if, and only if, he plays more often as a central defender. If he keeps switching between left back and centre back, then he won't cut out those mistakes or sloppy passes.

3509~~~
I'd worry if we play him at left back more often. Rojo at left back leaves our left side quite weak and open, and whilst Rojo is decent going forward, defensively, he's inconsistent and unreliable as a left back. He's too rash and flat-footed as a left back, and his decision-making is also worse than it is when he's a central defender.

Quite often, what I've noticed of him at left back whenever he's partnered with an aggressive central defender like Otamendi is that he's unsure about whether to cover up a gap in the middle when Otamendi starts to push out wide or stay out wide and cover up the left channel. Also, you will notice that he frequently pushes up to quickly close down the left winger/wing back without even considering the risk of doing so. Finally, he's a very flat-footed defender as a left back. When marking wide players, you have to be on your toe as a full back, but Rojo seeks to win the ball immediately rather than close down the wide player's avenues before winning the ball.

I don't know who coached him to play like that as a left back, but regardless of that, he cannot be trusted to play that role reliably. I'd much rather see him as a central defender where he is more familiar and has a better understanding of how to play that role.

3510~~~
Lets say Rojo is caught out of position as LB. The winger will have two options ie either to cross/pass the ball or to challenge the two CBs and try to score. Having said that if he is a CB than such mistake would probably free the striker to go one to one against the keeper. 

No wonder why so many young CBs are first given a chance as full backs . Its a much easier role to cover.

3511~~~
People need to give him a break. It was his first season in a new league. He can only improve this season and hopefully build on the glimpses of quality he has shown.

3512~~~
Well, yes, that's a given. However, unlike you, I believe that he's a different player as a central defender. Also, I can tell you several instances where Rojo's defensive errors at left back has caused us many problems, even more than during his stint as a central defender.

The one error as a left that sticks most in my mind is Vardy's first goal against us at the King Power Stadium. Rojo went in too early at Vardy and completely failed to win the ball. He tried to chase back, but Vardy was already past him, and his cross (yes, the ball crossed the line, but that doesn't matter) was met by Ulloa, which put the pressure back on this. Rojo diving in too early gave Leceister a break, and Rojo's mistake allowed Leceister to get the goal back. I also remember several instances as a left back in that match where he'd press on Vardy but Vardy would often beat him.

As a central defender, though, the only times I remember him causing us problems are his sloppiness on the ball, him flustering under pressure, and him losing aerial battles. I've rarely, if ever, seen him overcommit and leave a gaping hole at our back line. I've rarely seen him make mistakes that he'd make as a left back.

3513~~~
Wow we must have such an amazing team that a starter for Argentina who had reached two big finals within a year is just nowhere close to being good enough for us.

3514~~~
He'll do far less damage settling down as a LB than a CB. His mistakes would be less felt. He's a far better LB than we think and that was clearly shown with Argentina

3515~~~
He doesn't look comfortable at all at LB and hasn't he specifically said he sees himself as a centre back?

His worst game by far last season was when he played left back away at Leicester.

3516~~~
I just looked through the thread marks. There are very few games where he does not get slated for making a mistake or being reckless or for his poor passing or just not being able to defend.

3517~~~
He didn't get "slated" regularly. He's made mistakes and they have been discussed in here, but that's generally the norm in these player threads. Fellaini has had a good year yet there's a plenty of stick throughout his thread.

There was a lot of positivity around the New Year up until he got injured again. He was in solid form.

3518~~~
There was plenty of justified criticism even before that point which generally got shot down because he was a new toy and because crapping on Phil Jones was the trend until it became obvious that Rojo was even worse.

3519~~~
I don't really think that's obvious. It's just you beating that particular drum. Both of them share similar strengths and weaknesses and are around about the same level.

3520~~~
If you look at the match day ratings then Rojo has a season average of 6.0 and Jones has 5.9. Those seem about right to me, Rojo was slightly better than him throughout the season and he had the burden of being in a new team in a new league without any pre-season with us. Plus he had to play a few games at left back where he struggled badly. His lowest rating of the season was the 3.5 he got at left back in the Leicester game I mentioned earlier.

3521~~~
Your being too sensible/rational the caf don't like that

3522~~~
Thought he did okay myself.

3523~~~
Definitely a good way of comparing their performances, and you would expect Rojo to improve a lot as he settles more in his second season. My rating averages for the two players are apparently 7.0 for Rojo, 6.1 for Jones, so I consistently rated Rojo a lot higher than most people on here it seems!

3524~~~
He clearly showed us he is a stand in left back and when he played quite well at cb. Considering it was his first season in a new country he did well, although his spell in russia would of helped, even england is warmer than russia

3525~~~
People here just get notions and refuse to budge(see Roone worshipers and the other extreme who think he's worthless, Carrick, Kagawa, Nani and so forth). Rojo has lots of tattoo's,bad hair and is an aggressive defender so therefore is rash and makes mistakes. People don't seem to realise that there are more was to defend than sitting deep and backing off. When I was being coached we were often told to get touch-tight and don't allow the striker to turn, whilst the other CB covered. Here, Jones or Rojo usuall press higher and Smalling covers a lot but people don't notice at all. Rojo had bad games and made mistakes, but overall was solid. At the least he'll make a good backup for LB/CB in future seasons.

3526~~~
I do not agree with that statement at all. From what I saw, he struggled with those aspects in each and every game he started in the position. 

About his aerial weakness, I don't believe that is due to him not coming to terms with the physicality of the league. In fact, that is one aspect that I believe he doesn't have any problems in dealing. I find both him and Blackett as extremely poor headers of the ball. 

I hardly ever saw him for Sporting, so cannot comment on that. 

He didn't have to switch back and forth from LB to CB, he mainly played as a CB before he got injured. Don't think it had anything to do with how he came across as a defender. 

I hope you are right and he adjusts to the league, as no one likes 20m duds. Though, I doubt it is going to happen. Jones superseded him as the "L"CB towards the tail end of last season, and as things point, we are looking to sign another player to play the position.
