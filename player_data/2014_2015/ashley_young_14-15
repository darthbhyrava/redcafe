Looked for a thread in here for his performances but couldn't find one.

Was absolutely terrible today with his passing of the ball. Broke up a number of our moves by being able to complete a simple pass. His form is dismal but he still gets games.

I honestly think DDG passes the ball better.

2~~~
Yep, was pretty terrible.

And still set up our two goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3~~~
I genuinely have no idea how he's got 90 minutes, it makes no sense. 

Nani needs time on the pitch. And Young is dreadful. Truly dreadful.

4~~~
I often try to stick up for our players, but no defending him today. 

Was proper gash, he can do far better but surely he is on the way out

5~~~
He and Valencia seem to take turns at being simply woeful. 

Awhile back young was doing the odd decent thing while Valencia was simply awful, and now it's the other way round.

6~~~
Watching him play gives me diarrhoea.

7~~~
I just don't know how he fails to complete simple passes.

He obviously has strengths; very quick with a awesome strike, but his awareness, passing of the ball and his ability to beat a man is beyond shoddy.

8~~~
He needs kicked out, pronto. Annoyingly, he'll most probably still be in the squad come September, while much better footballers will leave. 

He was shite.

9~~~
Valencia is alright when given time and space, Young had that in abundance today and couldn't find a man. My view of him as a footballer has fallen even more since his hoofing versus Arsenal and Olympiakos

10~~~
Would be top of my list in the DFS summer sale, his first touch would rival my coffee tables in its shitness.

11~~~
Atrocious today at everything. Praying we don't start with him and Val against Bayern.

12~~~
Tough game for him.  A couple really good moves when West Ham opened up a bit in the second half where Kagawa, Mata and Rooney were really playing well together.  Quick passing, good movement, all coming deep to get the ball, and then Young was there on the right, waiting a pass so he could do a useless stepover and either over hit the cross or play a poor pass into the box.  A lot of moves broke down when he got the ball

Would have been nice to see someone like Welbeck out there with the other three, or even Nani, although he is so often frustrating as well to watch.

13~~~
I can see one of them being sold in the summer, but  I doubt both. We have so many other priority positions to be refilled.

14~~~
I don't think a half fit Nani would've done any worse than Young today. Why he wasn't given a few minutes is beyond me.

15~~~
Thought he was ok today. Think people are just looking for his mistakes because he's been shit all season.

16~~~
He was absolutely terrible today. Broke up all our counter attacks, provided very little attacking threats other than running, and wasn't good defensively either.

17~~~
Ashley Young's feet, the place promising counter-attacking moves go to die.

18~~~
He was shocking today. Always thought he would be better from the right but doesn't seem to be the case, couldn't beat his man and broke down far too many moves.

Nani should of got some time, we need to get him in form for Bayern.

19~~~
Why didn't Nani get atleast 10 minutes..

20~~~
Hopefully he's gone in the summer but it nay be difficult to find a willing buyer.

Only reason Val or Young gets games is they offer the much needed pace. Zaha probably deserves his chance next season

21~~~
He did one good thing today and thats provide the cross for Rooney's 2nd. He was terrible, having a set of eyes and then backing it up with stats is really quite simple.

He spent the entire 2nd half passing the ball to every available West Ham player.

22~~~
Because he lacks the one thing Young has more of, hard work. Young is obviously showning signs of being more fit in training.
Absolutely ridiculous how Nani didn't at least get 10 mins game time.

23~~~
The issue with him is that even when he does good things in a game, he's terrible for the rest of it. His generally standard has been so low for us it's amazing. Sometimes he'll do a few good things in a game but his general level is way way too low for a team like united.

24~~~
Not convinced and still think we should get rid and have Zaha take his place. Can't possibly be worse.

25~~~
Lost the ball a-lot and was extremely wateful. He isn't anywhere near good enough for our level.

26~~~
There were times during this match when I wondered whether he remembered that he was playing for the <i>away</i> side. Forget adding to the team, he spends half his time taking away from it.

27~~~
He was awful when he came on against Olympiakos and today he picked up where he left off on Wednesday. Terrible.

28~~~
Great assist for the first goal, I could hear him shout to Rooney "Hit it Wayne !!"

29~~~
Everything seemed to fall apart with him. Great play all around and then when he got the ball it was usually a bit shit. Good squad player to have I guess but we've got enough of them. Hopefully he leaves and kagawa stays because today kagawa showed he's got what it takes to be a key player to this side.

30~~~
I can see the argument for Valencia in that he is very strong and offers good defensive work as part of his game, even if his form has plummeted.

I see no genuine argument for Young ahead of any of our other wingers and that includes the likes of Zaha.

31~~~
Perceived hard work. I don't think Young works harder than Nani.

32~~~
Zaha needs to sort his work rate and attitude first. But young really does need to go. Would be incredible if Kagawa goes and Valencia or young stay. Sadly I can see it happening.

33~~~
Waste of space now. He can deliver an okay looking ball if played in by someone else but what does he offer?

He can't beat a man. He rarely shoots. He might not be adventurous but he's hardly a defensive cover. His passing is illogical rather than safe and he's neither strong nor particularly quick.

Hope that's his sole performance for us for a while because he has no place against City and Villa should be used as the tune up for Bayern when he surely doesn't play.

34~~~
His brainless play just doesn't fit in with our forward players.  Same goes for Valencia.

35~~~
Does he get credited with the assist for Rooney's first. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

36~~~
Back up your 2nd sentence with his pass completion of 30 out of 37.

37~~~
Why on earth didn't Nani come on for him?

38~~~
Unbelievably yes. It's a fecking clearance too.

39~~~
I don't like Young but I wouldn't rank that as one of his worse performance, he was rubbish but not terrible, which is a significant upgrade from his cameo in midweek.

40~~~
At least he did help out defensively. That's something, right?

41~~~
What is the point of him? He lacks confidence in nearly everything he does. Young is under hitting passes to his team mates that are only 4-5 yards away. Abysmal.

42~~~
With the way moyes keeps picking young, would be shocked if he was sold. Then again maybe just putting him in the shop window. 

I'll be angry if they sell kagawa. Valencia I'm impartial to whether he goes. But we really need to play our younger players like Januzaj and zaha. It just makes us pacier and more of a threat on the Counter.

43~~~
Rashley Young

Hashley Young

Trashley Young

Take your pick...

44~~~
I just can't comprehend what David Moyes, let alone any other manager, sees in him.

45~~~
Alright, perhaps I was being generous by calling him bobbling or miscontrolling the ball into a West Ham players path an actual pass.

46~~~
Same. He makes us play better as a team as opposed to young who has good moments at best.

47~~~
Well he is a wide player who suits the style of both our former and current manager.

48~~~
Gashley Young.

49~~~
Haha

50~~~
He's actually quite funny to watch. He never, ever lifts his head. He's dicks around with the ball performing pirouette after pirouette and then looks up. By that time the defender, who has been bamboozled by Ashley's gashness, is back alongside him. A waste of time and effort.

51~~~
The infuriating thing with him is that once he creates space, he does nothing <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> No clever, pass or shot.

52~~~
I genuinely thought he was decent today.

53~~~
We should offer him to a club for free. That way we'll at least get rid of his wages.

54~~~
Both, Fergie first and foremost, expected much, much more from Young.

55~~~
Young should be sold back to Villa in the summer, several chances in the first half to slip Rooney in through the middle, yet he decides to take an extra two or three touches (then the chance is gone) same with Valencia this season.

56~~~
Completely and utterly shot of confidence. He runs a lot but his final balls is, much like Valencia's, complete hit and miss. I really hope we can find a new club for him in the summer and move on to find a replacement/play Januzaj more. Would be good for everyone involved.

57~~~
You mean completely miss? it would probably be easier playing with 10 men sadly.

Januzaj needs to be bedded in slowly so he doesn't burn out, 10 appearences this season, 15 next, 20 the following etc. You can't throw a youth player in that fast, it doesn't work that way, we need to go shopping for a winger in the summer, and 2-3 midfielders that are world class.

Honestly even Rafael is very questionable at the back too, but Young does need to be moved on as soon as possible.

58~~~
You can count the cross for the second goal as an assist too if you want. Crap performance and still gets two assists.

59~~~
If I just wanted Blockbusters I'd of had a word with Bob Holness

60~~~
I just feel that he isn't the future, and that says it all for me really. Not a future first team player, not a future squad player. I fully expect Moyes to sell him in the summer.

61~~~
I keep switching between him and Valencia in terms of which one annoys me more, but he's overtaken Valencia again. Such a negative player, I just can't understand how two players who's games are based on speed can refuse to run at people as much as they often do. I mean its one thing for kagawa/mata to turn back and bide their time as they might actually play a much better ball if they're patient, with him he needs to take on people as he won't play someone in as they might. Still suppose he helped contribute to the second but really hope with nani fit and kagawa giving a good showing, they're played over him as just think they have more to offer.

62~~~
He's shit. That's all. Having said that  I could play as well as that and if I could earn his money instead of slaving away all day i'd be set up for life.

63~~~
Young's technique leaves so much to be desired. Don't know if it's a lack of confidence or just lack of ability, but he's on a much lower level than our other attackers.

<i>That said</i>, he's a game runner and he played a role in keeping the pitch stretched so Mata and Kagawa had space to play. Won't have a pop at Young, because even though he's hit and miss, he does a decent job for the team. And he put a dangerous ball in for Rooney's second.

Clearly though, we need a serious right wing upgrade in the summer. Young and Valencia aren't up to it long term.

64~~~
Can't restore his confidence and he's not even 30... For a winger it's a bad omen. Zero consistency through at least 5 matches.

If Moyes will be looking forward to a serious team's upgrade and taking it back to it's good old level, there won't be any further speculation about his future.

He's so off, Januzaj or even Zaha won't have bigger problems with taking his place next season with that kind of 'level' of football.

65~~~
His all-around game was pretty much terrible, but his final ball is much better than Valencia's who has no final ball. He was gash, but at least he put some dangerous crosses, which we scored our second goal from(it was poor clearance from the defender, but that's what you get when you deliver ball in dangerous areas) and could probably have assist or two directly after his crosses-the one with Fellaini comes to mind). He can be better than this, but overall, we saw much worse performances from him and especially Valencia this season.

66~~~
The second goal he should be looking to pick out Rooney. Our strikers have been feeding off these scraps all season.

67~~~
He was okay. I don't think he has been too bad at all tbh, think he has a place in our squad but purely as a backup

68~~~
Why can't he dribble? I think thats the first time I've seen our player picked on the right wing not beat his man once.

69~~~
we can find better backups thaan him

70~~~
Young can play good football and he's cunning at times but he look more and more in need of a psychologist to change that awful mind set of being hit by a truck at any time. Unblock his mind and he'll be consistent and full of energy to run past defenses.

The only thing that can save his United career is patience from Moyes which may end anytime in the avalanche of pressure to move this team forward.

71~~~
If we again must return to Valencia's subject... he's still the tank and a fast one no matter of the current form.

72~~~
He does the "first" part of dribbling, he creates enough space to get past the player but for whatever reasons he just stands there allowing the defender to adjust himself.

73~~~
I thought it was good for the away fans to song his song as well.

Honestly thought yesterday was decent from him. Did exactly what he needed to do.

74~~~
Talksports Georgie Bingham has just stated that it was Young's first 'assist' since Dec 2012. Shocking if it's true.



I get that and I feel unless United are in for a top winger this summer or a change of manager, Young and/or Valencia will remain at the club. They are both players who are content to be part of the squad.

75~~~
He is a very well paid squad player. Nothing more. I'm sure he would be a very good player, playing for another club, week in, week out, but not for us unfortunately. Shame it's turned out the way it has as I remember been quite giddy when we signed him.

76~~~
He was bad yesterday, seemed to lose all confidence early on. Having said that, he didn't shy away from the task or hide when we were in possession and he did put one on a plate for Fellaini and had a hand in the second goal. So not all bad.

He does have a decent end-product but his general play is lacking and Rafael was frustrated at times yesterday with Young's inability to link with him.

77~~~
Me too. I think the reaction here is just bizarre and based on a vendetta against the player that people have for some reason.  He seemed to have get a decent 'rating' review from one or two of the media outlets that I've seen this morning.

A lot of people are determined to label his performance shit before kick-off. I've seen other players have virtual dogs dinners of a game only to be faced with almost unanimous praise here. Can't put to finer a point on it but a good 40-60% of people will decide who has played well and who hasn't before the game starts and only a performance out of the ordinary will change that.

78~~~
Yeah but I find this massively bizarre. I come here yesterday after the match thinking he'd done easily enough to justify playing the next game and people are calling him awful. Yesterday was far from an awful performance in any sense of the word.

79~~~
He just isn't good enough for United and it looks like he needs to be at another club to regain his best form

80~~~
I would keep him as backup tbh. I would get rid of Valencia instead.  Young has been better this season.

81~~~
Both our goals came through Young forcing the play.

82~~~
He does it a lot. He's not the best player in the world. I like him in the squad though. Although things haven't gone great for him this season fitness wise, when he's player I think he's been good at being direct and offering us a way up the pitch quickly.

83~~~
The second goal was incredibly fluky; it was an awful cross that deflected and the first goal was all Rooney but let's try to pretend he isn't shit.

84~~~
A cross along the 6 yard box is now "shit"?

He's a useful squad player who can help you win the odd game. But if i had my way, only one of him or Valencia should stay at the club as that option of a squad player in their position. Besides who would want to take him especially with that high wages of his?

87~~~
I thought he was very poor yesterday but he set up two goals all the same.

88~~~
He's one of those players that people watching have a pre biased way of thinking about.


He does a fairly decent squad job, and like a lot of players will look much better when we play well.

Might well be struggling for a lot of action next year, as Mata, Januzaj and Valencia are surely ahead of him, and that's before we decide who to bring in.

89~~~
There were players open and he just crossed it straight to a defender.

90~~~
Phew. Thought it was me going crazy then. What game were people here watching yesterday?

91~~~
Many times Young seems to just hit his crosses into a specific area. Compare this to players like Mata and Kagawa that actually look to see if there's a player in that space. We really should be replacing this guy as soon as possible.

92~~~
That's a bit far stretched, isn't it? One was a blind clearance, the other one a poor cross that fell into Rooney's feet due a mistake by the defender.

93~~~
He is much less annoying when played on the right, doesn't give him the opportunity to do that shit cut back onto his right foot before a rubbish cross. 
The other thing is, he's actually a decent player when we're playing on the counter-attack (again, especially when he's on the right). He has a bit of pace to get behind the full back, and when he crosses first time the end product is not bad. He still found ways to take too many touches when he had a chance to put the ball in yesterday, but overall if we're going to play him that was the ideal way to do so.

94~~~
It's pretty obvious that Young isn't good enough for Utd, but who would take him with £90k a week wages? He's got 3 years left on his contract as well.

95~~~
Don't get hatred since I thought he played well last night. Played a beautiful cross from which Fellaini should have scored and it was his cross that led to the mistake & the second goal. Did well overall.

96~~~
Has a player ever looked so out of place and out of his depth when compared to his team mates? Kagawa, Rooney and mata playing lovely triangles and showing their technical ability while young can't hit a 5 yard pass.

97~~~
I remember a season or two ago when Young was a fixture in the England side and was even getting playing time behind the striker. He was scoring for us too.

He hasn't been the same since the Euros where he was absolutely terrible and missed his penalty against Italy.

98~~~
yeah but i mean this goes back to the point when watching the same game, two people may see things differently and thereby walk away with completely different opinions/conclusions etc. The caf is a perfect representation of this.

this is where stats can be helpful as long as they're being used in context and with some objective performances measures to better ascertain how good or bad one's performance actually was.

on young, it doesnt make sense to me that he can give the ball away multiple times yet that's somehow glossed over by our fans but when other players do it, "he was poor. gave the ball away numerous times" and I'm just like what about young?

99~~~
I don't think he's good enough. Certainly not for the wages and not for first choice either. We need a fit Nani in form or a Zaha with his head screwed on. Someone who can excite people. Young is not that player.

100~~~
Two years. This is his third season at the club and he signed a five year deal. Hence I'm praying we fob him off come 'renewal' time.

101~~~
Our play broke down so many times last night because of his lack of ability. He's not good enough.

102~~~
Christ, I thought yesterday was amongst Young's worst performances in a United shirt. Most of our moves broke down yesterday when the ball went to him, it was incredibly lucky that we salvaged a goal out of that cross he played straight to a defender. There were two strange points in the game also where he seemed to be shielding the ball out of play for a goal kick to them.

103~~~
Not good enough to be a first XI player here, that much is certain.

Is he a good enough squad player? Possibly, though his form over the past 12-18 months hasn't consistently shown it IMO.

Then you might need to factor in what kind of wages he's on to be a squad player. Personally, I think we're over stocked on wingers/attackers and we need to trim some quantity for quality and Young would definitely be close to the top of that list for me.

I don't think he's as bad as some on the Caf let's on. He's a good/decent attacker.

104~~~
I think we should be setting the bar higher than him for a United winger, given the quality we've had in that position over the course of our history.

Really frustrating when his only trick is that feint to cross. And how many times does he do it when a first time cross would actually be the best thing to do? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

105~~~
A clearance and an inaccurate cross.

106~~~
Oh yeah. Class football indeed.

107~~~
What about that cross straight to Fellianis head?

108~~~
He wasn't bad. We'd be much better served trying to get Nani fit and on form though.

109~~~
Quick pressure and closing down for the first one (Barca get praised for that all the time). The second goal came from his quick pace and a clever ball played into the corridor of uncertainty - any closer the keeper or the first man and it never would have resulted in a goal.

110~~~
It was a good cross. 

Still a poor performance from young, which is fairly normal by his standards.

111~~~
I actually wouldn't mind Ashley Young coming off the bench and generally being a backup squad player. As I've said before,he's always capable of decent moments,  good run or cross here or there, but he's quite an ordinary player (poor by united standards) in general who doesn't help the team play better at all. Hence the above preference of his ideal usage. The issue lies in the fact that he's such a prominent part of the team. 

Same with Valencia. He's very limited these days and seems to offer not much other than hard work and fight. 

I'd keep one of them and have him as backup to the main widemen.

112~~~
One thing I've been thinking lately(regardless of how he plays or if we're goign to keep him) is who we'd sell him to.
Who would buy him? Would we get 8-10m for him?

113~~~
I'm sure a lot of Premier League sides would become interested. The major stumbling block is wages, as it is for the majority of our lesser talented players.

114~~~
Agreed. He's on 80000 or something like that a week, isn't he? No way is he going to step down from that.

115~~~
I remember a journalist touching on it at some stage this season, that Moyes could find it difficult selling some of the players he wants to as wages are high and not consistent with ability.

116~~~
i agree we lost ronaldo and havent signed anyone remotely close to his level at that time since.

117~~~
I expect if Young leaves it'll probably be on loan because of the wages.

118~~~
yep. this is why i feel focusing purely on end product doesnt cut it. imagine having a striker that offered nothing to our build up play but somehow got 25+ goals each season

119~~~
Quick pace?

Exactly what Young hasn't shown since his Aston Villa days

120~~~
He was faster than Mata or Kagawa would have been in that situation.

121~~~
Agree.

A lot slower than Nani or Valencia. I was just watching Ashley Young videos from his days at Aston Villa because I could have sworn he used to dribble and had good speed. Its true, one goal I remembered was in there where he sped away from Chelsea's defence to score. He's half the speed now for some reason

122~~~
Valencia would have checked back and waited for his fullback. Nani would have pulled up with an injury.

123~~~
And Young would have dived?

124~~~
No, he would have crossed and put the ball into a dangerous area that Rooney would eventually score from.

125~~~
I don't mind Young, he's got good pace and is capable of beating a man which is what we lack. When he does pull it off and get a goal or assist it just shows to me what we are missing, the issue is that Young isn't good enough to do it as frequent as we should expect. 

We need a pacey, skilful and technical winger who offers us 10 goals and 15 assists a season as a minimum.

126~~~
Age catches up with the best of us, mate.

127~~~
No he wouldn't <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

128~~~
Sums it up perfectly. Young is a decent option, and a good squad player. But he will never be good enough to be a consistent starter for Manchester United, that was never the intention with him either.

129~~~
Never rated young, when we bought him I didn't understand it.

130~~~
Put it into the defender's feet. As Valencia specializes in and Nani can easily do too.

131~~~
He's 28 now and was about 25 when we signed him. He shouldnt have suddenly lost his pace when he signed his contract

132~~~
If big clubs genuinely want rid of players, they can agree 'redundancy' type packages paying the difference between wages offered by the new club and their current contract. 

I imagine Man City could shed more of a light on that but Adebayor is well documented.

133~~~
Watch the match again.
Valencia struggles to beat the first man with his crosses, and when he does, the 'keeper often claims it. Young actually got the ball into the six yard box. That's not to be sniffed at.

134~~~
Young is our version of RAWK's Patrice Evra, obviously. 

Most people agreed he did at least alright on Saturday. Here people call it one of his worst performances ever. Convinced some people don't give him a fair shake.

135~~~
True, but I'm not sure how open we'd be to the idea. I'd say Moyes would rather keep him as an option than move him on but still be paying him.

136~~~
I heard Andre Mariner tried to send him off yesterday.

137~~~
This is a complete myth that journalists always peddle. Regardless of what a player is on, a move is always financially beneficial to them as long as they don't hand in a transfer request as they get their contract paid up as a "loyalty fee" which alongside their signing on fee and new contract will always be financially better for them than sitting put. 

The way it can be an issue is if a club needs to put their transfer fee towards their replacement. 

If you imagine a player is on £4m a year and his club have to pay him 2 years of his contract in order to buy him out of his contract to sell him to the buying club. Of a £10m fee that would leave the selling club £2m. 

So I can't see it being a problem for United as we are not going to rely on the money we get from Young to bring in another player and financially speaking, those wages are already a "commitment" as far as the clubs finances go and as they lose a commodity with value I'd guess there is also a way they skip around the tax.

138~~~
Could we entice him with a new contract, with a slight difference? Plays very well for the next 6 months and he'll get a 10% rise. Play below the standard expected of him and he'll lose 10%. Have him on a 6 month rolling contract and repeat the process. In fact, do it with all our players.

139~~~
I can't stand him. Absolutely useless footballer.

140~~~
He's so depressingly horrible. I'd like to know what kind of favours he does to Moyes to get picked over the players on our bench.

141~~~
Six pages of bashing in the matchday thread. Good lord.

142~~~
Not one to slag players off but Ashley Young is utter toilet.

143~~~
The lovely ball from Rafael up to Mata, who controls it nicely and lays the ball off with a beautiful backheel to... Young, who completel miscontrols it and loses possession. 

He isn't a scapegoat for our overall performance, but individually he has been atrocious. Really do not rate the guy at all. The only attributes he has are pace and the occasional long shot, literally cannot think of another.

144~~~
Who else do we have? Januzaj has been overplayed this season and needs his rest, Welbeck and probably Giggs will be playing against Bayern and Valencia's been just as poor all season. The only other option is Hernández up top but he's been so out of sorts this season and it pushes Mata out wider.

145~~~
If he had Nani or Kagawa written on his back he would be subbed off at 15th minute. He is terrible today.

146~~~
I would much rather Welbeck than Young until the end of the season if that's what it takes.

147~~~

Christ sake.

148~~~
Yup. Some of you also need to read the Valencia thread circa January as well to remind yourselves of the season that he's had.

Young seems to have these games where he looks utterly lacking in any ability, yet will have a random purple patch where he can score from 30 yards and whip in dangerous crosses. Such a confidence player.

149~~~
Nothing player. Doesn't have the mentality for this club.

150~~~
1 successful pass!


one!

151~~~
TBH, some stuff that cannot be talked about in public if kids are around. :worried:

It's so depressing when one thinks that the media sold him as the next big thing, and then he's in fact nowhere near expected as the final product.

152~~~
That backpass that lead to 0-1. Jesus..

153~~~
Am used to it by now. Him and Valencia are just not good enough.

154~~~
Cleverley out right would probably be an improvement, to be honest.

155~~~
Give nani a chance to get some form. He's always been much better then young. Even Valencia in his poor form does more for the team then young.

156~~~
Dear me... it is so boring to look at. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

157~~~
Nani

No brainer really

158~~~
And it's only in attacking third. His misplaced pass cost us a goal <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

159~~~
"Although we did see flashes in the first half of impressive wing play from Ashley Young"



feckING WHAT?

160~~~
I'm going to pay for a banner for Young out as he is dreadful

161~~~
Nani?

162~~~
Honestly, does he have any footballing intelligence? Mata made a great run to the right, but nope "LUMP IT IN THE BOX!"

163~~~
Diabolical again.

164~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No way someone said that

165~~~
I shit you not! I thought I was hearing stuff.

166~~~
when does his contract runout?

167~~~
Not for another 2 years. We'll probably renew him and let de Gea leave on a free knowing us.

168~~~
Januzaj needs a rest?

Sorry - is he either a pensioner or a toddler?

And how long a rest does he actually need?

169~~~
Can't we just loan him to Westham, Hull, Palace for the next 2 seasons?

170~~~
He's a youngster he's clearly struggling what's so difficult to understand that he needs a rest to protect him?

171~~~
He's beyond useless. I'd have every single member of our squad over him on the wings. Even De Gea. Hell, even Lindegaard.

172~~~
I'd rather have Bebe instead of Young and to think Zaha is away on loan, the mind boggles!

173~~~
Do you think Young feels ashamed coming for work every morning and picking up his salary? He is paid better than more than 1/2 the squad and a kid like Januzaj is better at every aspect of his game than Young is.

174~~~
I hope we can shift him in the summer, but with those wages it will be hard to find any takers. Too much of a confidence player and doesn't have the mentality to play here. We're stocked with attackers as it is and he should be one of the first out the door.

175~~~
SAF's worst purchase.

176~~~
He looks so fecking poor compared to anybody that played in the front 6 today, subs have done more, fecking hell, even Büttner has done more forwards today. I'd as well put some blame on him for AV's goal.

177~~~
Whereas Antonio Valencia clearly has some value other than attacking (where in his poor form, he's offered little...) Ashley Young does not have a single redeeming quality that is better than our other wingers/forwards. Valencia is aggressive and helps win the ball back and can give balance and help in a big match, a few of the things we picked Park for. So its worth keeping him in the games to make sure he isnt lacking match fitness when the big games come around. 

Young is just a mediocre player. He is just an attacker with decent pace who throws a decent ball into the box sometimes and tries to keep it simple with his passing and occasionally pops up with a nice shot. He doesn't run at defenders, he isnt creative, he doesn't bring anything that our other players dont have like Valencia does. He's just a standard europa league winger.

178~~~
A pure waste of space and money. Poor on the ball, offers damn all going forward and not worth a fiddlers when it comes to closing down players or defending. He'll have to be offloaded in the summer, not to sure a lot would be got for him but there's no point in holding onto him now either. He's deadwood.

179~~~
How is he a man utd player. What was fergie thinking?

180~~~
He's not, or wasn't, struggling any more than other players, and not nearly as much as some.

181~~~
Again the weak link in that front 6 today, just needs to be sold in the summer. No idea why we didn't give Nani a chance to pick up some form, as even a frustrating, off form nani is better then this shit.

182~~~
I don't think he was at fault for giving the ball away, he was trying to play a 1-2 with Fletcher and in the space between Young getting the ball and releasing it to pass to back, Fletcher f***** off.

183~~~
Absolutely.

Fergie was dreaming when he bought Young. Now Moyes has taken over this dream and actually believes he is our best winger! 

Wake up Moyes!!!!!!!  Please sell Young and yourself as well....!

184~~~
he really is dire - surely Nani needs a run out?

dont know what happened to him - used to be a pacey, exciting player

185~~~
Along with Valencia, simply not good enough. Unfortunately for us, we were daft enough to pay him huge wages which means we're stuck.

186~~~
Terrible terrible footballer now. He strikes me as one of them who has hit the point of no return.

I'm not surprised he played but the fact a player like him is in this squad cements the fact that perhaps we are where we are quite deservedly.

I didn't mind him when he first joined but he offers absolutely nothing at present and shows no signs of improvement. I hope he plays well when he does so someone takes a punt on him if he's made available for a move.

187~~~
Imagine.... no takers for a Man Utd player.......?

How great is Ashely Young?

188~~~
What was Fergie thinking when he signed him? Why he did that? And why we didn't sign Mata back there?

189~~~
didnt seem that strange at the time, most people were pretty happy to get him I think - even started his United career quite well IIRC

but has regressed massively - tried to give him defensive skills and ended up making him into a nothing player

190~~~
Where did you get the idea of him clearly struggling because of being over played??!! Youngsters do not rest so as to improve/maintain standard. They need to keep playing to get experience on the pitch

191~~~
Actually it's about finding the balance of not overplaying them which Moyes has AND getting enough experience to get that development going.

192~~~
Moyes is managing our club with a mid table mid set.

193~~~
Yea and it's about not burning them out. He's played plenty of games for us, carried this team at times, managing Januzaj is one of very few things Moyes got absolutely right this season.

194~~~
I wasn't at Caf back then (so can't prove anything) but it looked to me a bizarre signing back then. Never rated him at all.

What made me irritated even more is that we could have gone for Mata at that time who even there was the superior player, and while would have cost 5m more or so, his wages would have been lower (considering that he was at 70k at Chelsea, so I guess for something similar would have come here).

195~~~
Moyes' decision to play Januzaj so infrequently without obvious reasons is a mystery. But we get used to his strange decisions do we?

196~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bj5euX8IEAAPl5z.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bj5euX8IEAAPl5z.jpg"/>

197~~~
His management of Januzaj is one of the few bright spots of his tenure thus far. Adnan has surprised most people with how well he's done this season bar the mid-season slump. But most people who have seen young players succeed here have also seen them have slumps at a young age.

Unfortunately Ashley Young is the one he turns to when Adnan is rested now which is a shame.

198~~~
He's awful and is simply not cut out for a club like united. Rubbish signing by fergie.

199~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

200~~~
Can anyone remember him ever making a pass that wasn't either 5 yards or a big slinging cross? Does he have something wrong with his middle distance vision? He's shite

201~~~
Are you kidding me? He should have carried that ball forward, which every intelligent player anticipated, including Fletcher - there was a 20m gap to run into; one flick into attack and he could have started a great attack. Instead he tried a flick backwards to a person willing to join what should have been an attack.

He was utterly abysmal today.

202~~~
There aren't enough negative adjverbs to describe (or there are too many?...) his performance today. Truly dire.

203~~~
Stealing a living playing at this level.

204~~~
I am surprised that Fergie admitted in his book that he signed Young specifically to bridge the gap between us and Barcelona!?!? Surely he had enough of a look at Young to realise the insanity of this very notion. However, in general terms, I think that Fergie's belief levels in his players really lifted them to a higher level.

205~~~
Moyes will be loved by every United fan if he'll successfully deal with Young's problems... unfortunately the player's reaching 30 years of age and from that point it's gonna be difficult especially for a winger to offer something substantial to this team.

206~~~
The Moyes sympathizers take a big hit with Young being a fixture in the side.

It's getting really bad now.

207~~~
What was he like last season, can anyone remember? 

Wasn't he completely anonymous?

208~~~
Pretty much this, but more injured and without the screamers he has scored this season. Pretty much a worse version if you can imagine it. It's funny, because his start in the first season was so promising when he scored those two curling shots from outside the box against Arsenal, but just regressed ever since.

209~~~
Can someone please take him this summer? Cant stand him anymore. He is literally the worst player we have right now in the squad. I really dont get why Zaha was not given a chance. At least he isnt a one trick pony like this fecker over here.

210~~~
I've concluded that the only reason he keeps getting in the team is that he's offering someone on our coaching/management team sexual favors. Truly baffled how he's at this club.

211~~~
Should recall Lingard and give him the game time that Young is going to get rest of the season. There won't be a better time than this to give youngsters a chance in premier league.

212~~~
Was he actually there? No. Wait. He shat more than a few times there

213~~~
Seriously, have we got no youngsters at the club who we can play wide right other than Januzaj?

214~~~
Ashley young judging on his performances in the last two years is one of those players, where i think we could take him off without replacing him and it would have little or no effect on the teams performance or outcome of the game.

He is probably the most underwhelming player i've seen while watching united in the last 25 years.

215~~~
Unfortunately the ones that are most likely to get a chance are all out on loan (Zaha, Lingard, Cole & Barmby).

216~~~
Rich man's David Bellion is what I think of woeful Ashley Young

217~~~
That's harsh...







...on David Bellion.

218~~~
But that's not the point Livvie he needs protected for the long term and isn't hardened or as developed as much as the other players. I'm happy with Moyes playing the long game with him.

219~~~
You are wrong here redevil2 they need rested as much as they need playing or they can really suffer long term

220~~~
I think you were wrong in assuming that Januzaj needs more rest than other 19 year old. lol 
If you have coached young people before, you would know the balance that needs to keep. Although I myself don't have such experience coaching, I do have "authority" to give an opinion. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I am just hoping United has the coach who knows about how to keep the balance between playing and resting.

221~~~
We paid £20 million for him when he had just a year left in his contract. That same summer Mata joined Chelsea for £23 million. Cazorla went to Arsenal for even less. I'm still haunted by his performances at Euro2012. I've never seen a player look so out of depth at an international tournament.

222~~~
To be fair, we can't expect every player we signed is going to perform and excel. Mistake can be made but what's important is to control damage by not using them and getting rid of them. Hindsight is 20/20 but Moyes has the benfit of seeing him training and performing. What we fans saw on the pitch reveals how mediocre he is but Moyes seems to treasure him as much as he did to his signing Fellaini and it's painful to watch

223~~~
And your authority being is what the same as the rest of us? Come on its common knowledge that young players need rested and nursed through parts of their early career. You just have to look at Owen or Pato to see what happens when you over play a youngster. Especially one with the build like AJ who as well as being tested mentally will be even more so tested physically than someone like Jones for example.

224~~~
His thread was full of people who were unimpressed with our interest which unfortunately always attracts a number of hardmen who whipped out hard red stuff like ''Spoiled muppets, he has done amazing for Villa and the 18 million for someone who has one year left on his contract is just the usual United tax, no biggie. You would react differently if his name ended with -inho.''

So yes, I was correct once more. Vindicated but (conveniently) forgotten.

225~~~
Nope. On loan from Fulham to Milton Keynes Dons

226~~~
Thing is he was actually all right during his first few months here, then turned shit. We had the best wings in the league in 2011-12, then the worst in 2012-13 and proceeded to win the league. It's baffling.

227~~~
All I'd like to know is...what's the name of the stuff SAF was smoking when he thought signing Young would bridge the gap between us at Barca at the time? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

...Oh & where can I get my hands on some of that stuff? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

228~~~
You're talking as if Ashley Young doesn't pass the ball around like Andres Iniesta

229~~~
The decision to bring him on against Bayern Munich was understandable. If Moyes used Nani off the bench in our last couple of games to build up his sharpness, then it would be debatable (bringing Young on). His performance, however, was poor - not shockingly poor because it's not a shock that he's performing in this manner. He's not a mediocre player, but he plays like one. There is no confidence in taking players on, he looks weak and tentative. And when he does get into good positions to cross the ball, his delivery is poor...

230~~~
Why did he come on last night? Buttner was injured right?

231~~~
His unused substitute bonus is even higher than his weekly wage.

232~~~
Now that Nani is fit again i think that should be the last we see of young this season, give Nani games to see if he is worth keeping while putting him in the shop window if we do decide to sell.

233~~~
Worth keeping?! Good lord, he's the last winger we should be getting rid of!

234~~~
Im actually a big fan of Nani's, but he's had a bad run of injuries the last 2-3 years, if we give him a run of games and he stays fit and finds a bit of form great, having nani fit and back to his best would be a bonus. 

If we play him and he gets injured again and misses more games, then as much as i like him as a player we need to start shipping out some of the sick notes in this squad.

235~~~
Load him in a cannon, fire him to the moon.

236~~~
I like how Young's megathread doesn't have the word "performance" in it. How fitting.

237~~~
Sadly I think Kagawa and Nani will out the door before Young.

238~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

true.

239~~~
Nani has been declared fit 3-4 games a go. He hasn't played a single second since.

240~~~
Yeah which has disappointed me, villa would have been the perfect game to ease him back him back in.

241~~~
I know it was first-class opposition, but Young was really crap when he came on I think. We are not like those clubs who say things like 'we are not judged by our performances against teams like Manchester United'. For us, games against the likes of Bayern actually tells us a lot about who is capable of taking us to where we need/want to be. Young's cameo confirmed to me that he cannot be expected to have any sort of impact on games of this kind.

242~~~
Do you really need a bayern game to confirm that ashley young is shit?

243~~~
The original meaning of performance is "accomplishment". So yes, fitting indeed.

244~~~
so according to Whoscored he has made 8 accurate crosses from 68 attempts. This excludes corners. Makes 0.9 key passes a game. Basically he is useless yet his name never comes up when the press is talking about Moyes' forthcoming clear out of underperforming players. Even if we spend 200 million in the summer it won't improve us if our spanking new midfield maestros have to pass the ball to Young.

245~~~
There hasnt been any united players who I actively hate - However when seeing him on TV with his arrogant face, conceited demeanour and lack of a footballing brain, he has become the first.

246~~~
If true thats fecking woeful.

247~~~
It's quite worrying that he's not been linked to a single club yet as we near the end of the season, yet there's speculation of some of our actual talent leaving. I do like him as a squad player, but the last thing I want to see is a young talent like Kagawa and Hernandez leave the club and Young still lingering about.

248~~~
It's actually 18 successful in 111 attempts. (16%)


Valenica also has 0.9 Key Passes per game and has completed just 17 of 96 crosses (17%) compared to Young's 16%.


So combined they have 55 appearances between them in which they have:

6 Goals.
4 Assists.
45 Completed Crosses.
249 Attempted Crosses. 


Woeful.

249~~~
What gets me about AY is the amount of wages he's supposedly on. Our problem remains that as much as DM may want rid of him, who would buy him? He isn't going anywhere as they won't pay his wages. We are stuck with him.
I doubt any manager could get a good return from him. Sad really, as he did look good for his first month.

250~~~
I really like Valencia well at least i like the player he was, but those stats are unreal, a good start to this re-building we are supposed to be undertaking would be to sell or release these two. Passengers at this stage.

251~~~
He is on £6.24 million pounds a year. I cannot see any club paying him that, I can see him volunteering himself to rot in the reserves however, worse, I can see Moyes being tempted to play him from time to time and after several poor games, just as David is thinking of dropping him, he will score a screamer.

We have two more seasons of him before his contract runs out but I would sooner pay him off to leave. I think spending £12m of our transfer budget to get rid of him so Moyes cannot play him will be money well spent, David will be forced to play Januzaj on the left then. This will only improve the team!

252~~~
Come to think about it today; extremely weird signing by Fergie. £18m. Jesus!

253~~~
I genuinely don't know what SAF was thinking when he bought Young. £18million and £100k a week. Ridiculous. But, that said, other than RvP and DDG (who were obvious purchases as soon as they became available) I don't think many of SAF's signings in his last two years were particularly good. Kagawa, Buttner, Zaha.

254~~~
Indeed, I would be pretty much in complete despair if I saw even two of Nani/Hernandez/Kagawa leave only for Valencia/Young to stay. Unfortunately I fear that it may well be the case on both counts.

Bit harsh to label Kagawa a bad signing. He's a talented player who hasn't quite found his place in the team; might not have been as good as we hoped (yet) but there was nothing wrong with the decision to buy him. Also, bit early for Zaha as well. Büttner, on the other hand, was a strange one indeed. Surely we could have done better than that for a backup LB. 

Phil Jones was another one from that period, strangely also a bit early to say how that will work out given he's probably here for the long term, but certainly not a bad purchase. Henriquez - impossible to say yet, Powell - the same.

255~~~
We paid tuppence for Buttner though, didn't we?

256~~~
I'm not sure he understood what they meant by "get better soon".

Comment of the month <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

260~~~
I feel sorry for Young. It's clear some people here dislike him because they resent him perceiving to have taken over from the Caf's Beloved.

I thought he played well vs West Ham and got off to a decent start today with one or two crosses early in the game, for the brief time he was on.

261~~~
His son has joined Arsenal, maybe he'll follow in the summer? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

262~~~
It's certainly brave of him to be on twitter considering how bad people are at abusing even the good players.

263~~~
Kagawa was and is a class player, and was signed for only £12m (a fact many forget). He's shown enough to be more hen that already, even if he hasn't been great since he came for various reasons, but he's getting better. No way you could say he was a poor signing. Buttner was signed for like £3m as well was he not? Don't expect much from a 3m signing and he's done alright I guess for the price. 

Zaha and young were shite signings though. People can say give zaha time but he just seems to lack real talent like januzaj, lacks the right mentality and lacks football intelligence.

264~~~
Yeah, <i>that's</i> the reason he gets stick.

265~~~
He has to go down as one of Sir Alex's worst ever signings when you also take into consideration his wages. 

I'd love for fergie to be asked about that quote where he said that we signed young to bridge the gap with Barcelona.

266~~~
This hand injury couldn't have been as bad as described. My old man did his ligaments and had to go under the knife to make sure it healed correctly. Given that it's only been 5 days...he couldn't have possibly had surgery, recovered, travelled to Germany and be declared fit.

Moyes trying to worry us that our Ashley was hurt. I'm so unbelievably happy he's fit..

267~~~
Mind games, he knows how highly Guardiola rates him. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

268~~~
Please get rid of this little turd nugget.

269~~~
Better than Valencia at least.

He's been alright today. Mata and Nani have both been worse.

270~~~
Fergies worst signing. £18m on his final year of contract.

271~~~
10 crosses in one half! One trick pony unfortunately. Thought he started well and then just went back to the player we've seen all too often.

272~~~
It doesn't matter how he plays, but he makes the whole team shite just by being in it. How any number of managers fail to see that is beyond me.

273~~~
Takes a player on, then doesn't even look where he's crossing it. So annoying.

274~~~
This article about Young on the Telegraph is just <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>'Ashley Young is on a par with Lionel Messi'</b>

<b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/3740559/Ashley-Young-is-on-a-par-with-Lionel-Messi.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...hley-Young-is-on-a-par-with-Lionel-Messi.html</a></b></span>

275~~~
I thought he was our best attacking player in that half, by far. He's had a good game IMO.

276~~~
Was just going to write this. He gets in good positions sometimes and then just hits it into a space. If there is a defender in that space it doesn't matter.

277~~~
Agreed.

278~~~
He's looked the most encouraging of our attack four, but a few poor crosses and everyone will be slating him as usual.

279~~~
He can dribble but in the same time almost as accurate as Downing.

He doesn't look where to cross, I can't believe no one told him how to perform these last passes and crosses.

We can't afford to have him in the squad, next season. Sporadic squad player at it's best for a team that <b>SHOULD</b> be aiming for top of the table and cups.

280~~~
He is a winger who can't cross the ball and does nothing except surrender possession.

281~~~
He's useless. The fact he's looked quite dangerous shows how shit the others have been.  

Used to be very direct and dangerous at Villa. After his first 3-4 games here, he's become utterly useless except the odd game.

282~~~
Why doesnt he look up? Its always about crossing in supposed dangerous positions with him. Hasnt been poor but can do much better when he gets into good positions.

283~~~
Why? because he beat his man a few times? 

That means nothing if you then act like a schoolboy and not look up before making your next move. If that's a good game from Young, well then all the more reason to see the back of him in the summer. Not good enough.

284~~~
Well that simply isn't true. He's put in a couple of good balls into the box. He's been uninvolved since moving to the left.

285~~~
He was ok. But his constant attempt at dribbling (if you can call that) by cutting in, then going out, then cutting back in again and going out AGAIN a million times over before he crosses does my head in!

286~~~
It takes a great deal of faith to think that he has any idea where he's crossing it, much less who he is crossing it to.

287~~~
Compared to most others on the pitch, he is having a good game.

288~~~
At least he puts in some decent balls into the box unlike Valencia

289~~~
Why are wentaking this "why doesn't he look up" issue to a whole new level? Lot of worldclass wingers are accustomed to keeping their eye on the ball. It is different for different players, has more to do with instincts than anything.

290~~~
No. IMO he's put in a couple of good crosses into the box. He also started our move leading up to the Nani shot. Note that I did say he's been good, and I think that's a fair assessment of his performance. The one thing that is disappointing is his inability to look up in key situations. To be fair to him, however, he's put in a better performance than most of our players.

291~~~
He puts in crosses in areas rather than try and find the man. There was a move where Hernandez was 10 yards away and just stopped his run but Young didn't bother to look up and pumped the ball straight into the defender.

292~~~
Started brightly, then did what Ashley Young always does, stats to become shit, then eventually disappears.

293~~~
I don't know how he's still wearing our shirt along with other average players when the likes of Veron were pushed out.

294~~~
True, but they're both clearly not good enough. Never mind central midfield, we're in need of a proper winger or two in the summer. Wide men of the class of Sanchez or Di Maria.

295~~~
Woeful

296~~~
You absolutely know for certain that he's not good enough. It's not bad luck. It's not because he isn't motivated. He tries. He really does. He's just not good enough.

297~~~
He needs to go.

He's not a bad player as he shown at Villa, but he's just never managed to make the step up to being a United player.

298~~~
He had a good first half, invisible in the second

299~~~
I see hip replacement surgery in the future of any fullback who has ever played against Young or Valencia. FIFA should consider introducing thigh and hip pads in addition to shin pads.

300~~~
I like the way he doesn't look up for some crosses, while for others, he stops, points where he's going to kick it, backs up four steps and let's her rip.

Shrewd intelligent player.  Build the squad around him.

301~~~
He was dogshit again...what do managers see in him?

302~~~
He was good for the first half hour then went back to his usual self.

303~~~
The amount of balls he sucks to get in the team must be staggering.

304~~~
Why Giggs started him over any player in our squad is beyond me.. Terrible player.

305~~~
Every time I see him on the field I always ask myself; "Why?"

306~~~
He's a decent player but he should never play for a top club.

307~~~
He is far from decent... just frustrating.

308~~~
i think he just signed all his sell my now letters today. Need gone asap.

309~~~
He had one of his better performances for us since he arrived and had a good couple of months. That being said, he hardly looks like he is capable of dribbling, passing, or crossing a football, which are all sort of essential to his position and the game as a whole. He was a good player at Villa so he can probably recapture that form at another club but he hasn't got it for us. Needs to go.

310~~~
Thought he put In a couple of good crosses today in the first half. Not his fault he had only one target in the box. Playing someone like Fellaini could have helped get on the end one of those. I thought he was better than nani for whatever that's worth.

Always hard to play a cross based attack against a team packing players in the box. Harsh reminder of the Fulham game.

311~~~
Hope he fills his car up with a few more, perhaps put Cleverley in the front

312~~~
For a while he was looking like our best player on the day. He had more of the ball than most of our team but that end product was pretty poor. So many aimless crosses with very little accuracy ruined his good work. I'm sure the stats will make grim reading for him. Maybe he could have been subbed earlier to try something different, but we let him persist with that ineffective tactic for too long. 

He's definitely trying.. to control the ball amongst other things, but games like this show up a lack of quality.

313~~~
Hope he never plays for us again really.

314~~~
He started well and then went back to his old self, though that did seem to happen more so when he went left. Still think he should be the first winger out the door in the summer.

315~~~
Im not sure if he is taking the piss anymore or not, just please Ashley, shut up

316~~~
It's worrying that the club's official twitter is even putting these quotes out there considering the whole lot of abuse they will receive.

317~~~
I actually got fooled and thought we would see a change in him after that first 20 minutes. But no, he goes back to showing us why he's nowhere near Manchester United quality

318~~~
We've honestly become a parody of ourselves.

319~~~

320~~~
What a twerp.

321~~~
He's good for maybe two or three quality crosses a game, which usually don't find anyone because no one's positioned inside, and one or two aggressive runs a game.  Offers nothing otherwise.  I'm surprised how many people have said he was better than Nani today, Nani looked far more of a threat with the ball then he did.

322~~~
so it's the manchester united way to win games now?

funny. i thought that was the way of every fecking team in the world.

323~~~
Like Cleverley, Anderson and a few others, Young has had his chance and not taken it. Needs to be moved on.

324~~~
Due to his high wages and poor performances, Young will probably be on the books for a while.

325~~~
You're right on two counts - 1) he was looking like our best player.........but no one usurped him for that "honour", so in fact, he was our best player and 2) ineffective he was.........but mainly because no one got into a decent position to meet his crosses. I disagree his crosses were all aimless - there was no penetration, no-one wanting to meet a ball in. Dire. But he was definitely one of the least dire.

326~~~
Yes

327~~~
Yep, don't see him taking a wage cut to reestablish his career, maybe harsh of me to judge him without knowing him.

328~~~
If he had any ambition on a playing level, you would think he'd actively attempt to leave the club to kick start his career again. He'll only get released in two seasons time when his contract runs out, at which point he'll be 30 and have wasted two years of his career.

329~~~
I felt sorry for him today, at least he was trying and kept wanting the ball. The coward on the other side (Nani) was hiding all game.

330~~~
It saddens me that someone with his sheer lack of quality starts matches for us.

It saddens me that he's a Manchester United player full stop.

331~~~
So what are the possible clauses in a player's contract, if he doesn't play upto expectations ? Can we just like that release him from the books or do we have to pay him wages for whatever time is left on his contract ??

332~~~
When he started the match well I was hoping this would put him in the shop window. As good as the start was, putting in some dangerous crosses, its nothing amazing. Just nice to have some decent delivery for once.

I hope any onlooking scouts and managers left at half time, like Ashley Young basically did

333~~~
Never has been good enough. We're <i>supposedly </i>the biggest team in the premiership yet somebody like Ashley Young is starting for us. Would he get in the squad of any of the other top 4 or 5 squads in Europe never mind the starting 11? Does he even start for England?

It's not his fault but we've really let our standards slide dramatically.

334~~~
He tried but he just hasn't got any quality. Can't beat a man, can't cross. Aside from the occasional worldy what does he really contribute. He should've come off today instead of Nani. Started brightly but faded fast.

335~~~
He could do it at Villa to be fair. Just the latest in a long line of players who freeze at a bigger club.

336~~~
Basically we smuggle some hallucinogens into the food of any scouts at Old Trafford. That's the only way anyone will be ever interested in this non-footballer.

337~~~
He was obviously trying really hard today, and has some quality but no where good enough as a starter for us. Squad player but on big wages for that. Also I feel like him like some others in the team are going to hinder the young players develop if they are holding up the space....

338~~~
Yea, he was alright in his 1st season too. Dunno what's happened to him. He's had his chance now though. Should be moved on to whoever will take him. Newcastle?

339~~~
Forget adding nothing, he subtracts from our play.  He is the first player who should go after Anderson.

340~~~
I was at the match today and he just looked poor. He got himself in some great and dangerous positions but like always he couldn't deliver much. He got booed when he was subbed off and I'm not surprised.

341~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BmuIxylCcAA9eOx.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BmuIxylCcAA9eOx.png"/> 

Not one single completed cross.

How the hell can a player on £130,000 not be able to cross a ball on target?

He gets paid more than:

Marco Reus only £35,000 a week 
Isco only £40,000 a week 
Ángel di María only £91,000 a week, 
Karim Benzema only £100,000 a week 
Alexis Sánchez only £70,000 a week 
Andrés Iniesta only £115,000 a week 
Neymar only £120,000 a week

I just want to cry....

342~~~
Now Young isn't a great player and a coward imo and I've had that opinion sine early last year..but that is a lie - he completed 1 of 16! Give him his due!


..plus if he's crossing and our CMs are jogging around the centre circle while our 1 forward struggles to get free of 2 CBs what do you expect? A lot of our problems begin with our midfield. To play a crossing game we need runners - we haven't had any bar Fellaini when he had a few good games vs dross mid-season.

343~~~
Not surprising that his crossing success rate is so poor - he never fecking looks up. Sofia Vergara could be completely naked in front of him and he'd still be staring down at his fecking feet.

344~~~
It doesn't matter. He needs to pick his head up and aim at our players that are there (3-4 at a time in the box). He just aims nowhere. The ball either doesn't go past the first person, or goes past everyone.

He needs to aims just behind he defenders.

This problem is evident in all our fullbacks and wingers. WTF? I feel sorry for Moyes in the quality he had to deal with when he had the best LB crosser of the ball.

People complain why we cross, but we have to! They pack the midfield and we don't have the quality to go through the middle. ALL TOP TEAMS do this.

Hopefully Van Gaal will sort his mess out.

345~~~
Ashley Young is simply stealing a living at this level. With his lack of quality, he should not be anywhere near our first team.

346~~~
Young, like Valencia and Nani are roughly in their late 20's, but all three are past their best already. Young built his reputation on 2 or 3 great seasons at Villa but apart from a good debut season has struggled with fitness and form, and will probably not rediscover it bar some miracle. Valencia and Nani also had great moments but have withered since. 

Their stars have fallen and we must look to how we can replace them with better quality players!

347~~~
fecking hell lads his wage goes up every week! He's definitely not on 130k <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

348~~~
Young should have been banned from the 18-man squad a very long time ago. He's a sorry excuse of a Man Utd player and should have been shipped as quickly as Veron ended up being shipped away when it was clear he couldn't make it. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

349~~~
He's absolutely atrocious. It's a real shame nobody will pay to take him off us.

<a class="username" data-user="34129, @mufcwarm92" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34129/">@mufcwarm92</a> 

He's on over 100k a week.

Either way, it's a fecking joke.

350~~~
Every week since when? Thats what it was reported when we signed him.

351~~~
That was fecking pathetic. Someone who boos one of their own players is immediately identifiable as a cnut.

352~~~
No it wasn't. It was originally reported around 90k, then largely agreed on as 118k (still sounds a little unlikely). Not sure where you've plucked 130k from.

353~~~
#HunchbackYoung

354~~~
He's obviously not good enough for us, but he'd be brilliant for a team with aerial threats in the box, playing a simpler game. West Ham should really go for him if they're keeping Allardyce.

355~~~
They can have Young, Fellaini and Valencia.

Sadly, thats pretty much the level for those three.

356~~~
I'm not ready to give up on Fellaini, though he might require a lobotomy.

357~~~
Valencia has a lot of positive qualities and could help the right team. He works hard, is a consistent short passer and has pace.  

RWB for Juve, splitting time with Lichtsteiner, playing RW on a team that plays mostly on the counter, or doing Ramires' role for Brazil under Dunga where you're an RCM that basically covers the right side with your pace (along with a pacey FB) allowing the team to play 3 attacking players.

358~~~
What the feck is going on with the wage structure at this club!?

359~~~
Some of our supporters are an embarrassment, not our best player but he's still one of us.

360~~~
We have to cross you say... yet none of our players (CMs especially) actively try to get to them... are our 1 or 2 strikers supposed to get to them surrounded by 3- 4 defenders? The CMs take so long to get the ball out wide it's pointless - they take long to pass adn don't trail play to score.

361~~~
Yep, agree. It's sad and pathetic.

362~~~
Rawking post

363~~~
Probably from here

etc

364~~~
One of who? He basically got paid £100k for that today. He's not one of anyone. Disgusting.

365~~~
He's a United player. He's not playing well. He earns lots of money. Does that make it ok for his own fans to boo him? No.

366~~~
He's an unlikeable little turd. He always was at Villa, nothing has changed.

367~~~
Just my opinion on it. Can't see anything productive from booing a player, he had a shit game, he knows it, doesn't need his own supporters getting on his back.

368~~~
This isn't very good. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps7c2ae4ce.jpg" src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps7c2ae4ce.jpg"/>

369~~~
How? It's utterly embarrassing.

370~~~
What teams function where 1 member simply isn't up to it? What team would allow a member to put in a complete no show time & time again & not get any criticism? 
He was rightly jeered off the pitch, fans are allowed an opinion.

371~~~
They are but my opinion is either support every player out there or feck off home, the fickle feckers would probably sing his name if he scored an injury time winner.

372~~~
So happy clap everything despite how shite it is. No wonder Moyes lasted so long here.

373~~~
unacceptable booing a player wearing the shirt.
I never did..but then I am a supporter not a customer.

...or am I just old school.?

374~~~
You're just not a cnut. Anyone who goes to a game and boos their own player will be rightly regarded by those around them as such.

375~~~
I don't know how a player like him made it this far into his contract with Manchester United. We used to be more ruthless about the quality we expect from our players in the past.

376~~~
this

377~~~
No. Who suggested that? 

What would you achieve by booing a player? Make them play better? Make them realise they're playing badly? Make the manager realise they're playing badly? You have to be a fecking simpleton to believe any of that could be the case. It achieves nothing, is probably actually counter intuitive and it makes you look like an idiot. Well done.

378~~~
It really isn't, lad has proven numerous times, he's simply not up to it. Clapping someone who doesn't pull his weight on numerous occasions just as "he wears the shirt" is not the correct way to go about things. There's a requirement to be a United player, if someone falls below it, they get feedback.

379~~~
As in my post above, what's the point? What does it achieve? I'd love to know what possesses people to act like such twats. Do you think he doesn't realise he is having a bad game?

380~~~
Never thought I would say this, but Milner actually is a better footballer than Young and I have a very low opinion on Milner as a footballer!

381~~~
I couldn't possibly see how he might have thought he'd had a good game. I expect had Sir Alex still have been there he'd have got a roasting over his performance. Is no different when the fans boo. He brought nothing to the team & got feedback. If he doesn't like it he could do the decent thing & request a transfer, I'm sure they'd still have him back at the Villa.
As for being a twat for booing someone? Really? Have you never been to a game and heard a lot of the chants aimed at opposing fans & players. You must be wumming with a comment like that.

382~~~
Milner would be first choice as our CM.

383~~~
Who's saying we should sing his name? Haven't heard his chant for months. Same goes for Moyes, he was shit, did we boo him? No, instead we focused on something else.

384~~~
Your missing the point here.

385~~~
Why would he move when the teams that will want him will offer half, if not less than half his current wage. He stinks out the place and has done for the majority of his time here. Even in his first season he at times played shite but at least popped up with an assist or goal. Now he does feck all but hand possession back to the other team.

386~~~
If someone obviously isn't trying then I can understand booing etc, but he always puts in a shift. It's more on the fact that a large number of fans actively dislike him.

387~~~
He certainly doesn't always put in a shift. He worked hard for about 50 mins today

388~~~
Was he getting booed?

389~~~
If a player is a shit, he's shit. He's frustrating and has done it for two years straight. I don't agree with the booing but I just know he'll sit on his fat wage and leave on a free.

390~~~
Got to the stage whenever I saw the ball heading to the right side of the pitch, I just switched off knowing we would turn it over.

391~~~
I couldn't watch the game today so I was unaware Young got booed, however, I think people seem to forget that players don't purposely go onto the pitch to play bad. 

In my opinion, Young isn't good enough for United, but I'd never boo my own player. It's up to the management whether they want to keep him or not. Whilst he's at United, he won't be getting booed by me. Disgraceful behaviour, in my opinion.

392~~~
I didn't boo him but wanted him off the pitch after 15 mins. He is completely out of his depth at United, he doesn't possess the attributes needed to help take the team back to the top. His crossing is below average, the amount that fly past everyone giving them absolutely no chance of creating a goal scoring opportunity, or cannon off the arse or back of the first defender is ridiculous. Surely come the summer we will see the end of his playing days at United, a club like Newcastle or QPR (if they get promoted) or even Sunderland would take him.

393~~~
If he's told he's got no future at the club, I think he'd at least leave on loan. Newcastle or Wham could cover his wages if there was no fee I reckon.

394~~~
Neither would pay him 100k a week.

395~~~
I don't agree with booing your own players, but I find it unbelievably hard to feel any sort of sympathy for Ashley bloody Young. The guy is such an unbelievable coward, who is stealing a wage at United and needs to be shipped out as soon as physically possible.

396~~~
Actually, he seems an incredibly nice guy, one of the nicest at United in fact. It's just he is a dreadful cheat is all.

397~~~
Maybe not 100k but what are they paying Carroll, Downing?

398~~~
You know a player is simply £ucking utter $hite when your Girlfriend (who watched a full 90mins of utd for the first time in about 10 years) states and I kid you not

"Why the feck does he keep kicking the ball into the defender"

Sums up everything that has always been said about Young!!

OUT NOW!

399~~~
You referred to supporters as twats for rightly booing a player. I'd say that was a tad harsh. A twat would make personal comments at him for not playing well. He was simply boo'd if he can't take that then he'd need to look at what he does for a living. Paid very well to perform in front of a crowd & has done very little to show he's capable for a long time now! Go to a lot of performances & watch it suck lemons, you'll get people who boo, doesn't make them twats it is simply a way of showing displeasure.

400~~~
No, I said supporters who boo their own players / manager are twats. You go to Old Trafford to support your team regardless of how shit they are.

401~~~
In your opinion yes, but to label anyone a twat for being of a differing opinion is wrong. I see nothing wrong with it & it's part of the game, fans voicing their opinions. Not blindly clapping a sub standard performance and numerous other such performances. Imagine if no one ever complained, where would the world be?

402~~~
I've never booed a player but it's disingenuous to act like he was booed for having bad game rather than a shit career at United.  It's just one more nail in the coffin and after a shit team performance, the one player everyone seems to be in agreement isn't up to United standards was booed.  It's not really hard to figure out why.  They booers are done with him as a United player.

403~~~
Booing opposition players and chanting about them is part and parcel of the modern game. Booing your own players is out order. It does indeed make them twats and it serves absolutely no purpose other than probably making them play worse.

404~~~
Again though, what does it achieve? It's the logic of a simpleton. The only possible outcomes are negative.

405~~~
I feel sorry for him getting booed yesterday

He's a limited player on a big wage - that's not his fault and he tried hard yesterday 

Time to move him on ....

406~~~
how much would it cost to release him? We are better off paying him to leave like Westham did with benni Mcarthy

407~~~
Liverpool did well to get rid of Stewart Downing

I'd let him go for 5-10 million - he'd need to take a pay cut or perhaps we would end up topping up his wage 

Think someone like West Ham, Sunderland, Stoke might be interested in him

408~~~
He deserves the booing. Fans are tired of his performances, and when you can't even do a basic thing like looking up and getting a decent cross in then you're not doing what you're being paid to do. Just get him out of the club in the summer.

409~~~
And the booing achieves what exactly?

410~~~
Telling him to feck off.

411~~~
I've never been booed in my place of work but I imagine it would have more of a detrimental effect on my performance and put me under more pressure 

I think fans who boo are pathetic in the case of players who lack the ability but not the effort 

You couldn't say he didn't try yesterday Freak?

I think he needs to be moved on but booing him is hardly gonna achieve that - be a supporter

412~~~
And you honestly think that might be the result of it? He knows he's playing badly, so does the manager. He's low on confidence. Only thing it will do is further knock his confidence. Such flawed logic. Plus, of course, everyone around you will think you're a twat.

413~~~
Exactly. It's one of my pet hates in football. He's a player who can clearly be criticised for his performance, but he's never fallen short on effort.

414~~~
Can't say I was happy with the booing but the sentiment was correct, time to move on I think, Aston Villa or Newcastle.

415~~~
Booing your own players is not part of the game, it's shit like this that's killing the atmosphere at the OT. It's the Ashley Young thread so I'm not going to derail it, there's one on booing <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/booing-our-players.378746/page-9">here</a>.

416~~~
I dont like it when fans are booing their own players but honestly I just dont want to see him in a United shirt anymore. There are so many better/cheaper options than him, I think he makes that kind of money at United only because he is English.

417~~~
Who cares if he was booed? He is being paid £ 120.000 per week, if as a footballer for United he can't even get himself to look up before he crosses, then he deserves to never play again for us! 

I couldn't care less if he seems to be trying or not. If he really is trying, then why not sit for 5 mins, think about what he is doing wrong, and work on it? How difficult is it to learn to look up before crossing?? 

All over the footballing world footballers get booed. They have to deal with it! A section of Bayern fans booed Robben in a friendly between Bayern Munich and The Netherlands in the Allianz Arena which was played a few days after the CL final 2012. Because Robben missed the pen against Chelsea and generally didn't have his best game. He also missed a pen in a decisive league game against Dortmund a few weeks before the CL final 2012. Now that's harsh to boo him for that, but they did. Guess what? He stayed strong and helped them to the treble the following year.

418~~~
Does anyone really believe, that with United being arguably the most supported club in the world, with a status as certainly being one of the top five that Ashley Young should really be starting for matches in a United team? I mean seriously? If so...then we should start reconsidering ourselves as a mid-table team with outside ambitions of making the top five each season. Total waste of a good position...sorry

419~~~
He's not good enough but booing your own players gains absolutely nothing and frankly, is quite unsavory. I hope he is sold in the summer but Young doesn't deserve a booing. He's not thrown his dummies out of the pram and asked to leave, he's not said something idiotic. All he's done is try hard (despite that not being very good) and he's dived quite a lot.

420~~~
He has dropped off a cliff since he signed for us.

For Villa he was always a pacy dynamic forward thinking player with an eye for goal who was capable of playing across the forward line.
He was great at free kicks, could finish, could beat a man.

Here he just looks like a player who wants it all to end, to be fair he needs to be shipped out as he is finished for us.

421~~~
Surely, he won't be at the club next season? We should include that in Van Gaal's contract.

422~~~
Unfortunately Young's contract will keep him at the club until it runs out. United can't sell him.

423~~~
Can't we sell him and pay the differential wages till his contract would have run out with us? Or break the contact and pay him whatever we have to. Big wages and game time for a player like him at a club like ours is laughable

424~~~
There will be plenty of clubs that will take him on, we just won't get a lot for him.

425~~~
It's his decision. Go and play at a lower club or go through the motions at United and collect a massive wage. He is going to stay here for as long as he possibly can.

426~~~
Booing any of our players is pathetic, but I honestly hope I never have to see Ashley Young in a Manchester United shirt ever again. He's f*cking woeful. He tries his best but he's just completely shit. His passes are all backwards to the fullback or CM and his crosses are all aimless punts that he simply pumps into the box without lifting his head up for a second to see where his teammates are. He's so out of his depth it's untrue. He's an extremely limited player and the quicker we get him off our books the better.

427~~~
Too bad that buying out a contract is not something that can be done in football unlike in other sports.

428~~~
LVG will absolutely hate this joke of a player. He is harmful to the team, his aimless overhit crosses actually effect morale and the crowd after the 15th one sails off into the crowd.

I have to say I don't think I've seen a worse player in the entire prem this season he's been that bad. Literally the worst player I've ever seen in a united shirt.

429~~~
United will not only be held to ransom bringing players in but also we'll be extorted, trying to offload them.  Who would pay over £5m for Young, Valencia or Nani?   Anderson will either stay or be given away.  We may get a million for Buttner, £2m if we sold Lindegaard?

Carrick & Fletcher have little transfer value after the season we've seen them have & Carrick will be on big money.  If you want to see the back of them, don't expect more than £5m for the pair.

We're getting zip if the three defenders leave, we know that much which, will possibly lead to them staying, for another, CL free season.

430~~~
Hope the first thing LVG does is cancel Young entry card to Carrington and then puts him on the transfer list.

431~~~
Who else are you going to be disappointed at their staying next season?

432~~~
Did you never see Djemba Djemba play? Bellion? Prunier? Obertan?

We've had quite a few worse players. He's a decent winger who played out of his skin in his first season, is just short of the level of United and looks much worse now that he's in such dire form.

433~~~
Are you his agent? You seem to be getting very wound up about this. Go have a lie down.

434~~~
Him and Downing have the same mentality. When Downing went through on goal vs Spurs yesterday he had no intention of taking a shot. He was happy for someone to touch him so he could fall over and avoid the possibility of missing. Young should be playing at a club similar to West Ham. He should be the first one sold this summer.

435~~~
Agreed. Both are absolute cowards.

436~~~
Head down, run in circles, give it away.

Ashley Young.

437~~~
Some of his crosses were decent yesterday, in fact he provided more quality in that regard than Nani or Januzaj when he came on. Other players, Carrick and Jones whipped in good crosses and nobody was there as usual. Anyone booing Young off yesterday was a disgrace to the club, it's embarrassing behaviour. One day the club may fall on real bad times, and players like Ashley Young may be the best we can afford as a club. I bet those supporters will be nowhere near then. I wonder how many booing yesterday had his name on the back of their shirts a few seasons ago. It was the same with Fellaini when I was at the City game, and I couldn't help but think how many of the twats had bought those Fellaini wigs only 6 months previously.

438~~~
Awful awful player, looks worse than ever this season.

439~~~
Not just with Young but a number of players have done this, this season, but why when there is a quick or simple pass to a team mate, they just stand on the ball and take so many unnecessary touches of the ball. Multiple times Young could of played in Evra on the left or a quick in field ball to Mata.

440~~~
Fixed.

441~~~
He looks completely shot of confidence. Don't think he's been right ever since that England penalty miss in the Euros along with regular injuries. His first season was fairly decent for us despite missing chunk in the middle due to injury, and he just looked a lot more confident. Went in to the Euros in pretty good form (scored 4 consecutive friendlies), and then had a pretty poor tournament finishing with that penalty.

He just seems to run away from the ball now, head down, shoulders hunched up as if he's trying to hide behind someone in case someone spots him in space and passes him the ball. He was probably never going to be a great player for us, but I thought he'd be a pretty decent option.

442~~~
Booing or heckling a player should never be condoned, no matter how ineffective his performance is. It accomplishes nothing apart from creating an atmosphere of negativity within the stadium. He's really not as terrible as some might suggest. I'd agree that he's not a United level player. But can we fault Young for jumping at the chance to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world ? That was a once in a lifetime opportunity for him.

The fault doesn't lie entirely with Young. He tries a bit and has a decent workrate. However he clearly doesn't have the mental toughness or technical level expected of a player at the highest level. The fault lies with the club for signing him. That is why I feel a bit of sympathy for Young. He's clearly overwhelmed by the pressure that accompanies being a United player. Just like our last manager couldn't come to grips with the expectations at United. Neither of them had the credentials. So we can't really blame them implicitly.

With that in mind it'd be best for the likes of Young and even Cleverley to move in the summer and re-invent themselves at clubs with lower expectation levels. It'd be the ideal solution for everyone involved. They can be productive for a number of teams within the league.

443~~~
I would give Cleverley a year or two to prove himself. I don't know what's happened to him but up until he got injured against Bolton in 2011-12 I thought he was absolutely magnificent for his age.
This particular season shouldn't be a proof for any player because none of the established players played better than the year before.

Spot on about Young.

444~~~
I fecking wish I was. But this applies to any United player and really has nothing to do with Young personally - I would rather he wasn't around next season too.

It winds me up big time though. Sad little scrotes booing their own player, which unsurprisingly makes him play worse. It's an embarrassment to the rest of our support. Grow up.

445~~~
Hmm you're probably right about Cleverley mate. But I just feel that permanent damage has been done to his psyche. It takes a player of supreme mental fortitude to recover from the barrage of abuse that Tom has suffered - what with the twitter petitions and him closing his account to sarcastic cheers at Old Trafford. He comes across as an extremely sensitive and self aware person. And I just can't see him turning his career around at United. Cleverley's reaching the prime years for a footballer and sometimes you have to be selfish. It think it's established on good authority that he's not starter material for United. And being on the bench as a bit part player will do him no favours. Of course he might want to stay at his boyhood club. But it will only stagnate him further and hurt his chances with the national team. I could be wrong but IMO Cleverley needs a change of scenery and he'd be better served being a club where he's appreciated - like Everton where Martinez rates him highly. Barry is a really good example of that. Unloved at City but a vital player now at Goodison Park. If Cleverley puts his head down and works hard he can be a core player for a slightly lesser club. Then again that's just IMO. We'll have to wait and see what happens. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

446~~~
Here here. A bit of sense.

447~~~
This marvels me.  How could he sink so low from that?

448~~~
I never found him good at Villa either. No clue why on earth you would buy a sub top player there for that amount of money.

Either SAF hit the bottle to much or he heard how good he was on Fifa from the younger lads. Eitherway Young is a disaster who is ruining pretty much every attack through him. Baffled Giggs keeps playing him.

449~~~
At least one of the sympathisers in the last few pages has to be Young/his agent/close relative.

450~~~
There are some here who would say its understandable that the players didn't give 100% throughout the season because of how shit they saw Moyes was as a manager, and wanted him gone. The same argument can also be put about us fans booing players like Young, who has been here for much longer than Moyes, and has surely shown himself to be totally out of his depth. It boggles most of United fans mind why he is in the starting lineup most of the time. If booing him means he is shipped out sooner, then I am all for it.

451~~~
Booing is shite, no matter who the player is. It benefits nobody whatsoever. I always laugh, because it's these same guys that sings Rooney's names to the rafters.

452~~~
Fair enough mate. But IMO the problem with this line of thought is that United never sells players based on fan opinion. That doesn't mean we're not entitled to one. Absolutely not. But what I'm suggesting is that Young will only be shipped out if the powers that be do the due diligence and conclude that he's not suitable for the club going forward. Booing and chanting will not sway their opinion. So instead of heckling Young why not just support the team. Whistling and booing by certain pockets only sends out negative vibes in a precarious time for the club. We're the most vulnerable we've ever been in 25 years. It's the time for solidarity, not for infighting among supporters or bullying specific player - whether it's Young or Cleverley or Nani or whoever.

453~~~
Even though Cleverley has been playing shit for the past season or two, he can do better than that.

I'll reserve my judgment on whether he should be here long term after I see what Louis Van Gaal can do with him. If he tries hard to get back to his best under Van Gaal and do what Henderson did in overcoming criticism and realize his potential, he'll stay. After all he's going to be 25 next season; still got a good few years ahead of him and produce a second wind. I'm not saying that he's going to come back to his best for sure, but I'd still be patient with him for the next couple of years.

Can the same be said for Young? I doubt it. He's turning 29 next season, already leeching off what is reported to be 130k per week, which is quite frankly appalling to pay that much money for a player of his caliber. Not to mention it's annoying to see him constantly playacting.

454~~~
I have a different view of booing. Fans should be allowed to express themselves. This whole blindly supporting whatever the club does is straight out of Mao's little red book. A lot of United fans are snobs who think things like booing are beneath them. In the real world fans boo players, managers, club owners/chairmen when they are unhappy. 


If your MP doesn't deliver should you blindly support him because you are Labour or Conservative? If your child misbehaves should you smile and pat him on the head? Being a football fan involves a range of emotions. Fans should be free to express anger, happiness, disappointment etc. If our fans started fighting or invading the pitch then I would be concerned.

455~~~
You got a point. It happens at pretty much every club. And its the only way to be heard.

But the problem is, we all know Ashley Young is an untalented idiot who never should play. Its the trainer who still picks him. He deserves the flame for it. Not Young.

456~~~
It lets the player and others in charge of team know he is no longer wanted. Pretty simple.

457~~~
Rooney gets cheered for running about and playing crap passes. What do you expect.

Jesus, look at that line up, no proper right back and a Midfield four of Nani, Cleverley, Anderson and Young. What happened?

Anderson and Cleverley as a midfield two was tremendous until Cleverley got kicked up into the air by Kevin Davies.

The comment from Rio that he needed a thick skin couldn't be more apt. Fair play to him for taking it on the chin and ignoring the massive set of cnuts that largely populate our fan base.

475~~~
It's ridiculous how much hate this lad gets. He's not our best player but I like having him in the squad.

There's certainly an argument to be made that since he's been here he's been more useful than Nani and Kagawa.

476~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://25.media.tumblr.com/17af8c0d26b1b56411b4e030c857736f/tumblr_moixogQT2J1rd35cbo1_250.gif" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/17af8c0d26b1b56411b4e030c857736f/tumblr_moixogQT2J1rd35cbo1_250.gif"/>

477~~~
2 goals and 4 assists in 51 games last two seasons.

He's like the result of a freakish genetic experiment where Nani's lack of work rate and mental fortitude was combined with Valencia's lack of ability to do anything other than run about without the ball.

478~~~
I agree that the hate is stupid and OTT, but he's certainly not been useful over the last 2 years and should leave based on his performance level

479~~~
2 goals and 4 assists in 2 seasons is not remotely good enough. Why do people always have to compare squad members to other squad members when assessing whether they're good enough or not? It's clear that in the last two years Nani and Kagawa have not been good enough either so it's not like there's any point to that statement.

480~~~
Someone like Schurrle, Coutinho or Lallana is the type of back-up / squad player we should have. Players who actually provide goals and assists.

481~~~
I'm not a fan of Young, but i'm sure you would've labelled him as a type of back up / squad player when Young was at Villa, as he was constantly providing goals and assists. I think the problem is, he just hasn't been able to make that step up at United, unfortunately.

482~~~
Where do people get their numbers from? It's the second time I've spotted ungrounded Young stats in this very thread. He's got 3 goals and 10 assists in the last couple of years. That's obviously nowhere near good enough but at least be fair with the issue. He averaged roughly 45 minutes in each of his 30 games this season and 60 minutes a game in 2012/2013 and got 3 goals, 10 assists. Pretty bad but not as horrendous as it looks when you say 2 goals and 4 assists in two years.

He needed roughly 180 minutes to produce a goal (goal or assist) this season. Suddenly not as tragic, eh?

There's a decent player somewhere in him, his Aston Villa record is staggering for a presumably 'poor' player. He's been a 20 + man (goals + assists) in every season since and including 07/08 season prior to 2012/13 and <i>made</i> 20 goals in 33 games in his first season here. He's also been fine for England apart from the Euro 2012.

To sum up I don't see him as United quality but then again, none of our wingers currently is. We should aim much higher than that but what gets on my tits is this blasphemy of incorrect numbers and failing to see that he, like Hernandez, played little football this year which you won't understand when you're merely looking at the number of games played.

483~~~
Why is he still a United player? We should spend some of our warchest paying a club to take him off our books.

484~~~
Support QPR on Monday.

Hopefully Harry will take him off our hands.

485~~~
Haha. That video cracked me up. Good on you Young, that he's enjoying himself amongst the pathetic abuse.

486~~~
Define useful.

487~~~
There's certainly an argument to be made that since he's been here he's been more useless than useful.

488~~~
A moronic argument, maybe.

489~~~
The only reason what's keeping him at the club is this ridiculous contract and fact that he had appearances in England International.

Januzaj will destroy his chances quickly next season. Another fruitless matches from Young will be documented in Louie's famous notebook and won't be easily forgotten.

490~~~
Sometimes when we've needed an impact in a game he's delivered. Hull 3-2, Crystal Palace 2-0, Stoke in the cup. Had some good games against the big clubs. Arsenal 8-2, when he did very well v Chelsea. 

He looked shit this year. So did many other players. Not sure why he gets so much hatred, especially as he has been massively involved with some very good deeds for our fans and clearly loves the club.

491~~~
I still want him to do well here. He seems like a good guy.

492~~~
He's been shit for two seasons. I don't hate him. I blame managers for picking him, when there are several players that I'd rather see get his minutes. The only situation where he's more useful than Nani is when Nani's injured.

493~~~
Isn't it very easy crack you up now too?

Considering some of the crap he has served up in recent times he has no right to be enjoying himself at all. If he was serious about sorting his shit out he should be keeping his head down and working hard instead of bopping up and down like a clown in his car and posting it on the internet. I can't imagine LvG being impressed with that caper.

494~~~
FFS. This is exactly what I mean.

495~~~
What because he had a poor season he should not have a life?

496~~~
Who cares if he's a good guy? All I want is a player who performs on the pitch even if he can be an absolute nutter off from it.

497~~~
I think the issue with Young and Valencia and this backlash against the two goes beyond their actual performances. Their performances are half the reason why they are so disliked now and the other half is that people on here are not convinced with the type of players that they are. In the age of "wingers" playing closer to the centre and looking for options other than blindly crossing the ball, we have two wingers who can seemingly do only that. It is especially annoying when you watch wingers like Reus, Pedro (at his best), di maria... They have so much variety to their game whereas Young and more so Valencia do the same thing over and over.

It's a bit unfair because the club bought them knowing the type of players they are but there you have it.

498~~~
Or you could just take his stats in the games that actually matter (Prem, CL and FA cup).

In those three competitions he has scored 2 goals and assisted 4 times in two seasons. Fact. And that's from 33 starts and 18 appearances off the bench.

If you like we could say that the starts are ~60 minutes (he's usually subbed early for abysmal performances) and the sub appearances are ~30 minutes. That's a goal or an assist every 420 minutes. Appalling.

For comparison, over the last two seasons Nani (3 goals, 5 assists) contributed every 203 minutes. Valencia (5 goals, 11 assists) contributed every 308 minutes.

499~~~
Surely you want every player to do well that plays for us. 

Sadly he hasn't performed. And we should look to sell him. That video just shows what everything is wrong with him. Dropped from World Cup squad and rightly so should be keeping his head down.

500~~~
It's interesting to see how Young has become so one-dimensional in his play when, back then, he could play out wide and through the middle. He used to deal with 1-on-1's very well. He used to know when to cut in and when to stay out wide. He used to be very good at crossing the ball. His set pieces were very good.

Now, he's bad at 1-on-1's. He's weak on the ball, and his movement has worsened, so he rarely cuts in and is often staying out wide jinking left and right without even getting past his man. His crossing has been quite inaccurate. His passing's also gotten worse. He's just gotten worse in just about everything, so much so that I find Whittingham and Mutch better than Young in many aspects.

I think Young's confidence has shattered to the point that it's irrecoverable. He just can't do much right. Under van Gaal, he doesn't fit anywhere in his system. It's best for him and for Man. Utd. that he leaves so that he can get back to his best and so we can have players that fit into the system.

501~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Get a grip.

502~~~
People hate Young because at his best he is the player who will be MOTM vs Stoke, or will have decent game against City. He'll never play as great winger, he'll never impress you with his performance, at his best he is good squad player and that's it, and that "best" happens so rarely that people forget he can be a decent player. His style of play is unattractive, I can't remember when is the last time he tried to beat his defender, and apart one or two screamers per season he won't do anything else that will impress you. He has so negative mentality you just see he isn't player for top team. There was one game this season where his average position was almost identical to Evra's, and apparently he was winger in that game and Evra played as fullback. Apparently he is good at setpieces, but we scored around 2 goals after his deliveries from set pieces. They also said his crossing from open play is good, but most of his crosses from left would be too high even for Crouch who would be standing at back post. I remember us one time scoring after his cross, and that was probably overhit too, when Giggsy scored against Norwich. There was also one game when his every single completed pass was backpass. For some reason we play him ahead of more talebted players like Januzaj, Kagawa or Nani, only to sub bim after 50 minutes. His dives from past few seasons were embarassing as it gets(altough tbf looks like he cut that out of his game this season).

I don't think he is that bad player as some do, I think he can be good squad player, and he seems like a decent person in real life, but it's really not hard to see why people dislike him as a player.

503~~~
I'm not a huge Young fan, obviously, but does anyone else actually think that he may flourish a little under LVG? He is quite similar to a poor man's Robben; he does possess decent pace, has a good shot on him and links up fairly well with his team mates. His defensive work is also, well, tenacious, at least. He suffered under Moyes in a 4-4-2 system where his job was somewhat unclear. Like Robben, he basically has to cut in and shoot or cross with his preferred foot. He's not a 4-4-2 winger because he lacks the ability to go past defenders with the ball to make a proper cross from out wide. He is very good at managing to get two or three yards on a defender to chip in a ball or be able to get a shot in; that's a lot more useful in a 4-3-3.

504~~~
He'd need to learn how to actually look up and cross the ball to a man rather than aimlessly doing the same thing over and over to flourish under Van Gaal.

I don't think he's going to learn how to do something new/better at this stage in his career.

505~~~
His defensive work should be decent given that he was a full back before he came to Aston Villa.

He was very dangerous for Villa in that he could deliver a good cross out wide but could also cut in and make himself dangerous in the middle. Houllier even put him in the middle so that he could do more damage there instead of just cutting in from the left side often.

I think he did suffer from playing a more rigid role out wide. His dribbling isn't as good as it used to be, so he's not as good at 1-on-1 situations, anymore. Just by staying out wide, Young is ineffective. He's much better when given more freedom to play than just stay out wide and cross the ball in.

That said, I don't think Young can ever get back to his best. His confidence seems shattered, and he doesn't seem like he fits in here, anymore. He'd be better off going to another club where he can reestablish himself.

506~~~
After years of Giggs and Ronaldo, he never had a chance.

507~~~

508~~~
Young has zero chance playing under Van Gaal, the guy has no sign of a footballing brain he breaks down more passing moves than Rooney haha

509~~~
If I see the 'he might flourish under van gaal' crap in another poor-performing player's thread I think I might vomit.

Is there anyone van Gaal isn't going to fix?

510~~~
I have a feeling Van Gaal might sort Young out. Not just on the pitch but off it too. No more of this silly notion of enjoying himself.

511~~~
So is he not allowed to enjoy himself in his car? Why should his performances on the pitch dictate whether or not he is allowed the radio on whilst he is driving?

512~~~
I think people believe we have Jesus Christ as our new manager, and even he couldn't turn young into a good player. I think that's young, bebe and cleverley I've heard this about now. Anyone else going to become a world beater under van gaal?

513~~~
He seems to be right from the same school as your typical bellend 'street' footballer that wears his jeans hanging down to his ankles and listens to nothing but Jay-Z. Defoe and Rio have always been the flag-bearers.

Or maybe I just hate him and that song.

514~~~
God that gif had me in stitches <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

515~~~
Perhaps I didn't know League Cup doesn't count now but anyway, if you want to be picky, he's got 2 goals and 9 assists which is goal or assist per 243 minutes. Fact.

516~~~
I know it's fashionable to say that Young is totally hopeless but I thought he actually did OK last season overall. He at least gave us a pacy outlet for defences to worry about while allowing others like Mata or Kagawa to do their thing. Similar job to Welbeck when he plays on the flanks. 

I still hope we could get better though.

517~~~
It's really not fashionable at all. He was average at best. 

That is his problem and the problem people have with him. At best he's just about OK. 

He is the perfect example of why some fresh blood has to be brought in to improve some key areas in the team. The wings are right up there in the list of priorities and it's no surprise we've been linked with Reus and Robben - although obviously neither will happen.

518~~~
What the feck are you on? He is more useful than Kagawa? You really must be blind. I think you are the only one who likes to have him in our squad.

519~~~
Ok, as in what level? the level required to be a squad player at United or a squad player at Newcastle, Villa or Southampton? look at Ji Sung Park as an example of what a squad player at this club should be, look at Javier Hernandez since he's arrived. Young pales in comparison.

He's part of the dross that we need to clear out.

520~~~
Agree, hence my last sentence. 

I just think that people sometimes unfairly singled out Young for criticism when other players were just as bad but seemed to largely get away with it.

521~~~
I can't believe some people are actually defending Young after the season he had.

522~~~
OK as in OK. Not great, not even good just OK. As in as OK as Valencia, Nani, etc

523~~~
Who have all been as poor. I'm not going to single Young out completely, none of them have been OK. I think the wings are becoming as big a problem as central midfield. Januzaj is our only wide option that gives me hope at the minute.

524~~~
I think trying to ship out players like Young, Anderson and Fellaini is almost as important as it is to bring in the right players this season.

525~~~
I think it's the crowd that think the clearly not Utd standard quality players should be held onto on the back of a few stupid and lets be honest immature pic's and videos of themselves on instagram or whatever are the ones that need to get a grip here and not me. 

Young should be ashamed of himself to be posting videos of himself acting the fool like that. If I was his manager it would be the final nail in his coffin as I'd deem it him just pulling the piss altogether. I'd nearly say if Fergie was here today and he saw that clip he'd say wtf has that lad to be so happy about? 

Himself, Anderson and any other player that appear to be <i>just</i> here for a laugh and the handy money should be turfed out straight away and let them act the maggot somewhere else.

526~~~
Complete overreaction.

527~~~
Only here you can find people calling his season alright or decent. It is horrific and has been like this for the most part of two years now. An absolute non footballer, waste of space and waste of money. I would personally pay this club to get rid of him because he is an embarrassment to the club. To think we went from Giggs and Ronaldo to this. Him, Anderson and Fletcher remain on the top 3 list of players who should be out of this club the instant Van Gaal is manager.

528~~~
Why haven't we sold him yet?

529~~~
His birthday is in July right? Maybe we will forget to wish him a happy birthday? :P

530~~~
It's a fecking video. Who cares!?

531~~~
I have no idea what he is still doing here. He will not improve at his age and he is not a cheap academy product. Another terrible signing from Fergie's final years (maybe he thought Young could do a Dwight Yorke). Whether he is better or worse then Valencia or Nani is irrelevant - he is nowhere near the standard required at a club of United's stature and he is too expensive to be a squad filler. If we can't get rid due to his high wages, we can at least send him on loan to reduce costs.

532~~~
I hope Mad Winger has you on ignore or else you're walking a tightrope.

533~~~
Yes, I totally agree. Please don't misunderstand me - I am not saying that Young is good enough for a title charge. Even Januzaj, although promising, is not yet delivering to the level of, say, Sterling. I think we need one quality wing type like Reus plus maybe a younger prospect like Depay. Then clear out the deadwood like Valencia and Young (I still think Nani could do a job) and mix the new blood with the likes of Januzaj, Kagawa, Mata and Welbeck - suddenly you have a great mix of talent behind RVP.

534~~~

535~~~
Was hoping this was bumped with news of an offer from QPR.

536~~~
No such luck. We couldn't get rid of him even on a free.

537~~~
Is he gone ? Guess not ....

538~~~
Can we swap him for her instead?

539~~~
Please don't bump this thread ever again unless the fecker is sold

540~~~
Guys stop bumping this thread until he is sold.

541~~~
If she gets rid of the nose ring I'd do bad things to her. Females with tats do nasty things. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

542~~~
Got me all excited then back to reality.

543~~~
Like contract hepatitis C?

544~~~
becuase even if we wanted to sell him, his wages mean that only a big team could afford him and he isnt good enough for them

545~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

546~~~
Could van Gaal get him playing like a United player again??

547~~~
Again?

548~~~
Be fair, he had about two or three months in his first season where he looked worthy of a position.

549~~~
Apart from around six games or so his time at the club has been nothing short of shambolic.

550~~~
No they don't mind tossing your salad.

551~~~
Lovely...

552~~~
Young should stay away from Twitter methinks.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/483246/Ashley-Young-BLASTED-by-Man-Utd-fans-after-opening-day-tweet" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/foot...ASTED-by-Man-Utd-fans-after-opening-day-tweet</a>

553~~~
Ouch! Truth hurts.
Does he even have a slightest of hint that he's not upto our standard for wingers? Does any of our wingers have any hint?

554~~~
People can have those opinions on players but to directly shit on the guy through his Twitter account is embarrassing and disrespectful.

555~~~
Random Neanderthals should stay away from twitter.

556~~~
I share this view. I was annoyed when our own fans did the same to Cleverley to the point where he closed his twitter account. I don't understand why our fans would abuse our own players on twitter. What does it achieve?

557~~~
They just vent their frustration on the players. Some do it for fun. Totally wrong though. I think posting messages in a civil manner like "Your performance has been really bad." would be better.

558~~~
I'd love to go to their place of work and tell them they are shit.

559~~~
Come on, when he posted that on Twitter he knew exactly what was coming his way. No doubt there are vicious tweets elsewhere, but those quoted are only a bit of fun, really.

560~~~
More to the point, most of this can easily be ignored but some wanklord posing as a journo thought he'd post an article about it.

561~~~
Well, I can kind of understand the abuse he's been getting. He's one of the most unpopular signings I can remember. Generally his arrival generated much indifference and generally his performances have left much to be desired. Marry that to our serious demise last season, then he's a very easy target...but with some justification.

562~~~
People can moan about Ashley Young's shit performances all day on forums like this without doing any harm if they want to but there is every chance he could still be a United player next season I just don't see what benefit damaging his confidence by abusing/criticising him on twitter will do.

563~~~
When did he ever play like a United player apart from very few games if at all? LvG is great but a magician he is not!

564~~~
Not to sound mean but he really deserves the abuse methinks. 

His tweeting attitude reflects how clueless he is (just like his on pitch attitude: He always wants the ball but just doesn't know how to deal with it effectively.) 

The best tweet in response: you're playing for Swansea LOL

565~~~
For someone who just plays football, this is never a true sentence.

566~~~
no player deserves abuse from their own fans.

567~~~
Relating an incredibly innocent tweet to somebody's ability with a football is a new brand of idiocy. Well done.

568~~~
Well, for a start, every united player should always try to work harder to earn his place and maybe acquire some united quality by training harder and smarter? 

If his ego or confidence is being dented by fans abuse on the internet then he's not fit for playing united anyway. It's his own fault to be tweeting his excitement in the first place and truth hurts when fans pointed it out the obvious (I love the tweet "you're playing for Swansea"). 

In any event hope he's gone by the summer.

569~~~
I don't know how you rate him. But I cringed every time I saw him wasting his crosses, which happened too often.

There's no need for you to throw insult at another poster just because she doesn't rate him <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

570~~~
I personally would never do that. NO

571~~~
Exactly! 
Imagine when RvP tweets the same excitement? He would be receiving tons of praises and exciting response in return. 

Young should know by now how much "love" he's getting from fans.

572~~~
And you would be right! 

People who go to work and earn their wages should not do a shit job because there are so many out there who should be taking his job. And they should be told they should not be shit any more or else... Fair?

573~~~
I agree 100%.

574~~~
Not to sound mean, but maybe you deserved it.

575~~~
All joking aside, surely he'll be getting sold?

We can't seriously be keeping Ashley Young can we?

576~~~
Hey!!! You're mean

577~~~
He's not a great player, but I really like Ashley Young. Seems to love playing for United, and really appreciates being here.

578~~~
Lol, if you say so. They might also say "who the feck are you? Why are you harassing me? Do you even work in my profession?"

Do you even have a job?

579~~~
He's a bit lacking in self awareness really isn't he? 

I cannot wait to see the back of him. The only chance he's got of seeing the new season with us is LVG wanting to have a closer look at him (should take one training session?) before pulling the trigger. An average footballer that was never going to be able to deliver at the highest level. Add to that a penchant for the most blatant diving seen since Jacques Coustea pulled on a pair of flippers and he's a strong contender for my vote for next out the door. 

How much was he? £20 million? What's he on a week? £100k? Whatever it is get him and his fecking jewelry out the fecking door.

580~~~
Even Swansea have shown they can play some football

581~~~
I'm sorry, but no. That is completely ridiculous. It's absurd, it's laughable and it's risible. The guy plays for Manchester United, and said he was looking forward to the first game of the season. Response?

'NO WONDER THEY'RE ABUSING HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111'

There are just so many football supporters out there who don't seem happy unless they're picking on or scapegoating someone, even if it's one of their own players.

Young might not be world class. He might not even be 'United quality' (that's for the manager to decide). But he's done absolutely nothing wrong, with that Tweet or in general.

582~~~
Me? you're asking if I have a job? LOL... Yeah I do have a respectable professional job and I know I am performing it well.
I appreciate what you meant... But if I am the receiving end of a certain service provider who can't work up the standard required then I have cause for complaints <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

583~~~
Yeah the Cleverley incident made me upset. Like seriously? I think it's safe to say that most of the people that shit-post on players' Twitter feeds are just bullshit fans like you find on Facebook.

584~~~
Football players are now "service providers" ? jesus fecking Christ.

And you can't be performing your job that well if you are on the CAF during work hours.

585~~~
"Don't tell me you're not leaving?"

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Made ma laugh that tweet.

I look forward to seeing this thread bumped with news he's leaving. I like the guy and he definitely receives undeserved abuse - but he isn't United quality and I'd prefer giving Lingard a chance.

586~~~
I think it'll be difficult for him next year. If we make some assumptions and say Cavani and Sanchez are on their way, combined with the need to fit in Mata, Rooney and give Januzaj a full-time position in the team - I really don't know what becomes of Young, Valencia or Nani. It's probable one or two would be retained as you don't select the first 11 then throw the bathwater out with the baby still in but I suspect it might come down to 'who's cheaper to keep around?' out of those three.

587~~~
I would guess that from those three we'll keep Valencia because he is good defensively, links well with Rafael and can provide cover for Rafael. However, it is a hard guess and knowing Van Gaal wouldn't be surprised if Varela gets some time as a RB (instead of Valencia).

588~~~
Twitter and FB have become a platform for people to express their own emotion, granted.

Last season when Rio spent so much time on FB selling his brand #5 and it looks like he didn't have a care about United's existing status. There are comments (not abuse given it's Rio and there are many united loyal fans who love him) telling him to spend time getting fit etc.

I thought it's a bit harsh.

As I said I will never do what these people did as a result of the said tweet. Yet I still found it funny and didn't feel sorry for Young. 

If he's being made aware of the fact that he needs to improve (from his coaches feedback etc), he should spend the summer improving and come back strong to prove his doubters wrong.

589~~~
I tried, but just couldn't swallow that assumption.

590~~~
Haha... I multi task and have people working for me. I always can work well and find time for the  red Cafe, especially over lunch. 

Never had complaints from anyone. 

Do you know how to multi task? Or you have a lot of spare time in your hands for attacking fellow posters?<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

591~~~
Players who use social media should expect a barrage of abuse, whether they're good or not. He's taking up a spot in our squad that could be given to a promising youngster,  and with us having no European football next season I can't see him staying on.  He seems like a nice guy and he isn't the worst player in the world, but he's still nowhere near good enough to be at this club. Even if we don't hear any transfer news for the next month is gladly take it to ensure him and a few others aren't here next season.

592~~~
No, I am just rubbish at my job.

593~~~
And he has an annoying habit of diving, Continental style.

594~~~
Jesus! You took the post out of context! The post was a response to  Shamwow's suggestion that you can't go to someone telling him he's not doing their jobs (he's referring to posters in real life).

595~~~
LOL and you shouldn't be proud of yourself if you're earning wages yet you're rubbish at your job! It's just not right! What world are we living in honestly?! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

But you maybe just a humble person<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

596~~~
John terry, Suarez? Those two deserve abuse from everyone at every chance

597~~~
Get off forums then you useless fecking lazy cnut. Where do you work? I'm going to come and tell everyone there how shit you are. <span style="color: #ffffff">I don't mean this just making a point that it's ridiculous for trolls to do it to people on twitter.</span>

598~~~
Has there been a hint that he'll be sold?

599~~~
I genuinely thought he was dead.

600~~~
As long as it's about their performance and not personal abuse it's fair game. Between the clubs, the players, the agents and sky they long ago changed footy from purely sport into business and stopped treating is like fans and more like customers to be milked as much as possible, and as customers we have every right to complain if we feel we aren't getting the quality we feel we deserve. Ashley young has consistently failed to deliver and needs to be made aware of that fact, although in a respectful way as he is still a Human being and comes across as a decent guy

601~~~
Only LVG knows. The truth is he is not good enough for us. Thats what the tweets states to him. Hope he gets a hint on that.

602~~~
Keep in mind that you are making the manager's job a lot more difficult then. It's the manager's job to understand whether a player needs a kick up the backside or an arm around the shoulder. Having people constantly abuse a player on twitter makes job a lot more difficult. We should be leaving this stuff to Van Gaal.

603~~~
Will be sold as soon as we've replaced him. Surely? Hopefully?

604~~~
I agree and in lvg I feel we have a manager who can and will, unlike last season

605~~~
You sound like a bully. On the internet be careful who you're verbally abusing and threatening.  You will regret it.

606~~~
White text...

607~~~
I'd love playing for Man Utd and earning like 120k a week.

I don't know what he expected. He should just close his twitter and just focus on his football.

608~~~
Not what I meant. You can see Ashley Young in the crowd with fans going to games, for example. Can you see Rooney ever doing that?

609~~~
The second that he's sold, our squad will be stronger for it. I don't think I can take another season of his pointless outings.

610~~~
I'm not so sure. Maybe LVG will offer him a chance.

611~~~
No need for replacing. 

We got Bebe who can easily fill his role.

612~~~
If young was an actual top class player like Suarez has been for Liverpool, I think united Fans would not give young so much stick, even though he is one of the worst signings fergie ever made

613~~~
He can hang out with whoever he wants. Fact is he hasn't performed. 

He is a nice guy apart from his diving. But fact is he has shown nothing to suggest he is good enough for us.

614~~~
I'm sure as soon as he finds another club willing to pay him £120k a week, he'll be off!

615~~~
Never said he was. Just said he seems like a nice guy who loves the club, but I agree he should be sold.

Just wish more of our players had a similar attitude as he does towards United.

616~~~
Yeah, there's that. If he's actually on that kind of money, that is.

Anyway, disregarding the money - nobody actually knows what he makes, do they? - we don't actually have to replace him as such, as some have touched on. Depending on what system LVG goes for, of course - but we don't necessarily need a whole bunch of wingers. Not of the more traditional kind. Who knows, maybe LVG fancies Nani? If he intends to play a 4-3-3 of sorts we certainly don't depend on replacing Young.

Perhaps LVG likes Young. Imagine the meltdown on here. Would be a sight worth seeing, actually,

617~~~
No one will buy Young so we're stuck with him.  Putting his wages aside he provides a but of depth.  How much longer does his contract run?

618~~~
While most of our targets are playing on the big tournament it would be a good time to finally decide what to do with this guy's contract.

We know Buttner is saying goodbye and Rio, Vidic, Giggs are already gone... We could easily do some cleaning in the wing department to make a way for needed upgrades and injection of new, ambitious energy.

Even Hodgson doesn't rate him anymore ffs...

619~~~
We have got to stop handing out undeserving players a big wage package. When you think about it, we have a big squad on good wages and still have only 50% revenue to wages turnover. The amounts paid to the likes of Young and Fellaini will not hurt us financially but makes it a lot harder to sell them off. We could have had better players and still have a similar turnover over the last few years.

620~~~
Looking forward to waking up and reading 'Stoke have £5m bid accepted'

Please

621~~~
Genuine question why is he hated so much?

He's not the best by any means, saying that he's never moaned, never kicked off when he's dropped and unlike many of our so called "legends" didn't spend the whole of last season undermining the manager at every chance.

He deserves another 6 months, a chance to work with an actual midfield and defense who can do their jobs correctly. Even Mata struggled at times with the utter rubbish behind him.

There's also this. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/ashley-young-dying-fan-bucket-6366734" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...er-news/ashley-young-dying-fan-bucket-6366734</a>

622~~~
Wasted potential mainly by himself. If he's not playing bad then it means he's injured. He's also quite an idiot and the type of simpleton who's showing his cock in front of a web cam and getting tattoos for the sake of swag to show how much of a man he is. Closer with character and emotional development to Mario Balotelli than our great servants like Vida, Fletch or Valencia.

He is not hated by United fans. Folks just think this club have bigger football standards that should eliminate weakest links from the team working hard for success.

Would you really want that type of seed in your team when you know that exquisite talents are available like Memphis, Sanchez possibly even Di Maria ? There's a solid set of arguments that showing a way better options than Ashley Young who can't even find place in failed Roy Hodgson's collective.

623~~~
Whether or not he's good enough for United to achieve what we'd all like, there was no real need to have a go on twitter. 

It's just pointless and impolite.

624~~~
aw feck you lot I thought he was getting sold when I saw this thread at the top of the page

625~~~
Blame whoever decided he was worth what they paid Villa and what they paid/pay him. I don't see what Young's done wrong, other than diving, which many do.
It's easy to say <i>"he's not hated"</i> but it's often beyond just saying he's not good enough, which actually isn't a crime.

626~~~
Damm I thought when this got to the top of the forum that we had got a bid from a team for Young...

So disappointed <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

627~~~
The hate for him is pathetic.

628~~~
Why? its justified I'd say. When he starts we are worse off by a margin and when he comes on off the bench even for someone having a shocking game we are noticeably worse off. He loses the balls several times in a match which can go from you having a scoring chance to you being on the end of a scoring chance. He is absolutely USELESS!

629~~~
So how does abusing him (as many have done) make him suddenly a player who never loses the ball?
Blame whoever bought him, decided to pay him what he's paid, or decides to play him.

He's not very good. But does he go out trying to be as poor as possible? No.
Did he hold the United board members at gunpoint and demand they pay Villa money for him? No.

Is he supposed to refuse a spot on the team because he's not good enough?
If he's played and he's crap you have to ask what the club were thinking when they gave him one of the higher wages in the squad and what the manager's thinking by playing him.

630~~~
Getting all personal and pissy is just sad. He's a shite footballer, yes. But no real need to go as far as the odd 'young is shit' in a matchday thread. 

Football fans in full flow are embarrassing.

631~~~
When you're passionate about something competitive its very easy to get frustrated especially when the same player time and time again just does not cut it, clearly can't but yet still gets played.

632~~~
Who's fault is that? 
And who's fault is it that he's (reportedly) on such high wages that he's unlikely to move until his contract runs out?

633~~~
I don't hate him, but he's a frustrating player to watch. I think he is talented, and his burst of acceleration is very dangerous, but so many times when he plays for us, he seems to look for an opportunity to win the foul than to beat his man and get a shot away. He gets into dangerous areas where he could score a goals quite consistently and win us all over, but he doesn't seem that way inclined.

I think he's an okay squad player (though if the reports about his wages are true, then he's a very expensive squad player) but I don't think he should ever be a starter unless he's covering injuries or key players are being rested for bigger games.

634~~~
Absolutely.

635~~~
He's just an easy target. Although outside of the field he always seems like a really nice guy, his playing style is a little hard to look at, to put it mildly. Dives, always does the same thing, plays with his head in the ground, also had this thing when he first came here, where he was pulling his pants down a little every time he took a corner or a FK(I dunno if anybody else noticed it, but it used to get on my tits by some reason). Anyway, probably even with all this shit he's more effective than Valencia, so it's not that bad I guess.

I also think the he somehow got in the middle of the long Nani vs Valencia war. Basically people couldn't agree which one of Valencia or Nani were the best and they just settled to agree that Young was shit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Our fan base was always split between Nani and Valencia, if one likes flair and trickery - they will like Nani, if they like Pace and strength, they like Valencia. Young, unfortunately for him, doesn't really have a style, or maybe I should say something that he excels at, that means that he doesn't have many fans either, as nobody loves a average Joe.

What I am trying to say is that both Nani and Valencia have their fair share of haters, but they also have their fanbois to balance things out, but unfortunately for Young, he doesn't really have any fanbois to defend him when the haters are in full force.

636~~~
Wingers usually tend to play better when the team tempo is good and they are released early with the fullback already on the backfoot and they can go 1 on 1. We did not have that last season and Young actually looked like he belonged under Fergie. I'm far from a fan of his but I wouldn't be surprised if both him and Tony V were vastly better under Van Gaal.

637~~~
I'd been browsing this forum for years before I joined and there's always at least one scapegoat that gets a load of criticism. Past players have and still include Fletcher, Carrick, Cleverley, Nani, Rooney, Fellaini, Valencia and more. Young just happens to be one of the current ones, if he leaves others will take his place.

638~~~
WOAH!!!  What have I missed???

639~~~
The question should be: What talents we may miss if we'll be constantly keeping useless players with serious financial requirements.

640~~~
Tbh he has more to his game than Valencia. As a squad player I don't think there is any problem. At least he can use both feet and try a couple of different things.

641~~~
I fear he will run down his contract with us. Nobody will want him for his current wage if at all a club wants him

642~~~
Yep. The one that still takes the cake for me was in a ask Carrick thing on twitter I think and someone asked him would he rather go back in time to kill hitler or stop Cleverley from being born. There was then articles in newspapers with a collection of hateful tweets to Cleverley. Why the feck are papers give these gobshites and their drivel such attention is ridiculous.

643~~~
I'm sure every big club has it's dead weight players.  We're no different.

644~~~
But, who is going to buy him for those wages?  And why would he go for a drop in wages?

645~~~
I agree, he can play in 3 postions and his bottom form is better than Valencias.

646~~~
Thankfully there's full two months to determine that but I agree that this sad situation may and will be a problem. The other thing is that he's completely useless with his recent injury run. Nobody indeed will want a player who spend most of his time injured and get 100k.

He needs to go or Louie needs to find a miraculous cure to his both low form and fragile injury resistance not to mention his pointless crossing to no one... It's close to impossible.

647~~~
There's genuine hate for him which is fecked up. 
People have booed him on occasions.

Our support has become like spoilt kids.

648~~~
If Ashley does go I reckon it will be a season long loan with us agreeing to subsidise his wages type deal.

649~~~
Problem? the dead weight has been starting games not appear has squad players, do we need list off fellaini, cleverly, anderson when he was in shape, valencia, nani and young. We need players who can force the dead weight out the door, it never helps his case when he plays so bad, and is on wages beyond his talent

650~~~
That question maybe the funniest question I have ever read, and I thought the tea bag joke with spain and england was funny LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

651~~~
Hopefully you are banned soon enough with shit like that. Comparing a footballer to Hitler is in no way funny.

652~~~
I don't think he's half the problem people seem to think he is. As a fourth choice winger he's alright (Januzaj, Nani and Valencia all ahead of him). 

Obviously if we got the chance to bring in Sanchez/Di Maria and Van Gaal was up for it then one of them would have to go but that's not a priority for us now by all accounts.

653~~~
LOLLLLL someone's touchy, and you really think I can be banned for finding it funny, if you think that joke is the worst you have seen, you have seen nothing. And I did not even make up the joke, I said it was funny there is a difference

654~~~
That's my view on it.
He very rarely moans and he'll be happy as a bit part player.

Can also fill in on a temporary basis on either wing which over a long season can be massive.

655~~~
Agreed.

656~~~
Welcome to my ignore list! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

657~~~
And you are on it is well

658~~~
people mentioning his wages, surely if we just sell him of for £5 million cheaper that will save the buying club money for his wages? I reckon we ould get £7 million for him as he'd be a key player for any team outside the top 6. People seem to be forgetting just how good he was for villa. Im mixed on him at the moment, if he's confident and fit he's a very good player and would be still worth keeping around, Van Gaal seems the type of manager who can get his confidence going and get him up and running, if so him and Nani are worth keeping around for me

659~~~
The problem with that is all the 3 above him are also squad players currently (Januzaj because he is still very young), so we need to get someone more suited to first choice. Out of all the 4, Januzaj is definitely not going anywhere, Valencia has just signed a new contract, if reports are to be believed then LvG blocked Nani's sale to Juve. That only leaves us with Young to be replaced by a definite first team player.

660~~~
I don't think we have an outstanding wide player , they are all very much On the same level

661~~~
He isn't 'alright' in any capacity here at all. He simply isn't good enough for a club of our stature whether that's playing a first team role or as a squad player. His contribution is very minimal and we are talking about a player reportedly earning £120K a week. He <i>is </i>very much part of the problem in which we are struggling in the winger department.

He simply must be sold, as he's completely dispensable. Ideally, we will bring in a quality and competitive wide player, but even if we don't; Januzaj, Valencia and Nani could suffice, or we could promote Lingard to take Young's place. He would be a more appropriate squad player given the disparity between their earnings and the fact he will offer something different.

Even if he does stay - I imagine he might because no one will one to equal or pay close to his wages - I expect him to be ostracised from the squad under van Gaal. Probably barely get a game next season.

662~~~
I would understand and sympathise, however he is a very expensive 4th choice winger, and his output in no way justifies the outlay either. 

Plus his contract runs out in 2 years - so do we cash in on him, let his contract run down or offer him a new one?

663~~~
His performances since he came to United have been almost uniformly poor. At least Nani and Valencia have had a good spell at <i>some</i> point in their United careers, suggesting there's the possibility of magically getting back to their best, even if the chances are remote. Young played well in that Arsenal thrashing, scored a decent brace in an otherwise unimpressive performance away at Spurs, has popped in the odd long ranger in low key games and that's about it. In terms of general play you really are looking at a single quality performance in 3 seasons. 

I cant think of a single reason not to give his place to a youth player.

664~~~
Oh, I'm ever so hopeful when I come in this tread for some sucker to offer something for Young. I don't care about grammar, btw.

665~~~
Harsh but fair. One of Fergie's worst signings, especially when you consider the fee/alleged wages.

666~~~
Fergie's transfer record was pretty dire in the last few years, shocking really. Most managers would've be ridiculed badly for it. Just as well he was still a great manager on the field.

667~~~
It's looking that way. If Nani, Valencia, Anderson and Kagawa all end up as a busted flush (which is not unlikely) his record will probably be the worst of any top flight manager over the same period of time.

Who was the last player he signed that ended up as a long term success, other than RvP? Vidic and Evra? Back in 2005? 9 fecking years ago. Throw in the departures of Pogba and Pique (probably bit harsh to include the latter) as well as Forlan winning the golden boot after leaving United and it makes Fergie look borderline negligent!

668~~~
Can't believe you forgot Carrick given how much you defended him over the years, shame on you <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

but yeah, hard to believe how bad so many of them were. To be fair though, I don't think <i>anyone </i>could've predicted how bad our main set of 'flops' (the 07 crowd) would turn out to be.

669~~~
If he is sold even for 1 pound , it will be the best transfer business we have done since buying rvp.

670~~~
How can call them bust when we have titles with them in the teams? I agree Nani and Anderson are terrible now, who knows what is up with Valencia and Kagawa hasn't shown his potential .... yet, but we still have titles with them playing games.

Losing Pogba stings ..... nit worried about the loss of Pique.

671~~~
Jaysus, my bad <img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/>

Slim pickings over a very long period of time though. Up until very recently I was assuming the likes of Young, Valencia, Nani and Anderson would form the bedrock of our next great team. If they don't Fergie's track record in the transfer market over the last 7 or 8 years looks very fecking unimpressive. And that's a very long period of time, with an awful lot of money invested in our squad. 

It's mad that this coincides with arguably the most succesful spell in the history of our club. In a way it's great evidence that winning trophies is about so much more than being an expert at buying and selling players. Which is something the FM generation really struggle to get their heads around.

672~~~
Many still consider djemba and kleberson far worser signings

673~~~
I would not call nani Valencia and Anderson a busted flush,  Anderson and nani between 2007 to 2011 and Valencia between 2009 to 2011 were pretty key players for united during those years, it's just after 2011 their cycle started to come to an end.

Pique had Ferdinand and Vidic in their prime infront Of him, the greatest partnership fergie probably ever had. Pogba was the one that did get away, who could have easily walked into the united midfield, when united were at their weakest in that area

has for kagwa I just cannot see the boss sacrificing players and hope kagwa comes through who is good, but he's not better than mata Rooney etc in the hole.

In 2004, forlan had to deal with competition from RVn the clubs leather goal scorer at the time, while Saha and Rooney along with smith all 3 were signed within an 8 month period, with Ronaldo developing, so forlan had to be moved on

674~~~
I actually think A.Young(and Nani, and Valencia) will have a good season under LVG.

675~~~
I agree, but you're forgetting De Gea there Pogue. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

676~~~
Indeed I am. Took this discussion to a new thread anyway. The one with the massive, rambling OP.

677~~~
We've not missed Pique at all, he's not even that good anyway.

678~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.memegene.net/media/created/t3z784.jpg" src="http://www.memegene.net/media/created/t3z784.jpg"/>

679~~~
We've just signed Herrera and Luke Shaw looks set to come in. On top of that most sources reckon we're after another midfielder and a defender. Surely that has to be the priority rather than worrying about replacing Young? strengthening the squad to where we want to be has to be a fairly gradual process. Get the black hole in our midfield fixed (we're halfway there) and sort out the defence and then from a position of strength next year we can worry about the wings. 

Don't get me wrong though, if Van Gaal said he wanted a winger and Young was the one he wanted out then fair enough, I wouldn't complain. I just don't think it's an urgent problem.

680~~~
I never said it was essential. I said ideally we will sign a winger, because all three of Nani, Young and Valencia are unreliable and Januzaj is just 19. For those reasons I do think it's an area we need to strengthen, but it's not critical like central midfield or left back. We are strong in offensive positions anyway, so our front four will look strong on paper even if there isn't one winger taking up a place.

However, what I was implying, is that Young is completely dispensable. He's on huge wages and his contribution is probably less than any other player in our immediate first team squad - Anderson aside. We should look to sell him as soon as possible, as his wages are completely unjustified and he doesn't do anything Lingard or possibly Zaha couldn't. Selling Young wouldn't be a determining factor in whether we sign a winger or not.

681~~~
That aint right LOL

682~~~
They can't all have a good season. They will be lucky if there's space for one of them on the pitch at any one time. Valencia or Nani might have a shot of turning it around and nailing down that place, but Young is third choice and has no chance.

683~~~
I remember how he started his season when he first made his move. I'm just trying to look at things with a more positive view.

684~~~
Is there a kid (Can't recall his name) from Coventry that a few clubs are watching? Maybe we should swap him with  that kid... sent  Young to Coventry.

685~~~
Flog this guy off to QPR. We then get him off of our wage bill while at the same time getting rid of a footballer that's not good enough at the same time getting rid of a player with reputation as a diver. Killing three birds with one stone.

686~~~
Didn't he have his signing on fee spread out over his weekly wages? So if we get rid we will have to pay out that portion to him right?

687~~~
Embarrassing form by some United supporters. Poor guy was welcoming the new additions and received a torrent of unsavoury tweets in return. So sad...

688~~~
Disgusting.

689~~~
No point even paying attention to that. Idiots will be idiots.

690~~~
I don't like Young as a player on the field, and I want him gone, but that's shitty, ignorant behaviour. He may be a twit on the field, but off it he's never said a bad word or kicked up a fuss and generally being very respectful to the club. Shame.

691~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/oTz_U0DVVB/embed/" width="612"></iframe>


He doesn't exactly help himself does he?

692~~~
Normal stuff you find on social media. Suppose the CAF would be more like that if we didn't screen our posters with a newbie forum.

693~~~
Internet in 'being home to wankers' shocker. 

These people are best ignored.

694~~~
Looks like he's having a seizure.

695~~~
Exactly, just see the Would Cup forum for instance.

696~~~
There's been numerous similar comments been made on this forum regarding this tweet. Everyone hates Youngy. Poor lad.

697~~~
The difference is that Young probably doesn't read this forum, so even if someone says not so generous things about him on here, it will have very little effect on him. He definitely will read some of the messages directed at his twitter handle and unless he is completely thick they will have an effect on him. Seriously, a good portion of the online football fans really are a pathetic breed. Hounded Darren Gibson off twitter too a couple of years ago.

698~~~
Leave him alone. Think a player is shit, moan about him to your mates or on forums like this but anyone who tweets abuse to him directly is a nob

699~~~
The stupid pricks are even tagging Ander and Shaw.  Way to let them know they've come to the right club!

700~~~
Did anyone ask for a two footed winger who can actually cross? thats not me.

701~~~
Weirdly the more hate he gets the more I like him and want him to stay........

702~~~
he's a decent squad player. The level of moaning is ridiculous.

703~~~
Whats astonishing is every reply is slamming him. Poor form.

704~~~
Its really no different than the Facebook page. Seems mostly semi-literate teenagers from the middle east and asia.

705~~~
The comments he gets on twitter and facebook are pretty nasty and you do feel sympathy for him after reading some of them but let's not go mad.

He's in no way a decent squad player. He's terrible and he's been terrible for his entire Utd career bar maybe the first 4 or 5 weeks. He's scored 2 league goals in the last 2 years and had maybe 2 or 3 assists? How is that decent?

706~~~

707~~~
He's such a likeable character it pains me to see disgusting people have a go at him. He's isn't quite upto the standard of what i expect from a United player, but he handles himself very well.

708~~~
Poor Young. Seems a nice chap bar a few mistakes, always keeps up with his charity work etc. I'd rather he played for someone elses football club, but there's no need for personal abuse.

709~~~
Oh come on, we all do that when alone in a car.

710~~~
He'd be first on my sell list, but I think he handles himself impeccably off the pitch. Lots of great stories about him, and whatever you may think about videos like that one above it fits in well with the image I have of him mostly just being himself on social media. Would love for him to be turn around his fortunes at the club, but I have a hard time believing there's much chance of it.

I'm definitely in the "the more abuse he gets, the more I like him" camp as well <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

711~~~
I see nothing wrong with Young personally, true he's not up to standard, but a bit of decency and respect please. What has he done, other than be an underwhelming signing.

712~~~
Main issue with Young is that he has actually regressed playing for us. Saw him at Villa and he was a good player, amazing at times, how ever he joined us, and yes we maybe above his level, but straight away he was not the player who was quite deadly for Villa. 

You expect a player, with better players, and better strikers to actually have an easier time and look a bit better. He just looks half the player than he was for a mid table Villa side.

713~~~
I like Ash. Was a big fan when he was at Villa and he joined United and started like a house on fire. His regression has been shocking though. Really don't know what's happened there.

714~~~
I think they huge amount of stick he took for diving (fairly in most cases) probably shook his confidence and he's never recovered. He just looks very cautious, lacks enthusiasm and confidence to attack a defender now.

715~~~
I never rated him for Villa until his last season where he played as a central attacking midfielder. He got 9 goals and 12 assists from there and I think he always looked a one trick pony for Aston Villa when playing out wide - compared to centrally where he was genuinely good. Until his AM season in Villa, and then moving to United Young had just had 7 games for England even if he was in the team of the year two years in a row in the EPL.

716~~~
I don't like him as a player, and think he should leave but man, those twitter twats took it too far.

717~~~
Can't the US, no one seems to be craving for a gun.

718~~~
It's always the bloody foreigners, eh?

719~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Four seem English of the seven. Are you bad at maths or just slightly elitest by nature?-

720~~~
I'm talking about the Man Utd Facebook page.

721~~~
It's pretty much the norm on there. Embarrassing stuff.

722~~~
I think we should just keep him as a squad player if he isn't kicking up a fuss about it.

Might be useful for his work rate in tough games.

723~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.expressandstar.com/sport/aston-villa-fc/2014/07/07/roy-keane-offers-encouragement-as-ashley-young-linked-with-aston-villa-return/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.expressandstar.com/sport...-ashley-young-linked-with-aston-villa-return/</a>
The claret and blue’s players were poised to meet Keane, the club’s new assistant manager, for the first time at Bodymoor Heath.

Keane has built a reputation throughout his career for being a tough taskmaster and has fallen out with players in the past. But the former Sunderland and Ipswich chief insists he does have a softer side and is prepared to show it.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.expressandstar.com/sport/aston-villa-fc/2014/07/02/aston-villa-package-tempted-roy-keane/keane-9-ts-02/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.expressandstar.com/wpmvc/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4551453.jpg" src="http://www.expressandstar.com/wpmvc/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4551453.jpg"/></a>
Roy Keane is appointed assistant manager at Aston Villa.
“There have been one or two instances highlighted, particularly my time at Ipswich I suppose. Jon Walters obviously. But that’s about management, learning, experiences.

“If you think I come into work – and I’ve been a professional footballer for 20-odd years – ranting and raving every day or even every week I wouldn’t last two minutes.

While Keane prepares to start work, former winger Ashley Young has been linked with a shock return to Villa Park.

The 28-year-old looks likely to leave Old Trafford this summer having struggled to make an impact.

724~~~
Sounds about right, that's his level. Although Keane would eat him alive.

725~~~
W
When I play him CAM in Fifa he is very good tho so think you are right. ;p

726~~~
No thanks. His proven time an time again to be unreliable and with less games there really is no need for him.

727~~~
would you care...just get rid of him

728~~~
Get out.

729~~~
I think he's been reliable in big games i.e sticking to his job.

730~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/2014/07/06/man-united-winger-ashley-young-could-be-set-for-stunning-aston-villa-return/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.caughtoffside.com/2014/0...could-be-set-for-stunning-aston-villa-return/</a>

Caught Offside I know, but it's one of several sources running with it.

731~~~
Really? His performance in the big games except against Arsenal in 2011 and City in 2012 have been lack luster at best. I really see no need to keep him especially for over 100k a week.

732~~~
Who are you?

733~~~
Has he? I remember the Bayern game when we played Kagawa out wide and he did as much defensive work as Young does, whilst offering far more in ball retention and vision. The 'defensive winger' stuff has been debunked, I'm not afraid to say.

734~~~
Aye, he's hardly looked good in those games that I was mentioning, but he did his job decently.

735~~~
Isn't it obvious ?...

736~~~
It would be better for him and for us, surely. He still can be a decent player - I just don't think that he can make it here, he doesn't have confidence anymore, neither do the fans. Aston Villa fans must remember his spell there and still have a good feelings for him? Though he dived against them if I'm not mistaken.

The twitter abuse is awful, he is a mediocre player and I want him gone but the direct abuse is just classless and stupid - he has done nothing wrong as a person, watched football with the fans, was late to the match because he stopped to help at the accident et cetera. Bad choice of missus though.

737~~~
Not to the weak ones, I guess.

738~~~
Who are you?

739~~~
You know what I know.

740~~~
He'll flourish under Van Gaal... flourish I say... you'll see... you'll all see....

741~~~
It'll all go exactly as we planned, with him tearing it up on the wings and Valencia sitting in front of the defense, we'll be fecking unstoppable.

742~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

743~~~
He isn't good as a "defensive" winger, nor he is as an attacking one
Are you sure that you're not talking about this guy?

744~~~
Who are you?

745~~~
He can't even be relied to do that anymore. Defensively Kagawa is better than him I'd trust him more than Young.

746~~~
I know who he is. It was a joke ffs. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.
I know it's weastedevil.

747~~~
If I ever turn up to Old Trafford and witness Antonio Valencia charging around like a maniac in the holding role, battering everything and everyone in his path, I probably would have to wait until all the semen dried before leaving the ground....

748~~~
He's gonna be our very own Robben next year. Only with better shooting, crossing and FK delivery. Cannot wait!

<span style="color: #ffffff">Seriosly, every time this thread gets bumped, I get my hopes up that somebody made some offer for him. </span>

749~~~
What does that have to do with anything?

750~~~
How many squad players do we have filling the midfield? Cleverly Anderson fellaini Valencia bebe fletcher that is nearly an entire section of our depth. Yes squad players I welcomed, but we don't have enough quality and all we have a trillion Ashley youngs in our midfield .

And the so called talented ones like kagwa and nani have been utter garbage. Which is why the squad players some how start  games, because our so called talented guys can't even do their job for for united . Who perform just has badly as the average players infesting our midfield

751~~~
Another 3 years of this guy, continue the torcher.

752~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You quoted yourself Rado.

753~~~
The abuse he gets is really OTT. Kagawa did feck all last season nobody seemed to notice.

He was bought as a squad player who is decent on either wing and provide cover for Nani and Valencia.

The problem is our lack of quality elsewhere means we have suddenly expected him to be world class. Any winger would struggle to work with our slow midfield.

754~~~
Januzaj didnt.

755~~~
He did at times especially in the big games.

756~~~
He cost £17m when he was in the final year of his contract. He is on like 120k a week, so excuse us if we expect better performances. 

And you say he's decent on either wing. Yet he can't even be decent most the times. He is a one dimensional player.

757~~~
Happy Birthday Ashley Young. <span style="font-size: 10px">Now feck off.</span>

758~~~
He's 29 today? I thought that he was a year younger than that. (no pun intended.)

Anyway, I hope that he returns to Villa as rumored, or anywhere really. I don't want to see him in a United shirt next season.

759~~~
Here's another player it's become fashionable to be seen hating.

760~~~
Never realized his 29. More of a reason to sell him, no chance of him improving.

761~~~
It's a strange pattern. Players that are shit aren't liked here. Who would have though?

762~~~
He should stay for a year.
He'll accept a smaller role, assuming we play 4231/433 a new winger would struggle to have an impact if we play Rooney, Mata and Adnan behind RVP

As I said on that other thread get first 11 sorted and improve overall squad if we're back in Europe next year.

763~~~
You need to learn the difference between hating a player, and thinking he isn't quite good for United.

764~~~
Yeah oke, but in the regular games he didnt, while young did that every single match.

765~~~
Swap Young, TC23 etc for O'Shea, Fletcher, Park etc. All decent squad players to have.

The problem is there's less world class players to do the hard bit.

Everyone was utter shit last year, some get blame more than others. May aswell give them all a fresh start.

766~~~
It's the kind of neolithic thinking that's best served miles and miles away from any club business, that is for sure. Next we'll be having 'shit player catwalks' where rabid fans stand and hurl abuse at players they don't like as they walk up and back. Of course, unbeknown to the fans there is a foot of thick glass so the players can't actually hear them.

767~~~
Apart from the 3 games he scored in. More than some of our so called stars.

768~~~
Young, Fellaini, Anderson shouldn't even compared to O'Shea, Fletcher and Park. The last three are definitions of reliable squad players that always performed and were good at football. The first three are the entire opposite, never perform and are shit at football.

769~~~
The amount of hate and abuse he gets on Twitter and Facebook is utterly embarrassing. I think he could still play a role at the club as a squad player (and that's it).

770~~~
Didn't SAF say in his book that he was meant as a replacement for Giggs? Fergie wanted him to be a regular rather than cover and I think the fee and his wages suggest that.

771~~~
They've been times when lots on here thought otherwise.

772~~~
Look at our best squad players over SAF's reign and a few from other top clubs around Europe and Young doesn't even meet that role for us. He's not good enough to play for us, just as Buttner wasn't. (Who was obviously even more of a liability.)

773~~~
Aye, its a pretty mental thing to suggest we would spunk 16 million plus his astronomical wages just for him to be a squad player.

774~~~
It isn't the only time Fergie was wrong about a player, shouldn't come as such a shock and it's no slight on the man saying he made a mistake on him either considering the amount of great buys he made in 26 years compared to the bad ones.

775~~~
O'Shea and Fletcher were called all sorts on here for years.

Let me apply some logic to my arguments. How many players do we genuinely have that would get in a top 4 side?

De Gea - Obviously

Rafael - yes, Jones, Smalling, Evans - squad players. Shaw - Yes

The midfield.

Aside from Herrera, our best midfielder is Carrick who'd struggle to get on the bench given the way he played last year.

Anderson, Fellaini, Cleverley. Obviously not, Fletcher would have been kicked out years ago by most clubs but I'm glad we have him around. Should be given a coaching role now.

Our attacking midfield/wingers

Nani on form yes but arguably hasn't been on form for 2 years. Valencia and Young are good back up options as they won't kick off due to lack of games at times. As I've already said be very difficult to fit a 30 million + winger into a side that potentially has Rooney, Mata, Januzaj and Van Persie in it. Our front Rooney, Mata and RVP would get in most sides, Januzaj has the potential to be brilliant. Kagawa who has a very high reputation hasn't done it enough in the last 2 years to warrant a near meltdown every time he doesn't start. Hernandez and Welbeck would be seen as back up options only

Big changes in squads over 3 months doesn't work.

776~~~
Young has had three seasons and is supposed to be at his prime and has done nothing apart from fall over a few times. That is his biggest contribution.

777~~~
Of course, I'm just saying he that Young wasn't bought in to be a 'squad' player.

778~~~
Given we had Nani, Park and Valencia at the time and were looking at Moura, Sneijder and Nasri around that period I'd say he was. The problems started for the team when Nani and Valencia (key for us in 10/11) lost form and we lost out on other targets.

779~~~
On a more happy note though, I bet Ashley Young is gonna dive right into his cake.



<span style="color: #ffffff">I'll get my coat now.</span>

780~~~
Because he is clearly not Manchester United quality... do you think he is?

781~~~
Well, always is a figure if speech, no player for us (bar Paul Scholes) has performed always good, but those players I mentioned have been generally reliable and good squad players.

782~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b>Leicester bid £6m for Brighton striker Leonardo Ulloa.. </b>
<b>Why don't they come offer that money for young? </b>
<b>We could just say he is yours for half the price and payment</b>
<b>can be made at 300 pounds a month.</b></span>

783~~~
Young is on a big wage to be a squad player.

784~~~
It's crazy to think that our main wingers at the beginning of the 2011 season were:

Nani: Just had his best season at the club and had finally dropped most of critics who wanted him gone at the end of his second season. Would continue to impress in 11/12.
Valencia: Looked good coming back from his leg break and would go on to win player of the season, winning plaudits from everyone (even RAWK couldn't deny how good he was).
Young: A player that had impressed at Villa and though some didn't really understand the transfer, he had a decent first year (long forgotten by many on here) and was picked as first choice for England on the left at Euro 2012.
Park: A reliable, experienced squad player that could be used in the big games should we make the later stages of the Champions League or domestic competitions.

Now look at them. Nani has barely played in two years and has only shown flashes of being the same player when he has, Valencia has contributed little in terms of attacking play with people surprised he was offered a new deal, Young has had injures but has no confidence and most want him gone, Park is no longer here of course.

785~~~
He was flying before that tournament, he had a good season with us and played very well in the warm up games leading up to Euro '12, then he had an absolute shocker and hasn't looked anything close to the same player since.

786~~~
I think Young might be unsellable, his wages are way to high for someone of his ability and he isnt good enough for most clubs in the top 6-7 teams in the league, he has gone from a decent all rounder to essentially a defensive winger. Something no one is really prepaid to pay that much for, he would be best suited to a club like west ham, Villa, Palace, Swansea (Although Dyer is better). We may end up running his contract down similarly with Nani. I honestly cant see anyone offering anything more than 3-5m and him having to more than half his wages.

Would he do that? not a chance, not whilst he has something like 2-3 years left on his insane contract. Our only hope is that someone like Fiorentina, Inter, AC Milan are tempted by a low fee. Perhaps Wolfsberg or perhaps Schalke.

They're all on massive wages.

My point throughout this thread is we may aswell keep the likes of him and Valencia for a year because any replacement will want to start nearly every game  our front 4 is basically set in stone now. They won't kick up a fuss. 

It's a different story next season when we're hopefully back in Europe and have the increased number of games to rotate big players.

788~~~
Looking back, im starting to wonder if SAF was rlly a genius with transfers/talents or that he was actually pretty bad at it.

789~~~
It doesn't surprise me that people have forgotten about that though. Whenever we've played badly this season I've seen people post 'we replaced Ronaldo with Valencia- what do you expect?' as if the fact Valencia has been mostly disappointing for two years completely discredits his strong performances up until he switched to the 7 shirt.

790~~~
Park, O'Shea, Fletcher - who are now considered excellent squad players, it seems, all received dog's abuse at one time or another. And they were all very vocally being labelled "not United quality".

In terms of being starters for a top club with European ambitions they weren't either, strictly speaking. But football doesn't work like that. You need players who aren't "United quality" to make up the squad - and some of these are often just as important as the ones who are "United quality". Look at Park and how Fergie used him in his rotation. Only idiots and ABUs rolled their eyes at Ji-Sung.

I'm not saying Young is in that bracket before anyone starts to cry here. But we need players beyond a starting XI. My feeling is that some fans don't quite appreciate this fact. There's a tendency to assess any player as though he were a starter - even though basic common sense should tell you this is not a valid way to judge more than half of any given squad.

791~~~
The real issue with Young that riles people is that we paid 18 million and he is reportedly on big wages. That is what distinguishes him from the three players you mention (and I note you emphasize that you are not comparing them in terms of ability - I thinks that's wise as certainly Fletcher and Park could make a more useful contribution). It just seemed a strange transfer at the time and has nothing in the intervening three years has altered that initial sense of bafflement. Maybe Fergie thought he could step up like Dwight Yorke but it has proved a waste of money.

792~~~
Aye - I know. Personally I agree with what was said above: Fergie brought in Young at a time when he had three other viable options out wide; Park, Nani and Valencia. Given his team selections at the time I find it hard to believe he - Fergie - regarded Young as the obvious starter among those four. More likely that he wanted options, alternatives, etc. In short, I think Young <i>was</i> bought as a squad player of sorts. The money was stupid - but that's the domestic market for you.

The question has to be, though, whether he can be a squad player for us NOW, based on his ability, not his salary or the question of whether he's "United quality" in the sense that, say, RVP is.

<b><i>Young isn't worth the money.</i></b> Fair enough but quite irrelevant as the money has already been paid and he's here on a contract which doesn't expire for another two years.

<i><b>Young isn't good enough to be a starter for a United side with high ambitions.</b></i> Fair enough but quite irrelevant as the idea is to keep him on the books as a squad player, not a starter.

<i><b>Young is shit and can't play football.</b></i> Clearly not true.

793~~~
A squad player should be someone like Schurrle, solid player who produces good stats and can keep first teamers on their toes.

794~~~
... No, I'd say that's pretty much on the money.

795~~~
There won't be the same impetus for rotation next season without European football. I think ultimately I'd rather see a younger player with room for development used as back up but if he stays on, so be it. From his own perspective, he might be better accepting lower wages for regular game time elsewhere.

796~~~
It's not. I suspect you know that too. But it's far easier, of course, to simply say he's completely useless. Makes any discussion superfluous, doesn't it?

797~~~
I agree with all that. We'll see how it goes soon enough. If Young stays and LVG doesn't give him a sniff, he'll probably be more inclined to leave (even if it costs him in terms of wages) himself.

798~~~
If we has to do it all over again, clearly no one here would support Picking up Ashley Young for the fee/wages we paid for him.  But here he is and as a squad man he can help at the margins.  There will be no buyers for him at his current wages, so we'll just have to let him run out his contract and use him once a month or so.

I didn't like the signing in the first place.  This is another one of those Ferguson legacy signings that went tits up, like Anderson, that's no doubt much like the albatross signing every major club has to deal with.

799~~~
Did well today, nice cut back for James' first goal and then supplied well timed runs and finishes for Ander's through balls. Might workout for him as a wide forward in a 3-4-1-2.

800~~~
It was what, 2 goals and 2 assists ? Fantastic performance from him, really took his chance. It's still Young of course but bloody hell, maybe he could work in that formation.

801~~~
Fair play to him. Probably should have had a hat-trick as well.

802~~~
Took his chances well, changes nothing though.

803~~~
Had some nice touches and runs in addition to the goals. And an assist too! Weirder things have happened...

804~~~
Felt like alternative reality watching his finishing and trickery.

Looks like LVG may be planning to reprogram him to something completely new.

805~~~
Seems he might work in the 'Robben' role in the new formation. Less chance of him relying on his formulaic ways when he's on not on the wings.

806~~~
Good performance from a good player.

807~~~
Maybe LVG can get the best out of him and he could then be decent backup

808~~~
Good performance. Hopefully he can have a good season.

809~~~
Of all the positives from tonight, his is the one performance I would put little stock into. LVG fixing Young would be a true miracle

810~~~
Well maybe he will actually make a decent striker? We already know he is pretty useless as a wide player but maybe he can be a decent backup up front, who know?

811~~~
I never got the over the top hate for Young. I am not saying he is a wonderful player or anything. But he is a very decent squad player and way more useful and versatile in his play than Valencia who is just awful.

812~~~
He'd played with an incredible intelligence, confidence, and desire to have the ball.

813~~~
No lads just no. Finished his chances well but that overhit corner....Christ. Imagine being 1-1 against Chelsea in the last 3 mins, you get a corner, he's on the wing.....horrible thought.

814~~~
Would be fantastic if he could turn it around. Here is hoping.

815~~~
He was good today at finishing, but I don't care. Would rather not have him take away minutes from other players.

816~~~
Good game from him, and took his chance to impress the new boss very well. Time will tell if he can keep this sort of performance up, particularly against quality opposition.

817~~~
He started the second half poorly by rarely getting involved in the game and not doing much, but as the second half went on, he grew into the game and actually had a good statistical output in the end (2 goals, 1 assist). Then again, by that time, the Galaxy were getting easily opened up as they pushed high up the pitch to get some goals. Still, he was alright in his combination play, but his movement wasn't that great, overall. His positioning was also somewhat reserved from him.

van Gaal has made Young more effective, at least, so that's good to see. His pace and quickness can be a problem for defences, and if he becomes a more confident player, he can become a useful player for us like he was in his first 3-4 months here.

818~~~
This.  More chance James turns out to be as good as James ("Hamez") than Young becoming good enough for United regularly.

819~~~
Not a Young fan but have to admit he played well today.

820~~~
Good performance but I doubt it will be enough for him to retain his place. If not anything, if he performs well on tour, that will mean we can get few additional millions when selling him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

821~~~
He can work in this sort of system when he's part of a fluid front three. He's at his worst when made to hug the touchline and is face to face with his fullback.

822~~~
Agree with this, the times he's impressed have been when he runs through the middle, I dont think he is good enough out wide at this level. Id be happy with him in the squad as a 2nd striker.

823~~~
he hasn't done well for us - everyone can agree on that. Doesn't change the fact that on his day he is a good player - if LvG can get the best of his Villa-days out of him - what a bonus

824~~~
Are you guys really getting excited on a pre-season game against LA Galaxy? He's a decent player but just not good enough and it will show against better opposition. Someone mentioning the Robben role for him is just <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

825~~~
But that's the role he's played today, what's wrong with it ? Nobody's comparing him to Robben.

Nobody's getting excited either, he's played well, took his chance unlike players like Kagawa, Nani or Cleverley for that matter.

826~~~
LVG has said that he wants to assess the current squad before any transfer activity and I guess this was exactly the sort of thing he was looking for. More of this and the likes of Di Maria will be quietly crossed off the list of targets.

827~~~
Kind of unfair to Kagawa who as we know from the end of last season, can't play in midfield.

828~~~
He'll have to adapt or be gone then really. Before it was Rooney and Mata for the #10, then you've got Adnan and today even Herrera showed that he's versatile and comfortable in the CM or CAM role. We were absolutely shitting on LA in the last 20 minutes or so, him playing in midfield doesn't really stop him from playing a through ball from time to time, no ?

829~~~
This game will give him a lot of confidence going forward. Hopefully he can keep this up and continue playing like this.

830~~~
Well he was generally deeper than Cleverley apart from 2-3 instances, but yes, with this system he will have to prove himself to LVG wherever he plays or he'll be gone.

831~~~
Not comparing, but saying he can play the "Robben role". Which he obviously cant. Let's keep things in perspective

832~~~
He didn't have that much of an consistent impact on the game, imo other than his 2 goals. Seemed to be rather anonymous Maybe my dislike for him is clouding my judgement. Doesn't matter, think Nani and Young will be probably off since LVG is looking to play a No 10 and 2 strikers with 3 central midfielders. Can't see Nani or Young having the intelligence to adapt to LVG's tactics.

833~~~
He came on at half time and assisted 1 and scored 2. I definitely think it's your dislike of him that's clouding your judgement.

Looked up for this match and performed well. His striker counterpart on the other hand was well..meh.

834~~~
If no club is going to buy him, we might should keep him as a backup. He is an utility player. He can play as winger, attacking mid, and even 2nd striker. If I remember he used to play as a 2nd striker with Watford. This is probably can work with LVG issue since we are still confused with our formstion.

835~~~
Januzaj can play all 3 of those roles too. Wouldn't you rather him instead of Young? Same with Nani or possibly Lingard (if he's not on loan).

836~~~
That shouldn't change anything. He's nowhere near good enough for United. LvG wont be fooled.

837~~~
Yup you are right, perhaps I was a bit too harsh on him since he was involved in all 4 of our second half goals. Just can't bring myself to praise Young <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>.

838~~~
Yes I prefer Januzaj and Lawrence as well. But with so many deadwood it is impossible to get rid all of them in one summer transfer. I must say Young is one of best deadwood we can keep. I don't like his wage though.
We can sell nani to outside EPL. Loan Lingard to EPL clubs.

839~~~
Well to be fair he does play better through the middle. Which he did at Villa. 

My only gripe with him was that we were starting him in important games. I don't mind him being on the bench.

840~~~
Smashley Young

841~~~
Could he be converted into a wingback? His workrate has always been good?

842~~~
Would be pretty weak and easy to get past I imagine. Doesn't have the physicality to be solid defensively, imo.

843~~~
Good performance from a very good player. It's so sad many United fans can't get their heads out of their rectums concerning Young.

He's miles better than Valencia. He was injured for most parts in the last 2 seasons & his performance was rubbish last season because we had a manager that was wholesomely a simpleton.

I hope Young keeps this up & gives us a good service this new season. He's a very good player and has more ammo to hurt the opposition than Valencia.

844~~~
Indeed. Opinions are built over time.

845~~~
doesn't he always impress in pre-season though? 

Good goals last night but he really does need to go, performances in pre-season friendlies won't sway my opinion of him.

846~~~
We are quick to forget that Young was quite a dynamic player when he first signed (the 5-3 against Spurs comes to mind). He was fast, had a good shot, and I remember him being a refreshing alternative to one-trick Valencia, who ironically has had a similar decline. If somehow LvG can bring him back to life, he would be a valuable asset.

847~~~
Could he be converted to a decent CM? Ala Schweinsteiger v0.001

He seems to be pretty decent at all the fundamentals. As far as I remember Schweinsteiger was exactly the same as a winger.

He works hard, can pass decently, has a good shot. He wouldn't necessarily need to beat a man, which is probably his biggest downfall when playing wide.

Just a wild thought.

848~~~
Also, it's a real shame Young was never able to really kick on his game to the next level. 

Anyone remember how outstanding he was at Watford?

I think he is another on the large list of players who could never rise to the pressure of Man Utd.

849~~~
Depends on what LVG's thinks of him really. If he really wants to give everyone a clean slate then Young has got off to a very good start... Was rather disappointed at how Young got into the team over Lingard and Zaha. Plenty of pre-season games yet to come and hopefully Lingard or Zaha grab their opportunities and show their potential which would hasten Young's exit...

850~~~
Can't really read too much into his performance. We know he can finish, and he should score more goals but two good runs to break their defensive line

851~~~
He was really impressive in 07/08 when O'Neill was comparing him to Ronaldo. He scored 8 goals and had 17 assists in EPL that season while winning young player of the year in EPL the next season. He seems like the type of player who excel in mid table teams and look out of depth at the top teams.

852~~~
played well but still not at United standards. He needs to move on and we need to get as much as we can for him. Yes he finished well last night but really didn't look into it much as i do think his true colours will shine against better teams. He most likely will be sold. Personally, thats what i am hoping for.

853~~~
He has more chance of being kept than Nani anyway.

854~~~
He was twice a member of the PFA Team of the Year at Villa too. Was also impressive in his debut season here. The diving and some injuries that hampered his form have soured a lot of people's opinions of him, but he's far away from being a poor player.

855~~~
Happy for him.

The biggest positive. He didn't play on the left and didn't cut in and make aimless crosses to the far corner.

856~~~
No, shit performances have been the reason everyone wants him sold

857~~~
Think he might be utilised in the same way LVG used Kuyt for the Netherlands.

On the other hand if he keeps playing like this his value must be slowly creeping up and a club might be more inclined to snap him up <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

858~~~
Poor form which came from niggling injuries every time he built up a bit of form. Our wingers, with the obvious exception of Januzaj, were poor last season but Young was the only one who had any real period of form. He's 29 now and unlikely to get his form back so I'd move him on too if we received offers, but he gets more stick than anyone else and people say he's a shit player which simply isn't true.

859~~~
Hopefully a couple of goals against a shite MLS team won't save him.

860~~~
No. He's been shit regardless of niggling injuries.

861~~~
Well he wasn't shit in his first season, the only season he didn't get niggling injuries.

862~~~
Pleased for him. Now granted, he is a diving sissy and one of the most infuriating United players i've ever seen, but some of the vitriol he gets from out fans is quite shameful imo.

He got a lot of stick last season, and rightly so, but keep in mind we had a complete charlatan as our manager and none of our other wingers were covering themselves in glory either.

863~~~
One performance against LA Galaxy in a pre season should not get anyone thinking he is good enough now, still a poor player, and united will still need a top class winger, which united are heavily short of, just like defence and midfield

864~~~
He is still a poor player, for the standards of MUFC he's above average player

865~~~
He was only good in the first 2 months. Valencia and Nani were better for far longer periods.

866~~~
He's a good little player, but yeah going by the standards of United players in recent years he isn't top notch.
That just isn't true, he was good for the vast majority of the season. Granted Valencia and Nani were also excellent that season.

867~~~
What a strange post.

You seem to be saying that a poor player would be considered above average "for the standards of MUFC". Are you sure you meant to type that?

868~~~
Just above average, he's got ability no question, more ability than valencia, but for the standards united have set for decades he is not a united standard player

869~~~
If I remember correctly, most of his end product was in the first 2 months, maybe 3 months in. He was overshadowed by Nani in the first half of the season before his injury and then Valencia really picked it up in the 2nd half of the season.

870~~~
I'm even more confused now. Those bits in bold completely contradict each other.

871~~~
he's a poor player who is an above average player who isn't a Utd standard player but is an above average player by Utd standards.

What's not to get?

872~~~
Even Ashley young played well today. This fact is helping me keep grounded after today's performance.

873~~~
I said he's got ability, does not mean it's contradicting. Just because I said he's above average does not mean he's very good, meaning he's an ok player, still a poor player for united standards

874~~~
Maybe van gaal can robben him.

875~~~
Two wonderful assists from Herrera helped things though.

876~~~
Januzaj if anyone. Can dribble past players, is more creative than Young, and is left footed.

877~~~
I like him. There, I said it.

878~~~
I actuay felt he did okay under Sir Alex, had a great start but then got injured and the whole diving and twitter issue left him low on confidence. Had a poor second season and even worse third one under Moyes, but then again, so did everyone else. 

His greatest weakness does seem to be crossing (at United anyway) so as a winger, that's shocking; but if there is a change of system and the ball is on the ground most of the time, I think the likes of him and Nani may shine. 

He was one of the three I really wanted out this summer (the others being Anderson and Nani who have such poor attitudes) but from memory, Young was one of the few that looked like he cared when he played. He is a confidence player and from the looks of it, LVG loves giving the players confidence. Everyone should be given a clean slate under LVG, and if he continues to impress, I don't see why we shouldn't give him another chance.

879~~~
What really impressed me vs Galaxy is that he made what seemed a conscious effort to stay on his feet rather than simulate contact. A couple of instances (Ander's through balls on both occasions - the second one resulted in a goal) I'd have expected Young to go down but he didn't, fairplay to the man.

880~~~
Can't believe people are being fooled by a decent Young performance against basically a pub team.

881~~~
I even doubt 7-0 is a good result when LA was so crap today. But the again, we can't deny that Young did really well in that game.
But we still need to take the positive

882~~~
You have to give him some credit, he played well, and this goes for all of the players. We've seen players who are poor and have gone on to have poor seasons have good games in pre season against junk teams. Hopefully he can keep this up but trying not to get ahead of myself here.

883~~~
I loved every runs from Young, very good in that aspect.

884~~~
His movement was fantastic and took his chances well. Very good 45mins from Young.

885~~~
Excellent last night. Thrilled for him.

886~~~
Perfectly reasonable to give him his due when he puts in a good showing.

887~~~
Absolutely. But people are thinking he should stay now on the back of this which is madness.

888~~~
Played really well. Looked like his old Villa self. Still not fooled. Still want him gone. Still one swallow does not a summer make. Still LA Galaxy were dogshit.

889~~~
Surely every player deserves a fresh start under the new boss? There were many players last season who performed as badly as Young has. He's as entitled as any other player to earn a place in the team.

890~~~
Should try him in the right wingback spot. I'm sure our plan is to use valencia or rafael there but we all know rafael is gonna get injured and valencia's crossing is hopeless.

891~~~
So he either stays as backup striker or leaves. Same applies to Nani. It was bizarre seeing the two play upfront last night.

892~~~
I wouldn't mind him staying. He's a confidence player. If LVG can convince him he's a professional footballer then he'd be a good squad player.

893~~~
To be honest, I'm not sure last night is going to make a difference to his likelihood of staying. if anything it may make him easier to sell.

The truth is the guy's failed to perform in three seasons, and more importantly, his worst performances have often been in important games.

Couple that with the fact that we're playing 3-4-3 to start off with (which doesn't really use wingers so much as wingbacks) and I don't see where he's going to get a game anyway. Notice that he came on in the second half with the kids & subs not in the first half with the senior players.

894~~~
2 goals in the dying minutes with resistance broken, playing as a striker where we have plenty of more talented options. If he can't be useful as a winger he should be sold and that is still what I think is best to all involved, at least for United!

895~~~
Odds are we'd still be paying for him, even if we get rid, if his reported wages are near true.

It'll be one of these silly deals where the buying club agrees to give us a pretty looking fee, so we don't look so stupid, but we're actually still paying a good percentage of his salary.

896~~~
If only.

897~~~
Didn't he also provide a cross/assist?
I've only seen the highlights, so can't say for sure but he seemed better.  Not good enough, but better somehow, like with that cross he actually aimed it rather than just belting it at random across the box.

I actually think this lad has his moments and some good runs.  Sadly they just don't happen that often.

898~~~
Despite being a serial diver, I think Young can come good under Louis van Gaal.

If anything, we have seen LvG turn a very mediocre (looking) Dutch NT into a squad that came 3rd at the World Cup. There were plenty of Eredivisie players in that team and somehow they did much much better than all those English NT players who basically all play in the Premier League.

899~~~
Despite? I really didn't get the impression serial divers struggled under him.

900~~~
They kept playing over and over Young's post match interview ... He of all people! Yeah he's scored twice and had a good game for 45 mins. Still want him sold. Sorry!

901~~~
So when those same players play like shit again and lvg gets the boot, do they get another clean slate the season after? How about the season after that? Young has not been good enough for more than just last season and it will take more than 45 minutes against a glorified pub team to change mine and others minds

902~~~
Agreed, it's amazing how a couple of goals against the type of non-league level team you'd expect to meet in the first round of the FA Cup has suddenly transformed Young into an asset despite 3 poor seasons in actual top flight competition for us. All his career he's had little clusters of games where he plays well but that is what you expect from a kid coming through, not a seasoned pro who should be consistent, hopefully this flattering to deceive cons someone into buying him.

903~~~
I believe he and Valencia will be tried out for one more season.

904~~~
Valencia should be sold to Stoke. He's not a football player. He should have been a professional miner. Young contributes more to the team, numbers don't lie. Nani & Young are our 2 best wingers.

905~~~
The way he played the Galaxy's offside trap was better than anyone else who played up there in the game. His link up play with Herrera was like what you'd expect from a top class striker, and he's obviously a fast player so he has a lot of assets we can use in this system if he plays the way he did last night.

906~~~
We got our own marco reus.

907~~~
Imagine if Young became a quality centre-forward? Our Robben? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

908~~~
Someone parachute this man/woman and his/her optimism into every crisis zone on Earth.

909~~~
If Young puts in performances like that from now to the start of the season and LVG is impressed, then I'm sure he wont give a feck if Young had scored 10 own goals in a single game.

I thought it was an OK performance and precisely what players like Herrera/Mata/Kagawa need. Some of the one touch stuff he played was very nice.

910~~~
i always slag off young but yesterday there's no denying he had a really solid game. far more effective than nani.

nevertheless, this doesn't mean we should keep him. hopefully today's performance means that teams outside the championship will now be interested in him.

911~~~
Tbf his movement has always been good off the ball. At his best he needs to be in a fluid front free where he can pick up space to run with the ball as opposed to having to hold the width where he hasn't got the skill or control to be a constant threat. Our strikers like to get involved in play so unlike at Villa he doesn't have a proper target when crossing.

912~~~
Youngs best opportunity to impress is in that forward role. Either left of a 3 or something similar to the Robben World Cup role. 

He's got pace and a good finish on him but not enough in his game to be effective from deeper.

913~~~
Hopefully he impresses enough in pre season for a Stoke or Southampton to take a punt on him.

914~~~
in terms of finishing off moves or supplying the final ball, i'm okay with young staying. as for the other parts of his game, incredibly frustrating

915~~~
LVG said he will give everyone a chance to impress and Young has done exactly that. No complains here. He started a little shaky in the first 10 minutes, but then grew into the game - by the end he was one of most impressive players. It's just Galaxy, so early days - I'd like to keep an open mind, but I want to see more performances like yesterday before I get convinced.

916~~~
Maybe it was a bit optimistic to compare them, Reus is nowhere near his level.

917~~~
Greatly taken goals for Youngy. 2 goals, 2 assists, smashing game.

918~~~
We all should be happy about Young's performance and maybe more good performances in the next friendlies

A) Van Gaal likes him

B) More clubs are interested in him

919~~~
I haven't been fooled. Against competent players he'll be his old self. Running down blind alleys, turning around and passing backwards. And falling over a lot.

920~~~
Alas.  So true.

921~~~
No surprise he's more effective when he doesn't actually have to try something other than strike the ball. He's got a good shot on him, usually. It's out wide where he's offered next to nothing since he's been at United. He can't go past players and his crosses are mainly overhit. He scored a couple of good goals last season, but when he played on the wing he was just completely ineffective. Full backs generally had their easiest day of the season when Ashley Young ran at them. Cut back, overhit cross, rinse, repeat. Oh well, now he's scored 2 against a beaten LA Galaxy we should give him another chance. Lingard scored a few last year too on tour and he probably wont make it.

922~~~
I'm dead certain he isn't ever going to make it here , whooping poor teams when they are already down means nothing. This merely means that someone may be impressed and hopefully we can get rid of him for a good price

923~~~
Lets just play him up front and change his name via deed poll to Smashley Young once and for all. He'll score 35 a season up front no drama.

Give him some credit, he did bury his chances when they were presented. It doesn't change my opinion on him, but I will say that if we were to play with wingers, I'd much rather have Young starting than Valencia. Of course both are terrible, but at least Young can maybe add something to attack once a game, as opposed to Valencia who winning a corner is as good as it will get in an attacking sense.

925~~~
If it was between young and Valencia, I'd take Valencia.
I think Valencia would be useful at rb/rwb and rm/rw, especially late in a game...he has pace to burn and can still put in a cross.

Young is a one trick pony and a coward. He occasionally scores a goal or two and that seems to make folks in here forget his shortcomings. 
Also, the salary he is on at the moment is atrocious.

926~~~
I'll give him credit for last night, but one game doesn't change my attitude to him at all. Goodness, have a look at some of the match day threads of last season when he played.....bugger me, there was hardly a soul who didn't want him out. Now...after a couple of goals and decent play against a side which, let's be honest, is hardly up to the heights of most of the permier league teams, people suddenly want to keep him and think he might wizzardly become a great player for us...

get rid....end of.

927~~~
Hope we sell him, and sell him soon. Aside from lacking the quality, he doesn't have a place in the 3-5-2 system (nor would he have one in a 4-3-3, being behind several others); we're maxed out for forwards and number 10s, and he's not good enough to be a wing-back. The best that he's been for us isn't good enough, and 3 full seasons proving that aren't all erased by 2 goals scored against an LA Galaxy second string side already down 5-0.

928~~~
I'll repeat this view that I have made about a million times.

What did Young do wrong last season? Moyes picked a formation that clearly didn't suit us or the majority of our players. If you sell Young for being rubbish last season then we'd end up with 6 players (that's being generous.)

Now I like Valencia, he gets away with an awful lot. Why? He offered nothing for the majority of last season. 

Assumng we do go 3-5-2, we'll still need a back up plan. 4411/4231 requires wingers, now your not going to bring any winger of note in to play back up unless you sell Rooney. Young and Valencia may aswell stay for the next season and see where we are in August 2015.

929~~~
A lot of the scorn at him stems from the fee and the wages, I think as fans we pay too much attention sometimes to this kind of thing.

930~~~
If played in the center would be a perfect replacement for lallana at saints

931~~~
Define 'making it.'

Bebe isn't going to 'make it' here as he will never be a regular in the first team. Young has 'made it,' we just think he's a bag of shite.

932~~~
Young has been shit for 2 of the 3 years he's been with us not just last season. Not to mention he's an unrepentant diver. Even his so called great first year with us was overrated. The shit crosses, cowardly backpasses and percentage play were all on display then. It's just that his confidence really fell after his Sunday League showing at the Euros.

933~~~
His first few months he was good, after that downhill from there

934~~~
I wish he was whooping poor teams when they are down

935~~~
Even if we'd paid a lot less for him, he'd still be getting a lot of stick because he's just rarely been great in a United shirt. Sure, people might not be moaning as much about the price/wages and how we paid too much, but instead people would likely complain about why we ever signed him in the first place. There are some players who get way too much criticism due to their price tag - Young isn't one of them. With his level of performance since he came here, people would be complaining about him no matter what.

936~~~
Every 2/3 years, United fans seem to develop a genuine hatred for one of our own players. I find that bizarre.
Fans seem to find excuses for other players.

937~~~
Direct swap for Di Maria anyone??

938~~~
Calling it now, Young is gunna have a very good (great might be pushing it) season.

The main quality he brings to a football pitch for me is his movement and runs, he's always lively and I think with the way we are expecting to play this season, he's gunna be important.

939~~~
Was decent again. And put in a great ball for Keane.

940~~~
I thought he was decent in a flying in and getting booked sort of way. Not overly convincing defending, but he made decent ground down the right a few times from the wingback role

941~~~
Decent performance again by him. I start to like him again our Ashley.

942~~~
Thought he was awful as wing back. But I'm not judging, not his position obviously and he was great against LA.

943~~~
I think he'll end up staying. I reckon Nani and Zaha will be sold provided we can get buyers. He's not very good but you can't knock Young's effort.

944~~~
Thought he was OK actually, can still put a good ball in (which Valencia rarely seems to anymore) but also gave the ball away to Roma in a dangerous area. I've said before that I'd rather keep Nani and get rid of Young, but Young has been better than both Nani and Valencia so far on tour.

Whether he could still be a part of our team next season is a different question though, because you wouldn't think he's a natural wing back. I don't think he's ever been asked to cover for Evra in the past for example, we'd normally play Buttner or move Evans over. He has been used by Ferguson in some of the big games with Valencia during the 12/13 season because of their willingness to get back and help out the full back, however I'd be worried if we played against some of the better league teams with Valencia and Young as right and left wings backs.

945~~~
Fully agree. Nani is more talented than both Young and Valencia on his day, but the other two will work their arses off even if they have a bad game whereas Nani can look very disinterested. Look at the commitment Valencia showed when his eye got busted up vs. Bayern. Young might dive a lot but he actually will get back if the full back gets caught out of position.

946~~~
Think he still has a future here, don't expect him to be sold this season.  He shows commitment, work rate, tactical awareness, versatility and is a useful team player, which are a good fit for LVG's teams.

947~~~
Not that much difference between Valencia and him at wingback. At least he put a nice ball into the box for Keane.

948~~~
He'd really surprise me if he staked down a claim for a wing back position here. 

Decent performance but he'd be crucified against top opponents in a game that matters judging by his defensive contributions.

A lot of interesting positional experiments conducted by LVG thus far.

949~~~
He's done well to not let the twitter haters get to him and then perform well on the pitch. He's proving to be a better winger than Valencia so far and put some nice deliveries in.

Only thing I remember Valencia doing in that game was over hitting a cross.

950~~~
It was obvious that Young doesn't suit the wing back role. He's very weak, defensively, and often overcommitted on some of his challenges. Going forward as a winger, however, he was alright and looked pretty confident. His cross to Will Keane was very good and almost got us a 4th goal were it not for Roma's right back intercepting the cross.

He's certainly performing better than last season, at least, when he looked devoid of confidence and didn't have much of an idea of what to do on the pitch.

951~~~
I guess playing as a wing back is easier than playing on the wings for Young.

But part of me things that the obvious thing to do, would be to buy a real winger and then there is no need to play 3/5 at the back. It is all well and good playing a formation/system to suit the squad, but it needs to be balanced as the £30 million United just spent on Shaw looks a waste in the current formation considering his attributes.

I know it is way to early to make any conclusions...but yeah if LVG wants to get Young into the team then wing back (reduced attacking and defensive duties) might be his best option

952~~~
Its amazing how people will continue to justify their views of players even when the player plays well. It just sticks in peoples throats. He made a couple of foals, big deal so does everyone all over the pitch. His runs behind people are great, and his goal scoring is best in the club from wide positions. He's made for the LVG system.

953~~~
Totally agree man. He's showing that he really wants to be here with his efforts & thats what we want to see from our players.

I was extremely anti-Young before the tour, but i've seen enough of him to take my hat off to him. 

Comparing Young to Nani on tour, tells the whole story of who needs to be shot of & who has the fight to play well for the team & LvG..

954~~~
Fortunately for Young he seems to be having his twice a year path of form where he has 3 or 4 decent performances at just the right time to avoid a well deserved axe. He's not suited to RWB defensively but did get one good cross in which is more than Valencia managed.

955~~~
Van Gaal traditionally likes to have a front 3/4/5 that interchange.

Young can do that.

He wouldn't be first choice but could potentially fit in easily if we have injuries/suspensions.

956~~~
We work to a budget at United and it's a lot smaller than many of the teams we compete against.

957~~~
Seems like we have found a role for Young in the first team squad after all

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Tour-2014/Tour2014News/2014/Jul/Ashley-Young-eyes-Patrice-Evra-DJ-role.aspx#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/Tour-2014/.../Ashley-Young-eyes-Patrice-Evra-DJ-role.aspx#</a>

958~~~
Yep, fair enough to be honest. I still really don't rate him at all as a player, and I'd rather we didn't have to play him. But he is at least very obviously giving it his all. Nani looks like he couldn't care less.

959~~~
Man when I saw this thread bumped on a night when we had some transfers out news I got my hopes up.

960~~~
There are a bazillion fullbacks who are smaller than Young.

961~~~
"When we play this system, he has to play as a striker, otherwise he cannot play," said the boss. "Young is another winger but he can play as wing-back. We shall see."

Interesting quote from Van Gaal re Zaha and Young.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Jul/louis-van-gaal-will-stick-with-new-system-for-the-rest-of-manchester-united-tour.aspx?newsid=E294D814-4366-4EBE-AB9A-93B2861579FE&amp;pageNo=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...E294D814-4366-4EBE-AB9A-93B2861579FE&amp;pageNo=1</a>

962~~~
I love how definite LvG is about players and how he's keen to avoid playing players outside of their natural skillset.

963~~~
You have to believe in the players while they're here.

Ashley Young might very well regain his Villa form under Van Gaal. Nobody knows. Some players play way better under different managers, tactics and formations.

He's looking like one of our best players so far in pre season. He's making the runs and shooting more. That's what we want to see. Young has been riddled with injuries since he came here.

He's never really got a consistent run of games to my knowledge. Therefore he's missed those chances to catch a break for himself an develop some good form. I'd give him till January at the least to see what he can do.... But if West Ham or someone came in with a 7m-12m bid for him, I'd probably say sell him.

964~~~
What's height got to do with it? Young has one of the slightest frames you will see on a footballer. A player like Lahm would knock him through to next week, irrespective of height.

965~~~
Looks like Young's going through his annual 'couple of games of decent form to tidy him over for the next 6 months full of injuries and crap performances'

Come January, he'll put in another couple of decent performances, and the cycle begins over again.

966~~~
True, sadly. The 'good squad player' line will be trotted out also, of course. He's anything but.

967~~~
Well it is pretty obvious. He's never played as a wingback and I don't think he has the skillset for it.

968~~~
LVG clearly seems impressed so far. At the end of the day Young probably has more ability than Kuyt yet the Dutch love Kuyt because of his commitment to the side, running ability to play wherever the manager wants....maybe Young will be that player under LVG. He's fit enough to play wing back, I havent seen him defensively be that great but he does track back. 

I thought he would be shipped off. But with LVG's latest comments maybe not. Everyone has new opportunities under a new manager maybe he'll take his.

969~~~
I want young gone, reality for us all? we cannot sign many players at all, and there is the saying you are given the hand you are dealt with. In van gaal's case he will have to get the best out of what we have got, it is going to make it more difficult to rebuild the squad with another wasted transfer summer, making next year even harder to rebuild has we may need a few more next year, has we still need 3 defenders 2 midfielders and so on

970~~~
Young can be our Kuyt. So exciting!

971~~~
Ashley Young is the new Demacus Beasley.

972~~~
Young does work incredibly hard, but for our only player on the left of the pitch to be a right footer, and Ashley Young at that?

Surely we need a player there who is going to stay out wide and hug the touchline to provide the space inside for others? Ok, Young can stay wide but once given the ball his only option is to bring it inside, especially since he'll have no fullback to overlap anymore to keep the play wide.

I'm sure it's just a one-off thing while Shaw is working on his fitness.. I hope anyway. Can't see us going into next season with Young as our cover for LWB/LB.

973~~~
I swear he doesn't. Didn't he put on a bit of weight recently? I remember him coming off the subs bench and looking bigger.

Oh, and ever heard of a guy named Jordi Alba?

974~~~
feck. I'm now resigned to the fact that Young will be with us for another year. Good thing he won't have to cross as much or cut inside as much this season at wingback.

975~~~
I want him gone purely for the ridiculous £130,000 a week he earns.

976~~~
He has won and told us: "eat your heart out, I'm stayingggg"

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/oTz_U0DVVB/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

977~~~
Seems like Young will only play as a wingback under Van Gaal. He's not good enough to occupy one of the attacking places, especially in a 3-5-2 where he'd have to play as a striker. If we switch to 4-3-3 Van Gaal will probably buy another wide attacker so no place for Young again.

978~~~
I think he will thrive under LVG's discipline of knowing exactly what's expected of him, strange to think that in this system, he's a wing back or a striker, I'd have him more of a Striker than a wing back, but LVG said he's more of a wing back didn't he?

979~~~
He's probably saved his United career with a few decent games as a wingback. Ashley Kuyt it is.

Meanwhile Nani has probably done the opposite with a few games where he didnt work hard enough.

980~~~
Ashley Kuyt! Love it.

Yeah, I was actually surprised by how well he did the defensive part of the wing back stuff today. No rash challenges, no panicking under pressure. Its easy to say he usually helps out his full back, but as Van Gaal was telling the press yesterday wing back is a specialist role. Young's been set a challenge by Van Gaal and he's risen to it. Fair play to him. If he can sort out his crossing a bit and get his old thunderb-d shooting going again he'll be a proper asset this season.

981~~~
Why does United constantly let him take corners?

982~~~
He was alright today, but himself and Valencia are so amazingly shit at crossing it amazes that they were actually considered wingers.

983~~~
He's done surprisingly good at left wing back today, was shit scared that we'd get ripped to shreds but hey, Inter decided to be dicks and park it so, yea, good game from him.

984~~~
He takes a extra touch everytime and slows the play down. He was alright but don't see him as a Wingback option regularly at all tbh.

985~~~
I thought he got more involved offensively as a RWB, him and Valencia don't really look the answer though.

986~~~
young's performance reminded me of LVG's likeness for workhorses in the team. Young is definitely one of them

987~~~
Yeah he was good.
Wing Back might be the perfect position for him.

Have to agree with the crossing being crap though.
Dont know what happened on that front, all of our players have been terrible at it for a good while now.

I remember when valencia was awesome at crossing, its weird.

988~~~
I think he's the player (along with Rooney) whose done the best for his United career since these friendlies started.

989~~~
agreed.  He appears to be gaining confidence as well.

990~~~
Making mugs of some people.

991~~~
Going to be our Dirk Kuyt with better crossing.

992~~~
Been excellent in fairness.

993~~~
Has resurrected his season here with this pre season and pissed a lot of ppl off as a result.

994~~~
I'll take back all the negative things I said about Young if he carries this form on to next season and help us win a silverware.

995~~~
Surely even his biggest critics can't be opposed to him as an attacking wing-back?

996~~~
Been our best player during pre-season. Someone needs to make that Vince McMahon gif with all of his goals.

997~~~
Brilliant performances from him throughout the pre season. Who would have thought he would be the one van Gaal gets back to life?

998~~~
Your not wrong....

999~~~
Deserves to stay at this rate. The system is working for him and he's showing some really good pre season form. He's looking like our best option from the wings at this moment. Who saw that coming?

1000~~~
Ashley Kuyt is playing very well. His attacking style translates very well to the wingback role where you expect a little less out of your wideman than a winger.

Defensively he still hasnt been tested

1001~~~
He's been a revelation today.

I'm almost speechless.

1002~~~
Put him on the right and let's find a a better option on the right. I like Valencia but, again, completely beat his man but, ball was on his left and took it back to the right to the defender and then had to try break defender's leg to get cross in.

1003~~~
He's definitely done better than Valencia with the switch to wingback.

1004~~~
I still think he is very susceptible when he has to defend, particularly aerially, but I can't deny that he is infinitely more threatening than Valencia and even Shaw (currently) on his current form.

1005~~~
Ashley Kuyt is undergoing a renaissance. I've doubted him, slated him, questioned him. I never thought Young would regain his form as a winger nevermind a wing back. The way he's applied himself, got his head down and taken on the tutelage of Van Gaal demands respect. Pleased for him. Long may it continue.

1006~~~
Fantastic 1st half. Well played.

1007~~~
I came into this thread expecting to see a bunch of people trying to somehow say that despite his performances, they still think he's shit.

I'm pleasantly surprised to see him getting the credit he deserves. He is taking to this system very well and even if he is not a starter, he could be a good sub to bring on for Shaw/Rafael when we're pushing for a goal.

1008~~~
I'd rather have him than di Maria personally. I like watching him play and i love it when our players prove people wrong (Carrick, de gea, fletcher etc.).

1009~~~
I thought he would be first name on transfer list (After Anderson obviously) but he has been surprisingly very good. Hope he carries on this form into actual season.

1010~~~
Been fantastic in both roles he's played in the new formation. Bodes well.

1011~~~
I prefer Shaw playing there, but i don't mind Young as a cover. As long as he keep running that line and giving his 100%.

Both alternating might be the ideal solution. (Young looking good against defensive right backs (arbeloa style)

Vs more offensive full backs, maybe Shaw would be a better idea as he is a much better defender.

well, feck it... LvG knows better

ps. we still need more alternatives on that flank...

1012~~~
I'll say it again: stroke of genius.

1013~~~
Young has been playing great in this match, he played well against Inter as well. This is what i want to see from a wing back.

1014~~~
He's had a good half but I maintain my reservations as we have seen these patches of form without consistency his whole career, this needs to be his level week to week not just for a few games before months of mediocrity.

1015~~~
Steady on.

1016~~~
I bet the Nani fanboys will be devastated that he is now closer to the exit than either of Valencia and Young.

1017~~~
He impressed me as a WB, shaky in defence and Real did not really test him, but still. Actually i thought 3-5-2 would suit Valencia. But right now Valencia looks as bleak, indecisive, hitting first defender with his crosses as always, while Young looks a bit rejuvenated by this switch really.
Of course it's all based only on couple pre-season games, so not exactly the most reliable data set.

1018~~~
The season has not started yet and Young has apparently proved the doubters wrong.

1019~~~
i would. I know it's not going to be a popular opinion but it's the opinion i have.

1020~~~
Great username, 'tis all.

1021~~~
You'd rather have Ashley Young on the basis of a few pre season glorified friendlies despite the fact he's barely looked a footballer for a pretty long while now over one of the world's top players who was probably Real Madrid's best player last season with the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Modric knocking around and was a huge part of their champions league win.

Not a popular opinion? It's just utterly mental. Seriously, this games mean absolutely zilch. Madrid have been the worst side from your little group and are obviously actually the best by an absolute mile.

1022~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/AdoredUnevenKillerwhale.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/AdoredUnevenKillerwhale.gif"/>

1023~~~
Madrid to make a mega bid?

1024~~~
He has proven that he deserves to stay, completely changed my mind about him because he really has been great this pre-season.

1025~~~
He was great in his first season, and was englands best player for the euro qualification campaign, then he completely lost all form and confidence at the tournament, and until this pre season, had never been able to recover. I had no idea he had it in him to get back to his best, and on this form he does have a place here.

Its up to him to continue this into the season and prove to the fans he's worthy of the shirt.

1026~~~
Ashley Young scores a brace against Real Madrid.

I know it's pre-season, but I've never expected I can write that.

1027~~~
He looks like a footballer. I know it is preseason, but he's playing wing back against the champions league winners.

1028~~~
His best games in the past 2 seasons have been in pre-season friendlies, so I'll reserve judgement on the guy until he steps to the plate up on a consistent basis in games that actually matter.

That being said Young strikes me as the epitome of a confidence player, and if he can take this form and mindset into the new season there's no reason he can't make an impact.

I remember actually being really excited about us signing him. I want that excitement back Ashley.

1029~~~
I won't change my mind based on pre season  performances BUT if LvG feels he can actually play like that for us for real, then I'll be happy enough for him to stay. He was immense today.

1030~~~
He has taken his chance by responding to the challenge really well in this pre season and thus bought himself more time . He has been on top of everyone's departure list but if he can take this form into the season then by all means let him stay. It's clear that he has earned himself another season/half season.

1031~~~
He has done what we asked from all the players after last season. He has stepped up, he deserves a lot of credit for his performances so far and if he can keep it up I can see a lot of people who will have changed their minds about him come May.

1032~~~
Always have maintained that Young should stay at United and is a very good, versatile squad player to have.

1033~~~
One thing to say though, is he better fecking carry this form into the season, and produce it when it matters.

Young has a tendancy to put in a couple of good performances, then go missing for months.

1034~~~
MOTM for me. Fantastic game.

1035~~~
'You're God damn right' -- Heisenberg

1036~~~
Very good pre season from him really. Just carry this on and you are a fix starter.

1037~~~
If we're sticking with 5212 for this season i think he can do a job as wingback cover on both flanks as well as forward cover. Would rather see him on the right than Valencia, and that was before he had a good pre-season. 

Young might need to develop the defensive side of his game, but Valencia's pretty useless at it and people tend to ignore this.

1038~~~
Very happy for him, he's finally showing what he's capable of and shades of his Villa days and first season with us.  I'd sell both Nani and Zaha before Young, he's got a good attitude and is willing to adapt to the manager's system.  Good squad player to keep around unless someone comes in with a silly offer.

1039~~~
I'd be more than happy with him and james as cover for lwb.
More worried about rwb now with rafa injured and valencia underwhelming so far.

Guess he can cover there too though.

1040~~~
He's surprised me. Playing really well so far. Wouldn't mind him staying, if he keeps up this kind of form.

1041~~~
For the first time since that Arsenal game, Ashley looked like his Aston Villa self.

1042~~~
If he keeps this up I'm perfectly happy that he can cover both left and right wing back roles next season and I no longer think we need to buy anyone to cover those positions. 

Credit again to LVG  for taking the time to look at his options instead of just ditching him like most of us would.

1043~~~
As I expected, Young did very well as the attacking wing back in the team. Defensively, he wasn't too tested with Arbeloa not really doing much on the attack, but still, he intercepted almost all of the long passes coming his way, and he reads the game better than he used to. Plus, on the attack, he's looking more dangerous than before.

I still think he's defensively shaky, but if he's not often tested, then Young can be effective as a wing back, but only on the right side. I still think his one-footedness can cause him problems on the left side.

1044~~~
He has been impressive so far, i think it's partly down to fact he has more space to operate in and doesn't really have to creative or beat a man to be effective on the wing. This role is better suited to his qualities imo. 

As someone else said i'd rather see him on the right with Shaw on the left, Valencia.. well he just doesn't offer much going foward.

1045~~~
All us armchair football managers can't dream of the stuff Louis van Gaal comes up with and pull it off.

Therefore we should all hush it and let the man simply do his magic and don't question his decisions on a forum, we are not worthy of questioning him.

1046~~~
Arguably. The way he's looking.....He could be our best ever player.

1047~~~
how the hell has LVG managed to turn him into a half decent wing back? surely the greatest feat of all time if he plays this well all season!

1048~~~
Well to be honest, he won't be going anywhere now.. I wasn't convinced about him as a wing back but performances like that on a regular basis will obviously change my mind. 

On a side note, loved his dig earlier at Liverpool on MUTv..

1049~~~
What did he say?

1050~~~
It was mentioned that Us and Liverpool could play in the final, the two biggest English clubs and Young replied it would be fantastic for American fans but we are the bigger club of the two.. But with a little smirk.

1051~~~
Thought he had a great game today. Looks really comfortable at left wing back. Would have thought you were mad if you said that to me before Van Gaal's arrival. Genius thinking, to be honest. 

Don't think we need a wing back now. Young has shown in the few games that he's good enough to at least cover for Shaw, Rafael or Valencia. Could even be in contention to start from the form he's been showing of late.

1052~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He has been great over the last few games, hopefully he can keep this up!

1053~~~
Really winning me over, very good pre season, showing heart and excellent attitude

1054~~~
Good on him. Looks like he could be serviceable at the least which is good for the squad. Hopefully he can perform well in games that matter now too.

1055~~~
Really liked him as a person, now i can like him as a player too.

1056~~~
Young might be one of the most intelligent players we have on the team. I never realized how confident he is in interviews. He gives immediate straight to the point answers, well articulated too.

1057~~~
He was in the team previous season because he tracked back to help the defense. Looks like he is made to play the wingback position.

1058~~~
Nani, Nani....vaguely rings a bell. 

Opera singer, maybe?

1059~~~
Has me a bit worried, this result. He was a major defensive liability against Inter and he's been yo-yoing below and above average, but never quite delving into "good for a title-challenging squad" territory. One good match and a lot of people are starting to look at him through rose tinted glasses.

Hope LvG is not so easily impressed. If he decides one good match in pre season is enough to consistently start him, then we might be in some trouble.

1060~~~
The thing with Young is that he can play on both sides. Rafael is always injured, Valencia kind of can't find himself still, so of Young keeps doing such a good work at wing back, LVG a great option even if he lacks defensive skills.
This two sides stuff and his ability to play a bit deeper (compared to Nani) suddenly makes him very much in-demand.

1061~~~
He's been our best "wingback" offensively. Not tested in the slightest defensively. If he comes through a game where he actually has to defend, not dive into tackles on the halfwayline then he'd prove himself as a quality option in that role. For now we just don't know

1062~~~
Has been one of the players everyone expected to be one of the 1st to be shipped out under LvG but we've seen almost no serious rumors linking him to an exit!

1063~~~
Here here.

1064~~~
Hate him as a player, slagged him off big time since his Villa days but, the way he has put his head down and got to work this summer, should be an eye opener for the bollix that is Nani! (Incidentally, a player who I have stood by and defended numerous times)

1065~~~

GOAT

1066~~~
I remember him having a top game against us for you, scored two goals including an absolute pearl as well.

1067~~~
He's had a few pretty good games, just nowhere near often enough.
I think people are slow to give him credit because the diving was embarrasing.
He cut that out towards the end of last season though which is another point in his favour.

1068~~~
Very good last night. I like that this systems forces young and Valencia to keep it simple and rids them of having the burden to create. I'm still doubtful as to how hell cope in the premier league defensively.

1069~~~
Young will be fine defensively. He does a great job of closing down his man and makes it hard for his player to get past him, Valencia on the other hand will flatten his man and give away a free kick. Young might not be able tackle like a specialist full back, but he wont be a slouch either.

1070~~~
I admit it, I have been a young hater. But come one, who would've known he'd be performing so well in his wing back position. Being a hater however, and just traumatized by his past performances, I'll say it's still too early. Can he do a good job defensively against the top players in the premier league? Has to be seen but that's me being a bit negative I guess.

.... just so weird though. His crosses were landing and he was actually beating players!

1071~~~
Geez if someone told me Van Gaal was going to convert Young into a wing back I'd have said you were mental and that he'll be the first out the door. 

Wouldn't mind him staying now. I'd actually prefer him on the right over Valencia when Rafa isn't fit because when Shaw is up to full fitness I expect him and James to battle it out for that spot.

1072~~~
This. His attitude has been fantastic.

1073~~~

"friendly"

always liked his spirit tho <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1074~~~
Might also be why he's becoming quite acclimatised to the new role and the philosophy, it's clear some will pick it up earlier than others.

1075~~~
Valencia has been comfortably better defensively in their careers so far.

1076~~~
I have proper slated young the past 18 months and wanted him out of the door.
He has shocked me this tour on how he has applied himself and from what ive seen of him can really read the game well from left wing back .
I'm not saying pre season friendlys are the real deal but I'm more than encouraged he can do a job for us there .
I wouldn't have bat an eye lid if tony and Ashley were off loaded but after watching the tour games and the system LVG is employing i would be loath to let any of the two go now . 
At worst if LVG was thinking of off loading then there value must have doubled in the last 3 weeks with outstanding performances .
Well done Ashley and credit too you .!

1077~~~
This thread? I've never seen such a change.


Just to remind everyone he was very good for his the first half of his first season. He does have quality, when that failed him he then used his work rate to keep in Fergies plans. But then even that left him and last 2 seasons his confidence must have been totally shot

We saw how much LVG likes Kuyt, if young can apply similar work rate and produce moments of quality he will be very much in his plans

1078~~~
Sensational, how much difference proper coaching can make.]

Haven't seen Young dive once since LvG took over. He is playing like a worldie.

1079~~~
Never thought he deserved all the stick, other than for diving.

He's had bad spells, and longs ones, but it's always been obvious he has the ability. Same with Nani.

1080~~~
Doing well against the current Champions League defenders is obviously not a great feat compared to doing well defensively against good ol hard English men running at ya. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1081~~~
Still has a lot to prove tbh - I'm not about to let a few preseason games change my mind. 

I've never abused him though. And if he continues this form, he'll be well worth a place in the squad.

1082~~~
Feck me are we talking about the same player! What a bunch of turncoats.

1083~~~
If we stick with the 3-5-2 and he keeps up this form then him and Shaw will be more than enough for the LWB position.

1084~~~
I know he's not the most popular player amongst the posters on here but I have always liked him as a player and I'm really pleased that he's found a new lease of life under van Gaal.

1085~~~
Fair play to him. He has worked and fought for his place and improved in this tour despite all the abuse he usually gets.

I would keep him ahead of Valencia and Nani, both of them have been very average and show no signs of improvement.

1086~~~
Absolutely. Young's a decent player - I'm very pleased to see him doing well at the moment.

1087~~~
Everyone got a new chance - seems like he took his. If he can keep that form over the season, he can stay. But that's still a big if for me

1088~~~
It's hard to believe this is the same Ashley Young, though fair play to him, as said above, he's been given another chance and so far he's making the most of it. Has always seemed a nice lad off the field, so it would be good to see him produce on the pitch as well. LVG seems to be put a real emphasis on fitness, and Young could probably patrol that left side all day long, or at least he's gonna have to if he wants to make it into the squad.

1089~~~
This. Great pre season for him but can't help but think he's putting in a shift now beacuse he knows he's out the door rapid if not. I'd ike to see a full, good season from him before being I'm convinced that he deserves to stay beyond any current contract. Part of being good enough at this level is the consistency and the dedication to sustain it beyond a handful of games here and there. I'd been slating him since he joined us but would be delighted if he delivered now.

1090~~~
Confirmed by LvG that he's playing the full 90 v Liverpool. So it looks as if he's going to play a big role for us this year. Genuinely amazed at the turn-around in his game in such a short space of time.

1091~~~
Thought he played far too many safe passes against Madrid. Little penetration. 

Good finish all the same but I'll be very disappointed if this is what we're settling for. Not a Manchester United player and never was.

1092~~~
Reckon he is a short term option. If LvG really is moving to a 433 then we're likely to see better wingers brought in and no spot for Young. Let's see what happens though because he's done well so far.

1093~~~
The thing is with Young though he does have a few games per season where he looks like he should be here and then reverts back to type..

With the new management, system and role for Ashley he will get another chance.. Although I'm not yet convinced..

1094~~~
He's certainly better than he's been able to show at United so far. Would've been a shame if he'd left without making any kind of mark at all so I'm pleased for both sides he might be coming good finally. It's good man management from Van Gaal - proves to everyone that the slate is well and truly clean and that if you take your chance he'll let you.

1095~~~
Indeed. I hate to be pessimistic so I don't want to refuse to see improvement when it comes. But part of Young's problem seemed to be disappearing as the games get bigger. It'll take a solid run of good form in the team, including performances in competitive games against the top teams, before I'm convinced the Aston Villa Young is back.

1096~~~
At least he can't be faulted for not trying when given the opportunity. Other players could do with his mentality, however poor of a player he really is.

1097~~~
On his form at the minute and the ability to play as a wingback, he will more than likely start against Swansea and that's when it starts for him.. Good consistent performances is what's needed. 

It would be really interesting if say a club came in for him now say QPR... what would the club do

1098~~~
Will he play wing back or will he take Welbeck's place up front? He did well there vs Galaxy.

1099~~~
Still think he should be shipped off if anyone comes in for him, he's been shite for years here minus the odd decent patch a year he seems to go through, meaningless pre-season friendlies don't change that.

1100~~~
Given his time at United so far, people have every right to be pessimistic about his form in preseason.

I will say that I'm very happy that he looks willing to fight for his place and try to impress the new manager. Credit where credits due, he's done well for us this whole preseason.

1101~~~
Impressive by Young. He's been given a role, and he's done exactly what's been asked of him, no more, no less.

1102~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVSRm80WzZk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1103~~~
Young has struggled with defensive stuff at RWB and everything he had to do deep in his half.

Has done well in terms of the winger part of RWB.

Again got skinned by Sterling there. He can't bully him physically so has to defend the dribble. 

Also takes the extra touch deep needlessy and puts himself under pressure time and again.

1104~~~
Has van Gaal given our Ash some balls?

1105~~~
Sterling will do that against anybody. he's that good on the ball.

1106~~~
Slightly unnerving that Ashley Young has been one of our more impressive players this pre-season.

At least Nani is still reassuringly shit. A small pocket of sanity in a crazy world.

1107~~~
Good on the lad. Always believed in him now carry it on because this means absolutely feck all.

1108~~~
Looks like a complete different player under Van Gaal. He had some good moment last season aswell, so hopefully this form is not temporary.

1109~~~
I didn't believe in him from day one, just like I don't believe in Zaha, but he deserves credit for this pre season tour. Been Uniteds best player. If he can continue like this, I would be glad to eat my words. Still, I doubt him.

1110~~~
Amazing how much Ashley Kuyt has changed under Van Gaal. Incredible really. He's probably not played this well since the start of 2011/12.

1111~~~
Player of the Tour for me. Hopefully he can bring this form to the Premier league and play on that right hand side where he looked really good today, with Shaw on the left and we should have some success down the wings once again. It does seem his crossing has proved massively which is very encouraging.

1112~~~
This wingback lark is easy.

1113~~~
He was full of hard work and aggression, really closing people down with the intention of pinching the ball and it paid off several times.

None of this was present in his previous United career

1114~~~
He is a confidence player.  He is not the kind of player who would suddenly step up and drag his team to victory when everyone else is playing bad, although he is capable of that as well.  Credit to LVG for handling him so well and of course to the player himself for his determination to stay and succeed at this club.

1115~~~
Putting some stank on it...

1116~~~
Needs to work a bit on his defensive tendencies, especially in one on one situations but he's taken to that role with a fantastic attitude and player of the tourney so far for me.

1117~~~
Has somehow rescued his Utd career when he seemed a dead cert to leave.

Would start the season with him as RWB with Shaw LWB.

1118~~~
Swagley Young!

1119~~~
Earned himself another season, surely.

1120~~~
He's been brilliant so far. Hope he carries this form into the season.

1121~~~
a different player so far. hope he keeps it up. makes us better.

1122~~~
He's another player who could do with staying fit. He's been a bit too injury prone during his time with us.

1123~~~
Completely new lease on life. Hope it continues. I think I said that already in here.

1124~~~
Has probably overtaken both Nani and Valencia in the "least crap" stakes. Deserves the credit he gets considering he's shipped an awful lot of fair criticism in his time too. Fair play, let's hope he keeps it up.

1125~~~
Well done, Ash. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Harrying Liverpool even in the final seconds.

1126~~~
Player of pre-season, delighted for him.

1127~~~
Gone from Gashley Young to Smashley Young to At-Times-Defensively-Rashley Young, but he's been very convincing this summer. If he keeps it up I'd easily have him here over Valencia and Nani. Still think our wingers lack top quality, though.

1128~~~
I just pray now that his confidence is high that he doesn't get injured.

1129~~~
For the love of Cantona, don't let any drugs testers pick him out of the squad for routine testing.

1130~~~
What a turn around! His confidence is sky high at the moment, the real test will come when it doesn't go right. If he passes that test then he'll have a great season.

1131~~~
Based on pre-season alone, he's shown enough for me to say that he'll be one of the best wingback in the world. He reminds me of Dani Alves on his Sevilla days.

1132~~~
Very good again. Really great to see what a turnaround he has managed so far. Now please Ashley do the same in the league.

1133~~~
Another MOTM performance from him. MOTM against RM, MOTM against this shithouse, who'd have thought really. Happy for him.

1134~~~
Fair fecks to him. He's had a great tour. 

Hard to grudge him for it either, he's always looked like he 'got' being a United player, and loved playing for us and was acting the fan and what not last season. He's never moaned about the criticism he gets constantly thrown his way either like some players have done.

Gotta give him huge credit, hope he carries it into the season.

1135~~~
He has started to win me over, his new position may have saved his united career, he looks fitter, stronger and looks like he can create for the forwards, his impact for lingards goal was very promising, and with this new system we look like we got pace in our team to hurt sides. I just hope we can get that magic CM player to bring it all home, because this team has goals in them, RVP rooney mata welbeck, and if hernandez stays all 5 could all easily hit double figures in the way VG has got us playing. But that one CM could really see us go very far

Mata young rooney etc etc could break the assists barrier if they convert this tour into our PL games

1136~~~
This will surely end up costing us? We can't get away with playing attacking players at wing back, I mentioned before I'd dread to see him have to defend one on one against Hazard, Sterling was another today. Seemed like he got caught out for their penalty too.

1137~~~
Valencia has played RB vs Sterling and basically Bullied him physically.


Young was very good going forward and full of energy but i am surprised people haven't noticed him panicking almost every time in our own half. Whether it be on the ball or defensively chasing the tackle too much like crazy.

1138~~~
Safe to say he will be in the managers plans for the season now. Well done for him to turn it around during preseason, now we just need him to keep this up during the actual season.

1139~~~
It's only his 4-5 games as wingback. Surely you'd given him more time to learn the rope?

1140~~~
Played really well today. Where the rest were bad the first half, Young was the only player who looked good. 

My MOTM.

1141~~~
Certainly deserves to start the first match of the season. Not a fan at all but his performances really merit a place in the side.

1142~~~
He has a future here. Can challenge the RWB and LWB spot. Can also be a back up striker.

1143~~~
Doubt there's many people on the Caf that hate Ashley Young more than me, but I have to say its hard to continue my hatred when he's playing very, very well. As much as I wanted him gone he's earned himself another season surely.

1144~~~
I'm actually quite speechless about what to say tbh. I usually hate the phrase 'its like signing a new player', but in this case it really is. He's transformed from being this timid, boring, no risk, gutless, sideways passing, useless turd, into a real proper player. He's beating his man, he's putting in fantastic crosses, he's defending like a seasoned bloody defender. I honestly don't know what LVG has done to him, but whatever it is, don't stop.

I'm actually, and whisper it, quite excited to watch him if he carries on playing like this. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1145~~~
This pre-season tour has been the equivalent of someone pulling themselves up from the edge of a cliff by their fingertips in a movie for his United career. Nailed on to start the season as the RWB.

1146~~~
Full credit for Young. Played in a completely new position and have done well so far. Was beaten by Sterling sometimes but coped well otherwise.

1147~~~
I think van Gaal has given Young a brain transplant.  That is the only explanation that I can think of for this incredible turnaround from him.

1148~~~
Complete 180 for Young.

Shows what a new manager and some new tactics can do.

1149~~~
Well done!

1150~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s13.postimg.org/p47s9jbmf/Ashley_Young.jpg" src="http://s13.postimg.org/p47s9jbmf/Ashley_Young.jpg"/>

1151~~~
I think he's just realised that he's 99% out the door this summer and had a change in his attitude. Its been such a dramatic turnaround that he's making himself a feature of the side.

Nani has done mostly the opposite. Carried on like nothing is happening and hasnt saved himself

1152~~~
To be fair he did exactly what Moyes asked of him too.

One of Moyes' favorite players IMO

Just kept banging in the crosses...

1153~~~
He's become so kind of dani Alves reincarnation. Lvg must of given fed him the soul of cafu.

1154~~~
It does make it even more frustrating (and thats putting it kindly) that he's been so unbelievably shite for two years. Its one thing if you're just not good enough, but he's showing now that he plainly is. So he's either spent the last two years not giving a feck, or he's had major confidence issues.

1155~~~
He did really well today.

1156~~~
He's been excellent at wing back, both right and left. Another great performance tonight. Long may it continue. I can imagine he'll get his fair share of games there next season. He's Van Gaal new Dirk Kuyt.

1157~~~
Showed real balls this tour given the abuse he was getting, and how he must have known how close to the exit he was

Well done ash

1158~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1159~~~
I'd like to see him at RB in a 4-3-3

But fair play to him, he's been brilliant through out the tour.

1160~~~
He's one step to proving me how wrong and judgemental I was... and that step is of course full, consistent season in the Premier League.

He can make it. Not an easy task but he look like he actually understand LVG's concept better than almost everyone in the team.

Genuine and honest shock.

1161~~~
His been brilliant but I'll be worried when he comes up against the likes of Hazard.

1162~~~
True, although I thought he actually handled Sterling pretty well today.

1163~~~
Atletico converted Juanfran into a RB.  It could happen.

1164~~~
Actually now that I think about it we'll probably play a different formation when up against the bigger sides.

1165~~~
Good point about Juan Fran

If LVG can successfully incorporate Young as a RB in a 4-3-3 and brings in a quality winger then I honestly believe our attacking play could be quite devastating.

1166~~~
Really pleased for him. I was very frustrated with him last season but he has turned it around so far. He got heaps of abuse from people on twitter and on here last season but to see him fight hard for his career is pleasing. I hope he can maintain it.

1167~~~
Crazy to think that prior to pre-season, my preference would have been to get rid of Young, Valencia then Nani in that order if we were going to trim fat. So far it seems the reverse will probably happen. Hope it continues for him - he's definitely had a lot of crap thrown his way simply for not being a bit bleh for a season and a bit.

1168~~~
I think its a bit different when its a 29 year old.

He's had a sudden improvement in his ability to play the position and looks a good option... And thats kinda what had to happen given he's moving into the latter stages of his career.

1169~~~
Fair play to him. I think 99% of us thought he's done at United and just not good enough but at least during the tour he's been very good. If he brings that kind of form over into the PL, he will definitely have a place in our squad. Fair play to him, seems like he took his chance

1170~~~
As it stands I'd say he's pretty much nailed on to start vs Swansea.

Astonishing really, I was certain he was done. Wing back role suits him.

1171~~~
What a transformation. Took on players ,tracked back ,produced some great crosses and almost scored a wonder goal.The reaction from Van Gaal when he came off said to me that he really appreciated the effort.

1172~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/><img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1173~~~
I'd be shocked if Young left now.  Van Gaal preaches about wanting players that play for the team, and Ashley Young seems like one of the most willing in the squad to do that.  He has played very well this summer.

1174~~~
Early days, of course but if he genuinely rehabilitates himself with us this season it will be one of the great comebacks. He deserves respect for the way he's kept his head down in the face of almost universal ridicule from his own fans. He looks a real viable option based on the last couple of weeks.

1175~~~
Young often starts the season well - lets hope he can continue it throughout the whole year.

Pleased for him.

1176~~~
He has adapted really good to this new role, I think he is the brightest of all our wingers and that results in good decision making and quite decent positioning. Nani seems extremely slow-thinker, Valencia is too reliant on his physicality and can't cross so I guess this RWB spot is his for now.

1177~~~
The issue with playing him as a winger and reason for his poor performances is his inability to beat a man. At wingback there is less of a need for him to do that and "reach the byline". He has always been very clever with his short passing and cross from deep so the wingback role suits him perfectly.

1178~~~
Am I the only one who is reserved about his performances, like some of you have said, it still only pre-season. What happens when he decided to play poorly again during the season. We'll be on his back in no time. Personally, im not a fan of Young. But saying all of that fair play to him for doing really well in preseason and reviving his United career which seemed all but dead.

1179~~~
It's about choosing the lesser evil though, sure he's not perfect for that role but considering our options (always injured Rafael and Valencia) I would say he has done enough to be considered as first teamer. Sure, it might not end well but we have to find a solution until game vs Swansea.

1180~~~
dFair play to him, he seems to be rejuvenated under LVG. Certainly is fighting very successfully for his place in the squad. I hold up my hands, I've been an advocate for getting rid of him, that is for sure. I have never believed he's good enough for United, but now...well...I wouldn't mind him staying and fighting further...

Football fans eh?....bloody fickle lot...<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1181~~~
Van Gaal looked delighted with Young after the game

he showed great adaptability to switch wings when Valencia went off

have to say I still wonder about his defensive ability but maybe the extra CB gives us that extra assurance

some of his crosses were excellent and Hernandez really should have scored early on 

I'm previously a big critic of Young but like Rooney and a few others he has responded brilliantly to the new manager.

1182~~~
His confidence seems to have gone through the roof and I am delighted with it. As one of his most vocal critics I was extremely frustrated with him and annoyed about almost all aspects of his play but the wing back role seems to be a god send for him. Id love to see him play it week in, week out. HOWEVER I do think Rafeal was better at the role against Galaxy and throughout the games v Madrid and Pool I saw glimpses of the old Young whos favourite trick was to over hit a cross into row Z.

1183~~~
Some of the abuse he copped on here was just absurd. People completely lost their heads over nothing, there is still the same player from early days that we signed in there. Lets hope he can stay fit and put the knee/ankle trouble behind him.

1184~~~
His crossing has been excellent, he has put in some absolute corkers.

1185~~~
I've been one of his critics, but I say fair play to him for taking his opportunities under the new manager. The same can't be said about Hernandez and Nani. Hopefully his form continues into the season, he seems to thrive off this new system and role.

1186~~~
You get behind him and realise how good he can be on form.

1187~~~
Hernandez has a good goal and assist in the last two cameo performances.

1188~~~
Hasnt got us a penalty yet with a great dive...not impressed

1189~~~
Yeah, maybe I was harsh on Hernandez there. I still don't think that he's done enough overall to fully convince LVG that he's suitable for his system and I also don't think that Hernandez will want another bit part season coming on in the last 10-20 mins.

1190~~~
Can we rename this preseason to 'The Summer of Young'? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Who is this guy and what did he do with that overpriced, overpaid shit winger that we all loved?

1191~~~
After giving him a lot of stick last season for playing badly.. I think it is only fair that those of us who did give him stick recognize the improvement in his play this pre season.. I wanted him to be the first winger to be sold from our team, but as a wingback now he looks very important to our play.. So kudos to him..

1192~~~

1193~~~
Happy for him after all the abuse he's had, that recent Twitter backlash in particular.

1194~~~
I agree, out of Valencia Nani and Young I wanted Young out, however he has changed my mind over preseason.

1195~~~
I gotta say that young has been superb. I would of been happy to see him offloaded at the start of the summer but he has shown a new found ability to adapt and flourish in this new look side...

However... As with my feelings on this squad, I will reserve my judgement until he is doing it in competitive football regularly. The way he has been playing looks good, but I fear certain aspects of his and the squads weakness may surface more during the season...

Either way, well played young. Nothing would make me happier then for him to prove people like me wrong. If he can transfer these performances into competitive football, he will be like a new top signing....

1196~~~
He always had a good work rate and put in a shift, therefore I can see him develop into a proper wing back. It's early season though, the real test comes when the PL starts but so far, so good for him

1197~~~
I agree. Van Gaal is just what he needed. Confidence sky high, the twitter abuse he gets seems to have finally relented and he never complained once about the abuse, whereas a lot would have, or would have at least shut down their twitter accounts. I remember when Shaw signed, Young tweeted him congratulations and talked about seeing him and he got abuse for that saying he wouldn't be at the club. From the start of the tour his attitude has been top notch, he's always been involved with the MUTV post match stuff right off the pitch, and clearly he is enjoying himself now. Long may it continue.

1198~~~
If I'm going to get on his back when he plays poor. Then I should be willing to give him credit when he plays well. 

He has been brilliant during preseason. Hope he can keep it up.

1199~~~
I have always supported Young a bit. Very happy for him this season under LVG. But lets remember that Young has had such spells before. He suddenly turns very good for a few games and then loses it for most matches.

So although I didn't think Young is shit like loads of people but I also don't think he is going to a super player suddenly. Young is and should remain a back up. Of course if he continues this form for a longer time than he has before, its different.

1200~~~
I've said a few times on here that I've always thought Young had potential, when he's playing on form he's good enough to be on the team, but the problem is that his form is so hot and cold.  He'll do a brilliant run and slot in a decent goal, then spend the rest of the game blasting crosses into the crowd...  I hope LvG's guidance is paying off and the form from the last few games is going to continue.

1201~~~
true but doesn't make me any less sceptical...

1202~~~
I wanted us to let him go.

My reasoning? It seemed we persisted with him when he was playing poor and it got frustrating when I saw him on the team sheet, and also if he was to be used as a substitute. It got to the point where he'd only be useful shooting from range and it sometimes going in or diving and winning us a penalty.

Now? Well. This is exactly what he needed to do to save his United career. It's early days but his adaptability looks to be a major asset for him. I now want to keep him and want to see what he can do over the coming season. I didn't think he'd be a capable wing back to be honest, without seeing it for myself I wouldn't think it would work (he's not really played at full back or anything previously and seemed to be up the pitch and not getting back an awful lot as a winger vs Valencia for example).

1203~~~
More like when Hazard comes up against Young. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1204~~~
I have never understood this transfer and for me his signing (of course along with some other stuff like no midfield improvement, the way we lost the title to City, football getting worse, ...) was a hint for me that SAF wasn't God-like anymore! Still great, but not as impressive as before. 

Young never ever made any sense: Average, overpriced, high wages, we didn't even need a winger back then, at least not one who wasn't world class, and we always have enough English players so it wasn't even like we needed to fill any quota.

But if LvG can make him perform in his system for more than just some pre-season games, then I will take everything back and even turn into a RAWK-like poster claiming SAF always knew Young would be brilliant 3 years after signing him!

1205~~~
Young is not as talented a player you would hope for playing in an attacking position for Manchester United, but he is a hard working lad and genuinely appears to love playing for the club. Also the fact he is English helps. I've never understood the Young hatred personally, as he's nothing more than a squad player. Delighted with his pre-season performance, probably first choice wing-back going into the season now.

1206~~~
I am genuinely surprised with his performances. Pleased with it too. He was always the best crosser of the ball compared to our other wingers.  Shit at corners still and I don't understand why that is the case. 

Seems to thrive playing in a system where he knows what to do. I still don't think he is at the level we should hope for but I at least won't cringe to see him on the team sheet for a while.

1207~~~
Probably doesn't help that he dived constantly and is rumored to be on high wages.  Although, in general, the entire squad bar de Gea played poorly last season, his performances along with those of Valencia, Fellaini, and Cleverley were truly woeful.  Good to see him turn it around this preseason and let's hope he can carry his form into the games that matter.

1208~~~
Could never see the fun in abusing somebody on the internet. I mean his mother probably reads his twitter feed. It's a pretty low thing to do. Fair play to the bloke for hanging on in there and hopefully he can turn his career around here given the confidence he has got from LVG.

1209~~~
The diving is definitely an issue, the wages don't bother me as it's his signing on fee being paid in weekly installments, this is another strange reasoning to dislike him.

1210~~~
Ashley Alves

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2q2LgC5Otmg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1211~~~
I had a dream last night that he went. He's gone.

1212~~~
Ballon d'Or winner 2015

1213~~~
His crossing so far has been out of this world.. Should of scored 4-5 from his crosses alone this tour.

1214~~~
One month ago every United fan wanted him gone, looking in the matchday thread now everyone has him in their starting lineup for tomorrows game. It is really nice to see how he has taken his chance under the new manager and if he can avoid being injured all the time I can see him being one of the better players for us in the coming season. It really shows how fast things can change in football and that we as fans should be more careful in judging players and spewing our hate about them.

1215~~~
I always liked Young when he played for Villa and was happy when he joined United but he has never really looked anything more than a squad player. He has scored some lovely goals, most of them top drawer, and he has had some decent performances, but it's all been patchy and inconsistent and mirrored by games where he is truly awful or goes missing. And of course add to that some of his diving is truly embarrassing. However I think (and hope) this may be HIS season. 

If anyone watches Soccer AM then you will know when they have the "Team-mates" section, and especially when it's an England player, Ashley Young has been mentioned as the most skilful player a few times. He's extremely versatile and has shown he can play LWB where he was (imo) our best player overall throughout the tour, I think he is definitely first choice for LWB in the current United squad and formation. He can cover for RWB where I think he might start tomorrow against Swansea. And he can play either wing, as a 10 or up front as he often did when playing for Villa. On a whole, considering his age, nationality and versatility it would be silly to even consider selling him. 

It's lovely to see him playing so well, as it is for the likes of Fletcher and Smalling and Evans etc. But it's a real joy to see him skilfully marauding down the wings and recently, putting beautiful crosses in or him cutting inside to shoot and scoring more. Now i'm not saying he will be our player of the season or top scorer or anything like that, I just hope he can consistently continue to show what he did on tour. The talent is obviously there, and as mentioned before, he has a great attitude, one that seems to have spread throughout the entire team. This could be a great year for Ashley Young, and that may mean a great year for United too. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1216~~~
A goal and an assist tomorrow <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1217~~~
He's been the best of a bad lot there in that first half. Cleaning up from a Jones defensive mistakes at the back, whipping in decent crosses from both the left and right hand sides two of which Rooney could have probably done a better job finishing off too. Hard to fault him really.

1218~~~
Needs to run up that flank more OR pass it forward. Hell, he isn't even passing it sideways. Can't remember any passes to Herrera/Fletcher.

1219~~~
I can't believe a bird shat in Young's mouth. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/RevolvingObedientHyena.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/RevolvingObedientHyena.gif"/>

1220~~~
Wasn't to bad at wing back, though looked out of place at full back and I think he lack of experience their contributed in conceding the second goal

1221~~~
I think that was a bit of a reality check for anyone like me, who gained a bit of confidence in him during pre-season. He's not in his favoured position but still doesn't offer anywhere near enough going forward - far too one dimensional for a team that's going to come up against 10 men behind the ball quite often. Such a pity Shaw is out as I think a left-footed player is necessary on the overlap.

1222~~~
Was very average.

1223~~~
Back to looking ordinary. Order is restored to the universe.

1224~~~
Urgh that is grim. I know he had a tut game today but poor Ash.

1225~~~
Barely got forward from LWB. And he isn't a LB so hard to judge him in the 2nd half.

1226~~~
We are back into making him the scapegoat! He was one of our best players today.

•His through pass to Rooney that Rooney failed miserably to control in the early parts of the game.

•His cross from the right channel that Rooney headed timidly

•Another cross from the right channel that found Hernandez but the referee spotted an infringement.

•I remember at least 2 vital interceptions, one in the first half when Swansea broke in their first attack. 

He played very well considering the circumstances he found himself having to move from the right to the left. We lost today cos our creative players were piss poor.

1227~~~
I'm not saying he is shite but I'm saying that we need a player who can get past the defender, cross more effectively and create space for himself and his teammates.  Someone of di Maria's or Cuadrado's calibre.  I don't know how but Nani seems to have forgotten about 2010/11.  He was phenomenal for the first half of that season, before getting injured at Anfield.

1228~~~
People are actually blaming him?

He basically played in 3 different positions today.

1229~~~
To be honest I would have preferred to see him played down the right flank, that's where he was best in pre-season and the one or times today he did look like he might do something was on that right hand side.

There seemed to be a general reluctance from him to run with the ball when he had it and a few yards open ahead of him. Obviously this was curtailed in the second half a little bit, but he had up until the formation change, enough time on the ball to try and make an impact.

Young is a super frustrating player, he'll give you glimpses of class, but then go missing for game and games and games. Best I can say about him is that he was an average player in an average team today, no more, no less.

1230~~~
He tried his best but like fletcher and the team in general it was a reality check today and a clearer indication of his real progress. At fault for the goal but he was playing out of position, would probably do better as the right sided wing back in fairness to him but he is still a squad player at best

1231~~~
He took over Valencia's mantle of get ball, turn back, make 5 yard pass and repeat. Showed zero adventure and was extremely tentative with the ball. His crossing has improved significantly from last season though. Was at fault for the second goal with his faulty positioning and hopefully is utilized as a left back sparingly from now on. Not particularly his fault though. He tries his best but it is not enough and his lack of experience at the left back position means he will not get the positioning and the concentration aspects of defending right away. Valencia also had the same problem last season and looked extremely suspect defensively. Can you guys imagine him playing against some of the league's finer wide players like Sanchez, Walcott, Hazard, Sterling etc? Specialist full backs struggle with them and these guys would seriously tear Young a new one.

Using a 29 year old winger as a left full back is a stop-gap solution anyway but why do we need to do that??? Its not like we are in the middle of the season, we are in the transfer market and we have money to burn, so get the feck out there and get a specialist full back as a back-up for Shaw for christ sake... I would rather see Reece James out there than Young. Heck even Buttner would have been a better option...

1232~~~
Not blaming him for anything but he was back to the old Ashley Young today. His first instinct is to play the ball back (usually to Blackett). Him and Januzaj are like night and day.

1233~~~
Dear LvG,
Can we please never see him play on the left. As LW, LB or LWB.
Please,
Thanls

1234~~~
Only somewhat disappointed, as his form in pre-season was great but stepping it up for a real match is another thing.

Still, I thought we would at least see a semblance of his improvement which never really came. I guess it's never good to have hope, or something like that.

1235~~~
I think he's still worth a go on the left. Specifically left back in the changing room. 


Thanks, I'm here all week

1236~~~
Harsh to blame him much but I reckon Shaw will own that LWB position pretty soon.

1237~~~
He's no Wing back. We shouldn't play him there

1238~~~
I hate it when he passes it back when he has much better passing options available and he doesn't go for them.

1239~~~
He's been like this for ages. I don't know how it's been acceptable for so long for a player to just keep shifting it to his right and them passing it back.

1240~~~
You could understand him being insecure about his passing or him being under pressure but I swear there were times where he'd kill any momentum by passing it back, it's like a default mode he's on. You would think that him being right footed and playing on the left would make it easier to find passing options through the middle instead of going back all the time.

1241~~~
he's got very little confidence in his left foot which is a bit of a problem when your playing on the left. stick him on the right and we'll see what he can produce

1242~~~
I thought he looked really angry when he was sent to leftback, diving in all the time, arguing with the linesman, opponents and complaining to Nani in front of him. I think he's accepted and welcomed playing left wingback, but spat the dummy out when asked to play left fullback.

1243~~~
That would make zero sense. It's far likelier that he was just vexed by the result and/or the bird.

1244~~~
How would that make zero sense?

Playing wingback in a 5 in midfield is still playing the wing role

Playing leftback is playing as part of a 4 man defence

1245~~~
Much like the glazers and Woodward, he is just part of the huge problem of passengers in this squad that have overstayed their welcome

1246~~~
If anything, playing wing back is even more demanding. Both roles require a lot of defending and a lot of running though.

I'm sure he's happy enough to make the team.

1247~~~
Just imagine Valencia on the right, Young on the left and Cleverley shepherding them. Would truly be a spectacular sight to behold.

1248~~~
Well this formula did beat city 2 years ago, so got to give them some credit

1249~~~
I suppose it was naive to think Young could translate his pre-season form over to competitive football. Despite the quality of opposition he's faced, he was rarely tested on tour and even then he looked incredibly suspect on the few occasions he was defending deep - such as his complete inability to defend and intercept a diagonal, long pass even when he has time to judge the flight of the ball.

His future could largely hinge on whether van Gaal decides to continue with the 3-5-2, or the type of acquisitions we make. If for instance, we sign di Maria and that signals a change to a 4-3-3 or 4-1-2-1-2, then his future here is seriously in jeopardy, as I don't believe van Gaal rates Young as a winger and only sees him as a wingback.

He's certainly not a fullback and not good enough as winger here either, so the likelihood is he can only be a wingback option here.

1250~~~
I gave them credit in the past (not Young though, don't think he ever deserved it other than a few games at the start of his United career). Right now its painfully obvious that these guys aren't the required quality for the United team. 


''Or, I should say, <b>we don't have wingers of the highest level</b>, like Ronaldo or Di Maria or somebody like that.'' - Louis Van Gaal

You won't see a more straightforward assessment than that. We should just ship out the deadwood instead of trying to shoehorn two 29 year old wingers into wing/full back positions that they just aren't suited for defensively. Its not asking too much to get 2 specialist full backs to cover for Shaw and the injury prone Rafael. I don't mind Cleverley and still think he can do a job as a squad player given his age and decent footballing ability. However, Valencia and Young are just deadweight and playing them in the full back position is just a stopgap measure which is detrimental to the team in the long run.

1251~~~
Yea had to atleast give them some credit, but I agree. Has a united fan it should shock me so many passengers  have some how survived the chop, name them off, Cleverley fletcher fellaini Anderson Valencia nani young kagwa, we have mata that we never really needed. So for me another year with this lot really will be another brutal season for all of us, how Valencia got that new contract will never fully get an explanation

I do not think jones smalling Evans and rafeal are good enough if I'm being even more brutally honest

1252~~~
Its not about demanding.

Its about being a leftback, no longer a winger. And having a rival for your position playing in the role you wanted to play.

1253~~~
I very much doubt he stood there thinking: "Jesus, I'm officially not a winger anymore, my career is heading for the rocks".

A chance to prove his versatility would give him the ideal lifeline, given almost certain trepidations about his United career.

1254~~~
I couldn't care less what he thinks to be honest. He's been poor for close to a year now, and I can count with one hand the amount of impressive games he's had for us.

1255~~~
Actually reverting to 4 at the back meant moving away from the formation that had seen him reinvent his role and importance to the team. He's already proven his versatility.

And playing at leftback is clearly not what he wants. A lot of wingers would have been upset just like Young's behaviour suggested he was.

1256~~~
Young's behavior suggested only that he was frustrated. The rest is your interpolation.

1257~~~
Hardly our biggest problem right now, and our priority is obviously bringing players in instead of showing players the door, but it really is frustrating how he's managed to find his way into our new managers plans for the second season running (yes, i'm aware we have injuries etc but right now he's pretty much a nailed on starter).

Whenever we appoint a new manager, our induction should include making them fully aware that Ashley Young is actually a bit shit.

1258~~~
I share your frustration at seemingly going back to square one by giving more time to players who should have been shipped out long ago. Given the frequent turnover of managers, I'm not sure clubs can function properly anymore without a Director of Football overseeing the transfer strategy and shape of the squad.

1259~~~
Well I just decided to have a statistical analysis of his game to see if he really had a shite game as I perceived him to have.


-He attempted 46 passes and completed 40 of them but the hilarious thing is the direction of those passes. You could be mistaken for thinking he had an impenetrable wall in front of him.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755307/player-stats/18892/1_PASS_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...yer-stats/18892/1_PASS_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

-He made 8 passes in the final third with 5 of them being successful

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755307/player-stats/18892/1_PASS_08#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...yer-stats/18892/1_PASS_08#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

-He attempted 8 crosses with 1 of them somehow being successful and created 2 chances the entire game whilst attempting 0 take ons

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755307/player-stats/18892/2_ATTACK_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...r-stats/18892/2_ATTACK_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

Most of the players had a terrible game but the thing that annoys me most is Young's lack of gumption and adventure. He seems to shirk under pressure and always goes for the safe option without necessarily trying anything. The amount of times he cut back in to pass inside to the centrebacks was truly infuriating. Januzaj didn't have a great game but he had the audacity to try something and even though most of them didn't come off very well it showed he was trying to impact the game at the very least. Young looked like a passenger the entire game and was extremely passive. Young also seems extremely one-footed and doesn't seem suited defensively to play the full/wing back role. I really hope we let Reece James or even Blackett at left back instead of playing a 29 year old has been winger there. Really can't wait for Shaw to return...

1260~~~
You can't really expect him to be perfect. He also switched to left back after half time. Two completely unfamiliar roles to his natural position, by all means have a go at him and all that but it has to be taken into context. Also never crosses of his left, cuts back inside - for this reason I really don't like seeing him on the left I would prefer him inside right or RWB.

1261~~~
Yeah completely forgot he lit up the league for us in his natural position. Taking into context? He is shit. PERIOD. He is not good enough to play for us no matter the position. He makes no effort at running at the defender with the ball. Every time he got the ball he passed it back. At least make an effort.

1262~~~
What are we doing trying to coach a 29 year old winger into a position he has probably never played before? Are we genuinely considering him to be our cover for left/right back on the basis of good performances in pre-season? Its about time we shipped him out and got specialist cover for our full backs. I can't believe how some are open to giving him another chance after he has been nothing more than a passenger for 3 seasons now...

1263~~~
Constructive. Forgot the narrative in here "shit get rid want him gone now". Is that better? Do I fit in yet?
It looks as though we are considering him for fullback cover. Considering he's made his first appearance this season playing exactly that role (then wasn't hooked in favor of a defender at the interval, rather moved into a more responsible defensive role).

Believe it - people are patient enough to hope a player turns good, shock horror.

1264~~~
Van gaal seems to want to give him the chance, and that is the real problem

1265~~~
If he really manages to pull this one off and Schweinsteiger Ashley Young, it would be the greatest thing he would have ever done. Nay, make that the greatest thing any manager could have ever done.

1266~~~
I would love to see Young return to Villa or a team of that ilk and find his old form...except for when he plays us.

1267~~~
Im impressed with his application under LVG so far. Long may it continue.

1268~~~
Showing his true form now the season has started.

1269~~~
Jet lag?

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1270~~~
Am I wrong in saying that he slowed up in that 50-50 with the keeper? Looked like it

1271~~~
well the positive, his contract runs out in 2015

1272~~~
He is a disgrace to the jersey. Can we have a count of the number of back passes compared to the forward passes? I swear all I can remember are his shit crosses, his back passes from whereever he received the ball and his dive. That's it. Did he do anything special apart from that?

1273~~~
Showing his true colours. He really was Fergies worst buy. 

Worse than Veron. Atleast Veron was good in Europe and half decent in his second season.

1274~~~
Is it possible to just terminate someone's contract? Call it performance related.

I hope he enjoyed that run out anyway, all being well Di Maria is here next week.

1275~~~
That dive was pathetic. If he'd tried to actually do something rather than cheat we could have scored.

1276~~~
He's unbelievably crap, I dream of a day when he's not at our club. Seriously.

1277~~~
Get rid. For free even. Get him off the books. Bright side of today is once everyone's fit, only four or five of today's starters will be playing.

1278~~~
Absolute shite. No good balls into the box, another dive and so on. Hard to believe he actually looked decent in pre season.

1279~~~
When he's shit, he's really shit.

1280~~~
Proves that pre-season is just pre-season.

I'd release him, along with Cleverley, Fletcher, and Valencia.

1281~~~
He seems to have gone back to vagina mode.

1282~~~
We signed Valencia up to a new contract and no doubt we will do the same with Young and Cleverley. They should have all been shipped out and replaced this window .

1283~~~
That dive was pathetic. I hope we never see him play for united again, but unfortunately he could start on Saturday.

1284~~~
Him and Cleverley should be at West ham or a West Brom as they are fecking hopeless

1285~~~
The little cheating con artist bought himself another half season, but there is still time to get rid.

1286~~~
He's beyond shit, made their RB look like Cafu on him. Blackett had one cross without controlling the ball which looked a million time more dangerous than anything he's produced. Young gives hope to people at least, that despite being incompetent you can still have a great job.

1287~~~
Cleverley wouldn't get into the MK Dons team which will beat us 2-0 on Tuesday

1288~~~
We really should have tried to get rid of him in the Summer. Even when you think we've changed to a system where there is no place in the team for him, he has somehow wormed his way in there. Why, Van Gaal, why?

1289~~~
This. I was watching a match with my little bro and he said the same thing, all he does is cuts back inside and crosses which either goes out of play, or over hits it straight to the keeper. On the other flank Valencia was just as shit he kept passing it inside when he had ample amount of chances to have a run at defender. I am so glad Di Maria is coming, i have had enough of these two i would be sooo delighted to see the back of these two, the true definition of pointless footballers.

1290~~~
The dive was cheating and embarrassing.

1291~~~
He tried to get some urgency going. At least he had balls to run with the ball. Just not good enough.

1292~~~
Just when you thought he might have turned a corner, he get's found out again. Pre Season was a con.

He's gone back to desperately poor wing play. How many crosses does he need to get past a defender and not into a keepers hands? That dive was so blatant but otherwise his general play is just not up to par. No creativity, no penetration and no threat. Time's running out.

1293~~~
He's the worst player I've seen play for United. He's so shit it's ludicrous. I'm sure if everyone is fit and available there's no way he'll be in the first XI under LVG.

1294~~~
The more we play him on the left the more of these performances we're gonna see. Its better not to play him at all than to play him there.

1295~~~
Being fair to Young, we're about to break the british record to sign another diver so I guess it doesn't automatically make you a terrible footballer.

However, he's Ashley Young not Di Maria who was the best player on the pitch in El Classico last season and created the most goals in la liga last season. He's an average footballer who dives, not one of Argentina's best 3 players who dives.

1296~~~
I suspected those pre season performances were deceit. He's back to his level now. Thankfully rojo and do Maria will spell the end to his wage stealing minutes.

1297~~~
I said exactly the same thing too. Blackett crossed the ball better in one attempt than Young did in multiple attempts. It's unbelievable how bad of a player he has been for us. He is probably the worst Manchester United player Ferguson has ever bought and managed who's played more than just a handful of games for the club.

1298~~~
An on form Ashley Young is a great crosser of the ball, fast and a ton of energy to get up and down the pitch. He has all of the makings to be a fantastic wing-back but he needs to find his form. He started off very well in pre-season and I don't think anybody could deny that. He obviously still needs to work on his defending but that will come with time, he just needs to get back to putting in good crosses.

1299~~~
Can't blame him, he's playing improvised as a football player

1300~~~
I didn't think he was to bad today. One of the few players in our team who was positive and actually tried to make something happen.

1301~~~
If only he showed more bollocks when Welbeck played him through we might well have won that game.

1302~~~
There's no point in Young or Valencia if they won't take on the defender. All he does is shuffle about then pass backwards. Take a chance ffs.

1303~~~
Disgusting player and a cheat.

1304~~~
I've realized I actually feel sorry for Young, he just isn't good enough despite trying really hard.

1305~~~
Won his pre-season Mickey Mouse Cup and now he's back at being Ashley Young.

You just can't make this up.

1306~~~
He's a cheat on top of being shit and he's stealing a living making more money in a week than you perhaps do in two years.

Do not feel sorry for him.

1307~~~
You thinking telling me what to feel will work? 

Ok, I will change my feelings to fit in with the rest of the fecking lynch mob. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1308~~~
The only thing he looked like he was really capable of was putting in half decent crosses, even thought it's just once every 2-3 games. Now he's unable to do even that. What's the point of keeping him around? Distinctly average player. 18M for him is a daylight robbery.

1309~~~
If the club do the ice bucket challenge, give them ashley young instead

1310~~~
Fair enough, sorry. Its just Ia associate young and valencia with everything thats wrong with our club.

But yeah, you are obviously entitled to your opinions and feelings.

1311~~~
Can not be "Schweinstigered" against Sunderland, will be wiped off the floor against the likes of Chelsea and City. The guy is clearly trying his best, but his ceiling is most probably too low for United.

1312~~~
Mata still scored the goal, and like I said allot, with di maria signing in the works, we have the pieces in place too get the best out of mata. Its just crying out for a 4231 system, and I would say rooney and RVP are the problem, not mata.

1313~~~
I was talking about Ashley Young being played as a wingback.

1314~~~
I think Reece James would do better. At least defensively he is definitely better than Young. And going forward, well you can't get much worse than Young. Until Shaw or Rojo start playing we have to go with James instead of Young.

1315~~~
The correct time to buy this guy, if there was one, was when he was at Watford. He might have been moulded into something half decent. As it is, he's not good enough. He plays football like he's doing shuttle runs. He closes down one guy, it gets passed to another, Young does a shuttle run and skids as it gets passed again, does another shuttle run, skids again, does another shuttle run, skids again, ad infinitum. His brain functions appear to be a series of bleeps with ever-decreasing gaps between them.

1316~~~
His first contribution today, his long ball gives it straight to sunderland in united's own half, and this guy is on over 100K a week

1317~~~
I don't know how to copy and paste the dashboard but it sums him up; lots of safe back passes and a few inaccurate crosses. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755320/player-stats/18892/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...er-stats/18892/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

It's like he tricked LvG into thinking he was good during preseason and now the season has started he's reverted right back to what he was doing last season. Seriously, I cannot wait for Shaw to regain fitness as Ashley Young shouldn't be anywhere near a team with any semblance of ambition.

1318~~~
Signing/hanging on to players like young is one of the big reasons for our current problems. It doesn't help that everyone's confidence looks shot due to last season but this standard of player still shouldn't have to be relied on.

1319~~~
Young would be one of my first players to go, and I would get rid of him ASAP.  Hard to believe he is in our squad.

1320~~~
He needs to be released/banished to the reserves/sold. It is criminal that he he takes the place of anyone in this organisation. It would be mores sensible to play SAF than Young.

1321~~~
Young was awful today. 

I will bring on some of the youngsters we have as back up once Shaw is ready.

1322~~~
Nah they would be reserves to Mark Noble and Stewart Downing

1323~~~
One of the only things going for him was that he could provide a decent ball every now and then

Game against Swansea- 8 crosses, 1 successful

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755307/player-stats/18892/2_ATTACK_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...r-stats/18892/2_ATTACK_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

Game against Sunderland - 7 crosses, 0 successful

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2014/matches/755320/player-stats/18892/2_ATTACK_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...r-stats/18892/2_ATTACK_01#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

Why do we even bother with him?

1324~~~
I see Ashley has gone back to being the useless, pile of wank, diving, coward he always has been, as soon as the real football started. Absolute tosser.

And thats why I hate him so much. feck him off to the reserves.

1325~~~
The silver lining to that dark cloud is LVG sees him for what he really is while we still have a week left in the transfer window.

1326~~~
I sometimes defend Young...

Got nothing today though.

1327~~~
Why? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1328~~~
Why are you so bitter?
Why isn't anyone getting on the end of those - they look like good crosses into dangerous areas.

1329~~~
He and Valencia are as bad as each other. So predictable.Don't worry about Valencia's "assist" it was as lucky as it gets - he just smashes it into the box without looking

1330~~~
Looked very uncomfortable every time he has to defend deep today. He may put on a shift, but he isn't good enough defensivily to be having opposition wingers running at him

1331~~~
It feels like he has more cards for diving than he has assists in the last two seasons. He can't be far off anyway! 

He's still looking for John Carew at the back post <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1332~~~
As I said in pre season he has little patches of form every year, now it's back to regularly scheduled programming.

1333~~~
I've said this before but he's so much better on the right that it's ridiculous he keeps on playing on the left.

1334~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's so fecking frustrating I tell ya.

1335~~~
Shame his pre-season form was only on US soil. He's back to his worst, doesnt offer anything productive and should be a 3rd back up at best

1336~~~
Preseason should be viewed in isolation from these games. Add that competitive edge to a game and it can definitely be the difference between showing good and terrible form for a single player. I don't know how this is still news and surprise so many people year after year.

1337~~~
He's absolutely fecking shit and somebody should slap him on his tiny bald head until he leaves. He's a coward and he should be forced out.

1338~~~
Fair play for that shite ball in the first minute that he played and then got back to mop up the danger in the box. I missed the first five minutes of the game, credit for that.

1339~~~
Every pre season he seems to perform well and show the manager enough to trust him and want to keep him. Hell, even mid year when it looks like he's done for, he gets subbed on and scores a few screamers in the next few games to renew faith again.

it's like he intentionally does this shit to bestow his horrid presence upon us until his bloated contracted finally ends in 2016. I wish he be fecked out of the club but it seems highly unlikely.

1340~~~
I hate to say it, but I think we can all forget Young moving on before his contract expires.  He is on a good wage at a prestigious club.  He won't be offered any more than half of what he is on now and faces a big step down in the size of the club willing to take him on.  

If he has a professional athlete's pride, he will continue to fight to become the player he once was--even if in vain.  He is not on the bubble of being picked for England again, so has nothing to lose by staying at United at the cost of game time.  Even if he comes to believe he won't ever be good enough for United again he'd stay.

Like it or not, our frustration with him and readiness to see him go means nothing, and I fear United has little more influence.

We long laughed at other big spenders struggling to move on their expensive deadwood.  Well, now we face the same struggle in Young.

1341~~~
I cannot believe how this guy has flattered to deceive SAF, Moyes and now LVG.

What is it that they see in him. I cannot for life figure it out.

Please get rid.

1342~~~
Van Gaal does seem to like a LWB who used to be an attacking player and never ever uses his left foot. See Dirk Kuyt.

1343~~~
He's still shit on the right. Just shittier on the left - no difference.

1344~~~
He's pretty much done should we move to a 4-3-3. I really hope we don't see di Maria as a wing-back.

1345~~~
He must be sucking someone's cock seeing how he's still at this club. Ridiculously pointless footballer, along with cleverley.

1346~~~
If him and Valencia carry on getting picked this season, under a third experienced, knowledgeable manager, then I will have to hold my hands up and say that I understand absolutely feck all about football. Every time I've watched either of these two these last 3 seasons, they've looked absolutely shite even within a team not playing very well, so there has to be something I can't see here. It's early days right at the moment, but LVG says he should have the players playing the way he wants them to by December, so if at that point these two are still getting starts, I think I will give up on trying to understand.

1347~~~
So predictable isn't he? Seems he always does just enough at the right time to keep his feet under the OT table and then you get feck all from him. Another mid table player of ours helping us to a mid table finish last season.

1348~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Thread title. 

Thought he was top 3 worst players yesterday (only eclipsed by the Cleverley & Fletcher show in central midfield); terrible crossing, pathetic dive and him slowing down for that loose ball that Manone got to summed up his last 2 years here. Looked good in pre-season, reverted to type against Sunderland.

1349~~~
He wouldn't be as shit as Valencia is on the right and can put in a decent cross from there.

1350~~~
Valencia is clearly better than him. Young is just hopeless and can't even cross. Honestly, I don't see any point in Ashley Young, he's incredibly shit.

1351~~~
Buttner would have been a million times better as a wing back

1352~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1353~~~
Is that what he used to be?!

Anyways what ever he was he's not worth a fiddlers at anything now and the longer we hold onto him and the rest of the mediocrity the slump will continue. 

Selling young players like Robbie Brady who was showing good promise at the time and if were held onto and worked on would have done a job for pittance and buying in clowns like Young who was never a Utd quality player even when he was on top of his game for Villa for the guts of 20m was pure stupid.

1354~~~
No, he's not. Young is better in just about every area.

1355~~~
True. I don't think Young is good enough either but he is being played out of position on the left which is why we get those horrible cut backs and crosses to the keeper. Not that we have seen much benefit due to Valencia's reluctance to do anything more than blast it and hope or pass back.

1356~~~
Cannot wait for Shaw to return, why isn't young on the out list, get Blind in and sell Young back to villa

1357~~~
I wonder how much we could get for him? He won't be able to claim that £60k I bet he's on anywhere else, so £3 million maybe?

1358~~~
It's not a dangerous area if nobody is there. And it's not a good cross if it's over the player's head. His problem is that he looking only ever the ball.

1359~~~
Immensely irritating.

1360~~~
I wonder what is more predictable, his performances? or the last 3 managers who have kept playing him

Fans should be more angry at the likes of VG who keep playing this guy

1361~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> @ the thread title.

1362~~~
LvG needs to play some games in his next presser.

"I look at Aston Villa, they do not possess a wide threat such as Marco Reus or Ashley Young.."

1363~~~
Disagree. Young might be marginally better going forward in that he actually attacks the fullback whereas Valencia always plays safe but his crosses are mostly garbage. They were good in pre-season I'll give him credit there, but he's looks to be reverting to type. The first sign of an opportunity to get on to a loose ball he either dives or bitches out (the Manone moment). For all his faults Valencia is at least able to retain possession and hold off people.

Defensively Valencia is a better option in my opinion. Young was constantly giving fouls away in that first half because he's not got the strength to take the ball off players. Valencia was at fault for the goal but he made lots of tackles and was solid enough in the second half.

Edit: Also, when playing as wingers Young has had Evra as a full back behind who was great going forward even towards the end of his career. Valencia has had Rafael sometimes (and they work well as a pair) or Smalling/Jones who are not right backs.

1364~~~
He doesn't have a choice with Shaw out does he? I would rather he played Reece James there but for some reason LVG doesn't think he is ready. It is Ed's fault that we sold Buttner and Evra without getting adequate adequate specialist cover for both our full back positions. It is clear that LVG doesn't rate Valencia and Young as wingers and he has said so himself, he is just using them as stop gap solutions to the full back problem. We should have sold them both and gotten specialist full backs for cover by now and yet we haven't. I blame ED <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> (unless LVG decided we didn't need cover for full back)

1365~~~
Valencia is not in the side to retain possession. He needs to take players on and provide width to the side, something which he does once in a blue moon because he's turned into a coward. Young is not a coward. He's still shite on the left but bless him, he at least tries to do something with the ball. I don't really see how Valencia is better defensively either. Young is not a very good tackler but he does track his man a lot better than both as a wing back and a winger than Valencia has ever done.

1366~~~
Well youngs contract is up next year, so that's good news

1367~~~
The reason we play 3-5-2 is because our wingers are shit. They're simply there to supplement the attack and defence not to be our sole attacking outlet. If the main attackers like Rooney and Mata enjoy playing the ball out wide to them rather than creating opening themselves there's nothing more that can be done. LVG knows they're shit, you know they're shit and I know they're shit but for some reason our big time players are very comfortable with giving them the responsibility of being our main attacking option.

1368~~~
But they are been used to be our width from wingbacks , so our shittest wingers still manage to find their way in the starting 11, no matter the system

1369~~~
It's a sad truth that we are forced into playing them, but our forwards have so much ability that there should be no need for us to still be so heavily reliant on them when we go forward.

1370~~~
The reason we play it to fit Rooney and RVP in the same team. LVG has said as much.

1371~~~
As far as tracking back I don't really see too much difference. Valencia had two good tracking back interceptions against Sunderland, one vs. Cattermole and one vs. Gomez. Young had one too I think, but Valencia also put in more tackles and won the ball back for us far more.

1372~~~
We could just as easily play 4-1-2-1-2 or any other formation that didn't require wing-backs. He's gone for a formation that includes width, but doesn't rely on it. Currently, we're relying on it.

1373~~~
Unfortunately, giving contract extensions to our shitty wingers is just what we do.  See Nani and Valencia.

1374~~~
For what it's worth I reckon he'd do better on the right side. I hate the way he always has to shift to his right before he crosses the ball, it kills our attacking moves pretty much every time. He's got a good cross but the opportunity is always gone once he finally uses it.

1375~~~
He's on about £120k believe it or not. He has the best agent in the world.

1376~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1377~~~
Sod the (potential) new contracts, can't we just release him along with Valencia, Cleverley, and Fletcher?

1378~~~
He chose to have his signing on fee staggered over the length of his contract apparently which inflated his weekly wage. His basic wage is more modest.

1379~~~
I know, but £120k makes better headlines. It's not like he's giving good value even if he was on £50k per week. This is why paying any attention to money in football is pointless.

1380~~~
I watched the game last night again and most of those crosses were to particular players, they were unable to connect (which is and isn't his fault) and there was one to Mata at the back post who obviously was never going to get on the end of it. The ball was overhit slightly also.

1381~~~
I agree. If I were Ashley Young (or any of the other names you mentioned), I would face an important dilemma right now: should I push to have better luck elsewhere because I know Di Maria coming means a hell lot less playing minutes? Or should I train even harder like a wounded animal to find a bloody way to show everyone I deserve my place?

If those players have any pride left, they should work their asses off and fight their way back into the starting XI. If not, they can just feck off and never return.

1382~~~
This attitude really shits me and is a worrying trend among United fans. How can a United fan want to say to a man like Fletcher, feck off and you're not welcome back here.

The guy has been a great servant to the club and bleeds United but because the board have failed to invest in midfield over the years, people react like that.

1383~~~
Is the maintenance of high standards inside a team not relevant?

I know this is not the place to discuss about this, but as I wrote in the Fletcher thread: does the Eric Abidal story ring any bells? At one point, Barcelona just couldn't let sentimentality cloud judgement upon the current reality assessment, which we did as a mistake. When Abidal couldn't cut it up to Barca's existing standards, he was phased out completely and his contract was not renewed at all. We have to be realistic here; if one player can't cut it anymore, he has to go. This is the only way you can keep high standards within the team. Hell, even Hughes was bleeding United in his playing days, but Fergie had to be realistic in the end by cutting him out (something Fergie lacked to some extent towards the current dross in the last few years).

1384~~~
<a class="username" data-user="81130, @Kakeru" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81130/">@Kakeru</a> what does high standards of the team have to do with showing respect?

I don't have any issues with your opinion on the player, I agree to an extent but I would never say feck off and you're not welcome back, especially to a guy like Fletcher.

1385~~~
Cant wait for Shaw to be back .. hell even James is better..

1386~~~
<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

He deserved it!

<b>Young: Don't write United off</b>




Ashley Young is adamant it is too early to write Manchester United off in the Premier League title race, despite a winless start to the season.



United already trail early leaders Chelsea by seven points after following up an opening day defeat at home by Swansea City with draws away to Sunderland and promoted Burnley.

New manager Louis van Gaal has implemented a 3-5-2 formation since taking charge, which has seen Young operating in a left wing-back role.

Young believes it will take time for the system, and several new signings, to gel and he is not unduly worried by United’s sluggish start to the campaign, which has also included a 4-0 humiliation at the hands of MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

"In previous seasons when we haven't started the season so well we've gone on to win the league,” Young told Inside United.

"People have written us off already but everyone here knows you don't write off a club like United.

"People can say what they want but internally we all know exactly what we're striving to do, what goals we've set and what we want to achieve.

"There is no point panicking after a handful of games. It's obviously been disappointing but you have to take the positives from the games we've had.

"I definitely think things are going to turn for us and I would say to the fans there is nothing to worry about, we're going to come good.

"It's just like the manager has said: just believe in the philosophy and how we're playing and keep believing that we're going to turn this round - because we do.

"The manager has said things aren't going to change in a week or a month. It's going to take time for the players to adjust.

"We want to get results and I'm sure given the way we've worked in training the right results will come.

"We've got to keep thinking in the way that he has explained it to us and keep performing in the way he wants.

"Obviously things haven't gone the way we've wanted them to yet but we've just got to keep working on that philosophy that the manager wants, keep doing what we've been doing in training and show the spirit and togetherness that we always show.

"If we keep doing that then I'm sure everything will gel together and come good."

1388~~~
Is it alright to write off Young?

1389~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Surprised he didn't mention the influx of world class players, like: "I'll be sure to cheer them on from both the bench and the stands"

1390~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axNLI78-21U?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1391~~~
I guess you have to hand it to Young, he is the Gloria Gaynor of Manchester United.

1392~~~
Never understood the hate he gets to be honest. Seems like a pretty honest and down to earth lad who tries his best.

1393~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Young comes across well in that video.

1394~~~
He seems like a real sound guy.

1395~~~
Who's this guy, where's Smashley Young?

1396~~~
It'll be interesting to see who out of Young and Valencia will get the bench spot when they are both fit. Valencia is better defensively but Young offers the flexibility of both sides and is better going forward on both.

1397~~~
He's such a nice guy, it's a shame that he couldn't up his game to a decent level where, despite not being the most talented, he'd have been fans favourite due to his behaviour.

1398~~~
Nothing honest about divers.
Bit flash
Overpaid
His best isn't good enough.

I think if you add all that up it leads to a bit of resentment for some. Personally I don't hate the guy just rather he didn't play for us anymore.

1399~~~
Excuse me while I continue to not give a toss about any of that.

1400~~~
Man that name change <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1401~~~
Steady. He's right.

1402~~~
I like him, he's a bit shit sometimes, but he is a nice guy. 

Also he is not hiding like the other shit players we have/had. The likes of Valencia and Cleverley closed their social media accounts after being given shit by the fans, Young is still here and I doubt the others got half the shit he does. Just look at his Twitter/Instagram timelines... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1403~~~
He goes from featuring in every preseason game to a non-entity. I'm not upset by this but I am surprised. Is anyone else thinking that LVG has decided he isn't wasting his time on deadwood?

1404~~~
He's injured.

1405~~~
He's injured, but surely won't play on his return, there's nowhere for him in the current set-up.

Decent bloke, just never Manchester United quality.

1406~~~
Valencia now appears to be relegated to back up RB (which i have no issues about!) but he would still have a role to play for us playing as back up to our wingers - hardly like to like quality but he does pace and can deliver a good cross

1407~~~
No. He cant. He literally cant.

I hope he's nowhere near even the bench again.

1408~~~
Sorry i meant having Young as a reserve winger not Valencia. 

If you got that and still think Young hasnt got a role to play, i would disagree. Granted hes probably 3rd/4th choice hes still a good option to have

1409~~~
I have only just noticed the thread title <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1410~~~
So is he a third string right back or a third string left back? 

Or a winger on a team playing a formation with no wingers?

1411~~~
Hopefully a 2nd choice RB. He's better than Valencia so that's something he's got going for him.

1412~~~
He's an injured back up who will be sold within the next couple of windows.

1413~~~
You're kidding right?

Young is not a patch on Valencia defensively or attacking wise. I don't think I have ever witnessed him playing at right back, and I wouldn't want to either.

1414~~~
Maybe defensively you are right, but attacking wise? Is this 2011? As shit as he is, Young is 2 times the player that Valencia is going forward.

1415~~~
Just because he can do a job at wingback doesn't mean he should ever play fullback (in a back 4) for us. Definitely wouldn't be better than Valencia in that position either.

As an aside his "Paddy meets Young" was quite good. Seems like a decent guy, just isn't a good enough footballer for this club and I hope he finds a decent midtable club where he will be one of their better players, like he was at Villa, rather than staying here where he's one of our worst.

1416~~~
Young at RB would be Weird. Just because he could do a job as a wing back doesn't mean he can play fullback now. Even at wingback in our own half he was panicking all over the place.

Nah, not really. Even more so as a RB.

1417~~~
Not at all. There's barely anything between them defensively but going forward it's a no contest. Young (when playing on the right) wins hands down. Young on the left is as shit as Valencia is on the right however.

And no, I don't want a situation where our 2nd choice full back is Young but between him and Valencia he's the one I would choose.

1418~~~
I think after that bird did its business in his mouth Louis van Gaal was so grossed out he doesn't even want to look at him anymore.

1419~~~
I can understand we differ on our opinions when comparing them playing up front. However, I don't understand why you're so confident on your opinion having never witnessed Young play at right back.

1420~~~
I'm not really confident. They're both not very good. My opinion is based on 1)Watching Young play as a RWB in pre-season 2)Watching Valencia as a RB and RWB in this and previous seasons.

1421~~~
No way. Valencia is way better than Young defensively even though Valencia isn't a defensive stalwart himself. I do agree about the offensive aspect of their games though albeit it not being that significant. Young is a bit more adventurous and better technically than Antonio-Smash but he doesn't have too much end product himself and one can even argue that Valencia provides more width, work-rate and general presence in the flanks than Young. So it is not a no contest.

1422~~~
Didn't Young primarily play AM for Villa? And now we're fecking discussing whether he's a better bakcup RB than Valencia? Just shows how far downhill things have been going for him, when you look at his early career for Villa he has quite decent list of achievements. Back in 07/08 only Cesc had more assists than him in the PL, and he made the PL team of the year.

I feel part of the problem with Young is that he's never played in his natural position. Oddly that seems to be a tradition at the club, just look at Kagawa, Welbeck and God knows what's been going on on our RB when Rafael's out. No way he's a better number ten than Mata and Rooney though.

1423~~~
Last season he was shifted to be played as an AM for Villa, prior to that he played as a winger. But I do agree that he was at his best there.

1424~~~
Has LvG mentioned him at all when talking about injuries over the last few weeks?

1425~~~
LvG seems to agree, hence selling off Kagawa and Welbeck and playing Blackett/McNair over Blind/Fletcher at CB.

1426~~~
That's the question. Is he injured or just in Anderson territory.

1427~~~
McDonalds ?

1428~~~
he's doing really well for us, but thats because he isnt playing at all.

1429~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/story/2074380/manchester-united-boosted-as-ashley-young-returns-to-training" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-prem...d-boosted-as-ashley-young-returns-to-training</a>

Apparently we are "boosted" because Young has returned to training. Im not so sure.

1430~~~
Oh Ashley Young... I remember him from somewhere.

1431~~~
Did really well when he came on I thought. Doesn't get tougher to impress after coming on for Di Maria but I thought he looked threatening every time he got the ball. No longer the useless and shit Young, is he? Obviously been injured a lot but was pretty decent before his injury too.

1432~~~
Watching Ashley Young replacing Angel Di Maria was truly surreal.

1433~~~
One more year, that's all we've to last with him.

1434~~~
Was excellen off the bench. More of those please!

1435~~~
I'm surprised at people saying he was excellent - I barely noticed him when he came on last night. The entire team had a lot more urgency as we were chasing a result it is true, but I didn't think Young had any significant impact (not did he really have time to).

1436~~~
Di Maria was fecked for most of the second half. If anything, the substitution was too late. We improved significantly when Young came on and I'm really concerned that Di Maria will miss the Chelsea game now.

1437~~~
I've got absolutely no problem with him coming of the bench if needed. He did well enough. I understand people not wanting to see him start anymore (I agree), but as a squad player he's fine.

1438~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Young up for United scrap</b></span>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/9529152/Premier-League-Ashley-Young-prepared-to-fight-for-Manchester-United-place" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-...prepared-to-fight-for-Manchester-United-place</a>

Good for him.

1439~~~
He needs to build confidence in his own ability. He is a threat when he attacks and looks to go forward. Hopefully, he is watching Di Maria to see how it is done.

Last 18 months though, nothing but getting ball, standing still, passing backwards and diving. Didn't notice any of that when he was at Villa or when he first came. He had a good cross and just looked like he was going to take defenders to the cleaners.

1440~~~
Please let this be true!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/11/16/cl-david-moyes-targets-united-outcast-as-first-sociedad-signing/?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014...ts-united-outcast-as-first-sociedad-signing/?</a>

1441~~~
It'd be a good move for Young. Also, good to see more british players playing abroad. Young isn't bad technically at all, I just don't think he ever managed the step up mentally to United. He was a cracking player at Villa. 

Plenty of examples of players like that.

1442~~~
Young was very good for us in his first season, scoring from free kicks and whipping in dangerous crosses that were difficult to clear from the box.  If his wages weren't so high (probably further inflated from that spell with England) he would probably be getting calls from several mid table clubs.

1443~~~
This being the salient point.

1444~~~
Yeah, absolutely. I was convinced, at the time, that he would be a absolute cracking squad player for us.

1445~~~
Has played well today.

1446~~~
Ashley young on fire today...

1447~~~
Brilliant this game.

1448~~~
Very good today.

1449~~~
His performance deserves credit.

1450~~~
He did really well today. Great headed clearance and he put in the ball which led to the first goal.

1451~~~
Like above, very good display.

1452~~~
I'd have him just behind De Gea and Smalling as contenders for man of the match. Really unlucky to get taken off for tactical changes because he coped well defensively and attacked very well down the left. And the first goal came from his play

1453~~~
Surprisingly very good.

1454~~~
Very good performance, there was a great header at one point that Vida would've been proud of.

Was he injured at the end?

1455~~~
He was very good, fair fecks.

1456~~~
Very good performance by him, credit where it's due, great he's back from injury and let's hope that lasts

1457~~~
So impressed by him today. We had a lot of problems down that side before he came on.

1458~~~
He should be the first choice back up for both the LB and RB positions. Miles better than Valencia.

1459~~~
Aye, good game from Ashley today. I was mostly impressed by his tactical neatness, every time one of Arsenal's wingers tried to pass and turn around him, he followed him every single time, like a dog if you will. Seemed to be one that took care of sorting our defence out positionally at times as well.

1460~~~
Was pretty good today. Had the beating of Chambers once or twice. Pretty solid defensively. Not bad at all...

1461~~~
When Shaw got his knock, often you see that as being a sign it's not your day but he slotted in nicely.

1462~~~
Yeah his defensive positioning was decent. Valencia on the other hand is absolutely woeful at it. Seems to tuck in too much for some reason and leaves huge gaps on the right. Valencia is adequate on 1 on 1s and duelling with wingers though.

1463~~~
Did well, some decent driving runs and got to grips with The Ox after an early scare.

1464~~~
Looks like he really wants to stay at the club, a shame he cant perform like this week in week out.

1465~~~
Good game from him and a welcome surprise. I feared the worst when Shaw come off but he didn't let us down. He was defensively responsible but did help us carry a threat on the counter attack. There is a route back into the team for him if he's up to the task.

1466~~~
Had a decent game when he came on to be fair. What was the reason behind him being substituted? Tactical or tiredness?

1467~~~
Not fit to play the whole 90 minutes it seems but we may not have a bigger choice anyway in close future.

1468~~~
I like this lad just because he wants to be here. Well done today Ash. We needed you.

1469~~~
He did well, not sure why he came off unless he was injured, good to see him actually taking people on. He has ability, never going to be a world beater but he is a lot better than he has shown in the last couple of years.

1470~~~
Van Gaal explained post-match that Young wasn't fit enough to play 90 minutes. I guess he didn't want to risk it, with the injuries we had and all.

Good that he and Tony had a good game.

1471~~~
Fair enough jut thought it was a shame he didn't get to finish the game but last thing we need is another injury. him and Valencia both did very well and worked very hard, and considering they were both out of position was good to see.

1472~~~

#BANTZ #topLAD

1474~~~
I was pleased with him today, wouldn't mind him starting against Hull.

1475~~~
Oh my goodness Ander is so adorable.

1476~~~
Hahahaha at least he took it well <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1477~~~
Comes across quite well when he speaks I think. Good performance too.

1478~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>HAh<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> in the BBC interview LVG calls him "our friend Ashley Young"..

1479~~~
Credit to him. Came into the side after a long lay off and while we were under the cosh in that 3-5-2 and settled things down excellently on his side. Confident on the ball to make a run at their full back when needed and disciplined to keep Arsenal in check. Chambers influence in our half quickly diminished when he came on. When he's in his winger role one of my biggest criticisms is he doesn't go attack with the ball down the line so he gets predictable but at least two occasions he did a Montero on Chambers in the second half. I think against teams that open themselves up for the counter he's is a dangerous player to have as he is technically sound. It's when teams drop deep to defend he ends up looking an athlete only and not a footballer.

1480~~~
I wouldn't be worried at all if Young had to start a lot more games at full back this season. I do believe Van Gaal rates him, as I always have. When he's working in a defined system with a clear role I think he will shine.

1481~~~
Same. Having Young back is going to be a real boon. I really feel he is our most under appreciated player.

1482~~~
omg this thread is more dramatic with bigger ups and downs than a rollercoaster.

1483~~~
People just hate him for being 'shit'. He always come across as a very decent guy though and constantly works his bollocks off whenever he's on the pitch. He's also quite obviously a good footballer just not good enough to be one of the two main creative outlets for a team like us (which he has had to be when he played on the wing under Fergie and Moyes because that was basically our only way to play).

1484~~~
Converting him to attacking LB is probably a one real chance for him to play and perhaps even stay in United for a while.

1485~~~
Was probably our best individual player in preseason then returned to being shit and cowardly when the season started (totally reluctant to run/pass the ball forwards), but against Arsenal he was back to his preseason form. Very positive, drove us forward at times and was full of purpose. Good game from him, and I hope he carries on in the same vein.

1486~~~
Had an excellent headed clearance that Evra would have been out of position for. He also tracked runners well.. didn't give Arsenal much down that side. Promising performance.

1487~~~
was furious when he stripped off to come on. Was proved wrong, did his job. Guess it was just this one game our of 100 where he performs and had the luck the his average cross ended up with an own goal. Defensively he has shown some quality I didn't expect.

Still think he shouldn't have a United future!

1488~~~
Did well, fair play LVG must be a supporter of his, did well in pre-season then one injury then well again. Can see him getting more games.

1489~~~
Young's game is tailor made for a counter-attacking team. His main strength is pace, and that is useful when he has space to run. The problem arises when he has to play against parked buses or dribble past players from a static position. He doesn't have the guile or ability of the Hazard's or the Silva's. Or the crossing skill of a Beckham.

I thought he was one of our best 3 players in the game on Saturday.

1490~~~
Back to pre-season form. He was absolutely brilliant defensively, and like i wrote in the matchday also "the only that seems to have any discipline out there". I really can't understand why keeps on doing those stupid cross-feints (which mostly puts himself out of balance instead of the opponents) when he can be so dangerous with a direct playing style. This match and pre-season shows that his United career is far from over. He won't be a starter but he's a very handy squad player.

1491~~~
Wouldn't ever want to see him starting but he's a very good (and versatile) squad player. Would prefer him over Valencia all day long.

1492~~~
Good game for him, played really well, should start next game if L.Shaw not fit.
Didn't he dive for free-kick, which ref actually overlook?

1493~~~
Happy to have him a squad player, he's done himself no harm this season.

1494~~~
I have the impression that he is always good against strong oppositions( Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal or in champions league), when he plays against this kind of team, i'm never worried.

1495~~~
TBF i always liked him. I think because he give the impresion that he really want to do all he can and he really want to play for United.

He was good vs. Arsenal. That cross wich lead to Valencia goal was spot on, put it between goalkepper and defender is the best way to do it. Defensively he was good too, very discilpined. He did what he was asked to do and should get playing time now when Blind, Shaw and Rojo are injuried. Saying that, i thought we signed 3 LB's and now Young have to play there <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1496~~~
I just watched the Arsenal game, missed it on Saturday.

All in all I think Young did a good job. 

I know we didn't buy him so we could use him as a wing back, but he does that job well. His pace was much needed to stop Oxlade-Chamberlain. He works diligently and is apparently very focused on whatever he's been told to do by LvG. 

And he even started some counter attacks with his pace, which is always good to see.

I'm not his biggest fan, but he deserve a little praise for his performance on Sunday, especially after all the criticism he's had to endure.

1497~~~
If we have to play wing-backs then Young is a very good option to have it seems. The position really seems to suit him.

1498~~~
Valencia as well - both do well as wing backs, but struggle positionally as proper full backs. Seeing as they are naturally wingers, I suppose that is not much of a suprise.

1499~~~
Very impressive against Arsenal. If he can replicate this on a consistent basis, I've no problem with him being a back-up wingback/winger.
Problem is that given a regular run of games he seems to lose his bottle and just plays it safe the whole time.....

1500~~~
He did very well vs Arsenal, but I don't believe for a second that it's a turning point, he seems to just crawl back into his shell. For that reason I think that he should remain a squad player, he was never good enough to start consistently for United.

1501~~~
I don't really care much about Young. But this headlines makes me smile. I think he uses these interviews to bump up his chance to play. He's that kind of player. 

Forget top four - Manchester United stars are going for the TITLE, insists Ashley Young - Mirror Online

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/forget-top-four---manchester-4706730" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/forget-top-four---manchester-4706730</a>

1502~~~
Young or Blackett at LB Saturday then?

1503~~~
Just realized he's 29 or so now. Shouldn't there be a law that says you have to change your name from Young to Middle-aged when you hit thirty?

1504~~~
Good versatile squad player and incredible harder worker. Another victim of just being offered too much money by Fergie or Moyes - people hold him responsible for his wages, as if they would say 'I'm not worth that, I'll take half of that'.

1505~~~
More than decent enough squad-player, but as you say, we tend to ask too much of him especially considering his wages. I still cannot understand why, as a winger, he's so useless at running with the ball. He has bags of pace, very fast in fact, but once he runs with the ball he stumbles and cannot keep any pace at all and thus cannot run past defenders with the ball. He has to stop and use a dribble or two to get past - it works at times, but ultimately it holds up play.

1506~~~
Unfortunately he didnt work that hard on the wing. Just took a stroll in the park. If he worked as hard as he did in pre-season and his recent cameo, he'd probably have succeeded on the wing too

1507~~~
if van gaal plays with 4 at the back then probably blackett.

if he continue with 3-5-2 then it would be young as LWB.

1508~~~
I will forgive his 2 years of shitness if he plays well until shaw gets back and scores a screamer against Liverpool

1509~~~
We want Smashley Young back.

1510~~~
It's good to have a squad player capable of moments of brilliance. Also his corners are very good.

1511~~~
I would imagine Falcao getting to a few of his crosses. For all his skills and height, RVP was never great in the air.

1512~~~
Yes. You don't have to be Crouch's height to score headers. Rooney and Owen have also shown that. Cahill too among others.

1513~~~
Chicharito is also quite a good header on the ball. Rooney had a couple of seasons where he was brilliant in that respect - not so much these days. Falcao has a terrific leap!

1514~~~
Confidence I'd imagine. Valencia used to go by players for fun too but seems to never happen now.

1515~~~
That was valenica not Young.

1516~~~
Another good performance from him today I thought, again, positionally he's incredibly sound and provided width when it was needed. He's putting a good shift in Shaw's absence.

1517~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing him at right-back instead of Valencia.

1518~~~
This... Great again today.

1519~~~
Watched the game again and he had a few dodgy moments that Hull couldnt capitalise from. He is doing a decent job, but still I'm looking forward to seeing Shaw back again.

1520~~~
Hes good at set pieces in general to be fair to him.
Remember at villa they took great advantage of that. 
Hes doing a good job at full back, might be a more suitable position for him in the long run.
Dont see him having much of a career going forward with us as a winger.

I think i'd select him ahead of valencia at rb if / when it comes to that too.
He just seems to have adjusted to the role easier and quicker than him.

1521~~~
Hes a different player at full back. It seems like not having the pressure of having to beat his man in the manner of a traditional winnher has really helped his confidence. Having a player that can cover both full back positions is a real bonus.

1522~~~
Happy with him today and he seems content to play the role of a versatile squad player. People need to lay off him

1523~~~
Never thought I'd ever say this but I'm happy with Ashley Young, it seems just being a back up utility player is the way to go with him.

1524~~~
He put in a good shift today, fair play to him.

1525~~~
He will never justify that wage playing at left back, but I'm very glad to see his work ethic and at least we are getting some use out of him. 

He hasn't moaned and has taken to his new task with relish, which is all we can ask

1526~~~
I dont give a rats ass what his pay packet is.
I can understand supporters of other teams needing to take an interest but we really are stupidly wealthy. 
If putting us 600 million in debt isn't an issue then player wages will never be an issue.
Whatevers left over just goes to the Glazers anyway, so meh.

1527~~~
He's shown me he has a role as a squad player. Would still rather Shaw obviously but if Young can step in occasionally and do a decent job then that is just great.

1528~~~
Agreed. Both he and Valencia are showing decent value backing up Rafa and Shaw.

1529~~~
Who would have thought Ashley Young would make a decent left back? Was solid again yesterday and has proved himself as a very good squad player, well done Youngy.

1530~~~
I'm still not a fan of him as left-back.......it's maybe okay against Hull at home but away against Southampton will be a mistake

But Young was always a very good player in the own half......how many times has he played "left-back" when Evra has played as winger

1531~~~
Been quite impressive going forward tonight. Good dribbling.

1532~~~
Great at beating more than one man at a time, but his ball is shite.

1533~~~
Yeah, he's got the beating of his man every tim. Final ball not quite there yet.

1534~~~
Give this man a statue! What a miracle block!

1535~~~
GOAT clearance

1536~~~
Talk all the shit you guys want to about him but he's just saved our win there.

1537~~~
That was an incredible block on the line.

1538~~~
He just saved our fecking arses, MOTM just for that.

1539~~~
Great performance all round. That goal line clearance saved the win but he was good going forwards as well today.

There was one moment he broke through the middle of 2 Stroke defenders which I wouldn't mind a gif of.

1540~~~
Him and De Gea, Tikka bow sons.

1541~~~
Incredible clearance! Looked decent going forward too. Good performance.

1542~~~
Incredible save for us. He did put us in it by giving away a daft free kick but made up for it.

1543~~~
That block was just immense

1544~~~
Great performance at leftback

The clearance saved the points, but I was already really impressed with him before that.

He seems to have somehow become a 2 on 1 specialist since going to leftback, whenever 2 opponents closed Young down tonight he got past them both. It happened 2 or 3 times and I can't remember the last time I've seen a United player do that so many times in one match. Not even Ronaldo

Of course when Young was playing as a winger he couldnt even beat 1 defender

1545~~~
Smashley Young has been reborn as the worlds greatest full back, who'd have thought it.

1546~~~
Amazing how much more energy and confidence he's playing with. His cross was shocking all game though, needs to work on his left foot.

1547~~~
The clearance at the end sealed his MOTM for me. Great game.

1548~~~
Fair play. He's made sure we won the game right there.

1549~~~
Ashley Young, that's who thought it.

1550~~~
He was outstanding today it has to be said.

1551~~~
Well played mate. Off the line at the end. Blimey!

1552~~~
I still really dislike him because of some of his antics at times last season, but he looks a different player at the moment.

1553~~~
Brilliant once again today. Especially with his goal line stop. Never stopped working for the team from start to finish and filled in for Rooney tonight in that sense.

1554~~~
Whoa, what a fecking block at the end. Great awareness from a player who's not actually a defender. He's generally done very well in the left back role I feel, certainly a lot better than Valencia on the right. Surprisingly solid defensively and good enough going forward for a back.

1555~~~
Looks like the player of pre season.

1556~~~
What a feckin hero.

1557~~~
Must have beaten his man (or two) a million times today. Match winning clearance at the end sealed a good performance.

1558~~~
That one was insane... That was a nailed on goal, that's not supposed to be cleared. I'm in emotional turmoil, angry and happy at the same time. 

I think I need therapy over this one. I'll see if I can sleep it off, but I feel really weird. Thank you, Ashley! I guess?

1559~~~
That clearance so close,on the line.. Saved our bacon today.. Both him and Valencia are proving to be good cover for our fragile defense..

1560~~~
Definitely one of his better performances. Maybe van Gaal is right and he really can make every player better, wouldn't hurt if Young could bring more to the game than a good shot.

1561~~~
He was okay. Good at times, bad at others. But f*ck me, he saved our bacon at the end. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1562~~~
His block was as good as a goal, and he was the man of the match for me. He hardly made a single error. The fact he's proving a lot of people wrong makes me very happy.

1563~~~
Very good performance, he got my MOTM vote for the 90 minutes he put in, showed really attacking threat and defended well for the most part.

1564~~~
Shameful for the club that we don't have proper LB in case of emergency but he's surprisingly taking the chances from LVG and puts decent performances at that role.

1565~~~
Great game from him, and that clearance on the line at the death was just the icing on the cake. Great to see him full of confidence with the ball.

1566~~~
Was my MOTM tonight. Not just because he saved us at the end, but because he was a constant threat down the left hand side tonight, although some of his crossing could have been better.

1567~~~
I can't believe that Ashley fecking Young, who was an utter waste of space until recently, has now developed into a competent left-back who all of the sudden can beat a man again like he's back at Aston Villa. LVG must be a magician <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1568~~~
Saves like those are the difference between top 4 and Moyesing it.

1569~~~
Agree with whoever said he should get Ballon d'Or.

1570~~~
I thought, over the full 90, he was our man of the match today. Constant threat down that left and was beating people for fun. Well done him.

1571~~~
GOAT

1572~~~
Really good today. Happy to see it.

1573~~~

Goodness....I've never liked him, but deary me, he is really starting to produce the goods, even if it is out of position

Great to see him playing well and getting praise, as he's a great lad. Well done today Ashley.

1578~~~
Was good. Had one or two iffy moments but who cares. That block at the end too! Thank you Ash!

1579~~~
Lifesaver, and another decent display. Seems quite comfortable in this role.

1580~~~
Young has been a beauty under Van gaal, has to be said. was injured a lot like everyone, but was our best player today by a mile, playing as a left back.

1581~~~
Seems to have remembered how to beat a man again too

1582~~~
Serious wind of confidence flowing through his sails. About three times he was stood up by two men at the flank and just cleaned them with ease. Di Maria applauds.

1583~~~
I much prefer him to Valencia, can beat his man occasionally and on his right foot can put in a decent cross. Hard worker as well, shame most of the time he's forced to cross with his left. Life saver at the end.

1584~~~
Given him a ton of stick, but that clearance was fantastic.

1585~~~
Damn, black man thread is gone. Anybody catch the picture link? Needs to go in here.

1586~~~
He was brilliant tonight. Ran Smalling close for man of the match.

1587~~~
He skimmed their right back and winger together on 3 occasions with the same skill, and I remember thinking at the time, I wonder what the caf would say if that had been ADM?

1588~~~
Great performance from him. let us hope he can keep this level for the next match as well, that will be an important one.

1589~~~
That performance was like a throwback to watching him about 4 years ago. I can't remember the last time I've seen a United player beat his man so many times in one game. Such a refreshing change of viewing <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1590~~~
Would like to see him at RB so he doesn't have to take as long to get his cross off

1591~~~
Defensively solid again bar a few moments at the end with Diouf. Attacking wise this is the Young who electrified at the start of his United career and at Villa. Using his pace along with his skill and decision making to come inside, pick a pass, and get to the byline. For too long he just became a speed merchant. Technically he is pretty good as I've said before. He hasn't got that single minded approach Nani has but he is probably more rounded to change his roles in game. MOM for me.

1592~~~
Man of the match and it's not even close. And not just because of his brilliant goal line clearance.

1593~~~
You have to admire him. Instead of kicking up a fuss, or leaving the club, he plays at LEFT BACK instead of his natural wing position just so he can be a part of the club. It was obvious as soon as he's arrived that he loves being here.

I can only admire the guy. I really hope he carries on from his recent performances and becomes a solid squad player for us. Cut out the diving, and he's a very likable player. Always remember him and Fletcher watching a game with the fans a couple of seasons back.

1594~~~
He beat 2.

1595~~~
Was constantly talking to his team mates and getting people in good positions. MOTM for me.

1596~~~
He made two players maybe three times in the match. I couldn't believe their defending, won a free kick once ... his dribbling is very good he lacks the delivery which was quite awful.. I understand he is right footed but he messed up the most balls with his right.. anyway very good defensively, his positioning is great considering that he played as second striker for England a couple of years ago.. good work from van Gaal using all the players in a good way. He is truly a great coach.. ressurecting Valencia, Young, Fellaini. I think he could do very well with Nani had he stayed but he needed this loan and couldnt get a game time as his only position where he is playable is as a winger. Very good back up in the end for Shaw that Young guy is..

1597~~~
but he can easily cut inside and score goals like against newcastle.. but his destribution as I stated is quite strange as he overhit the ball many times with his right and with left there was quite no power

1598~~~
My MOTM and I never thought I was ever going to say it. He put in a brilliant shift and topped it off with an vital goal line clearance. I'm not sure what the difference has been but Van Gaal seems to be able to the best out of players who have been written off at this club. 

Fantastic all round performance, stepped up when the team needed him.

1599~~~
Just seen the highlights, as close to being a goal as they come. The ball was almost over the line, well done Ash!

1600~~~
He was our best player pre-season. Nice to see he has recaptured that form. The lad gives everything every time he is on the pitch. he has an infectious smile and a brilliant attitude. I'm with you, and really happy to see him doing so well. I just hope he keeps it up and continues to get the chances. It's pretty telling that he is performing so well when being played out of position.

1601~~~
van Gaal said he could improve any player, I don't think he was lying. Even Valencia has been good at right-back (he's actually been better than Rafael this season but I'll wait a while before pissing off the Rafael fan boys with that one).

1602~~~
Man of the match without a doubt.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nonsense. And you can call me a Rafa fanboy all you want if it makes you feel any better.

1603~~~
The goal line clearance towards the end has enhanced what was an overall mediocre performance. He end product and crossing were ordinary for the amount of space he found himself in. 

Can't really complain much about a replacement LB in an unfamiliar role.

1604~~~
I think it's a pity that each he did well  to create the space for himself by some good dribbling, he couldn't deliver a good ball. It's like he was content with the dribbling and the crowd roar and lost focus before making the cross.

1605~~~
Pretty much how I saw it. He was wasteful, and definitely should have created more clear cut chances.

1606~~~
At the same time it's just Ashley Young, I'm relatively satisfied by his general performance. It'd be unwise to expect much much better, he did well overall.

1607~~~
This.

It's no good finding space if you can't deliever the ball well. He was OK, he did his job, it wasn't great in any way.

1608~~~
Really good yesterday

1609~~~
Our man of the match.. Ran up and down the flank,  defended brilliantly and attacked with guts.  Has given Shaw something to think about..

1610~~~
He spent half of the match by time wasting via throw-ins. Otherwise he provided great penetration albeit with less successful end product meaning a cross finding his teammate.

1611~~~
It was an excellent performance but you can't ignore the fact he had very little actual defending to do. Although the defending he did do, to be fair, was very good.

1612~~~
I still can't believe he managed to pull off the Bardsley around five times and the Stoke defenders never copped it.

Good performance though, still can't cross a ball with his left to save a life.

1613~~~
He's a stopgap in that position and nothing more and viewed as such he's done pretty well

If we want to be winning things though you can't have an Ashley Young (or a Tony V for that matter) in your backline.

1614~~~
He was man of the match undoubtedly. Was a constant threat down the left and showed some dribbling that we haven't seen since his first season here. Final balls could have been better but that block at the end is a huge moment in our season

1615~~~
He was brilliant. Good on him.

1616~~~
He did a good job yesterday and the goal line clearance saved us. If he could pass the ball he could have got 1 or 2 assists. I hope this performance gives him the confidence to keep that level

1617~~~
Was amazed to see him actually beat a couple of players - even playing winger I dont remembering him doing that for a couple of years, nevermind fullback!

1618~~~
As a Rafael fanboy, I think I might even agree. I'm not sure if I would say he's been better, but definitely more solid. He just doesn't seem to lose physical battles, and rarely does an opposing wide player get behind him. Rafael is a much bigger asset going forward IMO, but it seems like we can really rely on Valencia, especially in terms of fitness.

When Rafael is fit, I think he will struggle to reclaim his place. But if both are fit, they are both great options. If Rafael can at least improve his injury record, and Valencia can maintain this level of performance, then I don't think we need a new right back for a while.

1619~~~
He's a good back up for the right back position but I'm still waiting with bated breath for Rafael to come back.

1620~~~
You get the feeling that he would play anywhere for the team without complaint. Has done a good job in the left back role.

1621~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Young: Thank God for goalline technology</b></span>
<b><a class="externalLink" href="http://origin-www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Ashley-Young.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ashley Young</a> has hailed the impact of goalline technology in football following his last-gasp clearance to deny ex-Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf in Tuesday’s <a class="externalLink" href="http://origin-www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2014/Dec/Manchester-United-vs-Stoke-City-Premier-League-match-report.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2-1 win over Stoke City</a>.</b>

The system was introduced at the beginning of last season and its importance was highlighted at Old Trafford during Saturday’s match with Hull City, when the cameras proved that Chris Smalling’s close-range shot had crossed the line by a matter of inches.

The technology was required once more against the Potters when Diouf’s shot was cleared off the line after David De Gea’s reflex save had denied Marko Arnautovic. Speaking to <b>ManUtd.com</b> after the final whistle, Young was thankful for the clarification.

“We are delighted that it has been brought in,” he explained. “The referee was there with his watch and, as soon as the ball hit my foot and was cleared off the line, I looked to see if he was whistling for a goal. He wasn’t and we managed to hold on to the win, so thank God for goalline technology!

"I’m not too sure what I was thinking beforehand. Diouf had the shot and I think it came off my bum and went the other way. It was just a reaction to turn around and run in that direction. I saw it fall to Mame and it was just a reaction to stick my leg out and hope for the best. Luckily I cleared it, but I felt we were the team that could have got more goals.

"It wasn’t meant to be but we stand here now with the three points and we are looking forward to the next game.”

After a sluggish start, Tuesday’s match became a wholly entertaining affair that was ultimately decided by Juan Mata’s goal following first-half strikes from Marouane Fellaini and Steven Nzonzi.

But the Reds were made to work hard for the three points, particularly in the dying seconds when Stoke threw men forward and almost rescued a draw against the run of play.

“It was a bit scary at the end but we knew that’s what Stoke would do - pressure us in the last 10 minutes,” explained Young.

“We felt that would come and we had to defend as a team. Everybody did brilliantly, from the goalkeeper all the way to the forwards. We’re delighted to get the three points.”

1622~~~
If he took a pay cut would any of you keep him as a squad option? He's having a good, underrated season.

1623~~~
Him and Carrick are the only two he have played well

1624~~~
He can be a back up to Luke Shaw. But nothing else.

1625~~~
Our best player tonight although that's being extremely generous

1626~~~
How many times is he open and everyone just completely ignores him. He's standing there waving his arms in the air and everyone looks the other way.

Do they not like him?

1627~~~
Hes been very good this season and follows up today. Not exactly lethal going forward, but has had some really good involvements in defense

1628~~~
Very good at his new role. If he'd been a bit more of a threat going forward, Shaw would have a hard time getting back into the team.

1629~~~
Not only that but it's almost like Southampton are trying to encourage us to pass it to him. They leave him in a feck ton of space out there. Is it because they want him to swing balls into the box or something?

1630~~~
Most probably because they've seen know one wants to involve him in the play.

1631~~~
Ashley Lahm based on today's performance

1632~~~

1633~~~
Uh oh

1634~~~
Ashley 'the king' Maldini

1635~~~
Best player in our team today, he's been having his best season for United .

1636~~~
Performed really well, cannot fault a winger playing as a LWB with such competence. Let's not forget how woefully sh1t he has been for the majority of his Utd career though.

1637~~~
Another fantastic performance from him. MOTM along with Van Persie today. Defended and got forward very well and didn't stop working all night. He's a real team player.

1638~~~
Work ethic from young has been fantastic.

However he is still so ineffective in possession.

He's better without the ball than with it.

1639~~~
Another top top performance.

1640~~~
Have to say Ashley Young has become a decent full back. I just laughed when he got across the front of Long to cut out a cross that had eliminated three of our back four in the second half. Questions about whether Luke Shaw would've had the awareness to do that and he's a proper left back. Is Young Louis Van Gaal's next Alaba?

1641~~~
He's quite decent, as evidenced by the fact that our attack became lopsided to the left for significant stretches of the 2nd half.

1642~~~
He really was brilliant, saved a certain goal at 1-1 with some excellent tracking back

If it wasn't for RvP's 2 goals he would be my man of the match

1643~~~
Yes. He's doing well

Wouldnt want him as a first choice but as a backup to Shaw I'll take it. More convinced by him at left back than Rojo

1644~~~
He was decent today and was one of the better players but that's about it

1645~~~
Smashley Young strikes again.

1646~~~
Fantastic game best player on the pitch though RVP just pipped him because he scored 2 goals.

1647~~~
Very good, again. Starting to think whether Shaw will really have to fight for his place back now...

1648~~~
I was very impressed by him tonight, he's so good defensively.

1649~~~
He did quite well overall again today, which is brilliant to see. Nothing like a redemption story.

But boy oh boy, I'd be reluctant to even call him a one trick pony in one-on-ones, because I'm not sure just changing the direction of the ball in favor of your right foot constitutes a trick!

1650~~~
He's doing well right now and I am enjoying him being in the team.

1651~~~
Decent going forward but he really left Long far too many times alone against Rojo. Thankfully Long was fecking shit, though. He also ruins a lot of quick attacks by being so one footed, we can never get an early cross in with him.

1652~~~
He's doing alright recently but feck me, can't wait for Shaw to come back so we don't have to cope with inevitable aimless crosses after he cuts inside every 5 minutes. Long being shit helped him out a fair bit today.

1653~~~
yeah no matter how shite he i going forward he is very responsible in defence. 
hes like Val in this regard.

1654~~~
On a night where most were awful, he was one of the better players on the pitch. Looks a different player under LVG.

1655~~~
Very good performance from him imo.. Our 2nd best player behind RvP, would have been my choice for MotM had RvP not scored a brace. His concentration levels were amazing, might not be the best defender but he takes up good positions and keeps his cool under pressure too. Moving him to Wing back/Full back seems to have been a great move by LvG! 

I remember praising how well he used to cover for Evra, but offered very little going forward in the last 2 seasons. Looks like LvG's put it to good use

1656~~~
New RB? I reckon he could play there as well, he isnt injury prone and works his ass of. If Shaw gets back, I hope he gets shifted to RB, he deserves a place with his form.

1657~~~
I must have seen something different than others. He was decent but I thought he was poor defensively on a few occasions.

1658~~~
I thought he was good and I'm happy for him. Hadn't written off his ability but had written off his mentality. I had him down as a bit of a coward, someone who wasn't up for the scrap and who didn't have the balls to pick himself up from his poor form but he looks to be proving me wrong. Fair fecks Ash.

1659~~~
I've been really happy with his performances lately.

But that's after having an expectation of 0 after last couple of seasons.

1660~~~
Defensively he's been a bit of a revelation. Attacking wise he's still fairly useless, but in this formation it can't be denied he's good money for his place.

1661~~~
Our best player apart from RVP of course. He put some nice crosses into the box.

1662~~~
I actually think he's been a lot better offensively. Maybe that is just because I compare him to Valencia though.

1663~~~
Probably our best player tonight, but then again there's not much competition

1664~~~
Some of his crosses were really good. I never understand why one or two dont go back post for his crosses though. He whips them in well. I think Falcao would love getting on the end of his crosses tbh as he would be attacking them.

1665~~~
You really think he was better than van Persie?

1666~~~
I had him down as MOTM for most of the game until RVP ran away with it - incredible how well Young has done at left-back.

1667~~~
He's doing a reverse Bale. Shite at winger, great at left back.

1668~~~
Always posts those nice pictures on facebook and shit, very likeable guy.

1669~~~
Valencia's done a reasonably solid job recently but it's amazing that a winger can be so timid on the ball. I swear he didn't even try to overlap once never mind dribble today.

1670~~~
He actually gets crosses in, which is a plus, but he's not particularly affective. I also worry (a bit like Fellaini) that his mere presence encourages us to move away from the passing football we're supposedly aiming towards. When he's there, we seem to get it wide at every opportunity.

1671~~~
Rooney was pissed off at him during second half at some point, he was keeping defender on his back and wanted to release Valencia but he just wouldn't run. Fellaini tried the same thing in the first half and it didn't work as well.

Not sure if it's some instructions that Young is allowed to be the more attacking wing or just Antonio bricking it.

1672~~~
i thought he did well overall defensively, but there was one big mistake where he just didnt bother to track back Long and he headed straight at De Gea. I was furious. Offensively same old, still cant put one decent coss in.

1673~~~
I'd say he's given us plenty of reason to save a few quid on a back up LB.

1674~~~
Kept his head down and worked hard and now he is back in the team. I am very happy for him, the shit he was getting was ridiculous.

1675~~~
Yeah I saw a tweet he put out where he praised the away fans. Seems like a really good guy.

1676~~~
Made some mistakes (but then again who didn't van Persie aside) but was by a distance our second best outfield player tonight.

1677~~~
Hes definitely proved hes capable of playing wb/full back, but would like to side him on the right side.

1678~~~
He also comes across as very intelligent. I think he's one of  the most well spoken players i've seen in a while. Doesn't stutter and always immediately answers questions straight to the point.

1679~~~
He put in  two very good crosses in that no one connected with.

1680~~~
Must admit I'm actually shocked at the amount of people in here saying he has been 'great' and seemingly a long term answer in this position. He has deputised well but he isn't good enough to be our starting full back long term.

1681~~~
I guess his direct opponents have been shit in the last three games as well

1682~~~
Our creative hub <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> ? I like Young because no matter his limitations as a footballer, he tries his best and plays positively.

1683~~~
He was OK, but I think we're being a little generous here. He made more than a couple of mistakes in possession. Defensively though, he has done alright- most of their attacks seemed to come from Valencia's side.

1684~~~
The interception he made towards the end that denied a clear goal at the right post of De Gea was quality. A real defender's instinct to get there and do it in the box.

1685~~~
I want to see him at RB/RWB when Shaw is available (assuming Rafael is injured, which he will be at some point) 

I think his attacking play would benefit from not having to cut in to cross off of his dominant foot.

1686~~~
One of the players to come out the Southampton game with any merit.

1687~~~
Looks like <a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> had a point whenever he kept banging on about Young>Valencia defensively. Still think Valencia is better on dealing with 1v1s but Young seems to have better positioning and a better grasp of defending overall. Just wish he would use his feckin left foot to put in an early cross once in a while instead of the predictable shiftin it to the right routine.

Quietly impressed with him the past few games.

1688~~~
Valencia is definitely better 1v1 although I think that's more down to how freakishly strong he is than any particular defensive ability. Positionally Valencia is awful.

I'm a fan of Young as long as he's not playing as a left winger. LB, RB or even as a right winger he's pretty good.

1689~~~
Like him or not, he's done a good job recently in a position that is rather new to him. He's not our problem right now. Yesterday, he was one of the better players

1690~~~
He made a right balls of a pass across the midfield last night and we were lucky we weren't punished for it but other than that he would have been my man of the match against Southampton had RvP not put in a brilliant performance. 

Overall theres definitely been a pep in his step since LvG took over.

1691~~~
Thought he was very good last night (but for one horrific moment). He's actually got a bit of defensive ability... which is handy as going forward he's still looking pretty blunt.

If he regularly puts in performances like the ones he has lately he's a rather handy guy to have around.

1692~~~
Am I the only one that thinks his offensive work in terms of crossing isn't that bad? I thought he put a few decent balls in, there was just no one there to get on the end of them.

1693~~~
This he's proving to be a decent cover here. And pleased for him. Not many players in our side who can cover a completely different position as well as he has so fair play to him.

1694~~~
I think they're ok, my only problem is that 95% of the time, it's the same: good run down the left, gets back on his right foot and swings a curler in. I think to be effective on the wing he needs a tad more variety because the opposition defence usually knows how to shape up to wait for those crosses. 

Has his crossing ended up with any goals this year? Honest question, I can't remember.

1695~~~
The Gibbs OG was a result of the initial Young cross...if that counts.

I think he's a much better crosser from the right. I wouldn't be against playing Rojo at LB and Young at RB until Shaw is back.

1696~~~
In danger of becoming our best defender. It's a funny old game.

1697~~~
That was Valencia.

1698~~~
THe initial cross was by young which lead to Gibbs and Chesney tackling each other before Valencia tried to hit it for a throw in.

1699~~~
I agree, although as a centre forward its always best to have an idea of when the ball is coming in so that you can get on the move. On two occasions last night he put in decent crosses with his left foot and nobody had moved. Everyone was expecting him to cut back in on his right - which he does 99% of the time.

Agree that he would be better as RB, if we can get Shaw back fit.

Pretty happy with his attitude recently though. He probably  doesn't like playing as LB, but he gives it a real go and does show defensive promise.

1700~~~
Same as Fellaini, all you can ask after a season like last is that they get their heads down and work their backsides off to show they belong here. Those two have shown character and are rightly getting picked on merit now. The fact we've 48 players out injured helps but you know what I mean.

1701~~~
Younginho <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>, his dribbling is so funny.

1702~~~
The guy has done nothing wrong since he has been in the that left wingback role

It'll be hard to drop him when shaw returns

1703~~~
Seriously, what has LvG done to Young!? It's incredible, he looks like on of the better left backs in the league at times.

I'm not even sure that I'd pick Shaw over him at the moment!

I'm so impressed with how Van Gaal has gotten to him, and I'm also really impressed with Young's character and ability to apply himself.

1704~~~
Steady there.

Yes you would, obviously. Shaw's a much better full back and offers directness and pace that Young can't give you.

Like the job Young's done lately though, bailed us out when we've not got another left back to play.

1705~~~
Another top performance from a player many thought would be one of the first out of the door. Really pleased for him.

1706~~~
Another solid performance from Young. Wanted him out last season, but he's been really good this season, and is proving to be a great squad player for us. Top performance.

1707~~~
Ashley Alves is quite the revelation.

1708~~~
He's become such a likable player, it's actually shameful of all the shit me and so many other United fans said about him these last few years. Never complains, is delighted to be here, always gives 100%. May not be the most flashy of players but you can't fault him for not putting in a shift. Van Gaal has completely changed him, and Valencia.

1709~~~
I dunno, like I said - I'm not sure that I would.

Shaw is a talent and long term, obviously I'd rather keep Shaw than Young. But Young has been exceptional there given how fragile and inter-changing the defence he's playing alongside has been.

1710~~~
Not quite as good as his last couple of games but still a decent performance.

1711~~~
Philip Lahm is a black man. Enough said.

1712~~~
Very good again and it's good to see him turning his career around at United. LVG has given everyone a chance at a fresh start and he has taken it. Well done to him.

1713~~~
That thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1714~~~
There were a few times in the second half where he went absolutely batshit crazy because he wasn't being passed to, it was pretty bloody funny.

1715~~~
Really happy for him that he's shut up his critics by claiming his place at United. He's a good squad player to have and seems to be a pretty likeable guy.

1716~~~
He did well under Fergie and is starting to do so again under van Gaal. Players like him rely on good structure because they lack the skill to just make things happen. He has great pace and a good shot and those assets have been important to us.

1717~~~
Have to say, I've been really happy and impressed with his form as of late. He's adapted his game and we're benefitting from it. Hope it continues!

1718~~~
To be honest I've always liked Young just never rated him. He's always been a passionate player and clearly gives 100% in every match, I'm so glad he 's turned his United career around!

1719~~~
I've never rated him, but he's doing well this season, I still don't rate him mind, and not good enough to start for us when everyone is fit, but like Fellaini, he has worked hard and when he was given a chance, he has taken it, fantastic attitude.

1720~~~
Him and Valencia have been good for us. It's good to have cover, though Shaw will walk back into the squad.

Nice to see his confidence build.

1721~~~
Confidence is an amazing thing.

1722~~~
Would not see a positive in selling him. This says it all really about my change in opinion towards him thanks to his recent performances.

1723~~~
Young did a good job, but cant wait to see Shaw back, gives us the directness and pace we need.

1724~~~
Doesnt deserve to be dropped when Shaw comes back. A great indication of how well hes done there. Hes working so hard for the team and benefiting himself too by playing a deeper role.

Granted he may be exposed against a top team, top wingers, but so far, since coming in for Shaw hes been really good. Happy to see his name on the team sheet now.

1725~~~
Just needs more confidence in his left peg. His constant turning back breaks the flow. When he decides to attack it is nice to see. Thought he gave Evans some hospital passes today.
Also must be the exception to the rule being right footed and on the left.

1726~~~
This

But i would deffo keep him now. If we're playing 4-2-3-1 away from home then he would a very important player.

1727~~~
Not as rare as you think:

Azpilicueta, Adriano, Lahm, Glen Johnson, Santon, Antonini. 

Gianluca Zambrotta was a classic case too.

1728~~~
The turn around has been very impressive.

1729~~~
Be careful overpraising him, next think you know it will be a contract extension and regression. The Nani special.

1730~~~
Think the moment we switch to back 4,Shaw will take his place if fit,on other side its there for all to see Young doing more then good job as LWB.

1731~~~
What a difference 9 years make. Aidy Boothroyd had him playing either as a main striker or on the right. Went to Villa and either played left or as a no.10. Came to United and either plays left wing or now left wing back.

Centre back and goalkeeping awaits.

1732~~~
I think basically he's always been capable of hard work and responsible play, but somewhat limited as an attacking player. This FB/WB role reduces the pressure on him to be attacking effectively all the time, whilst giving him the opportunity to work as hard as he can. Wingers can't always do that, because they need to try and keep themselves in dangerous areas. Now, even if he's not doing that well going forwards, he can put lots of energy into his defending and impress that way instead.

I'd still put Shaw back in whenever he's ready, but it's good to know that we don't have to rush him and that he'll have proper competition once he's back.

1733~~~
He does run his bollocks off so fair play to him, now if he could do a Tony V and add a semi consistent deliver to his repertoire, we'd have something on our hands.

1734~~~
I was talking of LVGs philosophy. He likes left footed players on the left and right footed on the right to maintain balance.

1735~~~
Currently his deliveries are better and more consistent than Valencia. Though I must admit both of them did really well yesterday. And Young has been putting together a streak of good performances of late.

1736~~~
van Gaal wasn't lying when he said he could improve any player. He's turned two shite wingers into great wing-backs. Sky did comment on how Young had felt more confident as van Gaal had encouraged him as a senior player, and up until this point he didn't feel a senior player. But I guess he is.

1737~~~
Do you actually view Valencia and Young as 'great wing-backs'?

1738~~~
Relative to what they were as wingers last season, yeah. They've done great for us this season, as good as, if not better than, Rafael and Shaw.

1739~~~
glad to see young doing very well now. the LVG effect for sure.

he is turning into a very good back up for shaw.

1740~~~
Reckon he'd be even better at rightback.

1741~~~
Did well with tracking runners. Deserves a lot of credit for saving his United career. 

Still want to see him go to his left down the wing. Makes him a much  better attacker.

1742~~~
What a man, what a player is our Smashley! Our best player alongside Big Dave recently.

1743~~~
Brilliant run and cross. On his left foot too.

1744~~~
This must be his best run of performances for the club.

1745~~~
He's been fantastic this season.

1746~~~
Been brilliant today, constantly putting in good balls from left, deserves more than one assist.

1747~~~
If we insist on playing 3-5-2, Young gets my nod ahead of Shaw. Anything else and Shaw comes up trumps. He could even be accommodated at LCB in a 3-5-2 knowing how injury prone our centre backs are.

1748~~~
Lovely on the left, bit crap on the right. Di Maria's getting in screwed all today.

1749~~~
Fair to say he's been better on the left than the right!

1750~~~
Wut.

1751~~~
We've been poor ever since he came in, and to accommodate him, Young was put on the right, and Valencia went out. And they both were good today before that.

1752~~~
A really stupid decision from LVG to put him on the right side when he was doing so much damage on the left <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1753~~~
So yeah, he apparently can't cross from the right.

1754~~~
Can we just sign some world class left and right backs for a change ?

1755~~~
And Di Maria was out of the game on the left, when he looked lively on the right.

1756~~~
Credit where credit is due, our best outfield player several times in the last 2 months. If Falcao and Fellaini play together he will have some good targets

1757~~~
Our best player today.

1758~~~
Wasted far too many crosses. Ran at his man a little but he certainly wasn't MOTM.

1759~~~
He was doing very well until the red card incident. The boos clearly affected him.

1760~~~
Should have kept him on the left and kept Di Maria on the right (Free). We had the extra man as well.

1761~~~
Him and Carrick are the only players who played well.

1762~~~
Why in the name of Christ did Van Gaal switch him to the right?

Young had Lowton beat every time, he assisted the goal with a cross from the right and sent in 2 or 3 other dangerous crosses from the right.

Baffling decision.

1763~~~
Man of the match for me.

Found his form again and you have to give credit to him for reinventing himself as a wingback/winger/leftback etc.

Puts in a shift and Januzaj could take note of his work rate and determination.

1764~~~
Great cross for the goal and he was industrious, but whether he was hurt more then he let on from the Abonglahor challenge or the crowd  got to him I don't know, but either way he looked nervy on the ball after the red.

1765~~~
It's scary how much we rely on him to create chances now.

Big mistake to move him to the right.

1766~~~
Our best player today, silly to move him to the right from LVG, wrong move.

1767~~~
Played well again, but LVG doesn't seem to put any trust in him as a full back in a back 4.

1768~~~
Well done Ashley he has really turned it around after all the flack he was getting arguably been our best player last 3-4 games.

1769~~~
I'll never understand why the stupid Villa fans were booing him after the red card. Wtf was he supposed to do ? Not feel pain ?

1770~~~
They were booing him throughout the match, not just after the red card.

1771~~~
They were singing that he's a wanker though after that red card.

But hey, seeing how they've fecked around with that ball-hiding and all that it's rather a clear picture that there were plenty of wankers in the crowd.

It's almost as if he's left them for Birmingham City really.

1772~~~
He isnt liked by villa fans. He always gets booed at villa park

1773~~~
It got much more intense after the red though.

1774~~~
Presumably thought he made a lot of it.

1775~~~
Am I the only one who thought he was extremely wasteful? So many of his crosses were atrocious.

1776~~~
It's silly though. Hating a Villa player because he left for Man Utd makes no sense. Every single player in their squad would do the same, with no exceptions.

1777~~~
Gave him MoTM, thought he was really good and that piece of work for goal fantastic. Wasn't as affective when he was moved, but the difference in his performances compared to a year ago is night and day.

1778~~~
No.

Last 20 mins everything went through him. Strange.

1779~~~
He dived against them in a 4-0 win. Him leaving would get booed. But hate went up after the dive.

1780~~~
We have the likes of Rooney, Mata, di Maria in the team and we leave the creativity part to Ashley Young. Saying that, another good game for him, probably MOTM for me.

1781~~~
Somehow wasn't as effective at RB as he was at LWB, despite playing on his stronger side. Might've picked up a knock which restricted him but a good performance and he seems to have rescued his United career under LVG.

1782~~~
He's been really good this season and Shaw will have his work cut out for him if he wants to get back into the starting eleven.

1783~~~
Played well on the left; felt he was poor on the right, just aimlessly whipping the ball in. Yet we continued to go to him for the outlet every time instead of using Di Maria or putting him back on the left.

1784~~~
Exactly. He has the odd moment where it works but more often than not his crosses are shite. Wasted a lot in the final 20 particularly when we needed consistent delivery.

1785~~~
Played we'll but I do feel his crossing can be very wasteful at times, despite the one for the goal.

1786~~~
He was poor out on the right, did well on the left. Valencia should have stayed on the right IMO.

1787~~~
Ashley Lahm.

1788~~~
Why was he booed before the red?

1789~~~
He dived against them and won a penalty for it. Been booing him ever since.

1790~~~
Was playing fantastic on the left hand side and fully deserved MOTM, it baffles me that LVG swapped him to the other side and put Di Maria on the left where he was completely wasted.

I think Young has been the biggest surprise this season and has done enough to be a regular starter for me...

1791~~~
Crazy when he's right footed.

1792~~~
Good player

1793~~~
Watch Ashley Young finish his career at United, he just wont go away I tell you.

1794~~~
So what?

1795~~~
Just a prediction. I aint a hater.

1796~~~
Sorry then. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1797~~~
Another solid display. To be expected with the emotion and natural drive involved with returning to Villa Park but he did well to contain it and use it to his advantage. 

Who'd have thought that he would be a genuine shout for one of our best outfield players of the season so far? Probably the most consistent outfield player.

1798~~~
I think that's largely down to the Leicester game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . Young played as a LB in a back 4 for most of the game and was absolutely horrendous. I can't remember if he got subbed off or not but he was directly at fault for 1 or 2 of their goals.

Like it or not, the wing back role actually suits Young and I think this played a big part in why we ended up playing with a 3-5-2 today. There was no one else viable to play there in a back 4.

1799~~~
Think Rojo was at left back in that game, while Blackett was at fault for most of what went wrong (along with Rojo). Young hasn't actually had a poor performance this season I think.

1800~~~
Young played no part in the Leicester match. Rojo was the one who was playing as the LB, and every defender bar Rafael had a shocker.

1801~~~
Oh. Well my memory must be even worse than I thought it was <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>. I do however remember a game/incident this season where Young w as considerably disappointing as a LB in a back 4. I don't remember for how long he played there, or when it was but I am quite certain it happened.It would also explain why LVG refuses to play a back 4 without Rojo or Shaw fit.

Apart from that one portion of whatever game it was, I agree; he has been quite easily our most consistent outfield player this season.

1802~~~
Yes, I've realised I was completely wrong there. There was a period in one game where he played dreadfully as a LB in a back 4. I can't remember what game it was or for how long he was playing there however.

I just remember thinking to myself at that point 'well this is the last time LVG tries that..' or something along those lines.

1803~~~
MOTM for me. Thought he was our best attacking threat by a long way. Pleased that he has turned it around. Similar to Fellaini, making fans eat their words (me included). Hope he keeps it up. Also agree with everyone, silly to move him when he was absolutely destroying Lowton.

1804~~~
Our best player yesterday, got the better of Lowton every time. Not all of his crosses were good but the one to Falcao is the most important of course.

1805~~~
He needs more support when playing down that left wing I feel. It's clear we were playing most of our attack down that left hand side, so I reckon Mata should try to become more available. Young is great when he plays give-and-go with players, and we get into dangerous positions when he does so. I also think he has an effective cross when he cuts back. It's that sort of low, fast ball that is hard to defend and only requires a little flick on.

1806~~~
He is a different player when he mixes it up and beats the defender on his left. He has the ability to do this but has only done it recently and not at all in the last 2 seasons.

He was our best player against villa until being strangely switched to the right.

1807~~~
Just seen an Opta stat about him. That was his second assist in his last 39 appearances. Holy crap, that's a poor return.

1808~~~
I’m not a big fan of him, even when he played very well when he came, but we have to say that he’s been good this year.

But if Ashley Young is our best player, it’s that our team is very poor to be honest

1809~~~
i am surprised that he was MOTM for so many people, i thought he was frustrating to watch most of the time with his crossing. Ok he tried something, but his crossing needs to be looked at even if he made an assist. For a winger and someone who was the main man at Aston Villa for years with free kicks and corners, his end product is wasteful. He whips them in randomly and finally with luck it ends up to someone. Shaw is still the no1 for me, hope he is back soon.

1810~~~
I thought he crossing was very good from the left, but very poor from the right after LVG swapped him over. He did get the assist remember, and nearly scored from another dangerous cross that nearly snook in the far corner.

1811~~~
maybe his crosses werent as bad, but my god the last minutes were frustrating when your only weapon is Young whipping them in from the right. I still think he relies on luck if i look at his statistics.

1812~~~
I agree, the crossing at the end of the game seemed very aimless and hit and hope. Nevertheless, he was producing more crosses from his side than di Maria was on the opposite side.

I also think that there is always a little luck involved in these crosses when you're playing against a team that have so many men behind the ball. Your stats can look shite if the men in the box aren't finishing, or excellent if they are - All from the same delivery.

1813~~~
Having another good game today.

1814~~~
Certainly our most creative player in the first half

1815~~~
He'll assist Falcao directly 5 times before this season is out. 

He's the only one who sees his runs.

1816~~~
He's like a whole different player this season, in fine form at the moment.

1817~~~
Ripping those defenders apart again, so happy for him.

1818~~~
It's great. He's been great. Luke who? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1819~~~
When youngs your major outlet you just hope he continues this form. Has put in some good crosses first half

1820~~~
LVG has done an amazing job to transform him back into the player he was in our first season (and at villa). Clearly has the confidence to take on defenders and his crossing has been vastly improved.

Very dangerous on our left flank and he has been stellar in his defending too. Don't see why he couldn't play as a left back in a four man defence. Clearly he is heading that way in his career and its working out fine for him.

1821~~~
He's the man.

1822~~~
I'd like to point out that I always had far more faith in him than either Nani or Valencia and he was always my favourite of the three, and I, for one, am delighted he is proving all the haters wrong.

<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1823~~~
Deserved atleast 1 assist. Falcao should be doing better from the two peach crosses he got.

1824~~~
Gotta feel a bit sorry for Young today, he keeps putting in great crosses, and the strikers keep missing them.

1825~~~
He just looks like he's enjoying his football again, real confidence in his play.

1826~~~
10/10 today

1827~~~
Lionel Messi is a black man.

1828~~~
I think its important to remember performances like this, where his stats wont show any goals or assists but he's been fantastic in all aspects of his game.

1829~~~
He's been amazing. I'm not sure if Shaw should automatically play ahead of him when he comes back from injury now.

1830~~~
Should've had two or three assists today.

1831~~~
Should of had at least 2 assists today, just been a great wing back for us so far.

Smashley>Lahm and Alaba.
<span style="color: #ffffff">bite</span>

1832~~~
Most improved player this season easily.

1833~~~
Crossing was very good today, and on another day Falcao might have had two goals from it. And on another day, he probably will.

1834~~~
Top top performance. Looks like a different player altogether. Superb stuff. Could easily have had 2-3 assists.

1835~~~
I have to admit that Young has been very good of late. I don't see any justification in dropping him any time soon.

1836~~~
Growing in confidence from game to game, some really tricky play out on the left today, like suddenly he has more ideas than cutting inside and whipping it in.

1837~~~
Some substantial progress.

I guess this is the result of not being injured all the time.

1838~~~
Full of confidence

I'm reminded of Van Gaal's comment in the press conference that if Ashley Young hadn't made the cross then Falcao wouldn't have made the header at Villa Park. Young knows his job and has the confidence of his "trainer-coach".

1839~~~
How is he putting in all these really good performances? Very good again today.

1840~~~
Spot on, if a player has got one trick but is very good at it, he should abuse it like Robben for instance. However for players like Young, variety can only help them confuse their opponents.

1841~~~
This guy knows his philosophy

1842~~~
Did well again, and I am happy to hold my hands up and say I was wrong to completely dismiss Young before this season. He has always had his odd moments and games where he has looked like a world beater, but the WB role seems to actually really suit him, which has perhaps been the surprise of the season so far.

1843~~~
He was fantastic today I thought. Really flourishing under LvG.

1844~~~
A big reason why the 352 is any bit effective.

1845~~~
Laughable that in 2014 people still think Lahm is a white man who plays for Bayern. Talk about rewriting history.

1846~~~
I also have to hold my hands up, I was 100% sure he was finished at this level and wanted us to get rid of him asap. He's been great, and not just the odd performance, his consistency at both ends of the pitch has been impressive. Deserves to keep his place until Shaw proves he's even better.
Don't feel the same way about Valencia though, Rafael did about as much going forwards in his cameo than Valencia in the rest of the 90.

1847~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1848~~~
Another solid performance, tailed off slightly in the second half but was a threat throughout the first and was unlucky not to pick up an assist.

1849~~~
After Rooney, I thought he was our 2nd best player today

1850~~~
Ye, this. Another good performance from Young today. He's really growing into the LWB role.

1851~~~
Very impressed with Young in his new role. Have to given him huge credit really as given our issues on each side in defence both he and Valencia have been superb in my eyes.

1852~~~
I will first give credit to van Gaal for the improvements we have seen in players like Young and Valencia.

But yes...credit to the players for applying themselves....

1853~~~
Don't think this is anything we haven't seen from him in the past. It's consistency that's a novelty.

1854~~~
And he certainly does. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1855~~~
2nd best palyer.today??

Amazing transformation under Van Gall

1856~~~
Did well. I do think he needs to mix up the type of delivery he finishes his attack with...the cut back and right foot curler won't always work. But credit where it's due, he easily could've been told to pack his bags this summer.

1857~~~
When bird sat in his mouth, he must' ve thought "Hmm, does this my performance taste like?". 
It was really a wake up call. Thanks bird.

1858~~~
Absolutely pleased for him. One of the few players who genuinely <span style="text-decoration: underline">look</span> proud/ecstatic to be at United. He's defending like a seasoned-defender <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Keep going Young!

1859~~~
Seems to have finally put that penalty miss again Italy and 2 seasons of being shit behind him. There's always been a good footballer in him.

1860~~~
He is fast becoming our most influential footballer at the moment outside of Rooney. I'd dread to think how static this side would look if Young wasn't being brave and taking players on... alot of responsibility in this system falls on his shoulders and he is thriving on it.

1861~~~
Worst bit is he's actually playing better than shaw was <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I love shaw

1862~~~
Sell Shaw play Young. Seriously though, it's amazing what confidence can do, he was going past players for fun at times.

1863~~~
LVG has worked miracles on him. Looks like the player we signed from Aston Villa again. There's pace, threat and variety in his play. Amazing how he's become our creative outlet despite all the other quality players we have. Everything worthwhile was coming from that left wing today and mainly thanks to him. I still don't like seeing that 3-5-2 but he's making himself an expert at LWB and should be keeping his place on merit.

1864~~~
Not missing Shaw at all with him being consistently good. He's full of confidence and he finally gets the praise from the fans instead of the boos at OT.

1865~~~
Fair fecks to him, he's carved out a niche for himself in LVGs 352. 

I'd still rather we fecked off the formation and benched him though, but the point remains he's having a good season. Unlucky not to get a couple of assists today. Great crossing.

1866~~~
Interesting to see what happens when Shaw comes back, which isn't too far away it seems.

1867~~~
We will probably change to 4 at the back.

1868~~~
And play Young where, and for who, or back to the bench?

1869~~~
You can see the pride on his face, and he's constantly rallying the troops and shouting commands, you'd think he was captain.

1870~~~
Bench I think, it's what LVG has said. Rafael and Shaw better as FBs, Valencia and Young are good as WBs.

1871~~~
How he didn't end the game with an assist is a mystery to me... feckin' A performance.

1872~~~
Do United have a most improved player award at the end of the season? If not they should do. Fair fecks to the guy, been looking worthy of a spot so far this season which I think exceeds anyone's expectations for him from the summer.

1873~~~
Well worth his spot again today.

Have doubts about his ability to defend against better teams though. Shaw is not an automatic pick when he's fit though

1874~~~
Another good game. Has he been our best player in this 3-5-2? Seems to really flourish in that role and well done to him.

1875~~~
I think he's having fun on the pitch again and that helps him do so well. Should have had an assist at least today, another good performance.

1876~~~
Different players. As a left back, it's not a contest.

1877~~~
Another good performance. I was beginning to think that his confidence would never come back but it has. He's not playing with fear anymore and it's showing big time.

1878~~~
But it's not only attackingly, defensively he has been sound too. Some tackles by him are truly great, glad for the lad.

1879~~~
Proving a LOT of people on here wrong. The sort who were condoning him being booed by his own fans last season. They won't admit it though.

1880~~~
Having an excellent season and deserves huge credit for it.

1881~~~
I had written him off before this season (along with Anderson and fellaini) but he has been absolutely superb for us this season and is a constant threat going forward. If Valencia similarly stepped up his game at RWB we would be giving opposition teams a hell of a time. 
Really excited to see what the 2nd half of the season brings.

1882~~~
Let's be honest, the vast majority of us wanted him gone before pre-season kicked off. Isn't it fortunate none of us have any form of power at United eh? He's been one of our most consistent players, whilst playing in a position he hasn't really played in much before, well done to the guy. Seems like a really nice bloke too so great to see.

1883~~~
Anyone think he can do a job as one of the 2 CMs in the diamond? Valencia did pretty well against Everton and Young's passing range is a lot more impressive.

1884~~~
In this position though, it's not a contest at the moment. And LVG seems to be getting results with this system so hard to see it changing, I would obviously like if it did, but only if we get a right back who's injured for less than half the games

1885~~~
He has been nothing short of fantastic in this past couple of months. Looks like a completely new player and it just goes to show what the right manager can do to a player with ability and I'm really really pleased for him.

1886~~~
I think he will change it. Either way I see shaw playing loads whether we stick with this or change to other formations as I expect us to. He's a top class talwnt.

1887~~~
He was really good during the pre-season tour, but didn't really expect him to do well in the league mainly because I didn't think he'd get many chances plus after he got injured in september, I didn't think he'd get a look in again. Easily the most improved player under LvG, his crossing is getting to how good it was in his Villa days/1st season with us.

1888~~~
The quality of the crosses he has been putting into the box have been fantastic.

1889~~~
He's been fantastic recently, just hope he can keep it up. One of our best players at the moment and anytime we look like scoring, it's usually from his side of the pitch.

1890~~~
His son, named after Blackett, ain't half bad too. Next Rhain Davis, I hear.

1891~~~
Best player again today, causing tons of problems glad he's managed to turned his career around for the better

1892~~~
He's being doubled everytime he receives the ball but still managed to produce something good, in  excellent form at this moment.

1893~~~
what a turnaround from Young, unrecognisable. Long may it continue, has his best period at the club

1894~~~
Can't believe what he has been producing lately week in week out, amazing.

1895~~~
His crossing needs to improve. Not as good as they were against Newcastle.

1896~~~
Mata's been better but yeah, good game again from Young.

1897~~~
Put Shaw in for Falcao and move Young into the left. Spurs left flank looks vulnerable

1898~~~
Our main tormentor in the first half. Amazing what a turnaround he has had.

If I had to nitpick, he could probably put in some better crosses with his left foot. But that's really all there is to fault about his performance so far. Who would have guessed that Ashley Young would command a double team on the left flank. Bizarre.

1899~~~
great game, again....as surprising as it sounds considering what we've been used to with Young...hope he can continue delivering, the form he's in he deserves a place in the squad

1900~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so true.

1901~~~
Please win us a penalty Ashley!

1902~~~
Another good game.

1903~~~
We can't rely on his crossing as much as we have though. The sort of quality we have for crosses in Falcao, RVP and Rooney just should result in more dangerous chances more often. Three of the best strikers in the world all inside the box making runs. Nearly 10 crosses today.

1904~~~
Shocked how sound he is defensively as well.

1905~~~
great apart from that fecking cross out of play in the last minute, absolutely criminal doing that IMO

1906~~~
He's good these days, nothing more to say really.

1907~~~
Is he on the Patrice Evra diet? Running down that left flank all day long. Second full 90 minutes in 2 days as well.

Loving this version of Ashley Young. Defends better than most of our defenders too.

1908~~~
great apart from every cross (bar one) he made. He had like 15 crosses attempted and only one (as far as I can remember) found the target.

So, not great at all.

1909~~~
Tired towards the end but started brilliantly. Another solid game today.

1910~~~
Man of the match for me, was our biggest threat in the entire 1st half and defended brilliantly in the second half and was always ready to charge down on those rare occasions that we got possession of the ball. Don't know how he managed to do that for 90 minutes after playing for 90 minutes just 48 hours earlier.

1911~~~
I think he was average today, his deliveries when in good crossing positions were mostly poor.

1912~~~
The fact that Spurs were so quick to double-up and close him down in the second half speaks volume. He wasn't afforded a lick of space.

1913~~~
I didn't think he was good enough for us at the start of the season and wanted him gone, he's been good defensively but i don't understand the praise he is getting, he constantly gets the ball with acres of space to run into, any half decent winger would have a field day with the likes of Rooney, Mata, Falcao and Rvp as the targets for crosses, he either hits the defender, or when he crosses he doesn't seem to pick anybody out, he just crosses into a dangerous area, if he overhits it like he did today, it turns out to be great shot but thats about it. For a team playing 3-5-2 and the onus is on him to create chances, we will have similar days like today and against Villa away, i thought he was good midweek, but was terrible against Villa and today, the amount of times he gets into that space and either hits the first man or overhits or doesn't pick somebody out is criminal.

1914~~~
Second game in a row this has happened.

1915~~~
Ashley's inside out crosses have never been fully appreciated by his team mates. I dont know whether its the angle of them but his team mates have regularly failed to take advantage of them. They always seem to land in good areas too. This goes back a long way. Im just bringing it up now because he is doing well and has earned our sympathy in this regard.

1916~~~
I don't know what else a winger can do but put the ball into a dangerous area. Not sure what else people expect

1917~~~
This. 
He was fine today, understandably tired towards the end. What a turnaround! Very happy for him.

1918~~~
Was an excellent save away from scoring too.

1919~~~
He was our best player vs Villa so if that's your view its a warped one in my opinion fella.

1920~~~
Too right. He is very impressive at defending one on ones. A very good tackler.

I don't think Shaw or Rafa will waltz back into the side. I think Shaw especially will have a tougher time getting his place back.

I was never a fan of Young from the start, but he's been a great asset in the past couple of months. All credit to him.

1921~~~
It would be great if he can repeat these performances on wing because we could use good left winger if we switch back to 442/4231.

1922~~~
Realistically between him being a shite winger and LVG trying to already fit Mata, Rooney, RVP and Falcao in the team I can't see us switching to wingers any time this season. 

Young has been bang on average defensively, people mistake it for being good because he's not a defender and going forward he's spent most his time back passing when under pressure or whipping in a nothing ball with either foot and hoping for the best.  Grant it he's got confidence the past couple of games and he's actually running at the opponents full backs (which is an impressive improvement) but it usually amounts to another nothing ball. 

His improvements might prolong his career at United but Luke Shaw at 19 is already better than him.

1923~~~
Mate, i actually think even in that match he was frustrating, he was beating their fullback for fun, but then how many times he actually produced a great ball in? , as far as i remember there was one great ball in the first half, and another if you count the assist for the goal Falcao scored, that's his problem in a nutshell, in his good days he will beat their fullback two to three times, and one or two of those crosses will actually be threatning, otherwise most of his crosses will be underhit or overhit.

 The thing is due to shit wingplay from him and Valencia, we are so used to mediocre performances, a winger coverted fullback whose there to maintain width ,and always have ample amount of room to operate delivers two dangerous crosses in a match and we are happy with him, i remember when Di Maria played for us for the first match against Burnley, his first three crosses felt like peeches because there were swung in with pace and and there were towards some player rather than smashing on the shins, and constant overhitting or underhitting of crosses.

1924~~~
Which players out there that soon as they beat their man get a dangerous cross in each time? From dead balls players have difficulty getting in perfect crosses yet you think Young should be getting a dangerous ball in each time he beats his man? That he is putting pressure on defenders and beating his marker quite a bit is what makes the performances really good - instead of him having to go back each time. Even Di Maria, you mentioned one game, his crosses have been far from dangerous each time - even so called top players can't do it each time and Young right now is giving top level performances flat out.

If we could get the same kind of work from the right, we'd be in such great shape going forward.

1925~~~
It does frustrate me a little that he hasn't been able to get more than one assist to his name after half the season but so many of his crosses go into dangerous areas (unlike Valencia on the other side), he can't do much more. Not many players can cross like Beckham. The fact teams are starting to double-up on him is a good indicator of how he is playing. If Shaw is back I would expect a back four soon with Young out on the wing proper, it would be good to get some overlapping runs since Young and Valencia are often isolated out there.

1926~~~
I daresay if Giggs were playing now as a 25 year old there'd be a bunch of moaners on here moaning about his crosses

1927~~~
He has looked very dangerous recently, I want to see him LW for the next game with Shaw at LB.

1928~~~
I don't know why you're comparing him to Shaw. Young is better going forward and has been decent at the back. This is a makeshift position for him, its not his to keep.

1929~~~
I could name several players who need half a yard to put in a great ball in and they aren't even wingers, they try to pick somebody out, Kagawa, Carzola, Silva, Oscar, Bale, Ronaldo, Ribery, Robben, even in our side Rooney, Rvp, ADM, Mata all try to pick somebody out and they are a constant menace against opposition. My problem with him is that, he actually loses the ball alot, he either under or overhits it, and when he is expected to be our creator, and we overload the middle, which allows ample amount of space to our wingbacks, when they fail, we either fail to create chances, thats another reason i don't want the 3-5-2 because except the Attacking midfielder, we are largely dependent on them to create, Burnley and Villa being prime examples.

1930~~~
Because he's not good enough to be an effective winger, he never was for us so the only other position available is one where Shaw is much better at.

1931~~~
Shaw is not a better LWB than Young. 3-5-2 won't last long though, its up to Shaw and Rafael to play well and have a good run of fitness.

1932~~~
Yeah and none of those players put in a great cross, every game, every time they beat their man. For the past several games Ashley Young has been as every bit creating chances as any of those names you've put forward. Fine if he has not been good enough in the past but, your examples of games recently for not putting in a great cross every time even though he has created chances does not hold up.

Credit where credit is due - right now he playing well and we should at least be riding it till someone else can take over and do better if they get their chance or his performances do start to drop

1933~~~
Most of the players you have named are all considered world class. Do you really expect United to have a world class player in every position? Nevermind squad players 

Give young a break ffs, he's playing well and deserves credit not people like you moaning about crossing percentages

1934~~~
Was at the game today and thought he was rubbish. I dont think a single cross found its target and wasn't much of a factor.

Perhaps some of the criticism he came in for last year was unfair, but then maybe some of his current praise is a wee bit over the top too. He's turned into a good back up left back, but now that Shaw is here I hope this signals his return to the bench.

1935~~~
He was one of our better players again.

1936~~~
His left foot crosses have been shite. Whipped in some very good right footed ones though.

1937~~~
Very well put from Barney Ronay I think:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/dec/29/premier-league-ten-talking-points" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/dec/29/premier-league-ten-talking-points</a>

Cracking stat about us not losing with him starting!

1938~~~
My point wasn't about having world class players in every position, my point was when we play 3-5-2, we are dependent on him and Valencia to create most of our chances, and they are given ample amount of space to work with, i feel as a primary attacking outlet he isn't good enough or consistent enough, on his best days he will be able to beat their fullback twice or thrice and still his end product is awful. I would either want us to cease this formation, or play somebody who given that time or space will create far more than he does.

1939~~~
You're saying things that are far from the truth. On his best days, he's created many good scoring chances for our strikers. The few recent matches are a proof to that. Yes he isn't the best wingback we could hope for but he's doing his best.

1940~~~
What I'm finding amazing is how good he's been defensively.

1941~~~
I can't believe people are doubting Young's effectiveness these last few games, he caused absolute havoc for spurs in that first half and should've walked away with at least 2 assists to his name, he's been our best outfield player recently.

1942~~~
He's been absolutely brilliant for a considerable period now. Good on him.

1943~~~
yet the people you stand up as your examples of consistently good crossing/passing are all world class players.

1944~~~
We're not dependant on Valencia or Young to be world class wingers in a 3-5-2. What we do need from them is the energy to get up and down that wing every time, the ability to stretch play and occasionally to create chances for their team mates with pieces of good wing play even if they are nominally outnumbered. Which they do, Young particularly so. All the while defending their flank well enough, excellently in Young's case.

He's basically been nailing the wing back role lately. The problem isn't the wing backs it's our lack of pace in other areas of the team, particularly up front, to stretch teams.

1945~~~
Yesterday Young regularly had two men on him whenever he had the ball and yet more often than not he beat them. one of the big problems 2nd half was that nobody tried to find him and when they did they all just ambled around in the box while spurs defenders swamped him.

1946~~~
I always thought he is a clever little player very adjustable and versatile, I think he found his spot at LB, him and Shaw could be great there for us, I am little concerned with Young's defending but he can learn that and looked solid so far, so I don't see why not to use him in games we need to attack and risk more.(He already palyed there twice right?)Shaw will get better in no time to start ahead of Young but still there is no need for him to start 50 matches per season, Young can also alternate from the right which could be in the end a good back-up option for Rafael and maybe we will buy someone but till that he can do the job even as somebody suggested he is better crossing with his right from the left than from the right but it is a matter of time he will get it right maybe and the case of day he will be having..

1947~~~
Could this confidence he currently feels make him perform better as a LW or will we see the player we used to dislike ?

1948~~~
Our best outfield player since he started playing at left back

1949~~~
I want to see him play in the diamond, I thought Valencia would be a good option, but Youngs defensive game and ability to get up and down makes him a prime candidate

1950~~~
I can't wait to see us play 4-4-2 again with him play left wing and having the likes of Luke Shaw playing behind him. He needs support down that left side, that way he can be even more effective by drawing a man out. He is a completely changed player and I'm very happy to see this. van Gaal showing how fantastic a manager he is by improving not only him, by others like Fellaini too.

1951~~~
I have a feeling it wil be him or Shaw in the team, not both.

1952~~~
Injured - any news?

1953~~~
Couldn't cross the road today but hope his hammy isn't too bad.

1954~~~
Very unfortunate, finally finds some form and now he'll be out for ages. Luckily Shaw is back now.

1955~~~
Affraid we are looking for at least a month out.

1956~~~
As frustrating as another injury is, Young and Valencia's are really perfectly timed as Rafael and Shaw return. Even if LVG didn't want to play with 4 at the back he's surely going to be forced to now.

1957~~~
But after describing the injury as "very bad", the manager told <b>MUTV</b>: "He has a hamstring injury. He's out for many weeks, I think. But I'm not a doctor so we have to wait for tomorrow or the day after tomorrow."


<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Jan/Ashley-Young-injured-in-Manchester-United-draw-at-Stoke.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...jured-in-Manchester-United-draw-at-Stoke.aspx</a>

1958~~~
Pulling up at full speed like that means it's going to be as bad as hamstring injuries get, it's not like he felt it a little tight so stopped himself, that was a proper tear of the muscle.

1959~~~
Gutted, even if not as a starter he is a very good option to have on the bench. Just when he was playing well week after week this happens.

1960~~~
Massive shame for the lad. Probably showing the best form of his United career.

1961~~~
pity that. His best has come when he played on the left.

1962~~~
Young and Valencia injured just as Rafael and Shaw get back. Typical.

1963~~~
Another good performance today, coped well under the circumstances that was he playing right wing back. I hope the injury is not too serious, I think he's been our best player over the festive period.

1964~~~
Real shame for Young to pull a hammy like that. Thats usually 4-6 weeks out, has been in great form as well.

What is it with our squad as soon as one player comes back from injury (Shaw) another one gets injured. When will it end

1965~~~
Awful timing for him and us. A real shame after he'd built up form and fitness.

It was strange seeing him on the right today, he looked so awkward out there. I guess he's been playing on the left for a long time.

1966~~~
On the left in a 3-5-2 formation he has been unplayable. Moving over to the right to accommodate Shaw's return and then getting injured he's been missed. Young as LWB has been the key to making 3-5-2 successful but we need another like him on the right if we are to continue playing 3-5-2.

1967~~~
Under no scenario should we:

A) use a 3-5-2

B) use any system that requires us playing to Young's strengths. This is Manchester United, not Aston Villa. I don't care if he's been tolerable in an utterly shite 3-5-2 setup, Ashley Young is not who this team should be depending on.

1968~~~
Not saying we should do either A or B. Simply pointing out why it seems to have worked. Obviously having two strikers up front who thrive from wide service has also contributed to its success.

1969~~~
Agree with both of them. 

Young is not our saviour.

1970~~~
We shouldn't be building a team around him, but is it just a coincidence that our poor form has coincided with his injury?

1971~~~
Yes I think so. We weren't really playing any better with him in the team, just fortunate to get some good results.

1972~~~
Well you might be right, but I do think that he has been one of the few players who has improved with this formation (in fact, maybe the only player.)

1973~~~
He thrived as a wingback, no doubt. We miss him a bit at the moment, he was good going forward and defensively. If we switch back to 4 defenders, he wont be a starter, but in the 352 he was one of our better players.

1974~~~
I think his performances have been a bit overrated this season. He has one or two dangerous crosses per game (which is a massive improvement on his half) but makes a mess of the rest. We should be looking for more quality in that position, hopefully this position dies with the system now. Defensively he has rarely been troubled, but I can't remember him being really worked by a winger this season. With a four man defence, I can't see him featuring regularly.

1975~~~
Genuine question, did our dip in form start when Ashley young got injured?

1976~~~
Can't believe it's not Lahm, it's Young you knowwww

1977~~~
New contract ahead:

1978~~~
New 4 year 100 odd k contract on the horizon. And people wonder why we can't shift shite.

1979~~~
Oh feck off! Why the feck would we do that??? Why?!

I dont care if he was decent while the rest of the team was utter shite in a 3-5-2, the player is as good of a player as I am as a poster on this board. Im shit, he's worse.

1980~~~
Good, versatile squad player and seems well liked in the group. I don't mind this.

1981~~~
Great to know that we are looking to tie up Young after commiting wing wonder Valencia to a contract prior to the start of this season. He had a good few months after signing for us and has been decent (good relatively, obviously) for us at LWB this season but that's nowhere deserving of an extension. Although I can see why LVG might want to renew his contract based on this season alone but still, it isn't a great move imo.

Surely this is just a rumor and hopefully we get a proper LB for cover and not stick with a makeshift 29 year old there, esp one who is on substantial wages and is suspect in a back 4.

1982~~~
A few good games in a new position must land you a new contract these days..

I'm exaggerating, but this would be a strange move. I'd like to think we're moving towards a more conventional system long-term and he isn't a good enough winger to merit many games here.

1983~~~
I can't see the point, his only good performances for LvG were in a position that we hopefully will never use again.

1984~~~
He's been decent this season but, in my opinion, we should use his good form this season to sell him off for a bit more money, rather than giving him a four year contract. 

When Van Gaal sorts our the balance of the team, assuming he'll play a 433, where will Young play? He's not a left back and he's been below average on the wings for us over the past few years. 

Strange decision.

1985~~~
He won't get anything like £100k. The only reason he was getting that is because he requested his signing on fee be paid weekly over the course of his contract.

1986~~~
You've got to question what our intentions for him and Valencia are though. 

You'd hope that we sort our defence out to a place where we never have to use either of them at fullback/wingback again. 

Which leaves only wing roles that we don't currently employ and both are two or three levels below the quality we require there anyway. Backup to our new wingers? I'd prefer that to be Januzaj and Di Maria (1st choice CM) or if we play a 4-3-3 have Wilson as the RIF.

1987~~~
Our most important player.

1988~~~
Well played Ashley sir. Changed the game when he came on.

1989~~~
MOTM for me. Shook up the game and made our attacks more fluid.

1990~~~
The Aston Villa Young that we all thought we'd signed 4 years ago.

1991~~~
In terms of impact he has to win Man of the Match surely.

1992~~~
He's a really good sub to have. Works his balls off and brings a wee bit of intensity to our game. Out best form this season was when we had him on the left.

1993~~~
All hail the Ash. You can only respect a player who is doing his best 100%

1994~~~
He always wins freekicks the same way, where it looks like he's trying to mount the opposing player before falling face-first over him.

1995~~~
He is fantastic, he can actually put a good cross in.

1996~~~
The only way I can see him getting back in the side is if we go back to the dreaded 3-5-2

To be honest we still look as bad with 4 at the back, so feck it

1997~~~
He played well.

The biggest factor for my money was that his introduction changed our tactical shape to two wing mid.  This opened up the game.  Not slating Ashley or questioning your choice, just noting it was not just the player but the tactical shift that helped us.

1998~~~
It's strange that the Downing and Young we saw at Villa are back.

1999~~~
Why he's been offered a new contract.Much improved player.

2000~~~
Played well again, deserves to start off the back of that in my opinion.

2001~~~
He's turned a page since that bird shat on him hasn't he?

2002~~~
Young 100times better than Falcao,who would have thought that eh?????

2003~~~
Singlehandedly won us the game because he completely changed it when he came on.

2004~~~
Why is he not starting,if he does not start on Saturday,I will not be impressed

2005~~~
Sign him up!

2006~~~
He's too good for us, sell him to Real.

2007~~~
Young coming on gave us something we've desperately lacked in the attacking third: width. Having him (and Di Maria) on the wings gave us so much more room to work with in the middle. Hope we see those two play more often in wide areas because one of the major issues we have in the attacking areas is its all so narrow.

2008~~~
The switch in formation was what changed the game, but he certainly added some great thrust down his flank allowing Di Maria to to his preferred side.

2009~~~
He was very sharp when he came on, good to see that he's up and running again after his injury. What a turnaround, eh!

2010~~~
Has to be said, he has good end-product. Dangerous balls in when he came on. I like the variation too! 

Should start Saturday.

2011~~~
Welcome back Ashely!

2012~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
What a bird eh?!

Seriously, I cannot believe I'm saying this, but he looks a different player. What on earth happened to him?! Was so happy when he came on - something that I never felt for the poor guy during all his years at United….

2013~~~
It's all a bit Alice-in-Wonderland, isn't it? The heart leaping at the site of Ashley stripping off, Fellaini mopping up the adulation of the adoring away support...

2014~~~
He used to be very good in his first season here too actually, it was only in Ferguson's final season and Moyes year here that he looked completely and utterly out of place. I think the fact that van Gaal believes in him has lifted him and he's managed to put in some fine performances this season, out of all players at United he's definitely improved the most over the last 6-7 months and deserves recognition for this.

2015~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2016~~~
Fast becoming one of my favourite players. Was one of our best players before he got injured and had a huge impact yesterday.

2017~~~
He showed some urgency and we played faster and more direct with him on the pitch. He did well for th first goal too

2018~~~
I'm starting to really like Young. He seems like a really good guy in the interviews I've seen and stuff. And similar to Fellaini, the way they have turned their United careers around is commendable. He contributed to us changing the game against Preston. His crossing is probably the best in the team at the minute.

2019~~~
Should be starting on the left in a 4-2-3-1.

2020~~~
Yeah, another good game today. Don't know why he doesn't start to be honest. LVG doesn't seem to reward good form.

2021~~~
He's doing well, he brings danger from his wing. I think it's time that the surprise about these performances are over and to accept that Young is a much improved and new player.

2022~~~
Been our most threatening player in the final third.

2023~~~
Young's issue previously was down to confidence. It was shot to pieces which effected the way he was performing. Pretty clear that LVG has come in and completely changed that which is great to see.

2024~~~
The rest of the players should take note of the intent Young is showing today.

2025~~~
With all the respect for Ash because he's doing great this year and he's playing his lungs out, this phrase (whilst true) sounds fecking ridiculous when you've got Rooney, di Maria and Falcao on the same pitch.

And this situation is happening in yet another match, it's not just one rare moment.

2026~~~
The more he plays, the more he looks like our second best player this season after DDG.

2027~~~
Ashley Reus, been brilliant once again and deserves to start imo.

2028~~~
I said the same thing in the match day thread, mate. It's a joke, without being disrespectful to Young.

2029~~~
It sounds ridiculous but it shouldn't as it's been happening too often this season, Young is one of our best player.

2030~~~
Much more worth his place than Di Maria at the moment, only player that looks like making anything happen.

2031~~~
He's been superb. Was our best player before he got injured as well so this is no surprise.

2032~~~
Fair play to Young. He's turned his career here around and then some. Purposeful, threatening and probably the most confident he's been here since he arrived. More of that, please.

2033~~~
Playing like a proper winger right now.

Fair play to him for turning himself around.

2034~~~
There were questions if his good form was only linked to the wingback position but it's good to see that his confidence can make him play well as a winger too.

2035~~~
A great performance today, He has looked very good this season even in the wing back role earlier in the season, very happy to see.

2036~~~
He doesn't do anything special. He just plays the game at more than 5mph and in the direction of the goal. More of this, please.

2037~~~
Who would have thought a year ago that at the start of March 2015, Young would be our best winger and one of our most consistent performers? Great turn around from him this year. Genuinely good performance all around, not just when comparing him to our shit performances.

2038~~~
<a class="username" data-user="81972, @Empire" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81972/">@Empire</a> what you think?

2039~~~
Nice to see him not constantly looking for the foul but actually wanting to get behind defenders. He looks infinitely more positive than he did the past couple of seasons.

A couple of his outswinging corners were superb. I think we should stick with that, as it's unbelievable the amount of corners that just float right into the goalkeepers hands.

2040~~~
I hated him last season..wanted him out, but bloody hell has he got his confidence back. Just shows how fans really have knee jerk reactions like me. Easily the most improved player this season. Doesn't even dive anymore...

2041~~~
Our best attacker today by a country mile

2042~~~
Great stuff from him again. He really is flourishing under van Gaal. I just hope he stays fit for the rest of the season now, we need a Young in this form if we want to get a top 4 spot.

2043~~~
Really unlucky not to score, denied by O'Shea off the line. He was a really creative outlet for us on the left.

2044~~~
Can't be said enough - he deserves so much credit for turning his United career around. Everyone wanted him gone and he got lots of abuse but he's knuckled down and earned his place. The confidence in his game is obvious now and we're better off for it.

2045~~~
Good game from him today, constantly looked a throat and helped out Rojo with the defensive duties on the left flank.

2046~~~
It wasn't knee jerk, in fairness, as he was legitimately terrible. He should thank his lucky stars he wasn't out on his arse in the summer, but since then his improvement has been terrific and he deserves all the plaudits he's receiving.

2047~~~
He's always been a good player. His disastrous euro 2012 destroyed his confidence then the Moyes era.

When he switches it up and goes left to get crosses in it make shim such a more threatening player. 

Happy for him.

2048~~~
Impressive, most impressive. He's now taking on his man again and looks capable of running with the ball. He also looks twice as fast as last season; probably more a sign of confidence than physical ability.

2049~~~
Loved him at Villa, still love him.

2050~~~
Yep, some good performances in the summer pre season saved his career here but credit where it's due, he's grabbed the opportunity and deserves to be playing for us now.

2051~~~
Firstly I've been saying we need Young in the team for weeks, it's a side that lacks balance and one of the reasons for that is because of the lack of pace and Young provides that. Louis van Gaal has also shown his ability to improve players, Young along with the likes of Fellaini and Valencia have performed much better this season than under Moyes.

Young has been poor in the past couple of seasons but with Louis van Gaal's help and his own determination he has done enough to get a stating place for the next few games.

I'm not sure why you have tagged me in this post, it's one match since his return, but then again you might be of the opinion a player need only perform well in one game to be considered 'good'. Let's give him a run in the team and see what he can do, but as Louis van Gaal says the team is more important than the player, most important are results irrespective of who plays.

Your observations that Young was a good player last season I still disagree with completely, for instance look at his desire to cross on his left this season (he has added to his game), he is more unpredictable and that's not surprising since Louis van Gaal talks about the importance of a player being two footed and so likely he planned that training for Young.

As for your other assertion that Cleverley was good last season, I disagree and thought he was poor but I think it's a shame we let him go, he is another player that might have improved had he been here and Nani too.

That's the difference between a manager like Louis van Gaal and David Moyes (no offence intended, I know how much respect you have for the latter). Had Moyes still been in charge then Ashley Young would not (in my opinion) perform like he has done in Louis van Gaal's system (for one start since his return (against relegation threatened Sunderland who were reduced to 10 men), which isn't really United standard, we want consistency over ten or more matches so again not sure why you tagged me now...).

I also think in the summer we need to look at getting better wingers in, currently we are looking to scrape top four but if the championship is our objective then we must be looking to sign players like Depay and Reus. Moving forward at best he is a squad player but even then at 120k per week probably not worth that, hopefully he will agree to a pay cut.

(btw - I completely forgot about you, nice to know you remember me though, very respectful of you).

2052~~~
Another great performance by him, outclassed Di Maria comfortably.

2053~~~
Like him a lot, he will be very valuable player for us this and upcoming seasons, can numerous positions. Use him as a winger and when he drops in form play him as fullback, I also think he could play as 8 if needed but right now there is no need for him to play there as Herrera is bossing it. Shame Smashley didn't score, would be happy for him..

2054~~~
MotM for me. Everyone hated him last year, but fair play to him, he has really turned it around.

2055~~~
He's done brilliantly to turn things around. Didn't see it coming at all but it's a most welcome surprise. He is so threatening when he cuts inside on his right foot at the edge of the area, I almost expect it to result in a good shot on target every time.

2056~~~
Great that we have an genuine wide threat in form. Smashley just needs to bless us with one of his trademark goals where he cuts in on his right.

2057~~~
He was very good today, defo one of our top two performers. Massive respect for how he has turned his United career around.

2058~~~
Amazing it took him that long to turn his United career around and I have never been a fan of his, but my God has he turned it around. All credit to him (and LvG in this case tbf).

2059~~~
It wasn't kneejerk at all because he was terrible in the last couple of years but he deserves credit for turning it around under LVG. He has added some variations to his play like the left footed cross, he is taking players on again and has cut out the diving. Besides offering a genuine wide threat he also works hard defensively which helps with the balance of the side. I hope he kicks on and finishes the season strongly, we need him to.

2060~~~
I can't really express how impressed I am by Young's turnaround - he's been very good for us this season. Maybe the case of his should be a lesson for us in terms of how we react to players going through a bad patch.

2061~~~
Just goes to show how little most of us know about football. Maybe if we are a little more patient with other players, they might come good too?

2062~~~
I think the indicator as to his mental state is whether he is willing to take the ball wide instead of only cutting in from the left.  When things started to go badly for him under Fergie and Moyes, cutting in was plan A, B, and C for Young.  He was cutting in almost exclusively early this season, although he was putting in good performances.  It wasn't until late November/early December that he started regularly taking whatever option the opposition fullback gave him and I don't think it was a coincidence that his form went up another level.  

I'm glad I was wrong about him.  I didn't see this coming from him, because he looked absolutely broken after the last two years.

2063~~~
Back to the player I hoped we got from Villa. Happy he hasn't lost form from the Injury he sustained last month. 

Everytime he's on the ball in the final third I think a chance will be created. He destroyed their right back. He mixed it up which is good as you never know if he's gonna cut in, run down the flank or even both at once. Really impressed with his improvement. Will be useful for the next couple games.

2064~~~
I'm genuinely happy for him, he always gave everything on the pitch and his lack confidence was evident, but it was still infuriating to witness.

2065~~~
Exactly this. This is the Young who was such a huge attacking threat at Aston Villa, and now we can see why Sir Alex spent the money that he did on Young.

Having said that, though, I'm not sure he has the quality to be a regular starting winger in our team for the long run. I even think Sir Alex saw it that way in the summer of 2012 when he was going after Hazard and then Lucas. Still, though, he is an excellent squad option, and his improvement on his left foot makes him even more dangerous now as he'll be tough to deal with outside and inside.

His ball control is still not good enough, but his quickness, directness, movement, and good deliveries make him a good wide player and someone we can look to in the squad.

2066~~~
I am so so so pleased with his performances this season, for us and for him. He's been brilliant.

2067~~~
He had a good game today, one of the most improved performers under van Gaal by far. Extremely unlucky not to score.

2068~~~
Played very well. I still think he should be one of the best players on a slightly lower side in the table, starting at LW and hitting crosses every week, but he's done enough that it's tough to argue against this being our best lineup right now:


-----Rooney------
Young-Mata-DiMaria
------Herrera-
----Blind--------
Shaw----------RB
---Rojo-Smalling
------De Gea----

And in certain tougher games, maybe Mata out and Carrick or Di Maria central and good lord we still need another wide attacker.

2069~~~
Still eager to see how long this lasts for. He's only played 13 league games this season too.

2070~~~
Deserves to be commended for how he has turned his United career around. Hopefully it continues. Is one of our best players at the moment (if not the best).

2071~~~
Looks like i was right when i posted this in January. Ever since coming back from injury we look much better in attack.

2072~~~
Good performance today. When at his best, he's always disruptive and unsettling to this opposition.

2073~~~
He looks like he's been practicing going down the line and crossing on his left foot which is good. He drives to the byline with much more confidence and purpose which subsequently gives him more space to whip a cross in when he cuts back onto his right.

2074~~~
He's really turned it around. Was a real danger in the match, sadly nobody was on the same page as him.

2075~~~
Credit to him for the way he has turned it around.

2076~~~
The only player in the team that can consistently take on and beat players.

2077~~~
I've always thought he's been a decent/good performer for us since he joined. His injury record has been abysmal since he joined us though (what a surprise), and he generally struggled coming back from injury. Especially as you can't get any run of games because of the competition at the club.

Most of the abuse he got last season was for being chosen over Kagawa.

2078~~~
We should've had that pigeon shit in his mouth ages ago. 

Credit to young. Should be one of the first names on the team sheet these days.

2079~~~
Should win player of the season for me.  Everyone wanted him out but the way he has turned his career here around is astonishing - from zero to hero.

2080~~~
You can just admit you were wrong you know. I'm wrong all the time. No one would think any less of you.

2081~~~
I really like him. One of several players proving a lot of people wrong. 

Man of the match for the fifth or sixth time this season.

2082~~~
Hang on you still think Young was a good player last season? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You really need to let that go, especially your views on Moyes, I do remember recently you starting a new Moyes vs Louis van Gaal thread that was closed down before I even had a chance to reply!!!

I think you are showing Louis van Gaal disrespect, if you cannot see the difference between the player this season and the one of the last couple then you need to observe more closely.

You need to accept how important this current manager has been to getting Young to perform and furthermore one good game as a left winger isn't the level of consistency we expect and finally if we are to compete for the title we need young wingers like Depay and those at the top of their game like Reus.

I am wrong sometimes, I think everybody is wrong sometimes, look at the errors made by Louis van Gaal this season but on this I'm not wrong, last season Young was awful, the work under Louis van Gaal does not validate his performances under Moyes, it's crazy to think that.

Poor effort of "I told you he was good under Moyes" by you, perhaps when he moves to Sociedad and performs consistently then things might be different.

2083~~~
He could be key between now and the end of the season but honestly he isn't setting the world on fire, he isn't getting many assists or scoring many goals, he is playing as we would expect a starting United player to play like.

That basically means he looks quality because he is good in a poor team but we want all players to play good so Young's level yesterday isn't the exception. Januzaj was also good, Herrera too, imagine everybody like that and then the odd player that is on fire?

I'm even tempted in the next match to suggest we give Angel di Maria one more chance before Spurs however play 4-3-3 with Blind anchor, Herrera RCM and Di Maria LCM and then Young LW, Adnan RW, Rooney striker.

2084~~~
My player of the season

2085~~~
He's our most confident player, which is weird, but then it's not, because he also seems to be amazing.

2086~~~
I hope Young's revival shows some of impatient and fickle fans the value being patient and giving people time, instead of wanting RVP out, Falcao out, Di Maria out, LVG out, etc.

2087~~~
heh? he's been here 4 fuc4ing seasons mostly disapointing or injured. he's playing ok but he's not and never was worth 18m quid! if ADM plays like he has after 4 yrs and 60m quid you'll be singing a different tune and falcao has been sh1t and won't be here next season.

2088~~~
Really enjoying watching him play at the moment. He's full of confidence and always looks to try something. Has a lot of variation in how he attacks as well which is always fun to watch. Night and day from what we saw last season.

2089~~~
A commentator said the other day that it's over a year since he last scored. That was kind of surprising. He looked like a real goal threat in his debut season and scored some crackers too. Come agonisingly close a few times this season. Has to be due one soon.

2090~~~
It's refreshing to watch a United player actually playing with confidence, and seemingly has the balls to take on defenders.

2091~~~
I think his last goal was that belter against Cardiff at home, wouldn't hurt to see him try more of that.

2092~~~
He try a right foot curler against Sunderland but it went a bit wide. Plus he was unlucky to hit the crossbar after it was deflected off the defender, so hopefully he'll bag one soon.

2093~~~
In this transfer market he was worth what we paid for him. And he's playing much better than ok. He's been our best outfield player this season.

2094~~~
if anything let him take corners, we looked much more dangerous with him crossing the ball to the box than anyone else. Good pace and whip on the cross. We should start to score some goals from these situations more. It's been really bellow par since Van Persie stopped taking them. We have got players to finish it but not quite the delivery

2095~~~
You're joking, right? Rooney and Blind have been far better than him, while De Gea has been several levels above any United player this season. If we get UCL football, we'll get because of De Gea, and regardless of that, he should win player of the season.

Young has dramatically improved but people are making him like he's new Cruyff. He's still a very average player and at best, squad player for a team like United.

2096~~~
it wasn't this transfer market , he wasn't and isn't worth half 18m. he's playing ok not much better than that which is like many in the side this season and blind , and rojo just from the group of the FNG's are better than he's been.

2097~~~
Bullshit. You can barely get a Championship player for £9m. He's been far better than Rojo. It's not even close really.

2098~~~
so then blind IYO has been better , and would you pay 9m for him? his best game was his first match v le arse in his first yr. he's been a bit sh1t for his time at the club.

2099~~~
Yes in fairness De Gea is the obvious choice, I actually completely forgot about him when I wrote this!!

2100~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2101~~~
I don't see you getting better players for less than 9m these days. Blind has been one of our best players so it would be pretty close between them. Both have been far better Rojo. As has Chris Smalling for that matter.

2102~~~
Whilst he's played well I really hope we don't do the stupid thing and offer him a new contract.

Watch and see us give him a 4 year deal no doubt. Average player having a good season.

2103~~~
You just know he's going to get a new contract and then turn to shit again.

2104~~~
Why? He's been great since the moment Van Gaal took over. Was awful under Moyes (though he did have a good run that one time), but who wasn't? It's not like he was awful under Fergie. He had some good runs of form, some poor runs of form, but was a decent squad player when you look back. Think it's a bit unfounded to suggest he's only playing like this so he gets a new contract.

2105~~~
9m is what villa paid for an average young united paid 18m. mediocre player for far too much money and united have that in spades unfortunately. he looks ok this season because united look sh1t. mostly he's just been sh1t.

2106~~~
That's the thing about Young. He's close to being good but he really isn't that good. Against Sunderland he had dangerous crosses but only one ball was close to his man. Di Maria has been shit apparently but Young doesn't come close to being as effective. In defense Valencia has been a lot better. Everything about him screams squad player.

He's been good as a wing back. That's clear. But he doesn't create much. He creates a hassle for full backs but his end product is lacking.

2107~~~
People are getting way ahead of themselves with the praise, last few seasons we've been shitting all over the guy. 

He has done well so fair enough, maybe he has earned a spot in the team this season but in an ideal world he shouldnt start for Manchester United.

2108~~~
F***ing ell cheer up.

2109~~~
So who should? Seeing as he was the best player on the pitch last Saturday?

2110~~~
Well ideally di Maria would be in form and Januzaj could start. Also in the summer I would like for us to get a winger.

2111~~~
In this kind of form he should start and rightly so.

2112~~~
You're welcome to list the better players you can get for £9M.

2113~~~
Coutinho......just him

2114~~~
Very happy for the guy that he is doing so well. Hopefully he becomes more consistent because he is a very good option to have in the squad.

2115~~~
Praise where its due. I think he's been arguably our best player this season. The injury he suffered impacted the way we played we were not creating many chances. I hope he signs a new contract. We need creative players who can get the ball in the box.

2116~~~
I never thought I'd want him to start for us. But now I do, weird.

2117~~~
It's amazing what van Gaal has done to him. Young looks completely rejuvenated this season.

2118~~~
Exactly. The team has struggled so much and we have a player who is finally playing to his potential yet he's still criticised.

2119~~~
Now, I wouldn't really use stats to determine how good a player has been in creating chances, but since I don't have the time to watch every single match and determine Young's and others' creative outputs, I've checked WhoScored.com's Key Passes stats, and Young's 1.2 key passes per game is up there with most full backs. Keep in mind that the players have played at quite a slow, sluggish pace for much of the season as well, and this statistic isn't too shabby. I think this was his 2nd or 3rd time that he's played as a winger as well, so considering that he hasn't really had much attacking freedom, his 1.2 key passes per game isn't that bad. This goes in line with how Young has improved, overall. Last season, he played as a left winger and only registered 0.8 key passes per game.

If he doesn't seem to get his man much, it's because our slow approach allows the opposition to organise themselves. This means that Young can't just aim for the man; rather, he has to aim for a dangerous area and hope for someone to enter it. The only way you can really aim for the man is if the defence isn't organised inside the box. Recently, against Sunderland, we played at a faster pace, and Young was able to create more chances as well due to O'Shea and Brown having less time to settle themselves at the back.

2120~~~
Whoever has been crossing the ball from the wing (whether it's a full back, CM when ADM was on good earlier in the season or even a winger when we play with them), we always have a pb finding the strikers inside the box due to that pb you mentioned.

2121~~~
Yup, and it's why we seemed to get worse after losing to Barcelona at the 2009 Champions League final: we started playing slower than we used to. Good wide play is almost impossible if you play at a slow pace. Look at how Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid have made their wide play effective: with a fast-paced build up and aggressive attacking.

2122~~~
18m for a PL proven english player is not exactly a bad deal. Yes he was poor under Moyes (like everyone else), but if he keeps this up he is well worth that kind of money.

Some people still believe we should buy Falcao, and he is 3 times as expensive and hasnt done anything other than fall over all season

2123~~~
arguably the most improved player under LVG so far.

i am sure he is one of the first name in LVG's mind for his team against newcastle.

2124~~~
Fans eh......where are the haters now?

2125~~~
If he's not then I have more questions over LVG's sanity then I thought...

2126~~~
Ashley Young the wing back. Good. 

Ashley Young the winner. Terribly average and ineffective.

2127~~~
Yay!

2128~~~
2 point Young. Football can be a Krul game.

2129~~~
Massive, Massive, Massive goal.....if anyone deserves it ..it's Mr.Young...has been a revelation recently

2130~~~
Poor besides the goal it has to be said.

2131~~~
Deserved goal. (for him)

2132~~~
Congratulations to Young. 2 (mostly) open goals and he got there in the end.

2133~~~
In Smashley we trust.

2134~~~
He should have scored earlier on when he took about five minutes to react to a deflection, but good on him for the one he did score.

2135~~~
I'm happy he got a goal

2136~~~
Someone make that threadmark a bit too early?

Should have done better on the earlier chance where he should have passed to Rooney but at least he scored the later one. Not a great game but still better than a good few other players.

2137~~~
I love this guy. Love him.

2138~~~
Honestly felt he was one of our better players tonight. Not brilliant, but had a fairly good game, some decent moments and obviously managed to get the goal. His control of the ball before Rooney missed his first sitter was lovely.

2139~~~
Not much end product, but he works harder than everyone else on the pitch. Revelation under van Gaal and won us 3 huge points today. Hopefully it gets him really going offensively now knowing his goal won the game.

Love the passion in the celebration too, so bloody loud!

2140~~~
Not as good as he was the other day but but still looked dangerous. The goal will only help his confidence.

2141~~~
Pretty rubbish apart from the goal. Oh well.

2142~~~
I thought he was pretty frustrating. Started okay but got worse as it went on imo. Obviously missed a sitter and put in some really bad crosses then too.

2143~~~
Probably his Worst performance in recent times but he won us the game so fair fecks to him

2144~~~
Personally felt he actually managed to offer a decent bit here and there in a game where we really weren't creating all that much, despite looking more likely to score. Not a standout performance or anything, but fairly decent.

2145~~~
Felt it was his worst game and gets the winner, oh well!

2146~~~
Agreed, poorest he's been in a while but that first touch and finish was quality and vital to our top 4 chances.

2147~~~
Besides the goal, he didn't do enough. Too one dimensional as well.... feck it, he scored

2148~~~
Didn't have a great game but he deserved a goal after his recent performances, happy for him.

2149~~~
Was more like Young of old (bad and ineffective) but he scored the goal which probably is the most important goal we have scored this season.

2150~~~
Won us the game. Go on lad. Everyone who wanted him gone eating their words!

2151~~~
He's actually a better full back, then he is a winger <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Great finish for the goal. Could easily have panicked.

2152~~~

2153~~~
Player of the season, and he was the player of Pre-Season too

2154~~~
Has been good (whether it be performances or todays goal) since that bird "pooped" in his mouth. More of our players need bird poop. Bird poop for all.

2155~~~
Playing with huge confidence, major goal.

2156~~~
Does someone have a vine or something of his celebration? He screamed his lungs out, amazing to see. Not his best game but still won us 3 points together with Dave. Great stuff.

2157~~~
Well done, has really turned his career around at the club and deserves credit for it.

2158~~~
Didn't do much other than the goal. Happy for him, he was on his just on his way out and he managed to turn it around this season.

2159~~~
Agree with others that he was not that good, but still won us the game in the end so oh well.

2160~~~
What the bloody feck is Krul doing?

2161~~~
Classy guy is Ashley.

2162~~~
Copying his hero...

2163~~~
I think he is our only player to have improved under LVG...really surprised me with this seasons performances.

2164~~~
Smashley can do no wrong this season. Good on him too, I'm pleased for him. He's a good player.

2165~~~
"Man Utd have won all seven of their <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BPL?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#BPL</a> matches that <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/youngy18" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@youngy18</a> has scored in <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NEWMUN?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#NEWMUN</a> "

2011/12 - Arsenal 8-2, Spurs 3-1, Blackburn 2-0, Swansea 2-0
2012/13 - N/A
2013/14 - West Ham 3-1, Cardiff 2-0
2014/15 - Newcastle 1-0

I didn't expect him to have scored in that little amount of games.

2166~~~
Hopefully the goal will give him more confidence playing further forward again. Not scoring up til now this season isn't really an issue as a wing-back, but you would expect a confident attacking player to hit that earlier chance he had today first time.

2167~~~
Yeah his goalscoring record for us is terrible, considering he used to hit 10 goals a season for Villa and you usually expect players to have more chances and score more goals at a bigger club. No slight on his form this season though.

2168~~~
A lot of passion in that celebration. Expecting him to score a hattrick of wondergoals vs Arsenal now, all 25 yard curlers into the top corner.

2169~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2170~~~
Delighted for him, and happy he's won so many of you back over.

2171~~~
Could and probably should have scored alot earlier, very happy with his performance.

2172~~~
Important contributor to the team; Still want him sold this summer while his value is higher than it will ever be again.

2173~~~
Loved his celebration. Played for the shirt. cant ask for more.

2174~~~
It won't be that high, isn't he soon to be entering into the final year of his contract?

Anyway, don't see him being sold. He's been one of the best performers under van Gaal.

2175~~~
Ashley young (and fellaini) have really proved me wrong this season with their performances.
Young was fantastic tonight, always running at defenders, whipping in crosses And showed real passion.

If someone told me last season that young would be out performing Di Maria Id have laughed them out of the room.

Well played young!

2176~~~
It would not be a great idea to sell him, at the very least next season he should be our super sub.

2177~~~

2178~~~
Expires in 2016, yes. 

Ideally:
If we can get 6-8 million and his wages off, I think it's worth it. We should buy a 3rd fullback who can play both sides to go with Rafael and Shaw and I'd rather see Nani and a year older Januzaj getting minutes out wide. 

Reality:
He's done very well under LVG and we won't sell him. We'll sell Rafael and the fullbacks will be Shaw, RB we buy, Valencia and Young.

2179~~~
Loved seeing that passion.

2180~~~
I've been his biggest critic here, but I absolutely loved to see the passion he had after that goal. I'm won over. Not his best game today but he played well and has been solid all season.

2181~~~
I feel the same way, I wanted him gone last season but he has proved me wrong and I couldn't be happier for him.

2182~~~
Why get rid of a player who clearly loves and plays full of passion for the club? Plus, why get rid of someone who's actually performing well under our new manager.

I hope he stays.

2183~~~
I was critical of him last season but never wanted him gone really. I'm very happy that he's recapturing his best form for us now. Excellent stuff.

2184~~~
This wasn't a good game from him today. The fact that he was double-teamed for much of the match made it difficult for him, but his deliveries into the box weren't that great today. Still, though, his defensive work wasn't that bad at the end, and he did get a crucial winner for us.

2185~~~
He put Di Maria to shame. Very tricky player our Ashley. He beat two players at one point but his final delivery was shit. He's the only player we have that can take on and beat players.

2186~~~
He's not the only one for sure. Januzaj gave Gutierrez and van Aanholt a tough time, and di Maria still has the capability to beat players even if he hasn't demonstrated that recently, so it's not like Young's the only one who can do it.

I wouldn't say he was comfortably better than di Maria. He was less sloppy, yes, but he wasn't more dangerous than di Maria was in this match unlike against Sunderland. However, he did score the winner, so he does get credit for that.

2187~~~
Januzaj was worse than Di Maria IMO. Failed to impact the game despite his best efforts. He's just not the the free gliding player he was last season.

2188~~~
He was piss yesterday what game were you watching? Excellent stuff?? Saying that he's done well off late to turn opinion around but sums up where we are at when we have Young and Adnan as our wingers compared to Chelsea Hazard and Willian! Frightening drop off!

2189~~~
Agreed, Januzaj did well the match before but last night he was completely dog shite.

2190~~~
Yup, missed that this season to be fair. Ash's a top guy, proved that numerous times with different charity things, meeting fans at matches where he didn't play and all that shit, really happy to see this turnaround for him this season.

2191~~~
Great celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He really is a Utd player.

That day, I felt a lot of respect towards him.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Ashley Young is spotted among fans during the Manchester United victory over Newcastle. </b></span>

Manchester United Winger Ashley Young who is currently recovering from a knee injury was spotted among fans during the Manchester vs Newcastle game Sunday. Young who has not featured for Manchester since August and could be out of action till next month made the surprising decision to test his recuperating legs by climbing the upper tier of St Jame's Park to watch the match with travelling fans in a disguise. Trying to keep a low profile he was dressed in a long coat with a hood pulled over his face, but even with all the efforts made to avoid attention from Red Devils travelling fans, he was soon found out and swamped by fans who demanded autographs and took pictures of the player.

2192~~~
Wait i think you're onto something here mate.

2193~~~
that guy's face in the second pic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2194~~~
He was poor apart from the goal, hope that goal gave him a confidence boost.

2195~~~
I like him and I'm happy for him that he's having a better time of things this season but I still think we should sell him at the end of the season.

He'll turn 30 before this season is over. For a wide player that is pretty old, the pace will inevitably start to go.

2196~~~
Good goal and decent performance but needs to have more and better end product. Too often he was in a decent position but the final ball was lacking.

2197~~~
Great to see him turn it around and grab a goal. However, still much prefer him on the right. I think he would benefit the play far more. Suits van Gaal perfectly though.

2198~~~
He has had a very good season, and credit to him. He has proved himself useful to the squad, which is a massive improvement on last season.

I still think it goes without saying that he is not of requisite quality to be our regular winger that takes us to the pinnacle. Although to be fair for him, not every team needs 11 world-beaters, and the fact is, we paid £60m to have one on the other wing, and just one was enough when that person was Ronaldo. Young could feasibly take up a Park Ji-Sung sort of role, but that would require Di Maria to get a lot closer to a Ronaldo sort of impact that he has done.

2199~~~
Not even in top 3 players this year. As always, Caf is overreacting and I wouldn't be surprised that when he next has two bad performances people will want him out again.

As for player of the season, I don't know how anyone can see past De Gea. He has saved us repeatedly this season (including on yesterday's match when he was by a distance our best player again).

2200~~~
I have him 2nd, only behind DDG.

2201~~~
He's the only player in the whole fecking squad who can actually cross a ball

2202~~~
Di Maria puts in brilliant crosses. His form hasn't been great but his delivery from wide areas is not one of his faults.

2203~~~
There is no way that he has been better than Rooney and Blind (Di Maria, Mata and Herrera have been easily beter than him too). Heck, for most of the season he hasn't been even a starter (if I am not mistaken he has started only 13 games or so). He has a single goal and no assists.

He has certainly been the most improved player, but not near the best overall player. I think that him improving this much has been a total (pleasent) surprise and so people are exageratting his actual performances.

2204~~~
Young has played well pretty much every single time he's played for us this season. The fact that yesterday was one of his poorer games, and yet he still scored, says a lot. In contrast Di Maria has been absolute garbage for about half a season, Herrera has been about as good (but played less games), Blind I'd have 3rd - because he's been largely good - though a few games, particularly away from home, he's been really poor (but people are more lenient with him because they like him - which is understandable)... Rooney has the stint in Midfield working against him (Rooney as only a forward would definitely be 2nd), and Mata has disappeared in as many games that he has shown up for (though in general, he makes us play a lot better).

Young has played well almost all the time, and often been excellent. He's the player who has most comfortably adapted to whatever system LVG's been playing, and would have had way more assist if Falcao wasn't a bit shit.

2205~~~
No, to be fair you're correct with that. He does indeed. These two are where that seems to end mind.

2206~~~
And yet he has 14 goals/assists, compared to Young's 3 goals/assists. I agree that Di Maria has been bad for many games, but he has been extremely productive. Same can be said for Mata and Herrera (especially for the later who has been good in pretty much every game and has contributed in a lot of goals and assists). Then RVP who has been bad but then again has won us many points.

Young despite generally being good, hasn't been that productive. I don't see how a winger who has 1 goal and 2 assists can be in consideration for player of the season or anything like that.

For me it is:
1 - 10. De Gea
.............
12. Rooney
13. Blind
14. Di Maria
15. Herrera
16. Mata
17. Van Persie (despite that I have been speaking bad for him this season)
18. Young
19. Fellaini
20. Rojo

Edit: the fact that I have Young and Fellaini in top 10 (top 20 depending on point of view) explains pretty well how much they have improved on my opinion. Last year for example, I would have had those two on top 5 worst performers.

2207~~~
Agree with all of that.

After his last (very good) performance I remember noticing the commentator saying he hadn't scored in over a year and being sure that he would break his duck soon. Kind of mad that he does so in probably his worst individual performance of the season but that's football.

He's definitely been one of our best and most consistent players this season.

2208~~~
Well, Young has played more games as a wingback than a winger, but I digress... Players can have a really good game of football without scoring or assisting. Take the Sunderland game for example - Young was our MOTM, despite not getting either - that doesn't make his performance bad. 

Yes he could be more productive in terms of goals (though generally its not easy for wingbacks to get on the scoresheet) and assists (which he should have more of, but again - we've had many goals come from moves that have started down his side of the pitch, and he would have had more had our strikers not been a bit garbage - he's put numerous dangerous balls in the box across the season) - but football isn't all about assists and goals - its about performances, and as I said, Young has been very good in pretty much every game he's played.

Yeah, Di Maria has a ton of assists - but come on, he's been absolutely atrocious in a lot of games, I don't see how anyone could put him above Young just due to the numbers he's put up.

2209~~~
I generally give a lot of value to goals/assists because at the end of the day they win points for the team. Young yesterday was arguably the worst player until he scored the goal, but the truth is that without that goal we would have won 1 instead of 3 points. So in that aspect - all things considered - he was probably our second best player (after De Gea who kept us in game and then later didn't let Newcastle equalize).

Di Maria has been quite poor for some time, but he has contributed a lot in terms of goals/assists which have won us points. Even yesterday, despite him being poor he made a fantastic pass to Fellaini which should have resulted in a goal, an another fantastic pass to Rooney which ended in a goal but incorrectly rules offside and the pass to Valencia which created a good chance. This has been the story of the second half of the season for him.

Not great, but he's contributing. On an another day he would have had 2 assists on yesterday's performance.

Anyway, regardless of where we put Young he has been a pleasent surprise and has been decent this year.

2210~~~
Does anyone know what Ashley Young looks like with hair?

2211~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.watfordlegends.com/ashley%20young%203.jpg" src="http://www.watfordlegends.com/ashley%20young%203.jpg"/>

Looks more like Dot Rotten.

2212~~~
I was picturing more of a Welbeck fro. That's not nearly as long or as funny as I'd hoped <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2213~~~
You have got to be joking. His success rate with crosses is awful. He cant cross with his left foot and when he does it very very rarely finds a player. 90% of the time he tries to cut in on to his right foot to cross which in turn slows everything down and strikers have to check their runs. As a consequence most of his crosses never hit a player.

2214~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c381/SnowjoeGfx/ashair_zpsg2bun6wh.png" src="http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c381/SnowjoeGfx/ashair_zpsg2bun6wh.png"/>

2215~~~
I've always wondered what Gabrielle was up to these days.

2216~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Now <i>thats</i> what I was hoping for!

2217~~~
Have you been watching United play this season? Ashley Young has cleared the ball off the line, played as a LB,RB,WB,Winger, he has won games for us with his performances, he has scored a winner... i am by no means over-reacting, it is what it is -  DDG is obviously the best player in the team, but when it comes to outfield players - no United player has contributed more to the team than Ashley Young and i say this as someone who was calling for him to be axed prior to our pre-season campaign, "not even top 3 players this year" are you sure? there are three guys in THIS United team that have contributed more to the team THIS season than Ashley Young?

2218~~~
More than three.

Anyway, discussed this with AN! already so I am not planning to repeat myself.

2219~~~
RVP over Young? lol, yeah i think its best we don't elaborate this might take all week

2220~~~
rooney is one , blind is another , and rojo is another. dave the save is POTY. that's 4 so i'd agree with you. RVP has scored goals for wins as has ADM and even falcao has match winners. he got a lucky pass from the keeper and slotted it into an open net. when pressured he smashed it into the keeper. not united quality and never was.

2221~~~
Really giving his all, really trying to create, really trying to get at players when he can. Can't really say anything bad about him at the moment.

2222~~~
Another good positive that I have not seen mentioned too much is that he seems to have cut out the pathetic diving.

2223~~~
Interestingly Van Gaal says on the official site that he sees Young's best position as a wing back.

2224~~~
He does but no one seems to ever reads his crosses, or our movement is terrible. He makes a few excellent far post crosses each game and a good near post one yesterday but there was just nobody there.

I would say he's been our most threatening attacking player this season when he has played.

2225~~~
Yup, he stops diving in the season we need penalties....just our luck

2226~~~
Miguel Delaney has an article up featuring Young: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2333397/resurgence-of-young-a-reflection-of-manchester-united-season" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchest...oung-a-reflection-of-manchester-united-season</a>

2227~~~
Damn, thanks for the reminder. I've been slipping on Dot, massively underrated or as he would say, underestimated. Seems like he is just going to produce now though.

2228~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> You're saying that you would have preferred if he would have continued diving?

2229~~~
Truthfully, I wouldn't mind a nice little dive at Anfield to get us a pen.

2230~~~
Young has been brilliant this year and was instrumental in that run of wins before Christmas that set us up for a top 4 spot. As I remember it, he got injured and we lost the next game didn't we?

Single handedly made the 352 look good.

2231~~~
Playing for his next contract, which hopefully isn't here.

2232~~~
really? brilliant? i hope another manager feels the same way and we off load him for 10m.

2233~~~
I'm not saying i would have preferred him to continue, i'm just saying on the last day of the season when we are tied at 1-1 with Hull city and 5th on the table with 15 minutes to go and Ashley Young somehow manages to trip and fall and get a penalty which Rooney converts with ensures a top 4 spot, I would be able to understand how he could "trip" under such conditions - the human body is too complex to understand, plus we can discuss what happened and condemn/praise his actions in a bar on a tuesday night watching a group stage game away at Olympiakos <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2234~~~
Has anyone ever played Young on the right side of midfield?

2235~~~
If anyone's disputing that Young's been in our top 3 outfield players this season, then that person hasn't seen our matches at all this season. The lad's been a revelation inspite of him not playing in his natural position for most of the season.

2236~~~
He is doing well, there is no doubt about that. However a lot of it has to do with the fact that our standards and our general play is so bad that it isn't too difficult to stand out in our current side.

2237~~~
Not a great game from him tonight but you can't fault his workrate for the team, he helped his fullback out a lot more than Di Maria did.

2238~~~
Surprised the ref didn't try and send him off for kicking out at Ramsey.

2239~~~
So so pointless. Wonder what sir alex was thinking when he got him in.

2240~~~
Nothing worked for him today, could barely get a decent cross in all game.

2241~~~
People are actually criticising him? Seriously? He's done very little wrong this season and has put far more effort in than many of the so called superstars.

2242~~~
I thought he had a good first half. Drew a fair few fouls, won a few corners and put some good balls in. Dropped off in the second half with the rest of the team though.

2243~~~
Quite a few rumours circulating about a possible injury for Young and him being a doubt for the Spurs clash.

Winger Crisis <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2244~~~
Is he injured? We need him on Sunday.

2245~~~
We've still got a couple of relatively unknown wingers called Valencia and Mata.

2246~~~
Ashley Young does actually have a knock according to Physioroom.com, and they don't know what the issue or when he'll return. It's safe to say that this is probably a precautionary diagnosis, and we'll learn more about that in the next press conference.

2247~~~

2248~~~
Very good performance by him today. As people have said, he linked up well with Blind, and was often posing a lot of troubles to Spurs with his runs and crosses.

2249~~~
That was some match, very good link up with Blind (just like with Evra at times).

2250~~~
Wonder if he will get into the Enlgand squad?..would be quite the turn around

2251~~~
Utterly destroyed Walker<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2252~~~
Simply been amazed by Young this season. Probably our best attacker over the course of the entire season.

2253~~~
The triangle of terror between him, Blind and Fellaini demolished Spurs today.

2254~~~
Usually I feel like we dont need Young at left wing because he can do a very similar job from leftback as he did earlier in the season

However, having 2 clever players like Young and Blind together showed today that you can get even more for him when you double up like that, or make it a 3 with some help from a CM like Fellaini

2255~~~
Excellent today. You can tell he's playing with a lot of confidence. Linked up with Blind brilliantly, and was a constant threat down the wing.

2256~~~
Shame about that poor cross when he roasted Walker.

Other than that, very good.

2257~~~
Who is this new signing??????

2258~~~
Young is playing better than Di Maria...who would  have thought that eh?

2259~~~
Most improved player of the season for me without a doubt. He really turned it around and currently seems to be what we all hoped he would be when we signed him. Long may this form continue.

2260~~~
Why not, he's in great form at the moment.

2261~~~
And Fellaini is playing better than Falcao.

Manchester Madness!

2262~~~
This is the Ashley Young that we hoped we were getting a few years ago. Direct in his play, tricky at times and decisive in his passes and crossing (even if they didn't always come off.) I never thought I'd be saying this, but it'll take a lot to displace him from the starting 11 if he continues playing like this.

2263~~~
The triangle of terror. I pulled her when I was at uni in Durham. She gave the best blowjob ever, but when you went to return the favour, she had the thickest great triangle you'd ever seen. I must've lasted about 30 secs before I had to come up for air and write it off.
First lass I ever got three fingers in. Her name was Kathryn and she was Scottish. We labelled her the 'black triangle'.

2264~~~
Absolutely rinsed Kyle Walker time and time again. Another excellent Ashley Young performance.

2265~~~
The only thing he needs to improve is his final ball. He's very often in good positions but then the final ball just isn't coming off.

2266~~~
Ran rings around Walker. Was supported really well by Blind and Fellaini; they owned that side of the pitch.

2267~~~
This. However, his inswinging crosses are often quite dangerous and very good, but yeah, he should improve his crossing from that side given that he often gets into those positions.

2268~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2269~~~
Young and Blind - Sounds like a teen movie title! But they have been terrific together and have a great understanding of the game and each other. Young has definetely assured of a starting place. Just needs to keep injury free. Another brilliant performance

2270~~~
I'm drawing a blank here: who are the wingers for England? I'm guessing Sterling would be one, but who else? I think Young in this form would be a real asset to England.

2271~~~
I believe Welbeck plays as a winger for England, but I could be wrong.

2272~~~
Well I don't think Welbeck is as good as Young on the wing (when Young is in this kind of form.) In any event, Young could make a very handy, veteran option for the team.

2273~~~
young and fellaini. two players the fans desperate to see leaving last summer.

some turnaround for both of them.

2274~~~
Should walk into the team based on his form this season really, even ahead of Sterling. Though Chamberlain is class as well so he probably won't start, would be ridiculous if he didn't get called up though. What a turnaround from him though, from last season being with Fellaini the two most disliked players, to being one of our most consistent performers all season and really, one of the first names on the team sheet.

2275~~~
Definition of "just like a new signing"

2276~~~
Nah, don't want him in the England squad, he doesn't seem to fit, just how it is for some players.

2277~~~
Good tracking back today but didn't offer much in the attack, hopefully the 2 weeks break will allow whatever he strained to heal up.

2278~~~
decent performance, didnt notice him much, but defended well.

2279~~~
Went of injured didn't he?

2280~~~
Offered little going forward but as others say, he was solid in defence. Turning into a Valencia and will be a left back by next season.

... I wrote that as a joke, but maybe it's not?

2281~~~
That interception he made when Valencia slipped was fan-fecking-tastic.... deserves top marks for that. Other than that, one of his quieter games, but again, used the ball nicely and sensibly.

2282~~~
Thought so too but he always walks around like he's got a knock so it's hard to tell.

2283~~~
In truth, Young's attacking contribution this season has been ordinary, just the goal against Newcastle, assist to Falcao at Villa and a few decent crosses. It's his defensive play that has been impressive. Contrast with Zaha who has 3 goals and 2 assists in a similar amount of playing time but is woeful defensively.

2284~~~
Hope he starts ahead of DiMaria, the Argie can't make a 5 yard pass.. Young would be utilized better if stayed on the pitch in the second half I guess, the game was much more open.. hope he's fit for the next game..

2285~~~
Can see the difference when he went off and Di Maria came on, Whilst Di Maria set up the second goal (although that was centrally) and should have assisted a third (for Rooney), Young helped Blind so much that their right side (Sterling) was ineffectual bar the one moment in the first half.

2286~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 

He did pick up a knock though.

2287~~~
Did well off the ball but going forward he offered too little and, as usual, just doesn't have a quality final ball currently

2288~~~
Worked hard for the team and was solid but didn't offer enough going forward. But he's been very good of late and deserved to start.

2289~~~
I'd be intrigued to see him at RB instead of Valencia - I think Di Maria will regain his starting place eventually if he can get a little form going.

2290~~~
Not as good as he was against Spurs, but still give us a pretty solid game.

2291~~~
He works hard, but has zero end product. AdM got an assist, played the ball for the penalty, and should of had another assist for the Rooney pass, and that's despite people saying he was poor.

I'd actually play Young at left back at the moment to be honest. Blind is too slow.

2292~~~
What sort of end product are you looking for ? He's got an excellent work rate and can slither past defenders in the opposing third to get the ball into the box. That and the odd goal here and there are about all we can hope for. He does need to take more shots on goal similar to what he did in his first year.

2293~~~
fuc4 me he did. if not for a great goal by mata it would have been for nothing. pass was behind him. united looked 10 times the team with young out there and i am not young's biggest supporters. and he waited too long to play rooney in.

2294~~~
We didn't play worse because Di Maria came on. It was a matter of us not being able to sustain the insane intensity and possession of the first half and Liverpool making a strong push to get a goal back by thwarting our first half style.

2295~~~
Maybe some goals or assists? His crossing into the box has been poor in general. Everyone on here rants and raves about him at the moment, but he has one goal and one assist for the season.

He'd be better at left back imo, where his engine, work rate, pace and ability to overlap would make up for his lack of end product.

2296~~~
We missed him when he went off today. I never thought I would rather have Young on the pitch over Di Maria.

2297~~~
we looked worse when he did. he did himself no favors with his overall play. looked a div catching that ball.

2298~~~
He's been doing great lately, hasn't he? Didn't deserve to be taken TBH. Hope he starts one of the 2 games vs. City/Chelsea.

2299~~~
Decent game from Young, I thought he was a little over eager when he got in good positions though, perhaps wanting to shut the Villa boo boys up.

2300~~~
Yeah solid game with some very good moments. Didn't do much with his crossing and think he could have used Blind's runs better. Probably was trying too hard because it was Villa.

2301~~~
Justifying his position in the team at the moment. That being said, Blind showed him how it's done on the first goal. Crossing into the box is all well and good but when you have the opportunity to get your head up and pick a pass then you should take it.

2302~~~
Really needs to add end product to his game. It's obvious he's improved, but I still believe it was a case of him being that useless in the past that he now looks better, as opposed to him being brilliant. 

That being said, in a big game I would pick him because of his defensive qualities and ability to listen to a manager's instructions. But he really should score a few goals and lay on some clear chances. It's not too much to ask from a winger at United.

2303~~~
played very well. he had some nice balls in and some not so nice. makes the other winger and rb play their arses off.

2304~~~
He looked a tad overanxious when he got near the penalty area and with so much adrenaline, I don't know why he didn't try a shot!

2305~~~
I dont see whats special about him and again today was the same thing. Di Maria, despite his poor level by his own standards is far more effective and should start against City.

2306~~~
He was grand in the first half and pretty good in the second half too. Absolutely bummed Hutton down that left hand side, to the point where they had to replace him at half time.

2307~~~
Hutton was injured, and it was Sherwood's moronic decision to keep him in for the final 5 minutes of the first half that largely contributed to them conceding the first goal.

Not saying that Young didnt have some moments in that first half though, but again he displayed no end product. At his age, and with the minutes he has received this year, it's not good enough IMO.

2308~~~
Thought he was our best player tbh.

2309~~~
It's games like this he'll have been bought for. A good Premiership player who can do damage to all but the best teams in the league. Put him with other good players, and he'll help you win far more often than you lose.

Not absolutely world class, but then not every player in the squad has to be.

2310~~~
Most of Young's moments are completely self-engineered, yeah he needed to be a bit better with that final ball... but he was causing them all sorts of problems on a consistent basis which kept them under pressure (and then the goal came due to some good work from him). It was his good play in fact that gave Blind two great opportunities to create something (one for the goal which was grand, and one from the short corner, where he should have done better).

2311~~~
Am I the only one who thought his final delivery was awful today? Had the beating of Hutton throughout the first half but them put in aimless crosses in the box. He has been very good for us but today seemed lile one of his less successful days productively.

2312~~~
He can whip in good balls but he lacks that calm composure Blind and Di Maria have when they get into the same positions. Their crosses are a little more deliberate.

2313~~~
He lacks productivity, he does most of the football well (pass, movement, tracking back). It's just when it comes to delivering the final ball or take the shot that something misses.

2314~~~
He looks so close to producing an assist all game long that you almost forget that he's just got one assist this year.

2315~~~
I think he just loses focus when he has done most of the hard work. The final pass is the one where of the time, you need to really concentrate. The way I see it, subconsciously he sees it as enough when he gets past his opponents.

2316~~~
He really has the worst end product on a player I have ever seen. He does every thing right, until when it comes to crossing/shooting when he always fails. He has one assist and one goal this season, which is by far the worst product of our attackers (not including Januzaj who barely plays). Di Maria despite not having (currently) as a good general play as him is far more effective.

Still good to see that Young has become from useless to very useful. If he can somehow learn to corss he would be a cracking player considering that he easily beats the players which have to defend against him.

2317~~~
It is really frustrating because several times in each games, he toys with his fullback and creates space for himself which is something not many wingers achieve.

2318~~~
I think he's actually a good crosser, much better than Valencia for instance, but it's too often just whipped into an area rather than aimed at a particular player which he needs to work on.

2319~~~
There isn't anything special about him but he does a good job going forward and also is good defensively. Where as Di Maria is better going forward but leaves us completely open down the left side when defending. In tight games against big side I think we should use Young and against the smaller sides where we have to do less defending I would play Di Maria and let him do some damage.

2320~~~
I disagree... I think Adnan is a better investment for our future. Young turns 30 in summer and against lesser teams we dont need Young anyway.

2321~~~
I hope that after the City and Chelsea games we have Top 4 fairly secured and in the remaining games we give some of the younger guys some games. I'd rather Januzaj, Wilson, Pereira, and McNair get some minutes before the season ends rather than Young, Falcao and Valencia.

2322~~~
Definitely agree on all counts.

2323~~~

2324~~~
I like his all around game but he is definitely lacking end product. I am lazy to check his stats but I am sure they are far worse than his game would suggest, which is weird because when we bought him I hated him because he was all about stats and his all around play was average at best.

2325~~~
thought he had a terrific game today.

he's done fantastically well to get himself back into the team and play so well he's keeping Di Maria out.

Cripes, at one stage, I heard the never satisfied sweary boozehound behind me shout "give it Young, he'll do something with it"

redemption

2326~~~
I like him on the left, but he should be passing to Blind and Fellaini far more often.

2327~~~
Awful final ball. He came off and Di Maria got an assist about 10 mins later.

Funny that.

2328~~~
I got the feeling the old Ashley Young was creeping in at parts. Not a bad performance but very frustrating. I think Di Maria comes in for the City match.

2329~~~
You must be joking? He was almost pointless. 10 crosses and not one of them hit their target, worst pass completion rate on the pitch and the only thing he did that had any impact on the game was playing a simple pass to Blind who showed him how to do his job properly. In that one moment Blind set up as many goals as Young has all season. 1 goal and 1 assist all season is atrocious. Even Carrick's contributed more than that for feck's sake...and he's played less minutes than Young!

I honestly can't believe how much praise he's received from fans, commentators and pundits alike. The commentator on NBC today said he thought he was our best player up until that point. Bizarre. I'm glad van Gaal didn't feel the same way.

2330~~~
Did well, but the end product was lacking. I think he benefited from Villa sticking 1-2 men on Fellaini all the time, it created space with him to work with. Should definitely have done better with his final ball though.

2331~~~
Good run but then fails to pick anyone out. Even if the defender misses his clearance, the ball goes out of play. We have a player completely unmarked in the box.

2332~~~
Totally agree. It was bizarre the praise he was getting.

This article from the Daily Mirror lavished praise on him and Fellaini <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-3-1-aston-villa-5458094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-3-1-aston-villa-5458094</a>

Both players who were subbed for being off colour, though Fellaini was competent compared to Young.

Almost like some outlets think they've been late to a praise party and are over-compensating now,

2333~~~
You can see in the gif he had a player sliding in to challenge him as he was about to release the ball, he didn't have much choice but to put a very dangerous cross into the 6 yard box. He deserves credit for creating that chance we should have scored from. 

Brwned's being very harsh but I do agree Di Maria should be starting, Young's form has been decent but overstated.

2334~~~
I thought this too. I thought he was pretty good though, just lacked the end product. Will be interesting to see if he keeps his place.

2335~~~
He's a better left back then he is a winger.

2336~~~
I've said it today already in the "Carrick thread".....he must improve a lot his end product or he will/should/must lose his place to Di Maria.

2337~~~
The commentator said he was our best player when he got subbed out. I must have been watching a different game. He was decent, and had a lot of the ball but lacked end product.

Also, Herrera was brilliant. He was our best player.

2338~~~
I agree completely, but I'm not at all surprised. Young flatters to deceive, almost doing something good but then coming just short when it really matters. People appreciate the workrate and effort and their eyes play tricks on them, thinking he succeeds more often than he really does.

He's obviously been good this season but as a winger he doesn't provide enough. I've liked him more as a leftback where his end product isnt critical, but when he gets it right its very helpful

2339~~~
No end product but he's taking on his man again, after about 18 months of not doing any of that.

2340~~~
I still prefer to start him over Angel for now, and I think Louis does too.

2341~~~
He just links up so well with Blind..  And for me he brings balance to the force..

2342~~~
A 2nd place finish  will probably still be up for grabs, which means no need to prequalify for the CL and no disruption to preseason,. I wouldn't want the season to peter out with a Van Gaal giving game to players who are not an integral part of the settled  first team because he is 'happy' with top 4, United are not Arsenal. . It wouldn't set the right tone for next season either. If 2nd place is secure and  Chelsea are out of sight, then I'd be happy to  give them players game time.

2343~~~
Very stable player, but lacks end product sadly. Can't believe he only has one goal and one assist this season.

2344~~~
His end product for a winger is completely shocking. Just not good enough to be a starter for a club like United. Great versatile squad player to have, but that should be it.. 

Played very well at left back for most of the season, but he's just not good enough on the wing. His early season form is 'letting him off' for want of a better phrase. If he was putting these performances in at the start of the season, on the wing, he'd be getting destroyed on here.

2345~~~
His crosses would be superb if our players could predict where he puts them. He always puts them in a dangerous area but there is always no one on the end of them. And it goes harmlessly out of play or the defender at the near post clears it. RVP if he could get back to his best could benefit from his crosses as I think his movement in the box is by far the best among our strikers.

2346~~~
I think it's just you! He absolutely roasted their right back, and most of our attacks came down his side.
He's keeping a £60m player out too.

Some people just get caught up on who they dislike.

Fellaini and Young have really shown a few fans up this year.

2347~~~
What? He's played pretty well these last few games. That's why he's keeping Di Maria out.

2348~~~
You can sugarcoat it as much as you like, he needs to add more finishing touches to his improvements - his output is poor.

2349~~~
Looked like our most active player vs villa. Had some terrible 5 minutes before being subbed with that madness pass outside the box that  could easily have been an accident. 

His footwork and will to get stuck in is on a high level at the moment.

2350~~~
completely agree but we should understand Young does a good job tracking back and doesn't lose head trying things all the time from nonsense positions, that's why young plays especially when there is Blind who lacks so much pace but is intelligent to have a good combination with the winger, so I guess Van Gaal sees good balance there now. If dimaria improves he will surely be starter and he seemed more cautious yesterday, so I guess it's a matter of time but for city game I'd say it's 50/50

2351~~~
Mainly because Rooney decided to salvage Di Maria's cross by scoring a wonder goal though.

With Blind at LB, I'd much rather have Young in the team for his work rate. Di Maria loses the ball a lot, and Blind's not got the pace to stop a counter attack on his side. Nor does Di Maria do much defending in general.

2352~~~
Did Young's roasting of Hutton contribute anything decisive in the game? Standards for Young are just very low. He's played well in some games but yesterday he just fired in aimless crosses, dribbled and got nowhere and passed back.

2353~~~
I definitely agree that we hold Young to a lower standard, he's a hard working winger with good dribbling and a great delivery, but he still ins't the level you'd hope for anything other than a squad player at Manchester United. I like Young and I'd keep him, but he hasn't the ability to be a consistent starter in an attacking position for us, in my opinion. I don't think anyone is really suggesting he's great anyway. Good on him for this season though.

2354~~~
We need to look at replacing Young in the summer with a more technically gifted LW with similar work-rate however he has won the right to start against City on both the strength of his last couple of performances which have been decent to very good and by virtue of the fact that he is a reliable presence where as the Arsenal game should have given many a clue that Di Maria might not be in the most positive frame of mind at the moment so there is no telling how he will perform in a game of the magnitude of City at home. 

It would seem to me to be much more sound to put less pressure on him at this point by giving him a super sub role till the end of the season baring a disastrous performance by Young in which case Di Maria should be given his starting spot. 

I'm very keen that we don't change the team dynamic from now till the end of the season unless performances dictate that we have to.

2355~~~
Of course, however I think that our youngsters like Januzaj, Wilson and McNair would actually do better at the moment than Falcao, Valencia and Young, plus obviously the long term benefit. There is something to play for in 99% of games, and in the other 1% of games young players gain little because the result isn't very important. Part of managing at the top level involves bringing through young players - LVG has revealed it's even part of the brief. We simply need to give these kids games.

2356~~~
We already have that player (in fact, we have two of them) and, if he can learn to play within a possession oriented framework, I'm sure he will be an automatic starter in the future. However, as you say, until that moment arrives, Young has earned his starting spot.

2357~~~
The difference between 2nd and 4th is not insubstantial in financial terms, both from the PL money and from the increased share in the CL pool money.

2358~~~
His end product is terrible. Would much rather see Di Maria start against City. I'm glad Young has done a half decent job this season as it might allow us to get some money for him this summer. He's just not the calibre of player that we should have in our squad going further. Not sure why Ferguson ever bought him for £17m or whatever it was.

2359~~~
The problem with Di Maria is that he doesn't defend. Young does. When Blind goes forward, he knows Young will fall into his position and defend if needed. Much like when Evra was around. 

When Young came off, Blind stopped going forward and played in a defensive mode. Di Maria does have pace and bringing him on late certainly helps against tired defenders. 

I would prefer Young starting over Di Maria as this allows Blind to assist and attack where as if Di Maria started, I doubt we would see the same. 

Glad LvG sees it this way too.

2360~~~
Perhaps, but as far as Di Maria is concerned that is still to be seen consistently and right now I've not seen him add the type of defensive stability and possession orientated reliability that Young is currently adding or the work rate, I also have a theory that he may be better suited to a slightly modified version of the position that Fellaini currently occupies in the side but , but that's for another time. I 'd still bank on us adding a young LW to the squad this summer.

And this is what i am getting at, the relationship and balance between young and whatever LB we play behind him is always gonna be good, Its still to be seen whether Di Maria can strike the same balance long term but I've not seen him do so yet.

2361~~~
I understand that we are interested in Depay. Not sure how good he plays though as I haven't seen him play.

2362~~~
I'm not his biggest supporter. I don't think he's good enough for United. However I think you're being a bit unfair on him.

You can't reduce a performance to stats alone. His end product was poor but I'd argue he had a good influence on the overall team performance. Whether you like him or not, you must admit his workrate, energy, defensive awareness and understanding with Blind have definitely contributed to our recent good performances. While he's not scoring or assisting it's fair to say that himself and Blind have have been solid and dominated their side of the pitch in recent weeks.

2363~~~
Di Maria's cross to Rooney wasn't perfect, Rooney's control of the ball was astonishing.

2364~~~
His and Valencia's crossing and distribution around the penalty area is one of the main reasons we struggle to create chances in so many games. We see tons of the ball, and it constantly gets rolled out to these guys on either wing and neither of them can put a decent ball in. Both love to get their head down and drill a low cross in, which is just a numbers game at that point. Sometimes it works, but when it's your only option it becomes a problem. Even with high crosses there doesn't seem to be any particular intent, they just put it over and hope for the best. We got spoiled with Beckham and Neville, both intelligent footballers who knew where to place a ball for their centre forwards. It's the old "no end product" problem, it's pointless being able to skin two players if you're just going to waste the advantage anyway.

2365~~~
I don't see it in financial terms. I see it in more symbolic terms. Finishing the season strongly and claiming 2nd spot  above City and Arsenal should be the priority now. It sets a symbolic  benchmark for a club like United for next season.

2366~~~
I think most would agree - but Ashley Young would not be the factor in determining that.

2367~~~
The thing is, Di Maria, when he crosses, looks for his teammates. Young on the other hand, has a poor accuracy.
Wouldn't it be better if Young actually aimed at where the players are ? The best crossers/passers in the history of the game, have always been about finding the right player in the open space and not just focus on the space alone.

2368~~~
Same with Mata's assist the previous week, bad ball and Mata did the most with it. Against Liverpool, he had an excellent opportunity then decided to pass to Rooney but it failed miserably. Poor pass, again. 

His touch and finishing has been poor too, there's been times when he could have scored but didn't. 

Look, I'm not going to bash him, I think he is very useful but I think Young has his place in the team and Di Maria is good to come on as a sub and put even more pressure on the opponents.

2369~~~
Di Maria's cross was going straight to Mata in plenty of space if Rooney didn't do what we did. It was a perfect pick out and exactly the kind of thing Young fails to do over and over again.

2370~~~
Bad ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> utter nonsense. A bad ball is all 25 of young and Valencia's crosses combined against Aston villa. Easy to defend against.

2371~~~
Young has earned his play in the team, I salute his bravery and how he's willing to take players on. He doesn't get assists but so what? His general play has been very good [and I absolutely don't rate Young]. Di Maria has been really poor and the execution of some of his so called assists were poor too, it was magic how Rooney was able to control that terrible cross from him.

2372~~~
funny that both ADM assists were on great strikes. young has put in some good crosses and no ones scored a wonder goal. that's the difference and that ADM gives it away easier and doesn't track back.

2373~~~
Terrible cross <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Rooney stole the cross and made it his own, otherwise it was going straight to the only free United player in the box. It was a great cross and displayed exactly the kind of vision Young is sorely lacking.

2374~~~
His crossing has been to great areas most of the time just nobody is getting on to them.

I expect him to smash a wonder goal soon.

2375~~~
His crossing was very good vs Villa, shame he didn't get a goal to round off what was a good performance.

2376~~~
Needs to be more productive but is helping us by keeping the width. Can we do better? Of course we can, but Ashley can too. I'm sure we'll buy in the summer but he's a good squad player.

2377~~~
Yeah, just like Mata stole that one that was played behind him at Anfield.

2378~~~
What a strange response. Even if you choose to believe it was a "poor" cross to Rooney, you can quite clearly see it was going straight into the path of Mata in acres of space which is more than Young managed all day, and that was due to a combination of skill and vision which Young has practically never shown. He created the space with skill and then crossed it into a place where no defenders could reach it and in a position where as many as three forwards could take it on. With Young it's usually the opposite. 

The idea that Young is simply unlucky and di Maria is lucky is just incredible.

2379~~~
You clearly don't rate Young. He's the only player we have who takes on players and consistently beats them. You're not even acknowledging his involvement for the first goal

2380~~~
I've never even suggested anything remotely close to this ever.

2381~~~
True that's why I always preferred Nani and AdM's crossing because they always try to whip one in to pick out a man. Young and Valencia are both more hit and hope but Young's crosses at least have the potential to be productive with the right runs.

2382~~~
I think people are missing an important aspect wrt Young's game and his failed crosses. 

Whilst I like everyone else wish that he were better at picking out a player when he gets the chance, the defence still have to cover Young (and those in the box) as if he might. He wears them down, he provides a consistent focus drawing resources towards him and away from others, perhaps especially Blind. This gives Blind greater opportunities, and their synergy in both attack and defence gives Blind greater freedom. Between the two of them (and Fellaini) they control that side, give out-balls and avenues for forward progress, their ball retention until Young tries to cross is excellent. In combination with the trio on the other wing they cause major headaches for our opponents.

Now if LVG can work out a way to improve Ashley's final ball...

2383~~~
Who in a million years after last season would of thought Ashley Young with his aimless crosses would be starting ahead of Di Maria? I honestly think Di Maria should be back in the team, he's a world class player and Young is, well Young. That's not to say I think Ashey hasn't done well.

2384~~~
The issue is that all that ball retention means nothing if the final ball played is an aimless cross that almost never reaches it target. Whether one wants Young to start or not, it is very obvious that the current final balls from him are useless and just gives away possession. 

If we want a cross, Blind is a bloody excellent crosser of the ball. Young should be told to never cross the ball and instead play it short and low, and continue his runs towards goal to offer a passing option for whoever he passes to. 

Look at the dynamics of our right side. Herrera and Mata are excellent one touch players and they manage to break down teams really well and Valencia is just a last option resort for an aimless cross. Aimless crosses have a big part to play in a game if you have enough men inside the box which we have had lately with Fellaini especially. 

Our right side has had a really nice balance lately in that way.

2385~~~
Whoosh!!

2386~~~
I've looked at it again and it's definitely not going straight to Mata. Mata would have done very well to control that even if Rooney had missed it

2387~~~
Young served the ball on a plate to Fellaini a few times and the big man just wasn't jumping in that game. On one occasion right after we took the lead Young played a ball directly to an unmarked Fellaini who failed to control it, should've been 2-0 at that point. But no, he was wasteful all game

2388~~~
it was going behind mata , just saw the goal. mata was slamming the breaks on. there was no other united player near getting to that "great" cross. no one! two shi7 balls turned into goals.

2389~~~
fecking hell.

If you want 'shit balls' just watch any of Young's 3000 crosses.

2390~~~
so you agree those two "assists"  ADM will get credit for were sh1t.

2391~~~
No, anyone that thinks that is a complete moron.

The Liverpool one especially is something no one else in our team would have done. Just watch it again, the way he drops into the space, gets the ball then returns it to Mata. Young could only dream of pulling of a piece of skill like that.

2392~~~
he showed vision but the pass to mata was sh1t. the pass to rooney was worse. they were both behind and the goal scorers did a great job not only controlling them but scoring on them. and watch the name calling.

2393~~~
They were neither shit balls, nor were they great balls... they were simply, (fine, hairy) balls.

2394~~~
Stop this.

2395~~~
This is the main reason that Young made most of the poorer opposition concerned about him (even as a left wing back).

I feel like I'm watching Young at Aston Villa again. Back then, he'd have been lauded for such performances with Aston Villa with him beating players, causing the opposition problems with his pace, and crossing balls into dangerous areas without them making it to the players. With us, however, given that we've had better wingers in our times, we expect more than what Young's been showing at the moment. It's not enough for Young to just play the ball into dangerous areas and not aim for the players. In Aston Villa, he got away with it because O'Neill flooded the opponent's box with the strikers, the right winger, and a midfielder, not to mention the large number of set pieces he took and delivered into the box with big, tall players like Laursen, Knight, Harewood, Carew, etc., to aim for. I should also mention that O'Neill did play a fast-paced, counterattacking game as well with Villa, which suited Young and co. very well.

Man. Utd. played and still play differently from O'Neill's Aston Villa, so Young isn't going to create enough goalscoring opportunities playing in his usual way. We don't flood the box too often, and until we had Fellaini playing well, we didn't have a big, strong player who can challenge for crosses into the box. This is why, even if he's been back to his best, we still don't see him really create enough chances as he rarely looks up and picks players. Given how di Maria hasn't been the most efficient on the ball, he still spots players and seeks to play them in even if it doesn't always work. Young, however, does none of that. Even Valencia looks up more often than Young and puts in better deliveries, overall, than Young does.

However, what makes Young so dangerous is the fact that he plays balls into dangerous areas. This keeps the opposition defenders on their toes and makes them sink deeper into the box, leaving space in the box for players like Herrera, Rooney, and Mata to enter and score goals from. Of course, if he aimed his crosses rather than play them in blindly, he'd be one of the league's best wingers. What keeps him ahead of di Maria and Januzaj, at the moment, is his positional discipline, his ability to beat players more often than those two, his defensive discipline, and his good combinations with his full back. Both di Maria and Januzaj haven't contributed enough defensively for some time, both haven't been as consistent as Young in beating their man, and both don't combine that well with their full backs at the moment.

Still, though, this cannot mean that he will do well doing forward against decent defenders. Against Newcastle away, Janmaat dealt well with Young, and Young was effectively ineffective. Against Liverpool, Young had a relatively quiet game when compared to his performance against Spurs, where he didn't even create a chance (out of my own memory).

Against Man. City, I see Young being quiet again, going forward, but his link-ups with Fellaini and Blind will make them more dangerous than if di Maria or Januzaj played on the left wing. 2 dangerous players over 1 dangerous player is a no-brainer, at the moment.

TL;DR: Young's Aston Villa style won't be enough for him to create chances here; his other qualities make Blind and Fellaini more dangerous, though. di Maria and Januzaj might not be able to make our left side more dangerous than Young has at this moment.

2396~~~
All true and there's no doubt that Young has built up a good partnership with Blind in both attack and defence and adds balance to the side, but what you're essentially saying is he does the basics well. He's doing what basically any decent winger does, while adding a bit more in defence and a lot less in end product.

The good partnership with Blind is in part down to Young but also in part down to the fact Blind's a very intelligent player, because he creates options for the man on the ball and uses the ball well. There's no reason to think di María wouldn't do the same. The penalty against Liverpool shows di María's perfectly capable of utilising Blind's intelligent movement, for example, and given time I can't see why they wouldn't develop a strong partnership. It'd be a different kind of partnership, certainly, and Blind would be asked to do different things, but nothing he's not capable of IMO.

Di María obviously wears down the fullback and provides a constant outlet and creates space for others too - more so than anyone else in our team. That just leaves you with ball retention where Young comes out on top and even then the difference is fairly marginal. Young gets a lot of praise for this side of his game but the only outfield players that give the ball away more often are di María and Wilson, and in Di Maria's case you're comparing 78% to 81% - it's not hugely significant, particularly when you take into account di María makes more passes and of course does much more with his passing.

"Causing headaches", "giving outballs" and providing a "consistent focus" are the bare minimum we should expect of our wingers, not something we should praise them for. IMO the only reason people are praising Young for this is because our wingplay for the last couple of years has been so, so poor, and because people get so frustrated by di María that they fail to acknowledge he does every bit of this too.

2397~~~
I agree. I believe the price tag set on di Maria means that fans expect much more from him than they do from Young, and thus, Young gets a bit more of a free ride than di Maria (as already mentioned by some posters recently). If Young was bought for more than £18 million, then he'd be more lambasted for his lack of end product than he currently is at the moment. Given the highly-inflated prices nowadays, Young's price tag doesn't look as bad as it did before, so people are more forgiving to him along with the fact that he was much worse than this before.

I'd rather see di Maria as well as I'd believe he can develop a good partnership with Blind whilst being more dangerous than Young, but I guess most want Young's apparent reliability over di Maria's "erratic" playing style.

2398~~~
This.

2399~~~
He will be picked instead of ADM against City but only for his work rate and defensive abilities. It was evident against Villa that he does not have an end product and is not able to pick out a United player in the box. All the great runs and dribblings are for nothing if there is no final ball. It was frustrating watching him getting into great positions but only for a poor ball to end the attack.
Great that he has found some form again and is playing ok'ish, but I wouldnt really pick him before ADM or Januzaj

2400~~~
Mental how split this forum is on di Maria. Its not a shit cross at all considering top players manage to control the ball and score. Shit crosses are ones that are cleared easily every time. Young just aimlessly puts them in the box, that doesn't take skill. Same with tony v.

2401~~~
To be fair at least Young's crosses make it into the box most of the time and not just the defender's shins like Valencia's. I think Young's crosses are pretty good for the most part, it's just the strikers need to make the perfect run (like the Falcao goal at Villa) as no one seems to know where he'll put it.

2402~~~
To be fair to Valencia, he put in a brilliant cross for Rooney, who attempted a ridiculously stupid over head kick...

2403~~~
Yeah, been going through most of our games and Young is like a perfect crosser for a player like Falcao, who is always lurking in the box. That cross from Young is his usual cross and it was perfect for Falcao. Stats show he had a 81% pass rate and 12 crosses(three completed with one assist).

2404~~~
What a man!!

2405~~~
Woooooohooo. Happy to see him find his man, he had so much time there well taken cross.

2406~~~
Doubles his league goals and assists for the season. Good lad

2407~~~
Stop jinxing him!

2408~~~
Man of the Match so far. Goal and an Assist in the first half an hour to get us the lead.

2409~~~
Felliani is my Motm.. goal and the key pass for the 2nd

2410~~~
Try those numbers on for size feckboys.

2411~~~
Really good half. And Gary Neville can feck off accusing him of taking a tumble and looking for it.

2412~~~
Reminiscent of his performance against City the 3-2 in his first season. Absolutely excellent. Is it just my halftime euphoria getting the better of me or does he generally turn it on in the big games?

2413~~~
I wanted him little bit more to start than Angel as he's good defensively to cover for slow Blind, I'm glad he started. 1+1 and good game so far for Smashley happy for him..

2414~~~
Keep it up lad happy for him.

2415~~~
It is funny how a few years back most United fan would have loved to see him leave. He has really turned his career around and I believe that is down to his mental fortitude as he has always had the talent in him.

2416~~~
Worst part is, that when people on here are making their lists for players to leave this Summer that they still include Young when he has been fantastic this season in reality. Great player to have in the squad IMO

2417~~~
That cross for Fellaini was pitch perfect

2418~~~
What a player he's been today. Excellent. Definitely established himself as a MUTV pundit for the rest of his life after his form this season.

2419~~~
Young 2 - 1 City.

2420~~~
That's nothing new though. People are making future line-ups without including Blind who has been a consistent performer and quite clearly, LVG's darling.

2421~~~
That was exactly the type of cross I was talking about earlier that Young always does just that there's no one there to meet it and it floats out for a goal kick.

2422~~~
he is an absolute menace.Really looks like he wants this more than anybody else on the pitch today. He is really playing with passion today.

2423~~~
Yep, I've changed my mind entirely.  While I'd still like a quality winger, he's great to have.  He seems to uplift the team, both with his positive play and attitude.  He's ironed out his major issues and is a useful asset.

2424~~~
Don't care what his stats are. He's been very good this season.

2425~~~
You beauty

2426~~~
Incredible performance.

2427~~~
2 assist and a goal today. Been our best player on the pitch

2428~~~
Can't believe he kept all these things inside of himself for all that time. Even Moyes football ideas should be suiting him. He's been a very important player for us this season.

2429~~~
Quite a few people took him out of their teams for todays match.

2430~~~
Has he something like tripled his output for the season today?

2431~~~
He has the best in-swinging cross in the business.

Sensational today. As good as he has been recently he hadn't hit anything close to heights like these, the fact that he's outdone his season stats in one game show that. Delighted for him.

2432~~~
Never thought he'd turn it around like that.

2433~~~
Very pleased for him. He's more than earned his place in the first team now. At the start of the season if someone said we'd play Young vs City and leave di Maria on the bench, I'd wouldn't have believed it.

2434~~~
Best game this season and Zabaleta didn't even have a bad game.

2435~~~
He was always a good player. It good that he's showing it. Great player to have in your squad. A very good team player.

2436~~~
Dominated Zabaleta today. Fair play Young!

2437~~~
Man of the match performance from him. Both our wingbacks have been excellent recently.

2438~~~
His cooperation with Blind has been flawless today.

Massive pressure on City.

2439~~~
motm for me.. Currently he's much better than di Maria or 'dreamsigning' (for many United fans) Depay.

2440~~~
What a turnaround in fortunes from him, who could have imagined him keeping ADM out of the team at season's start?!

2441~~~
Great performance.

2442~~~
Incredible that some wanted him dropped in favour of Di Maria. Young's playing really well.

2443~~~
Keeping 60 million Di Maria out of side and rightly so.

2444~~~
Its always easy to throw players under the bus but this should be a lesson how in some cases there is something good locked in those,you just need to unlock it.

2445~~~
His turn around has been very good.

Bridshit is not a performance enhancer right.

2446~~~
MOTM.

2447~~~
Ashley "Tornado" Young

2448~~~
Hands up...hated him last season....been reborn this season. One man is the reason, LVG. He's rejuvenated him and given him belief...someone else used to do that to players...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2449~~~
That free kick was delicious but its refreshing how combative and mobile he looks out there.

2450~~~
Showed good balance and composure for the goal, but his passion on the field was great to see today.

2451~~~
Another brilliant performance, who knew he had it in him to be this kind of player?

That header though, I'm sure he's done that before. Or it might have been Diouf.

2452~~~
I'll admit it. Wanted Di Maria to start this match because Youngs end product was bad against Villa. MOTM today, fantastic performance.

2453~~~
plays both sides.

2454~~~
Hopefully the haters can feck off.

He's been fantastic.

2455~~~
2 Assists
1 Goal

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Fulfilling his promise from when he was a youngster at last.

2456~~~
Did he double his numbers today?

2457~~~
Universally (almost) hated a year ago, today he pisses all over City with a goal and two great assists. His revival under Van Gaal is just phenomenal.

2458~~~
1G+2A I have him in my fantasy premier league side, shame I left him on the bench for Silva, too bad for me. Anyway I'm glad for him he's good guy too

2459~~~
He has well and truly mastered the philosophy. Him, Blind and Fellaini's triangles on that side are beautiful <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2460~~~
Who would have thought a couple of months or maybe last year that this guy with the MOTM in the derby? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2461~~~
He's had spells like this before but they've been all too brief and punctuated by dross. This one looks like it might be the real deal. He's outshining Di Maria on merit.

2462~~~
His best game as an attacking player in a United shirt.

2463~~~
Tripled his assists, doubled his goals.

Finally, Ashley Young with some f that fabled final ball. Good man.

2464~~~
Great performance from him today.

2465~~~
Should he start against Chelsea too? I'd say so. If the game was any closer than a week, we might as well have given him a rest to play AdM, but with a weeks time left until the game, I think he should start.

2466~~~
Very good delivery today. Thats not always the case, but there are very few days where its just poor quality delivery. He pretty much always gives our attackers a chance even if its a slim one

2467~~~
Smashley!!!!!

what a performance pretty much his best in a United shirt, fantasric how he turned his career around and seems to be really enjoying his football again.

2468~~~
Smashley. Laying the smackdown today. That is all.

2469~~~
Superb again today, that little love triangle between him, Fellaini and Blind is really proving to be a great weapon in our arsenal.

2470~~~
Top, top lad.

2471~~~
I'm actually looking for the team to pass the ball to him, he's been great lately.

2472~~~
Give this man a knighthood. Or a England call up. Either one is fine.

2473~~~
Fantastic performance. Humble and hard working by the looks of it too. Well played.

2474~~~
Him and Blind work brilliantly together, add in Fellaini, who just draws defenders to himself, freeing other players

2475~~~
You were jinxing it with your Di Maria v Young stat off, weren't you? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2476~~~
Absolute ripping it up this season. He'll definitely get a new deal and it's very much deserved.

2477~~~
This time last year he was a laughing stock. In fact, no, he wasn't a laughing stock. Because <i>absolutely no-one</i> found it funny. He was just hated.

An embarrassment to the shirt, one of the worst players we've ever had, and so on.

Now he's keeping Angel Di Maria out of the team - and imagine if, in April 2014, someone had argued that AdM wouldn't get in the team ahead of Ashley Young if he came here.

Shows you how quickly things can change in football, and why patience is a virtue.

2478~~~
So true. Some players require consistent playing time to be at there best and Young is one of them (Nani is another).

2479~~~
If he can cut out the "uhhh"'s, might have a good 2nd career in broadcasting based on the post-match interview.

2480~~~
Ashley Young.

Philosophy Student.

2481~~~
He was awesome today. Have to say, I knew he was decent player but I didn't think he had this in him. He was a threat every time he got the ball, was unplayable at times.

2482~~~
Can't believe how good this guy played. So much confidence right now.

2483~~~
He must go home just skipping right now. He's improved as a player like no other. Totally belief in himself and doesn't let a bad pass or cross dent that confidence.

2484~~~
That backheel nutmeg before our 2nd goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2485~~~
Glad he got a goal today. His turn in fortunes has been well documented and he's a completely different player to the shell of a player from last season. Despite his improvement, I feel he badly needs to improve his end product. Hopefully today can be the start for him getting regular goals/assists.

2486~~~
Hardly put a foot wrong. He's on cloud 9 in terms of confidence lately, and it shows on the pitch.

2487~~~
The pre-season tour turned his United career around.

2488~~~
He's a fecking hero. To produce a performance like that after some of the shit he's got takes a whole load of guts, belief, and of course, ability. He's an absolute credit to the United shirt.

2489~~~
He had Zabaleta on the back foot the whole game today and not many players do that as he has been a very consistent player for City. I was wrong to write him off as just being a left back/wing back for us from now on, since he's moved back to a more familiar position he has produced the goods there for us. His crossing in the last few games has been top class and a real threat.

2490~~~
When's the last time a player (apart from Fellaini) has gone from zero to hero in such a short space of time?

2491~~~
Lots of respect for this guy for the way he's turned it around. Superb game tonight, looks like a real leader out there and his passion for us is visible. Great stuff.

2492~~~
It's not even the rise back to form and first team place or keeping Angel Di Maria out of the side on merit. Coupled with the below YouTube clips and his versatility, commitment and ability, he's becoming (become?) a real fan favourite.

Away at City:

2493~~~
Always plays a blinder against Citeh. Got to say I thought out of all the squad at the beginning of summer, I thought he was the one that would be sold.

2494~~~
Including the one that went straight on Fellaini's head today?

2495~~~
I was one of the people who wanted him dropped for Di Maria as he usually never sets up any goals and it just seems like a lot of huffing and puffing for very little reward. What a fantastic performance today though. Couldn't believe it.

Edit - Just looking at the stats at the top and did young actually just double his entire end product for the season today?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2496~~~
So you know how they say if you get shit on by a bird, it's good luck?

Seems like getting bird shit in your mouth can turn you into superman.

Amazing game today Ash!

2497~~~
We asked for more end product and that's what he delivered. Probably his best game in a United shirt, and all credit to him for a remarkable turnaround.

2498~~~
Has shown huge character this season. Fair play.

2499~~~
I bet all those United fans that were sending him abuse on twitter at the start of the season are cringing right about now.

2500~~~
The kind of wankers that do that won't see anything reason to be embarrassed.

2501~~~
I think away to City last season he had something like 9 or 11 touches in total in the entire game? His turn around has been amazing and I'm glad his crossing was finally rewarded today.

2502~~~
Keeping Di Maria out of the side with top quality performances. Looking like the player we had at the start of 2011/12 again. Just need him to cut in off the flank and SMASH one in and the revival will be complete!

2503~~~
I suppose your right.

2504~~~
Has justified his starting position over ADM - who would have thought that

2505~~~
Don't forget the time he let a dying United fan and his entourage use his box at Old Trafford all expenses paid and him picking up United fans en route to Old Trafford on match days. He's been heavily criticized for his behaviour on the pitch in the past, and rightly so, but I struggle to think of a United player who deserves to be acknowledged by United fans as much as Young does. A player who does everything to ensure the distance between the players and supporters doesn't grow even further, and now he's showing his worth on the pitch too.

2506~~~
I'll admit that I'd all but disowned him after his pathetic period of constant diving but his form has been fantastic. The way he's clearly gotten his head down and really worked at raising his game is a real credit.

Deservedly keeping Di Maria out of the side, putting in twice the effort and still delivering going forwards. Fair play.

2507~~~
Was in absolute god-mode at times today. Ridiculous turnaround for him considering he's one of the players people wanted to have out the door last summer. Myself included, I didn't see a way back for him. His best game for us today? Possibly. The Arsenal 8-2 game comes to mind, but this opposition were more competitive than that game. Has to feature in the next England squad now.

2508~~~
I might be overcritical, but Young still made some deliveries in the first half that wasted all of our good effort at building up the attack. There were a few instances where his crosses were ballooned way over everyone and onto the right side, but fair play to him for putting in better deliveries than he did in the past matches. I believe he can be more consistent with his deliveries from the left, and this match showed it. He improved his deliveries with his left foot, and I'm sure that he can improve the consistency in his deliveries.

His link-up with Blind and Fellaini is starting to become telepathic, and I'm not sure if di Maria can really oust him at this moment in time. Maybe next season, Young's position won't be as secure, but for now, he's sealed that left wing spot for himself. Defensively, he offers Blind a good amount of support as well and contributes to the balance that we have on that side.

Before the start of this season, I thought that he had value as a squad player who could fill in here and there if needed, but now, he's starting to become a key player for us, and the money we paid for him is starting to become worth it now.

2509~~~
What a game from him, my biggest complaint from him before was not being productive but hasn't he answered that, 1 goal and 2 assists I think today?

2510~~~
Well fecking done Ashley Young. He was brilliant today. Played with real fire and commitment today and the two assists were fantastic. He's overhit those kind of crosses far too often and frustrated but he got it spot on today. Delighted with his performance.

2511~~~
Aye <a class="username" data-user="90856, @BarstoolProphet" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90856/">@BarstoolProphet</a> - well said.

2512~~~
Great post. I've been appalled by his performances in the past, but I've always been impressed by how he's handled himself off the pitch. It's especially easy to hide away when things aren't going your way when it comes to football, but I've read nothing but impressive stuff about him throughout his time with us. So his turn of fortune really couldn't have happened to a better guy, and it just adds to his already impressive character. Because, let's face it, turnarounds like these don't really happen out of the blue, like magic, even though it may seem like it some times in football.

2513~~~
I was one who was debating for Di Maria to start ahead of him. Don't I look like a fool... He shut me up completely.

Arguably his best game in a United shirt this season.

2514~~~
Yay to birdpoop powers <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2515~~~
Have to give this man credit.  He's revived his United career this season under van Gaal.  I no longer cringe and spasm in anger when I see his name in the starting 11.

2516~~~
Keep it up and get yourself a contract renewal Youngy. The criticism was fair, but he's really improved his approach play, and it was great to see him doing the business today.

2517~~~
Brilliant game from him today, if he carries on like this he should comfortably play himself back into the England squad, and maybe the first XI

2518~~~
When was he ever a zero? He's been our most under appreciated player for quite some time now.

2519~~~
I'm a Di Maria boy but he was excellent today. Added the end product when it mattered most. Well done.

2520~~~
Absolute credit to the guy. I was firmly a Young hater. I wanted him out in the summer. He's been absolutely brilliant for us though. Contributed well at LB/LWB this season and now putting in solid performances out wide for us. Who would have thought he'd be keeping out Di Maria out of the team, in big games too. Long may his form continue!

2521~~~
And than he got on the pitch and scored the winner

2522~~~
Well done Ashley! After a few people (me included) had criticised him for his lack of end-product he goes and produces that! 

Imagine if 12 months ago you got told that Ashley Young would be keeping Di Maria out of our starting XI. You would not have believed it.

2523~~~
And Fellaini is keeping him out of a spot in midfield! <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2524~~~
Last summer, I was in the minority who believed that he would be just a mere squad player who'd still be useful for us but not get too many appearances in our team. I never thought that he'd be a key, but I did think that he'd be a useful filler in the team as he's a player who loves this club and always works hard for us.

However, looking at him this season, he has slowly started to become a more key player for us, which is impressive as I thought that he wouldn't really be this useful!

Huge credit goes to Young himself, though, for fighting back and establishing himself in our team.

2525~~~
Will hold my hands straight up. He was first out the door for me last season, even before Fellaini. Has completely turned it around and all the credit to him. It's great to see.

2526~~~
Well done.  Well done.  I wrote you off before the preseason, but Ashley has been incredible for the last month.   He may not be putting in excellent service with every cross, but he isn't hiding under LvG.  This is the Ashley Young we hoped we were buying a few seasons ago.

2527~~~
Thought he'd be our new Alves, based on summer pre-season.

Young might not the player that can take us to the 'next level', but to win the league, we need players like him and Valencia in the squad who would give 100% commitment and consistency the whole season.

Di Maria is still adapting, and I think he'll come much better next season, and may take Young spot. But looking at City on how some just didn't bother to 'fight' when the chips were down, it makes you appreciate Young even more.

2528~~~
incredible. what a performance.

2529~~~

2530~~~
Best game he's ever had for us.

2531~~~
Give the guy a new contract. Don't care if he's not considered world class, he's one of those few players who genuinely look thrilled to be at the club. Not to say the rest aren't committed, they clearly are - but Young actually acts like a fan and plays with his heart on his sleeve. We sure he wasn't raised in Manchester or something?!

I'm actually so happy for him (and Fellaini). Two players people just brushed aside. I admittedly wasn't as patient for Young as I was for Fellaini, but I had a feeling Van Gaal would make him improve as soon as it became obvious that he was staying with us. Had no idea he's improve by this magnitude though.


Fantastic statistic. World Class? Probably not. Efficient? Most definitely. He's clearly a confidence player and right now, he must be on cloud 9. Forming a lovely partnership with Blind too. 

One of my favourite United players now.

2532~~~
Something which I think has been crucial in his turn around. In all his time here, regardless of his form, he has always been happy to let a little knock get the better of him, he used to play it to the crowd, limping around etc but since he has cut the bad diving out, he really seems to be getting on with the game. If he takes a knock, he is getting on with it and it's great to see because it was my biggest fault with him in previous seasons.

2533~~~
So true. Football have no qualms about demanding a player be sold (Ala Cleverley, Young, Valencia etc..) to fund a shiny new purchase but will throw a hissy when someone leaves them for a better team.

Absolutely deserves a new contract.

2534~~~
Just watched his goal and celebration again. His passion is just brilliant.

2535~~~
So is he worth that £120,000 now? Joking aside though, what a performance and what a revelation he's been this season. If you had told me at the end of last season that we would buy ADM, but due to Young he would mostly be benched, I would have laughed in your face. On one hand I would love to give ADM a run in the team, but would I do that at the expense of Young at this moment? Would I feck. Nice problem to have though.

2536~~~
Has been in good form for a while now, but that was his best game.

The guys who refused to admit he'd played really well against Villa must be struggling to slate him after that!

He's got to get back in that England squad now. Should probably be starting, let alone in the squad. Who's keeping him out? An off form/tired Sterling, and out of position Danny Welbz?!

2537~~~
In the long run, if Angel is made of anything at all, Young's form will be the best thing that could have happened to him. Young has taken on the role of Park in the team, and I'd argue taken it on to a new level this season. He has been excellent of late.

2538~~~
I thought he would (and should) have been first out of the door last summer (or the summer before, etc). Credit to him for fighting for his place and doing well. I remember when he first signed for us he had some great form, and has had a few little patches here and there as well, but I think he is now achieving a much better level of consistency than he previously has.

2539~~~
As a person who's slated young in the past. Have to say I'm amazed and pleased with his form. I wouldnt say he's 'proven doubters wrong' because the criticism was warranted. 
But one of the best things about being a football fan is when someone you have so little confidence in turns in brilliant performances .

2540~~~
Funny that. I've never thought of him as a serial diver. He milked out tackles of course, but it is no more than most of others. You watched Giroud on last weekend, he has the body like a tank, but goes down at the slightest touch.

2541~~~
I don't know how I missed this yesterday. Found a gif of it luckily, imagine when Messi does this.... <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Hopefully we don't hear much more from ADM fanboys now whinging that young gets a start over him. That wing is owned by Smashley at the minute and no other player should be considered.

2543~~~
Wow didn't realise he nutmegged him. Glorious! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2544~~~
Look at the stick he's gotten the first 20 or so pages (which have been justfied at the time) and now, difference clear as day and night.

2545~~~
Sweet!

2546~~~
Exactly!

2547~~~
For some reason Ashley Young gets a rough deal by United fans. He's had a much better career at United than people give him credit. But he's had terrible fortune with injuries. This season mostly injury free he's been one of our star performers. He's played really well right from the start of pre-season and obviously enjoys playing under LvG. Rediculous he's not in the England squad!

2548~~~
I've just read another article that has Ashley talking us up and speaking confident. He's been doing that nearly all season and it's been fantastic. His attitude this season has been top notch and he's deserved to wear the shirt despite previous criticism.

2549~~~
he's was someone who came off the bench , if that , to being un-droppable. his last couple of months have put the words back in my mouth.

2550~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11535104/Luke-Shaw-My-debut-Manchester-United-season-is-only-worth-a-C-minus.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...er-United-season-is-only-worth-a-C-minus.html</a>

2551~~~
He is one of the many players in our squad who really love the club. The youtube videos when he is watching us with the fans tells you everything you need to know about him. I was sad for him last two seasons because it was clear that he is trying everything and that he really love to be at this club but it just didn't worked for him.

And as much as i was sad for him at that time i am happy for him now when he is playing well. I hope we give him new contract soon. He is really playing really well and i hope this performances will last for a long long time.

2552~~~
His performance on Sunday was the best of his United career, by an absolute mile. He was just brilliant. Not only the hard work and link up that he's shown a lot recently, but he finally added the end product that he needs. I still think he should be a squad player, but if he can play like that more often, then he has every chance of staying in the team for a long time. 

Hats off to the guy, he's completely won me round. Not just with his play, but his attitude and commitment too. Far too many times in his first few seasons he'd take the easy option, pass it back to Evra, or Carrick...now he's taking people on and putting in the crosses himself. The passion he's showing is fantastic too.

2553~~~
Zabaletta was one of the back right back in the league, and Young absolutely tore him to pieces <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2554~~~
If there was an award such as "Most Improved Player" in football, I'd give it to him this season. Whether at LWB or LW, he has improved impressively.

2555~~~
Holy shit. I just realized that Young is 29 years old and he turns 30 in the summer.

This changes everything.

2556~~~
I'd hook him off for Di Maria. He keeps getting in decent positions and then just passes it back to an under pressure Herrera

2557~~~
Needs to remember that he is there to create and score goals. Come on Ashley. Put in those crosses because Falcao is starving!

2558~~~
Was stone average today

2559~~~
Ashley Young of old today, offered no creative spark after the first 15 minutes.

2560~~~
This is why I'd like Di Maria to start next game. Young had the game of his life last week but most of the time he serves up this sort of performance. Lots of the ball with no end product at all.

2561~~~
You can't expect all our top performances to remain top performers week in and out. I'll take the Young we've seen in recent weeks any day, even with the odd one off mediocre performance.

2562~~~
Not great, but to be fair to him, he helped Shaw put in an MOTM performance.

2563~~~
He links up well with team down the left. Thought he was good today.

2564~~~
He wasn't bad, but today showed his limitations and why we need better than him.

2565~~~
This

2566~~~
released the ball to Shaw pretty well got him to decent places, apart that he didn't do anything spectacular and was too tidy, they covered the width well though. I remember he was just okay against astonvilla and alot of people speculated with him being replaced by dimaria, well he was in the starting line-up and we all know what happened that day. I want him start again next game, he will have more space and time against Everton, Coleman likes to get forward and Shaw will be up and down the pitch with him and Young will find some space I guess, Our wide players were pretty much doubled all the time as Mou didn't really wanted to put in crosses for big Fella..

2567~~~
Just a painfully average footballer.

2568~~~
Such a strange reaction... He had been our standout player for many games before this one and Mourinho obviously set up the team to nullify him.

Which actually gave Shaw an opportunity to shine.

2569~~~
Yep agree with this a good squad player but not a starter if we want to be at the top table!

2570~~~
Well that's obviously not true.

2571~~~
Agreed.

Almost seems like people are waiting for him to feck up so they can get back on the "Young is shit" BW.

2572~~~
Wasn't great. Our width in general, baring Shaw, was poor with no quality and no real pace. Put say Nani in for young and I think we'd get a draw yesterday. Young was very good against City. Just yesterday there was a lack of quality. Too many times in the first half we got in good positions to cross but we kept turning back on ourselves

2573~~~
Well that just wasn't obvious at all. Clearly the space to attack them, particularly in the first half, was down the left and Young seemed timid and was happy to pass it back instead of attacking Ivanovic. He had a standout performance against City, against Villa he was very wasteful and did absolutely nothing going forward against Liverpool.

2574~~~
I don't think he played bad yesterday, but against the best opposition his ability is left wanting. He's fine against the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham even Shitty, but against the very best not really.

2575~~~
We lost yesterday because Rooney missed his sitter whilst Hazard took his.

2576~~~
We lost, but I'd hardly call Rooney's a sitter, certainly not on the level that Hazards was. Imo Chelsea, despite their gameplan actually had the better of the chances. De Gea handled outside the box, Hazard missed an open goal in addition to the chance he converted, and other than Falcao hitting the post from a tight angle we didn't really create a great deal for our possession. Chelsea done us up like a kipper really.

2577~~~
Exactly this. Not having an amazing game against the best side in the league in their own stadium is hardly the biggest crime going.

2578~~~
He's clearly better than average, otherwise he wouldn't have been so fantastic during our recent run.

2579~~~
Indeed. We could've won 0-2 on another day, just as we could've lost 2-0 yesterday.

2580~~~
Thing is, over the last two years, Ashley Young has been in and out of the team, due to injuries, and has never been able to impress due to lack of consistent game time. The consensus here was that he was just a shit player, as that's what fickle fans do. When he was able to play consistently and that, too, in a non-shit team, he's put in some <span style="text-decoration: underline">good</span> performances around one sensational one. Now, he's being a tad overrated.

Ashley Young has always been a good player, who just like Fellaini, was never given a proper chance to prove himself and subsequently, has always been made a scapegoat. Reading the praise for him and Fellaini is quite funny as people seem to be so shocked and surprised that they're able to perform at this level, especially, since they've been doing for quite a while, for their previous clubs. Young was a a terrific winger for Villa and Fellaini tore us a new one back in 2012, when he destroyed our entire team in 90 minutes.

It's great to see Young (and Fellaini) prove his critics and doubters wrong, but this is the best we'll get from him. He'll be 30, in July, and I'd rather we play di Maria and Januzaj over him as there's a good chance he may not be able replicate this standard next year. Moreover, his performances have been solid and nothing exceptional; it's just that, in the mind of many, he's considered so shit that these good performances are perceived as amazing and sensational (the Man City performance was, though). What I'd say to certain people is that you should stop under rating every damn player after every bad outing, give them a chance, and maybe, you won't be proven wrong time and time, again.

2581~~~
What I do like about Young on the wing is he tends to link up with the left back more whether it's Blind/Shaw where as Di Maria would rather use that left back as a decoy and run at players. Young has adapted to the system more because of that, he does what's best for the attack, not just "What might create a chance if I get past the 3 players"

2582~~~
Except di Maria has not played enough in this new system to be able to adjust to it. I'd also argue that in his cameos, of late, di Maria has tried to involve the left back/right back more; referring back to yesterdays game where he was looking for support from Blackett, who never responded and di Maria resorted to taking on the defender, himself. Before we start judging di Maria, lets wait till he's played in this system as recent games would show that he's taking a more restricted approach - his pass % has been 85%+ in his last few appearances.

2583~~~
Can say the same about Fellaini. It was just a tight game against well organized opponents. Di Maria didn't do anything against tired legs.

2584~~~
People here turn their heads so quick after one match. Bale has his average games too against big teams.

2585~~~
You cannot seriously be comparing Ashley Young to Gareth Bale...

2586~~~
I'm just stating the fact that even world class players have their off days. So why are posters discrediting Young because of   the Chelsea game and none of them appear during the winning streaks? If young under perform for a run of games then yes, he should be criticized but not just one game.

2587~~~
I agree with this. It goes from "he's our player of the season!" to, "he's not good enough for us." It's ridiculous. He was ineffective against Chelsea, it happens. It was disappointing but oh well.

2588~~~
LOL, so true. I thought he was partially neutralized by the fact that Zouma was cancelling out Fellaini, but he & Shaw were giving Ivanovic (& Oscar) a hard time. His crosses were just not as accurate as in the City game, but I didn't think he was our worst player and can definitely play a role next season, even if ADM finally gets it & Depay is brought in.

2589~~~
Nice one Youngy.

Can't help but feel sorry for those kids though... Just when they thought they'd be getting Rooney...

2590~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69160, @Elvis" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69160/">@Elvis</a> looks happy enough. Getting rid of the beard knocked 35 years off him.

2591~~~
Young has been much better than Bale in the big games this season.

2592~~~
Even average players have good runs of form, happens in every team in the league.

2593~~~
I'm not saying he's Ryan Giggs circa 1999, but he is better than an average player and has demonstrated it recently. He clearly does what Van Gaal wants out of the position, which is why he has been given the starting role over Di Maria.

2594~~~
Trust you me, there are plenty of levels between him and late 90's Giggs. He's starting because Di Maria has been poor and generally a hazard to our team. He's been mediocre for the best part of the years he's been here. Even on his current run of form, he can produce what he did vs chelsea.

2595~~~
He was excellent in his first year and scored a few crackin goals. Last year was a bust for just about all of our players. He's widely recognized as one of our most effective players this year.

2596~~~
Then our standards are pretty low if his first year was anything close to excellent. He had a good start, the descended into mediocrity. Was pathetic last season but as you say so were many others and this year he's been good/mediocre/good/mediocre.

2597~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.courier.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276434/Article/images/26364464/9893321-large.jpg" src="http://www.courier.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276434/Article/images/26364464/9893321-large.jpg"/>

this is a lesson in how stats dont always give a full picture. We all know that Young was utter gash last season (even longer than that in fact) and has been vastly improved under LvG, but yet his stats are actually only marginally better this year than last.

2598~~~
with all due respect to young, it could also be that while young is indeed a bit better than last year, he hasn't really been nearly as good as some have pointed out and has benefited from the rest of the team playing much better as a whole. 

this place is ridiculous in terms of building people up and tearing people down after wins and losses. if managers actually listened to what their diehard supporters say on message boards, they'd not have any players left to choose from. the same can be said in terms of praise players receive. imo young outside the match against city hasn't really done that much, but what he's done has been ok. i don't think it's up to the calibre of what united need (would he get in on any other top club in the world?).

nevertheless, i'm a big fan of good people, and it's clear young definitely falls into that category and there's no doubting his love for the club. he's a nice option to have on the bench, but i'd be very unimpressed if we went into next season with him pencilled in for the starting 11.

2599~~~
Young has been great this year, especially considering probably half his appearances were as a LWB.

He does need to improve his goals and assists output though. You can see why we are interested in a goal scoring wideman in Depay.

2600~~~
Just doesn't offer enough goal threat or penetration in a front 3 IMO, this is not a winger role, it's a wide forward role in 4-3-3.

2601~~~
Can't beat his man. Coleman found him very easy to play against.

2602~~~
Not good. Couple of decent games have masked the fact he's very one dimensional. Di Maria must be very frustrated at the moment.

2603~~~
Probably, but it's not like he can blame anyone but himself for being frustrated. Young has performed better than he has over the last few months.

2604~~~
I dont think LVG transformed young he just gave him confidence and has played him a role that suited him! he is still going to struggle to perform to the required level on a regular basis, a good squad player but no more than that.

2605~~~
I would be totally shocked if he would be starting instead of Di Maria next Saturday.

I like him and would keep him for next season but his role can only be as squad player.

2606~~~
DI Maria has not shown anything to say he deserves to start ahead of Young tbh. Di Maria wastes a lot of opportunities and chances, which wouldnt be too bad if he was still scoring / assisting in every game to provide end product.

Young linked up well with Shaw. One thing that annoys me is whenever Young cuts in and crosses, why does nobody ever go back post? Fellaini did it against City but cant remember many other times.

2607~~~
To be honest, he stilled looked our best attacking player to me, and the one most likely to create something - moreso than Fellaini, Herrera or Mata.

2608~~~
<a class="username" data-user="35287, @Twigginater" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/35287/">@Twigginater</a> 

Hopefully you can tag me after WBA when Young plays well, if not then Palace! That's the problem, we have to wait a few weeks before you can do it again! 

I suppose you'll be telling me about how David Moyes has been vindicated now, Liverpool winning their game in hand puts them 4 points behind us!

2609~~~
You spelled "frustrating" wrong.

2610~~~
Tuned into a nice back up player for us, but it's time for someone else to take his spot, likely Di Maria.

2611~~~
We've witnessed the nice transformation from whipping boy to important squad member, so now I'm expecting the goods consistently. No wide man can start week in, week out for a club like United and fail to put up the numbers.

Harsh, maybe, but that's two weeks in a row. He needs to contribute more regularly to justify his inclusion in the team. There's only so long you can admire what he's been doing, I'm at the point now where I want to see him creating chances and contributing towards goals every week.

2612~~~
If he's still starting for us on a regular basis next season, something has gone seriously wrong in the Summer, as harsh as that may sound.

He's more then earned himself a new contract and a place in the squad, mind.

2613~~~
Same is true of all our attacking players and if they all ticked those boxes every week we'd be in a title race. 

The problem we have is that nobody is giving Young a meaningful challenge for his place, so when it's not his day we're toothless. Be nice to think that English football's most expensive player ever could put some pressure on him for his place but, alas and alack....

2614~~~
I think it's telling that Young has what, two goals and three assists in what's being hailed as a great campagin while Di Maria's got three goals and 10 fecking assists and is "rightfully benched".

A Di Maria playing out about a quarter of his potential is still a much better player than Young.

2615~~~
Di Maria looked very good for a month or two. At his best he was way more productive than Young (albeit much poorer, defensively) Hence he looks decent on paper. Sadly, the season is several months long and being good on paper won't cut it.

He played today, by the way. Almost thirty minutes. Wouldn't blame you if you didn't notice.

2616~~~
Even Di Maria totally off form produces moments that wins matches and unlocks defences.

Young, good match vs City aside, does not. Simple as.

2617~~~
Tbf, Di Maria was an absolute disgrace today.

An Ashley Young, who couldn't beat Coleman for love nor money, looked 10x more threatening.

2618~~~
No, that's not true. Again, I refer you to the fact he played today.

2619~~~
True, but then you look at Mata and Rooney of the front three, as well as both Herrera and Fellaini behind them, and all of them have put up considerably more numbers than Young. 

Even Di Maria, who you go on to criticise, has directly influenced our goalscoring in a way Young hasn't in spite of his admittedly irritating general play. His cameo today, which was shite, still lead to him playing a lovely ball into Falcao, as well as whipping in a great ball to Young at the back post, which he duly made a pig's ear of. 

And that's my point, Young's upturn in form is admirable to a point, but I want to see more given he's seemingly a regular starter.

2620~~~
My problem with him in a nutshell.

2621~~~
Well, none of them were any good today.

Come on Pogue. 10 assists/three goals for Di Maria. Three assists/two goals for Young.

And that's with Di Maria "off form bar one or two months".

How about playing him, getting his assists and moments of brilliance as a nice bonus, and hopefully let him find his form? You know, the key player in the CL winning Real Madrid campaign kind of form? Because a Young in peak form clearly hasn't got much more than this output in him, so either way it's no loss.

2622~~~
I agree with you that Young needs more end product. Although his recent run has been productive enough, to be fair. He's been very good defensively, under Van Gaal. Which will also get him games. 

I'd also like to see him dropped if we had a really potent attacking threat as an alternative. If Nani was still here I'd give him Young's place in our next game. Di Maria's just been so shit though. And seems to be getting worse.

2623~~~
We can't let Di Maria play his way into form when he's such a horrendous defensive liability. As a team we've been wank all season but finally looked decent when he was dropped. That isn't a coincidence. He just doesn't deserve to start every week, no matter how many scuffed shots have been converted into assists.

2624~~~
Really, we're going down the route of "scuffed shots" now, are we?

I guess Young's goal against City doesn't count since he scuffed his first shot against Clichy and it bounced back to him, then?

We're playing a diciplined 4-3-3 verging on a 4-5-1 when defending. We can afford Di Maria's dodgy defending as a trade-off for creating chances.

Even today he played a beauty in for Falcao that he could've converted if he'd controlled it on his chest instead of heading it from 14 yards.

Alternatively, we can play against teams man-marking Fellaini without any sort of attacking threat. I guess it's okay since Young does a good job defensively and all. Helped us massively today.

2625~~~
I get you. But after two defeats I think we could do with bringing back Di Maria against West Brom, just to freshen up the attack. If he reacts well to the nod then we could be in for a really good performance. There isn't much to base that on, I know, but the rewards could be great if we give him the opportunity. Neither Mata or Young covered themselves in glory today or last week so a day on the bench wouldn't be all that undeserving.

2626~~~
Bottom line is teams that play Ashley Young in the first XI as one of the main, creative outlets doesn't win the Premiership. 

That's what I'm getting at here, really. He's deserved his place in the squad but he's not going to cut it if we're aiming to win anything.

2627~~~
FFS Pogue, come off it.

2628~~~
Basically, this.

2629~~~
Might be harsh, but I wouldn't give him a new contract. I'm concerned that he's just had a good bit of form and converge back to his usual self. I doubt he'd drum up any interest anyway, so keep him but tell him to show good form next season to earn a new contract.

2630~~~
Yes, you're probably right. I was more arguing as to why Young has earned his place on merit. He was excellent in our best game of the season (one of the best in recent years) and has been a a key player in a really important run of games, so his selection has been completely justified. 

For the next game, though? Maybe we should shake things up. I just wish to feck Di Maria had made a more compelling case to start him instead of Young. He's just so dissapointing, every time he plays. It's painful to watch. Still, we might as well start him because we're looking very flat right now.

2631~~~
Taking his age into account we're blatantly not building any future side around him. He's a lowish bar to get over for anyone else that plays the same position, whether they're in the squad now or added in the summer. It's obviously not ideal that he's been our best option for so much of this season but that's the reality.

2632~~~
Which is why I'm arguing that playing Di Maria even completely off form would be wise. He'll bag us more assists and goals than Young anyway, and if he turns it around you've got a top tier player on your hands. No-brainer.

2633~~~
I just get irritated with people banging on about those 10 assists, as though this somehow proves he hasn't been poor for most of the season. Take away those two scuffed shots converted by Mata and Falcao and he's got the same number of assists as Chris Brunt.

2634~~~
Well you're arguing wrong. He got a lot of games when off form. He was crap. We dropped points. Got sent off, dropped  to the bench, we improved. No-brainer.

2635~~~
I don't think anyone would argue he's been firing on all cylinders, but for the ones you say are lucky there's a bunch of others that people blew that should have been assists against his name. 

He came on today and almost straight away put in our most dangerous through ball of the game. 

You can grumble about his overall performance all you like, but he creates chances basically every time he walks on the pitch, and will only improve with more minutes.

2636~~~
He's an absolute nothing player who had a few good games.

People like him because he works hard, and loves the club.

No other side in the top 4 would consider him as a viable starter.

2637~~~
In those games he still threatened and created chances, even when being quite crap. He's one of the creative outlets of the team. His job is creating chances/goals. I'd gladly take that ahead of Ashley Young and his non-existing end product.

Like I said even today, if Falcao's anywhere close to the level a United striker should be, that's a clean strike at goal from Di Maria's brilliant through ball.

He created more in 30 minutes than Young did the entire time he was on the pitch. From my wingers, I want chances.

I don't think that's wrong. I think it's obvious.

2638~~~
And his chance creation stats? Young has played well recently but it's so clear Di Maria creates an absurd tonne more.

2639~~~
Showed his limitations again. He can be very good in top form but that is usually for 4-5 games. He's still a back up player for me and I was surprised that he stayed on.

His main problem is his delivery. He has too little assists

2640~~~
He should have a good game today, Blind will be supporting him and Fellaini too. As he mentioned in his interview he has improved due to the coaching from Louis van Gaal and executing what the manager asked, I'm sure he will do that again, the trick lies in Louis van Gaal's preparation using his team mates to bring the best out of him, Fellaini moving to the far post so he can cut in and cross to a target but also Blind timing his overlap to draw one of the players closing him down away at the right moment.

I agree we need to improve on him, when you look at the wide players of our competitors (Bale, Ronaldo, Neymar, Suarez / Messi, Ribery, Robben, Sanchez, Hazard) then we need to target that level of quality. And he does need to demonstrate more consistency, he had a good match against City but has done little since despite getting the ball plenty, I think the trick to overcome his limitations is the understanding he develops with the players around him and it will be interesting to see how that left flank works together to find spaces against what is expected to be a well drilled defence, the right side also through their combination overcome the limitations of Mata (as a winger) and Valencia.

This does depend on the set up however, that isn't so obvious from the team sheet.

2641~~~
Man of the match? Righto. Zero end product yet again. Just another typical Young performance. He should have scored but didn't and not one cross met a United player. Waste.

2642~~~
The only player out there who looked bitterly disappointed.

2643~~~
Best player there. You can say "none of his crosses hit anyone" but they were dangerous.

2644~~~
My MOTM, put a couple of decent crosses in and plays with his heart.

2645~~~
I see few people praising him too and I don't get it. All he is good at lately is passing the ball to fullback. It's incredible how easy he is to stop when he is cutting inside, I think even Valencia is more dangerous when cutting inside than him.

2646~~~
Dire. No end product what so ever. Crossing the ball into the keeper's arms all game isn't 'dangerous'.

2647~~~
MOTM today in our team of course.

2648~~~
Not good enough. Not awful, for that see Di Maria. But a typical Young performance that is only deemed tolerable by some as its in contrast to his horrible form from last year.

2649~~~
He was decent again, I wanted him dropped for DI Maria but Jesus id be surprised if Di Maria gets a game again this season after that.

2650~~~
We're saying this every week. What good are these dangerous crosses if they're not good enough to land on a player's head or boot? 

He's a winger at one of the biggest clubs in world football and we're seriously impressed at the fact he beats his man once or twice and whips a ball into a box that inevitably gets cleared. It's not a charity.

2651~~~
He needs to learn to aim at targets when crossing.

2652~~~
I was disappointed, I thought he would have done well since he was always going to see plenty of the ball, Fellaini made it to the far post, Blind used his overlap to give him one on one chances but he just didn't do enough and against a parked bus you need more from your wide players as they are so important in stretching the defence, running at the defence (beating a man and so getting into a more dangerous area), putting dangerous balls into the box and making unpredictable runs inside into space.

The opposition prefers to be compact leaving space on the flanks so something needs to be done with that.

Louis van Gaal has done a good job with him but he can only do so much to help a player, it really is upto Young to be more aggressive (attacking the opposition) and creative.

2653~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2654~~~
Spot on. Another average performance from Young. But, hey, as long as he can pass the ball sideways and keep those "dangerous" balls coming in, why complain?

2655~~~
Am I the only one who thinks that he really should have scored from RVP's rebound? All he had to do was to hit it first time.

And I don't get why are so many people voting him as our MotM. I agree that he is now playing better than the garbage that he used to put up in the past but this is no way a good performance. It was average at best. A starting winger for a top club should have more than 2 goals and 3 assists too. What's the point of "putting some dangerous balls in" if they never results in anything?

2656~~~
Agreed. We need di Maria to step up though.

2657~~~
I missed the game today but let me guess, another good hard trying performance with nothing to show for it?

2658~~~
Aye, the standards have dramtically fallen at this club. No wonder Fellaini, Valencia and Young are our current heroes. 

Can't wait for him to sign a contract extension.

2659~~~
I thought he was decent, but nothing great. Not sure what happened to his form after the City game.

2660~~~
Both his and Valencia's crossing is woeful. I've been on about this all season, but there's no intention with them. It appears to be a percentage based hit and hope rather than them getting their head up and setting the centre forward up. Not that it would matter though because the overall ability and technique is pub football standard. How these two can float useless cross after useless cross all game every game is beyond me. How many are caught? How many go to nobody and are easily cleared? How many go miles over everyone and end up on the opposite wing? How bloody hard can it be??

2661~~~
I thought that too but also Young tends to need to control the ball, that has actually happened a few times this season from my memory and so I wasn't surprised. It's one of the things he needs to work on in the summer because in the possession system we will find teams parking the bus often and there will be those types of chances were a shot hits the keeper with power and he manages to parry it to the side a bit but it will fall into the path of one of our wide players.

Fellaini also had a chance when the ball came out to him in the box and a number 10 should have volleyed that into the corner, at least hit the target.

2662~~~
I disagree completely about Young, thought he put several good crosses and it just highlighted our lack of ariel threat in the box

2663~~~
I thought he was probably our best attacking player over the course of 90 minutes. Considered him as MOTM, went for Smalling but Young looked threatening and had the beating of the defenders. The only way I felt we looked like scoring was from Young creating something on the left.

2664~~~
The fact that Ashley Young, a winger who can barely beat a man or put in a cross that reaches a team mates head, currently looks like our most threatening attacking player tells you everything you need to know about how utterly shocking we've been in the last 2 games.

2665~~~
In fairness, he's been good by any standards. He and Smalling were the only two to emerge with much credit yesterday.

I take your overarching point though. I'd have expected some of the squad's leading lights to be stepping up to the mark a little more at this stage.

2666~~~
Tell me more about these crosses. Does Valencia actually complete crosses?

2667~~~
I have already mentioned this, and i really believe he sets us back even more than Fellani, when he plays as a winger in a LVG system, wingers are allowed to express themselves there are part of the 4 attacking players except CM's who are allowed to be creative, and 90 % of the time his only trick is coming inside and cross, if the opponent in showing him outside he will mostly just pass it back into the midfield rather than taking him on the outside, and he doesn't even look up and try to find a player, his best game was City at home in which i am the first one to say he was brilliant, but can we really accept a player who will have a good game in 1 match out of 10, is it acceptably at this level we are aspiring for?

I read above somebody said his crossing only highlighted out lack of aerial threat, which is not true, even if you have a single striker in the box and you are actually aiming for him and try to pick him out then he has to win most of the time the header against the CB marking him, but if you are just crossing it in the box with hit and hope and not really seeing where strikers are then you will mostly play it in the zone where there is nobody except their CB's and it would seem we are poor aerially, the only time this type of crossing looks good is when there are plenty of targets in the box, not when there are one target and you are just crossing with hit and hope. I was watching Seville vs Real Madrid yesterday the first cross of Bale yesterday was a perfect example of what i am trying to say, he had only Ronaldo as a target and Seville had two to three defenders but he looked up and played at ball at the far post, he actually tried to pick somebody out rather than just hit and hope, thats what our wingers should go and have the balls to take on the players.

2668~~~
He isn't good enough. I have no idea why the caf have had a love fest for him lately.

No other side in the top 4 would have him - he's bang average.

2669~~~
It´s always been the case with him really, his crossing looks good, but there are very few of them that actually make it to a United player or even look close to getting to our player. This lack of end product, even during this patch of good overall form for him, can not justify a starting place here. He's almost thirty, playing the football of his United career, and still there's very little to show for it. We need to give the starting place to someone who actually has the potential to lead us forward, Januzaj or Di Maria.

2670~~~
Pretty much this. There is no link up play, no dribble past the defender and, worst of all, never a quality cross. He had a great game against City but other than that he just lacks quality

2671~~~
How apt. Unwanted and lying on the ground

2672~~~
Hopefully the signing of Depay causes a reaction in him, we need it, against the parked buses there is space on the sides so the wingers are very important and let's face it, Mata isn't a proper winger.

2673~~~
Did you put it there?

2674~~~
I can't help but feel that Young is getting overrated by some people. He produces very little considering how often he finds himself in a dangerous position. He is good at beating a player but then hits a very shitty cross. I'm glad he hasn't been offered/signed a new deal and I don't think he's the best option we can achieve for our squad. 2 years of absolute crap shouldn't be rewarded with a new contract. He's coming to an age where we can only expect less in the future. If woodward has any sense he will cut him loose.

2675~~~
Think he's been good today.

Honestly, if Depay had played today like this, everyone would go mad.

2676~~~
Last 15 minutes he's been Ashley Ronaldo.

2677~~~
Our best player by country mile.

2678~~~
position rival new signing and waiting for a contract combine<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2679~~~
He's been pretty good all season apart from a few periods where everyone was shit. He's been so much better than his goals and assists suggest, especially considering how much of our attacking outlet is down to him. His lack of assists isn't all his fault either when he's being put in one or two great crosses every game. It's not his fault some of our players can't put the ball in the back of the net.

2680~~~
The criticism he gets compared to someone like Mata is am absolute disgrace.

2681~~~
And most important, his work rate is fecking fantastic.

2682~~~
anyone got a stream?

2683~~~
That too. You can tell he loves the club despite the fact that a large number of United fans have had it out for him.

2684~~~
Been brilliant today, motm.

2685~~~
Brilliant!

2686~~~
Easily MotM.

2687~~~
well done Ashley Young. You're despised by many idiots on here, but you've had a great season for us.

2688~~~
Brilliant is a bit much. He was decent enough and worked very hard as always.

2689~~~
He needs to run at people more ofte,  he has it in his locker

2690~~~
Beside Dave our only good Player today.

2691~~~
been performing very well for a decent chunk of time now.

2692~~~
Yep. Was much of the same old. The right back for Palace was horrendous, but even then Youngs crossing wasn't the best but hey ho!

He'll walk away with two assists, so I suppose job well done on his part

2693~~~
I'd rather have him than any of the so called superstars this season. They need to take a good look at him.

2694~~~
I bet people still say we should sell him.

Sell our only player who looks like creating anything at all.

2695~~~
Another good performance - he is been our most dangerous attacker for the past couple of months, if not more. Doesnt always get the final ball right, but has been the only player capable of beating a man and looking capable of creating something consistently.


Gave him my MotM today, was close between him and De Gea though.

2696~~~
Thought he was quite average for a large chunk of that game till he turned the heat on and carried us over the line in that 10-15 minute period. Still has to improve his crossing.

2697~~~
Another brilliant performance from Ashley. He might even be our POTY (I am not counting de Gea - he is too good)

2698~~~
I love his ability to turn up when things aren't going our way.  He may not be the best player in the team in terms of ability but some of the other players could learn from his attitude.

2699~~~
Agree, thought Ward was poor, but credit to Young as he did really well to beat him on a few occasions. Just don't understand how he was brilliant, still had his fair share of wild, wayward crosses, indecisiveness, loitering on the ball for too long or being easily musclebound, but he did enough in the game to merit a decent performance. He wasn't 'sensational' or 'brilliant' by any means though.

2700~~~
Decent in the first half, went missing for 20 mins after half time but then ran his fullback ragged for the last 25 mins. Good performance

2701~~~
Memphis can learn a thing or two from this man!

2702~~~
Outfield player  of the year.
Who would have guessed!!

2703~~~
He isn't despised at all. Stop trolling.

2704~~~
He contributed today, which is what I wanted to see. Well done.

2705~~~
He was brilliant, everything went through him, literally.
He's pretty much playing for his future and he stepped up to the plate which is more than can be said for some of the other deadites playing for us.

2706~~~
If we've paid £25m and he isn't better than that I'll be disappointed.

2707~~~
He was involved in both goals and worked non stop, good performance.

2708~~~
One of our best players this year. Just wish he was a bit better with his left foot.

2709~~~
Don't think he's been that close to POTY. He's been very poor since the City game and has been thoroughly inconsistent, this season. Even today, his crossing was a sham, but you can 't criticise is effort. He wouldn't be higher than De Gea, Smalling, Carrick who have been on another level to the rest of the team.

2710~~~
He was brilliant. Only for De Gea unbelievable saves he would be MOTM. 

It gives me real hope that LVG can get so much out of him.

2711~~~
He was our most dangerous attacker even earlier on in the season although then it was from wing back. We badly missed when he was out injured for a bit after that.

2712~~~
He was until about two months ago

2713~~~
If Di Maria had put in a performance like this you wouldn't shut up.

We're talking about him relative to his team mates. And he's looked our most lively attacker since about December.

2714~~~
Our best outfield player this season period. Give this guy a new contract he deserves it. Always trying every game.

2715~~~
Agree, i actually voted him player of the season on the official website last week.

2716~~~
No, he was criticised for playing shite. It isn't rocket science, this; if a player is good or bad then we call a spade a spade. His previously cowardly attitude and diving wasn't very endearing either.

2717~~~
Shows some bollocks, which is more than I can say for some of this lot.

2718~~~
I thought he was poor, yet he was our best player, which doesn't say a lot about our team. FFS, I want this season to be over.

2719~~~
If he "doesn't always get the final ball right" (which is putting it lightly) then what use is it <i>looking </i>threatening consistently? He consistently gets into good positions and uses the ball poorly, and somehow that's worthy of praise...I find it absolutely incredible. He averages 5 unsuccessful crosses per game (out of 6.7 crosses overall) which puts him in 11th place for the most mishit crosses in the league. Worse than someone like Yannick Bolasie who people regularly criticise for having a poor final ball and use it as a reason for him still being at a midtable club. The only players who cross it more often are Trippier, Downing, Navas, Albrighton, di María, Moses and Tadic, and in terms of end product he's at the same level as Trippier, Albrighton and Moses and a level below Downing, Navas and Tadic.

We used to criticise Nani for far, far, far less. Our standards for good wingplay have dropped to such a low level it's sad.

2720~~~
Well earned MOTM.

2721~~~
True. He really does deserve some credit for the way he's fought back this season.

2722~~~
I was always in the pro-Nani brigade anyway, for what its worth.

<i>"looking threatening" </i>isnt enough by itself of course, my point is simply that <b>its a start.</b> And it is more than what some of the much-lauded superstars have been doing.

Today Young created both of our goals. Prior to today we hadn't scored in 3 games. Obviously that isnt good enough, but I fail to see why the blame should lie with Young rather than Mata, Rooney or Herera, all of whom have essentially provided less than Young over the last month.


If we were banging in goals for fun, and the other players I mentioned (as well as Di Maria) were firing on all cylinders, then I would agree that Young would need to up his game, but at the moment he is the last one of our attacking players that deserves criticism.

2723~~~
Criticized for playing shite despite better than most of our other creative players who get away with it.

Posts on how he should be sold when his stock is high when he's the only one giving a feck and trying to mix up things going forward.

Probably the player who gets the most unfair stick on this forum. At least he tries to create eh

2724~~~
Excellent today, best outfield player on the park by a distance.

2725~~~
I was referring to his shite performances prior to this season. His upturn in form recently has quite naturally resulted in a resurgence of popularity.

The stick he was receiving wasn't unfair prior to this season. And the most recent stick, I've been vocal on this, in regards to his direct contribution on the pitch, was also warranted. He changed that today by directly winning a penalty and setting up the winner.

I'm pleased for him. I just think it's weird that the usual suspect(s) on here are using his good form as a means of criticising other posters for previous legitimate criticism.

2726~~~
You don't have to look that hard to if you want to see people giving him stick. Last week should be recent enough and the week before that and one before that as well...

People are waiting to for him to have bad games and when he has good ones he they want him sold because his stock is high<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2727~~~
Bula
Sorry Brwned but I'm not having that.

Stats are useful but they're a load of shit for stuff like this. Di Maria might get an assist when Rooney controls the ball out of thin air and smashes it in but Young gets nothing if the keeper stretches to it and it narrowly misses am attackers head. He's been MOTM today, easily for our outfield player.

2728~~~
To be fair I never went overboard on young At all. I  always felt he gets a hard time and a lot of the time he was better than was given credit for. He often helped out extremely well defensively but when was short on confidence his attacking game suffered badly at times. The abuse he received was pretty horrible IMO

2729~~~
Great performance, apart from Fellaini he was the only player that looked at all dangerous.

2730~~~
Oh sod off. 

His crossing was sub par, all game. That was as close to a recent di Maria performance as you can get. Take the cross for the penalty, why was it aimed at Dann and not Rooney? The right back had the best of him for ages, which was why Young was forced onto his left foot for large parts. Credit to him that he took advantage when Crystal Palace sniffed blood. Had they not, it would have been another bland Young performance.

2731~~~
It was aimed at Rooney I believe. He was trying to curl it past Dann and onto Rooney's head. Also had a cross towards Mata and then the cross towards Fellaini.

Good going.

2732~~~
Aimed at Rooney? It went straight to Dann, though. Pretty useless aim. Good of you to point out at his accurate crosses, also nice you missed out the fact that he attempted 10 and 6 failed to reach a man.

2733~~~
He was really poor. People seem to be using his assists today to counter that but Nani used to get lambasted on here for performances like that, where he constantly got into good positions and fecked up or made the wrong choice.

2734~~~
You can't be serious ? Nani never got slated for such a performance with 2 assists And he didn't even feck up situations much on average.

Motm for me just ahead of De Gea.

2735~~~
Was very average the past 3 games but today rediscovered his mojo a bit though didn't make it count enough. The penalty and cross for goal were great but he had that palace RB on toast all game and maybe should have delivered some better crosses first half. Great game overall still.

2736~~~
Eh? How do you work that out then?? consistently beat his man and was a great outlet for us on the attack created a 2 goals and very nearly scored as well. I cant see how you come to the conclusion he was poor, ok not everything he tried came off but on the whole he had a great game and was our most threatening player by a mile.

2737~~~
Can't believe Young is getting stick today. He got two assists, and drove their RB nuts - yeah he had a little poor spell in the match but easily the best outfield player for us.

2738~~~
His crossing was absolutely abysmal for the most part after he beat his man though, that's my point.

I simply expect more from a Man Utd winger. I don't see a long term future for him here.

2739~~~
Doesn't really matter. 1 cross won us a penalty and a second one ended up as a goal courtesy Fellaini. More like 10 crosses and 2 of them resulted in goals. I'll take that all day long.

2740~~~
He seemed to be the only player willing to hold on to the ball for more than 2 seconds whilst in the attacking third and looked like the only genuine threat we had today and I think the team agreed judging by the amount of times they looked to pick him out. Kept plugging away and trying to be positive and deserved man of the match if only for sheer determination. 

His quality will always be questionable but he has really shown desire, commitment and courage sadly lacking all to often with many of his team-mates this season and he hasn't shied away from responsibility.

2741~~~
Thought some of his crosses were either a bit rushed, or blocked, as Palace pressed us hard all day.  It's not like he had all th etime in the world and then delivered a shit cross into nowhere.  Some of the criticism is a bit harsh, considering many others were well below par.

2742~~~
For the record I agree he was probably our best outfield player today, but that doesn't say much. I just can't ever watch Young play and think that there's a player worthy of being on the wings for us. He's not good enough.

2743~~~
Some of his crosses were poor but feck me, he put in the effort and work. He must of touched the ball twice as many times as the next Utd player.

2744~~~
My MOTM. I think this philosophy is missing a little bit of stick the ball in the danger area sometimes.

2745~~~
If you think young is not good enough for us (and i'm not saying i disagree) then i'd shudder to know what you think of some of our other players.

2746~~~
I didn't think his performance was anything special today, average at best.

2747~~~
Oh yeah me too, buddy. Something I've argued in the di Maria thread. It's about results, and Young delivered that with the shoddy cross for the penalty and a good one for Fellaini. Overall, I just thought it was a performance almost identical to much maligned di Maria performance against Liverpool. Poor passing, both utilised their pace well, inconsistent crosses, yet both created a penalty and assisted a goal. I gave Young a 6/10; like I said, it wasn't a great performance, it was a efficient one and one which requires improvement if he is to continue starting, next season.

2748~~~
I've never considered him good enough for us. He's just playing well for the first time in three fecking years every now and again.

Valencia was the only other starter tonight that I don't think is good enough for us going forward. It doesn't help them that they're both nearly 30, mind.

2749~~~
What about Evans?

2750~~~
He didn't start <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2751~~~
He was lucky today same as di Maria was lucky with some of his crosses people are accusing Angel of, because that cross was Young's usual overhit cross that would end up out of play or in this case in keeper's hands if their defence didn't make the comedy out of it(or if Falcao didn't foul their player). Usual Young's performance, only thing that I always like about him is his attitude and character, but he definitely lacks quality to be starter for us. But then so are few other players.

2752~~~
That's fair enough.

I'd settle for Di Maria and Young on the wings for next season.

2753~~~
His crossing was terrible at times.  I like him because he's quite often the only one that seems to provide any kind of threat.  I do however think he's substitute material in the longer run.  Substitutes should be able to provide an impact, which none of them do at the moment, but he could do just that.  We've let our standards drop if you think he's plenty good enough, but it's far from a priority position.

2754~~~
With Depay, too. We should be sorted on the wings, now.

2755~~~
Yeah, that's how I see it. He should get some sort of award for his attitude this season.

2756~~~
Came here to say this but you beat me to it.

Wasn't terrible but its the exact reason why he's not good enough to start for us.

2757~~~
I can't believe Young is taking stick after that game.

For most of the match he was the ONLY player who offered something going forward.

2 Assists and MOTM for me... (only DeGea and him emerge from that mess with any credit- maybe Afro man for scoring the winner... but that's it)

Is he our best player?, hell no... but to bash him after he showed up to play in what was basically a MUST win game for 4th place is pretty churlish.

2758~~~
Agree with this. Young is having a good season but we need to look further ahead and there's where Depay comes in.

2759~~~
well you've made up your mind about him before today then.

he was the only player to who took other players on, and did it 3 -4 times.
One assist, a few crosses and our only threat today.

2760~~~
Because he was one of the better players he can't be criticized at all?  People can't say they don't actually think he should be the standard we aim for?
I've praised him a lot this season but we should be striving to get back to the point where he's substitute quality at best.

2761~~~
today he was our best chance of getting a goal, and our best player on the pitch bar DDG. People like you hold on to some old shit.

2762~~~
He did well in the second half except a couple of his final balls could have been better. Can't argue with two assists.

2763~~~
Hopenwe let him play on the right in the nexy weeks, hope we have Depay and Young next season.

2764~~~
I agree stats are a long way away from being the be all and end all but you're just making excuses here. Young doesn't create much. Di María does. You don't need the numbers to show you that but at the end of the day the numbers do corroborate what seems pretty self-evident. Di María is only more likely to get a lucky assist because he's more likely to take a risk and create something in general. Most of his assists have been great displays of the kind of creativity our team lacks and that he was brought in to help provide.

If Young was more creative he'd get more "lucky" assists. He got two today but funnily enough the people who scrutinised di María's assists to the nth degree aren't doing that with Young's. Go figure. If Dann hadn't inexplicably handballed it and Falcao hadn't fouled Delaney/Speroni hadn't made a complete mess of it then Young would've came out with nothing. I personally don't think that's a worthy criticism because what Young and di María both did in their "lucky" assists is ask the question, force the defender/keeper to make the decision and force the attacker to throw something at it.

That's what Young does nowhere near enough of. Most of his crosses aren't dangerous at all. He deserves credit for re-establishing himself in the team and showing he's good enough to play for United, but at the same time he's made it abundantly clear that he's not good enough for where we need to be. Most people are saying this is the best he's ever played for us. I don't agree but it's not far off, and that's exactly the point. He's playing close to his maximum and that just isn't good enough for a team with title aspirations. It's good enough to be a squad player though, and that's progress from last year. I'm delighted that we've seen that kind of progress too because he does have more passion than most. That's a great thing to have in a squad player.

Saying he's playing better than some "overpaid superstars" is neither here nor there. It's a strawman argument. We know that di María, Mata, Falcao, Rooney and van Persie can play better than this because they've shown in the past their top level is far beyond what they've given us so far. If it turns out that they can't reach that top level in this team for whatever reason - age, motivation, tactics - and they can only play as well as they have done recently then they will be surplus to requirements. We're not comparing Young against these "overpaid superstars" in their current form because in their current form they're not good enough. We're comparing them to the level of our competitors and the players we've had when we were competing for the title, and if you can't see that Young falls way, way, way below that standard then I don't know what to say.

2765~~~
Good enough against Crystal Palace but still very predictable.

2766~~~
It was nice to see a senior squad player take responsibility instead of deferring to others.  I got the feeling in the attacks leading up to the winner that Young knew he had the beating of Ward and wasn't going to let up.

2767~~~
Good post. Sums Young up for me, anyway.

2768~~~
He's nothing special but he plays with such passion and keeps trying on and on until he succeeds. Totally revitalized player under van Gaal.


Next season I think he will be a rotation option for both Shaw and Memphis on that left side. At least you can now expect a performance from him when he plays unlike his previous years at Manchester United.

2769~~~
Young criticism for today match is undeserved, its look like he will never be great for some fans.

2770~~~
To me Young looks a lot more likely to create things than Di Maria. Di Maria's last game was up there with one of the worst I've ever seen in a United shirt. Young was out MOTM today. 

BTW - I don't think Young gets an assist for that Dann cross today, it won't be included in his "official" figures. So overall he's not got as many assists as Di Maria, bt he's been a lot better

2771~~~
I agree. It was pathetically bad. Despite that he created probably the best chance of the game by putting it right on McNair's head, unmarked in the 6 yard box, out while Young tried and tried and tried and nothing came off. Kind of sums up the difference in class and danger they possess, IMO.

2772~~~
To me Ashley Young has been our best outfield player this year, so I don't know how much anyone out classes him in danger.

2773~~~
If he's been your best player, then it says a lot of our season and how far off we are.

2774~~~
Depends on how you want to define danger, I guess. If it's about beating a man and messing up the final ball then Young's absolutely out there on his own as our standout player this season. I find that more frustrating than impressive myself.

2775~~~
Won us the match today.

2776~~~
Not quite. He played wing back up until Christmas and was never great offensively; defensively, he wasn't bad. Since he came back from his hamstring injury, he's started 11 games in a row and was terrific against City, good against Spurs, Newcastle, Liverpool and Today and was poor in the rest (along with everyone else). That, for me, doesn't constitute the best outfield player of the season. I'd say Carrick has been near enough perfect in every game he's played, however, given his injury record, it may not be feasbile; Smalling after him and then maybe Blind and Young.

2777~~~
I was fuming early in that second half. Said to myself feck we are relying on Young to win it for us. And then he takes the initiative and gets it done. He keeps proving us all wrong. He deserves all the credit  and an England call may soon follow.

2778~~~
He did win us 3 points today.

2779~~~
Was great. Worked very hard and his passion was evident. Lacked quality on a few crosses but in the end he set up the goal that won us the game and had the beating of Ward a lot. Di Maria could learn a few things from him.

2780~~~
Yeah he had two assists and has worked very hard but 20 great minutes in the whole game aren't good enough for me.

2781~~~
He did relatively well. 

The sad part is that is considered a good performance at United these days. The standards at this club have taken a nosedive.

2782~~~
You've been slagging him off all season but strange timing to use that phrase in a game where he got two assists. No doubt you'd be waxing lyrical if Di Maria had put in the same performance. Feck it, just seeing him beat his fullback as often as Young did would have had people reaching for the superlatives.

2783~~~
Yeah he put his full back on his arse so many times, was brilliant to see.

2784~~~
Crossing is a tough art. Stands to reason the success rate will not be that high (I believe the overall success rate in the league was around 25% last season). And aside from that, he attempts to put most of his crosses into a dangerous area rather than try to pick someone specific out. Which means even his unsuccessful crosses are not wholly useless and can/have lead to scoring chances this season. Unless we sign a proper world class Left winger Young is not going to be displaced any time soon. Touch luck to the haters!

Liverpool game being a pretty good example. Was getting praised in some quarters for the assist ignoring that he was diabolical for the rest of the game. Far worse than Young has ever been this season.

2785~~~
I think it's undeniable that Young should be doing much better with his final ball considering the crossing positions and space he sometimes finds himself in(due to mostly his own work and some due to some incisive passing).

2786~~~
Come on his final ball was shocking yesterday. Think his lack of left foot was the reason but 3 or 4 times he ballooned crosses to the stands or out for a throw in. Still, considering his contribution won us the game, sort of then he has to get credit. Beat his man for fun too.

2787~~~
Provide the thrusts the team needed yesterday. Never shirks against the full back and always ready to help when defending. He is playing out of his skin at the moment. MOM if not DDG for yesterday's match. Looking forward to see him vs. Bellerin next. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2788~~~
I agree with the above posts. He's regained confidence in beating his man, but boy has his final product been suspect all season. He did manage one decent cross in the end but that was a bit iffy due to the Falcao/Speroni pushing going on. He really needs to up his final ball. And winning a penalty from an opponent hand balling is an assist? What?

2789~~~
Credit to his efforts and contributions this season. But he is not what United need in terms of first choice wingers..

2790~~~
They use the same argument people use for Di Maria saying how well he did to pass Blind who got a pen against Liverpool..

2791~~~
Wouldn't be a first choice winger though. We will need back up as the season progresses unless you feel we should be promoting the youth?

2792~~~
It's an assist. That's not opinion. That's how the stat works. He created the situation to deliver the cross all by himself and the cross obviously put the defender in an awkward position. Hence it was a decent cross. As assists go, it would definitely belong in the category where the assister deserves credit. Which isn't always the case with this particular stat.

2793~~~
Like when it's Di Maria you mean?

People rip into Falcao but what about when he sent Young through and he took an awful touch. What about when young got into a superb position (more than once) with players waiting and ballooned a simple cross into the stands? Same things other players get ripped into for. Pretty sure in Di Maria's appearance last week he put in 3 awful crosses but 2 brilliant ones. The different criteria for certain players and judging performances is as clear an agenda as anything.

2794~~~
Yesterday Young was our best player. Against West Brom Di Maria was our worst. There's no agenda posting going on

2795~~~
In regards to the assist stat, that's exactly what it looks like. Young was probably our best player yesterday but it doesn't hide that he was terribly wasteful for most of the match.

2796~~~
Way to exaggerate things.

The ball to send Young through reared up on him. Hardly an awful touch. If that's an awful touch then I'd hate to think what you've made of some of Falcao's touches this season.

2797~~~
What about all of his terrible crosses before the goal?

2798~~~
Not all of them were terrible. And they were more than made up for by the cross for the goal and being our only attacking who attempted to create anything. The rest were busy playing pointless one-two's on the halfway line.

No one's saying he's been putting up ballon d'or performances. Just strange to see him get stick despite him being generally a lot more threatening than any of our supposedly creative players.

2799~~~
Wait, that is the one he is talking about? He says other people have an agenda because of that moment?


BTW, has Young been fouled/crossed for another penalty this year?

2800~~~
I also can't remember him smashing four crosses out for a throwin yesterday

2801~~~
Assists, assists. Jeez, did you read what I said? It was clearly in regards to the crossing and assists. Also, yes young probably was our best outfield player but the team were absolutely shite. We've lowered our standards so much that people like yourself believe only a world class player putting in world class performances every week should replace young in the side.

2802~~~
Apparently it is not how the stat works. Which is bizarre. But it certainly puts into new light "He only has _ assists and _ goals all season thats not good enough for United"

He's now officially got 4 assists and two goals since the start of the season. Add in the penalty cross yesterday, suddenly a player who has played a proper part in 22 league games (feck knows how many as full back) and has contributed to 6 goals. About 1 in 4. I'd say if we include games as wingers, he's adding about 1 goal every three games, which isn't awful at all. He's also aided us with clearances off the line and sets up more as well.

2803~~~
No we haven't lowered our standards. It's just simple logic that you don't replace your best performing outfield player.

2804~~~
He is officially your new Welbeck.

He was for me MOTM yesterday too (despite De Gea's heroics). His final ball is really bad though, and Di Maria despite being in shit form still looks more threatening than him when he plays (which corresponds to his numbers too).

Anyway, for the overall course of the season I think that Carrick, Blind, Herrera, Mata, Fellaini and Rooney (probably Smalling too) have been better than young. Taking only the second half, then I guess it is between him, Fellaini and Herrera for our best outfield player.

2805~~~
As a matter of fact looking at whoscored (Ugh) he's played 18 games as a winger this year. He's got five assists and two goals in the league. That's contributing over a goal or assist every third time he plays. Hes also supposed to help defensively. Not bad.

2806~~~
He's certainly no Welbeck <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

I just think it's ridiculous his final ball is seen as worse than Di Maria's. Based on this year, ADM should be nowhere near a starter.

2807~~~
The only outfield player that isn't dispensable is Carrick. Nobody else has been good enough consistently. Rack out the stats and suddenly it looks like Rvp, Rooney an Di Maria have had good seasons.

2808~~~
He also works much more for the team than Di Maria. I know who I would pick out of the two and it's not even close to be ADM.

2809~~~
Don't think anyone is saying Di Maria has been brilliant or anything but he creates plenty more chances than Ashley Young.

2810~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We're fourth in the league. Two points from second. You don't need to get rid of 20 players to make that step up.

2811~~~
Not really what I said. I mean carrick is the only player who should be a certain starter, based on this season and how the team capitulated with him out of it.

2812~~~
Agree, but then again, this is Di Maria at his worst (he has been better in ever season he has been in Europe).

Di Maria's final ball is very good, and in fact has been very good this season. He has something like 13 assists despite not playing that much, being in a new league and not being settled. You don't get those stats by having a poor final ball. If he has played just an another 5 games, most likely he would have broken the all time record for assists when it comes to a United player for a season. The problem is that his all round game has been quite poor.

At the contrary, Young's final ball is quite awful. Yesterday he won us our match with those two crosses, but still on the majority of cases he beats a defender easily (something that he refused to do for the last two seasons) and then cross the ball to the corner flag. But he has had a decent all round game which is the reason why he has been starting for us.

2813~~~
You said the other players were dispensible! I took that as meaning to get rid.

2814~~~
I know he's a class player and of course I would keep him, but I don't think based on this year you can say his final ball is better than Young's. I would love a montage of his assists this year.

2815~~~
Well, he has 13 assists while Young has 4 or 5. I think that Young has also played mroe than him, so even from not watching the games it is clear who has the better final ball. And obviously, if you watch the matches it becomes even more clear.

Taking all things considered though, Young deserves to start above Di Maria. But on the other side, Young at his best (basically this version of Young or that of Aston Villa) isn't good enough to start for a team that wants to win league/UCL. Di Maria at his best has shown that he is good enough to do that. The problem though is how to make Di Maria play as good as he has been for Madrid. Because in this season, he has been poor with some moments of magic here and there. Anyway, until he finds his best form (or close to it) he'll be on bench and watch Young starting (on merit).

Depay might complicate things for Young though. I think that Di Maria (if he stays) will be either our long term attacking midfielder, or most likely our long term right winger. So, I guess that Fellaini and Mata are more in direct competition with him than Young.

2816~~~
I think you can add Herrera and Smalling to that list.

2817~~~
I agree with all of that. The only bit I'm now sure of is the "you don't win the league with Young" I'd argue you do, but he certainly isn't a star man.

2818~~~
Possibly, but Smalling's not reliable, as seen yet again with his latest set back. Herrera, yes, potentially. He hasn't looked anywhere near as good since Carrick's been out the side though, but I guess you can say that for most of them.

2819~~~
I'd be glad to keep young in the squad for next year. He's won over a lot of fans again with his hard work this season, and deserves to be in the squad. Don't see him as a regular starter though when we have the team set up next year. At least he can now play and do a decent enough job.

2820~~~
He scored 8 goals and had 12 assists in his first season for us where he had a great start but then awful, yet he was better than Di Maria's first season here. I mean if we compare stats like many love to do when defending Di Maria.

2821~~~
Not with him a starter/star man.

He can do a decent job as backup/cover for our new left winger (I guess that will be Depay), and even take responsibility and start when Depay will inevitably go into a bad string of games (it happens for all new signings, especially for young players). He has shown this season, that he can do a very good job. But our opponents have superior players in his position, so I guess we need to do better there.

2822~~~
Nani was also the best winger in the league for 2 years, overlapping this time. What does that matter? It was over 3 years ago now. Yes, Young's debut season was probably similiar to Di Maria's, some good games and lots of bad ones, it was the 2 seasons that followed that were useless.

2823~~~
I think that even those fans who really like Di Maria (for example, me) would agree with this. Especially on the first half of the season, Young was really good. Like this season, but with far better end product.

2824~~~
There's no agenda against Di Maria though as some would say. Young got so much abuse here (much much more than Di Maria) after the 2011/12 season yet he got 8+12.

2825~~~
My problem with Young is how he drifts in and out of games, without really having an impact. I would say he was a squad player, and a good sub but not a regular. Yesterday he drove into the box and laid it backwards but the Falcon was square on and all he needed was a touch. That's happened all too often with Young this season. Against Everton he ran out of ideas against two or three defenders, he is easily countered and that makes him not a regular IMO.

2826~~~
When di Maria set up Mata's goal and the penalty with two dinked through balls that cut open Liverpool's defence was anyone waxing lyrical? No, most people were busy criticising his lucky assists. I just said he was our most dangerous player, which is exactly what I said about Young today. I just asked what's the point of looking dangerous when ultimately it creates so little. Yesterday was a standard Young performance in which we were somewhat fortunate to get a helping hand from Dann and Speroni.

2827~~~
He's poor in the final third. What good is being able to beat your man if your next ball is wasted? He gets enough chances that eventually one of his hit-and-hope crosses finds someone, but he does not have a good football brain and more often that not picks the wrong ball. Him and Valencia are a huge part of the reason why we've struggled to create chances for so much of the season.

2828~~~
I think to suggest he's poor in places is a little too far. He made the assists yesterday, played very well at times but in some games he gets  completely shut out and has little in his toolbox to fix it. That's why for me he's not a regular.

2829~~~
You can obfuscate all you want about "helping hands" (and the cross for our winner would unsettle any defence) but he categorically did not create "so little" yesterday. He won us the game.

2830~~~
Perhaps we're arguing different points here. He played well yesterday and given it was one of the five games this season when he's managed to score or create a goal it has to go down as one of his best performances. The comment you quoted was about the season as a whole. The comment you've highlighted here is again about the season as a whole. Every one of my comments since yesterday have been about the season as a whole. Twigg's already given you stats above - 4 assists and 2 goals. That's pretty poor. Last season he had 3 goals and 2 assists from 9 less starts so he hasn't even improved his productivity from last year, and his lack of productivity is surely a big part of the reason you said this less than 12 months ago in this same thread?

We all acknowledge his performances overall are an improvement on last year and he adds balance to the side, but ultimately our wingers are there to provide a goal threat and he's still as poor as he's ever been despite getting in better positions much more often this year.

So it's bizarre when people say it about Young, but when people say it about di Maria it's fair game? Excellent.

2831~~~
I personally do not like Young, I think he has been a wage-thief most of his time at Utd, but he was far and away our most effective outfield player yesterday.

2832~~~
For where he's played this year, Young has got a good enough amount of goals and assists. 1 in 3 when he's starting as a winger isn't bad.

2833~~~
If only he would learn to look before he crosses and would try to find a teammate because he does all the work before crossing so well. He creates space for himself, he links up well with his LB and even Fellaini, he can dribble. The most important and most decisive thing is missing, an accurate pass because he could have had so many more assists or created much more danger this season.

2834~~~
If he was as dangerous going down the line as he is cutting in he'd be a serious player. On the one hand it's a credit to him and on the other it's a sad state of affairs that he's been one of our better players overall this season. He's managed to add a bit of end product recently too which has been important because for most of the season he wasn't creating anything for us despite the plaudits.

2835~~~
I don't know where the criticism is coming from. IMO we'd be a lot worse off without a much improved Ashley Young this season. He's provided the ability to take on his man, link up well, and inject pace to our offence. In contrast, our right wing is woeful and shiteous because of Valencia.

2836~~~
i think the point that i and and a few others have, is that young is lucky beyond belief that he even started with united this season. he's been horrible up until this season, yet he and valencia are given opportunity after opportunity after fecking opportunity to make something happen. even a clock is right twice a day, is somewhat apt.

nevertheless, he's been decent this year. nothing more, nothing less. it's just that the ceiling is so low with him, compared to what di maria can potentially bring based on precedent and based on what januzaj has in terms of potential. i don't think we'd be much worse off had di maria or januzaj been afforded those sames minutes that young has received.

2837~~~
Sounds more like Fellaini

2838~~~
Almost, have said the same about Fellaini. Young has improved on previous seasons but even this season he's drifted in games. I just don't think he should be an automatic choice.

2839~~~
He's the only player we have right now that is taking on and beating players. I can't find much fault in his efforts

2840~~~
That's true but when he gets shut out the consequences have been dire. It's like the rest of the squad a series of conundrums, which have to be resolved for next season.

2841~~~
Can't heap much blame on him considering the way teams have been parking the bus against us lately. Which other regulars in the squad have dug out something more when shut out by these tactics?

2842~~~
It's what he usually does after that that's the issue.

2843~~~
Di Maria's not shown enough when given the chance. You said it yourself, what Di Maria can <b>potentially</b> bring. Can we really know what Di Maria and Januzaj would've brought to the table given the same amount of time? Maybe they would've brought more to the table. But when Kagawa was around people were quick to slag him off for not showing when given the chance, and for me the same principle should be applied to Di Maria who cost a hell lot more and is more highly touted.

2844~~~
It's amazing how the Caf has went to such extremes with Young this season, guess it speaks to how the last 2 year have been.

2845~~~
Problem with Young is when he's shut out, he has no other options. IMO that doesn't make him a regular but rather a squad player.

2846~~~
I think Young will play plenty of games next season as cover for Shaw and Memphis. We have plenty of games with CL if we qualify, FA cup and league cup. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2847~~~
Incredible though how he turned around his career here. Kudos man.

2848~~~
Huge credit for resurrecting his Utd career. I still think he lacks that little bit of quality to really help us push for the title and CL next season, but (if he's willing to take a pay cut), I'd say give him a contract where we can keep him as a left sided utility player.

2849~~~
I have stopped bothering about his contract and his salary. What I would like to see is an upgrade on him while he becomes a utility squad player. A team like United should not be relying on Young as their wide player considering what we have had in the past.

2850~~~
True, but he's a more than capable stand in. He also loves playing for the club, which is endearing to see.

2851~~~
Memphis.

2852~~~
He should. He would not get anywhere near another top team of similar caliber.

2853~~~
I know but I have not seen a lot of him and don't know much of what to expect.

2854~~~
The manager trusts him enough to spend 22m on him, ignore his own policy of not speaking to players while the season is going on and personally intervening to stop the player from joining PSG.

2855~~~
The idea that he's been our best outfield player this season is just absurd, for me. He has 5 goals and 2 assists. I know numbers don't tell the full story, but that's poor, and often and not, goals and assists are one of the best ways to judge a winger. In their respective best seasons for the club, Nani and Valencia had stats way, way beyond that. I'd say if anything the stats show how torrid Young's end product actually is for us, because we're all clearly impressed by his 'transformation' in terms of how confident he looks, how he's beating his man, how he's on the ball so much and much more noticeable in games, yet his overall stats are actually worse than they were for us last year. 

It's just not remotely good enough for a Man Utd winger, or for any first choice winger at any big club, actually. I see little wrong with keeping him on as a squad player, but that's pretty much all he deserves. I don't think Young has ever done remotely enough to not be labelled one of the shittest signings that Fergie made in his tenure here, and that includes this season.

2856~~~
Bingo.

2857~~~
Just highlights what a sorry state our squad is in and how much we need to invest when we're applauding Ashley Young for successfully crossing the ball with some of the fans thinking it's something special.

2858~~~
You didn't answer the question though. Which one of our regulars has brought something else to the table when we needed it against a defensively resolute team? Rooney? Fellaini? Mata? Di Maria? We've collectively failed us a team to beat teams that shut us down effectively. Im talking about Southampton at home, Chelsea, Everton and West Brom. No one stepped up, no one. Mata was virtually invisible in those games and Di Maria looked like Nani on a bad day so why are you singling out Young?



So much for appreciation. If not for him we'd have drawn or lost the match against CP. He's had more MOTM performances than our highest paid players

2859~~~
Imagine we live in a world in which Ashley Young is genuinely a better player than Angel di Maria? Imagine?

2860~~~
Ashley Young is the best crosser in the country. City have Nasri and Navas who wouldnt cross a road between them. I could mention nearly every top team and say likewise.

2861~~~
He certainly has more bottle than di Maria, in the very world we live in right here.

2862~~~
England's loss and Manchester United's gain at the moment.

2863~~~
He's done well this season, like Fellaini I think he has secured himself a place as a squad player.

2864~~~
It definitely isn't any kind of loss for England, with several younger and more promising players who can play a similar role to him.

2865~~~
Fair enough, I'll rephrase that by saying in terms of form and end product he's definitely ahead of most of the English wingers picked i.e. Sterling, Townsend, Welbeck etc.

2866~~~
Simply not true. We are seeing (eventually) the same player Aston Villa had. Prior to his move to United only Cesc Fabregas averaged a better assist record over a 5 year period in the PL. So you are saying there are several young players for England who could match that feat over the next 5 years....big bullshit call.

2867~~~
What?

Why are you talking about Ashley Young in 2009? I'm not sure what that post even means. What happened 5 years ago at Aston Villa doesn't really matter and it should take more than a few weeks of unspectacular form for an England recall, unless we're hell bent on going backwards.

2868~~~
He's been the best English left winger in the PL this season! When Hazard doesnt play left side Ashley is the best PL left winger as well! 
So what you are saying about him and England is complete cr*p. John Terry is England best defender by a country mile at 34.

2869~~~
Ok mate

2870~~~
Jesus we have people wanting to give Nani another chance after 3 years of dross and getting booed off but for Ashley helping us get top 4 this season is still not worthy of praise. Laughable. Looks like LVG has judged the players rightly mind.

2871~~~
He's not been pulling up any trees but he's still been one of our best players. That probably says more about our team at the moment than Young himself, but still credit where credit's due. It's all relative. There's not been much to celebrate this season apart from securing top four, but one positive is the emergence of Fellaini and Young as solid options, at least at squad player status, for us.

2872~~~
Because this thread is supposed to be about Young!

2873~~~
Thats a serious cop out

2874~~~
He's been brilliant since he came back. People seem to be reluctant to give him the credit he's due for some reason

2875~~~
Don't know why people are getting so hung up abut stats. Young's contribution to our play has been several notches above Di Maria's. We actually offer penetration off the left with him taking on, <b>and beating</b> defenders and linking up well with Afro and Blind. Not to mention his defensive work. Nobody's saying he's the one who we should be settling for, but he's been crucial to us this season.

2876~~~
True very true.

2877~~~
Before Man City he had 1 goal and 1 assist all season. Take into account that 4 of his assists and the other goal came in 2 games then the productivity reads that he's produced something in terms of a goal or assist in only 4 games he's played this season (23 starts), if you look at it like that.

2878~~~
By Nani having a better season than any of our wingers? Well done LVG. Genius.

2879~~~
Definitely haven't had a better season than Mata and he's barely outshone the others at a significantly lower level of competition. Nani isn't good enough, and neither have our other candidate wingers been.

2880~~~
Mata isn't a winger. Champions league a low level? Alright.

2881~~~
Did he not play most of the season as a right or left wing back and occasional full back before the Spurs result?  

He's only just recently had a run on the left as a winger again.

2882~~~
Still, hardly any productivity. He has improved but that's because he was so bad before.

2883~~~
All this thread lacks is a "If he was foreign and had an exotic name everybody would have said he's world-class" post...


Yeah, he's got a good season by his standards, the only problem is that his standards are not so high.

He did well and contributed this year more than any of us would expect, but the truth is that we need better there and he shouldn't start every game.

2884~~~
More than half of his game has come as a starting winger. Only three as a full back. His wing back role was basically the same offensively as his winger role.

Before the City game Valencia had been more productive and effective from the right back spot but since then Young has been a lot better than Valencia.

2885~~~
Not a chance.

2886~~~
Wing back and occasional full back is a very different job position though and he should not be judged by the same standards of productivity as a winger which is basically what you are doing.

Young's basically been playing as a left winger since the Spurs game which if he only had 1 goal and one assist before then means he has managed 4 assists and one goal(if those CAF stats are correct) in 8 games as a winger which is generally pretty good going.

Shows to me that Young's basically been used as a stop gap solution because of Di Maria's suspension and done a generally good enough job to keep his place since then.

2887~~~
Playing as a wing back is a very different role to playing as a wide player in a 4-3-3.  You would expect much better numbers in terms of goals and assists from the latter.

2888~~~
According to whoscored he has started 16 matches on the left wing. A few of those possibly as a wing back, but then it also includes a further 2 as an attacking left midfielder. Didn't know the 5 assists included the handball... 4 proper assists then, and 2 goals. Half of that came in 1 game.

2889~~~
You can call it a wingback but his role offensively was effectively the same. He was even less marked than now because of the congested midfield.

2890~~~
So he didn't get forward, was expected to beat his man and put in crosses? Did he not stay out wide, hugging the line and make the occasional run forward when opportunity arrived?

2891~~~
Take into account Di Maria has started 19 matches, in 7 different positions (according to whoscored) and contributed 3 goals and 10 assists in the league. Young has started 18 of his matches on the left side/wing. Obviously general play is a big thing here, and Di Maria hasn't been anywhere near good enough in that sense, but stats wise, and comparing who offers more of a threat it should be a no brainer. Young's output is pretty shocking really.

Also, Di Maria has played a grand total of 144 minutes since Arsenal in the cup. Young has played 645. Clearly been given a much better chance of playing his way into form in one position.

2892~~~
His role was not "effectively the same".  He had far more defensive responsibility as a wing back on either side of the pitch when we played three at the back.  

In a 4-3-3 he actually has a full back behind him and his defensive responsibilities are far less onerous which means he spends far more time in attacking positions and in this system is allowed to press far higher up the field.  

The positions are very different.  You can't compare the two as if they are the same, especially when it comes to goals and assists.  It should be fairly obvious a wide player in a 4-3-3 is going to be expected to create and score more than a wing back.

2893~~~
Did you think Evra should have had plenty of goals and assists too then?
And no, I don't agree with you at all. It's a huge difference between the role he played at first compared to now.

2894~~~
I looked at whoscored and they basically have put down his games playing as a wing back as a left midfielder.  It's a weird way of classifying those games.  Anyone who watched us playing 3 at the back should be able to very easily identify that Young's role has been very different since we changed to this 4-3-3 system and dropped Di Maria.

I'm not arguing that Young should be a first team regular btw, I would hope Di Maria or Depay will have that role next season as I think they will be better players long-term.  I  just think that his stats and productivity should be judged appropriately  and fairly in the right context.   He's only been used as a winger in a very small sample of games this season and generally done well in the role.

2895~~~
Well, if it's between Young and Di Maria it's pretty simple for me, Young has performed for us this season, Di Maria just for a few games at the start of the season.

And if we should go on whoscored then Di Maria should not really be playing winger for us, as you know stats means so much for those who defend Di Maria.

2896~~~
They also show that he is being moved around more than any player in the league and not given a fair crack at one position in a settled side.

2897~~~
He has been given chances and not taken them. Simple for me.

2898~~~
We have signed Depay as well now.  I think Young has done well as a stop gap solution and has shown that he can provide goals and assists in that position, so he's proven his worth as part of the squad.  I would hope eventually though he would be able to coax something like Di Maria's best form out of him if we were looking to win trophies next season.  There's obviously a top class player there.

2899~~~
Young's first game as a winger for us this season was on 28th of feb against Sunderland. In the games before he either played left back or left wing back.
In 10 games as winger he has 2 goals and 3 assists, but also gives so much more to our team than Di Maria this season imo.

2900~~~
Nani helped us win a league title in the past yet doesn't stop you ripping into him. Young has hardly helped us that much even this season with his poor output. A better player in his place and we would have in all likelihood done better. In fact if Fergie hadn't made some dodgy signings in his last couple of seasons, with Young being a prime example, then there's hardly any doubt we'd be in a better situation than we currently find ourselves in. In that sense Young is a symbol of our demise and not remotely good enough to be a starter for United. Imagine him getting games at Barca, Bayern or Real? That's something truly laughable, yet when we bought him we were competing with these sides and we have the financial resources to do so again, so United's standards shouldn't be any lower. Young being a starter at United should be almost as much of a joke as the thought of him lining up alongside Messi and Suarez or Ronaldo and Rodriguez at the Spanish giants. It tells you exactly what has gone wrong when that isn't the case.

2901~~~
He's been used as one and his best periods have been as one. A champions League Group can be prettyu low level, Chelsea obviously arent' but he did feck all against them and Schalke is average and Maribor is Maribor.

He hasn't got a goal or assist against any of the top portuguese sides, while you've never even Heard of the ones he has scored against.

2902~~~
I'd guarantee you could stick any of our wingers out there for those 10 games and over 600 minutes and they would offer a bigger threat than Young. In comparison, in the same time Mata has 4 goals and an assist. Di Maria has 3 assists in under 200 mins of football, and no starts since Arsenal.

2903~~~
He's been our best winger (obviously not with us) this season, played well against the best clubs in Portugal and was one of the best players in the group stages. If Young can come back from exile after 2 seasons of complete dross then why can't Nani be given another chance? He done a lot more for this club than Young ever did but you would think he was worse than Anderson the way people speak of him.

2904~~~
Your right.  Forget he played in that position in that game and then the Newcastle and Arsenal match.

2905~~~
Come-back is a bit strong, he's done alright but people exaggerate IMO. He's not been that much better than he's been previously. His goal/assist output is actually worse this year compared to last year and just slightly better than the year Before that. But you can depend on Young to give 100% and to help out the defense, the same can't be said for Nani. When he's not firing up front, and he hasn't been for us the last 2 seasons, he contributes feck all. He's an incredibly talented player but he just can't translate it into his performances consistantly enough. Obviously not as bad as Anderson but not far from it in the last 2 seasons for us which is sop far from what we need.

2906~~~
He looks to have got a lot of confidence back from his loan spell. It would be a shame if we just flog him without giving him some sort of opportunity that the likes of Young has been given this season. Yeah, he offered nearly nothing for 2 years but that comes down to a variety of reasons, mainly injuries.

2907~~~
I think people are forgetting the main problem with ADM and that's the amount of times he gives away the ball. Young is far more efficient with the ball and, despite this, he still seems to be able to take it past his man with a simple drop of the shoulder or a nutmeg. This provides a much better overall contribution (and thus balance) to the team which is why he's getting the nod. ADM is a more exciting player, no doubt, but he's also a high risk player. That's why he's only been coming on when we've needed to offer something different and when the opposition is tired.

2908~~~
If Van Gaal trusts him then I'm all for giving him another shot from a squad player role. It depends on a few things though, mainly if we hire another winger for our right side and then on wether Januzaj stays or leaves on loan. I wouldn't have him back in any role which meant that we would be dependant on him, or in one that could hurt Januzajs development.

2909~~~
his end product is most certainly not as good as either Sterling or Welbeck, both of whom are considerably younger than him as well. In fact the main criticism in here is the fact that despite this seemingly great come back season he's having, where he apparently looks a player reborn and has been our best outfield player in the eyes of some (lunatics), he still has 2 goals and 4/5 assists total, and his end product is <i>worse </i>than it was for us last season!

2910~~~
and i'd wager he has had a lot more minutes as well.

2911~~~
oh geez. it was cina. i keep quoting him in here. no cina, i'm not following you, but i'll brace for a barrage of withering verbal abuse nevertheless.

2912~~~
If we have any designs on European glory Ashley Young should be nowhere near the starting 11. Nor should Fellaini, Valencia and Blind for that matter.

2913~~~
There is always space for Blind in the squad with hair like that. The glorious bastard.

2914~~~
this is not up for debate. and his performances in general have been excellent for us too.

2915~~~
This "beating his man" that people keep mentioning, is that when he moves the ball back onto his right foot 535 times before whipping a cross straight onto the centre backs head? I can recall Young beating a man about 4 times all season and 2 of them were CB's playing as full backs.

2916~~~
Did you watch the Palace match?  I can remember him beating his man 4 times in the second half.  It was simple as knocking the ball passed the full back and outpacing him but Young regularly beat Ward in the second half.

2917~~~
Brutally harsh, but bang on the money.

If we start next season with any of those 4 as 'first teamers' then something has gone seriously wrong in the Summer, and any hope of winning the title will be lost already.

2918~~~
I know where this sentiment and observation is coming from, they have definitely shown enough this season to still be here next season as part of the squad and offer options but if our expectations are set correctly they won't be starters, I can see the front 3 being very different (no Fellaini) once we get a more solid defence and dynamic midfielder to allow a more expansive and free flowing attack, the signing of Depay and LVG's recent comment on signing a player in the Carrick role is evidence of that.

2919~~~
Agreed, all four deserve a place in the squad for now. But none should be nailed on starters.

2920~~~
Evra played full back with a winger in front of him. Young as a wing back is a different thing.

2921~~~
I said his role offensively. He had the whole wing to himself.

2922~~~
I'd worry about CM, Striker, CB, and RB before contemplating of ditching Young. He and Fellaini are important squad players to win the league, or even Europe. We had Blomquist on left wing when we won the treble. And I think Young is better than Blomquist.

2923~~~
7 goals/assists in the games he has had as an offensive player is absolutely fine for him.

Especially because in so many important games this year he has won us points. Palace when we're worrying about fourth place, he's our best player. Newcastle away before Tottenham/Liverpool/Chelsea games and he pops up with the winner and also gets MOTM. Stoke at home in the season when we need to stop climbing the ranks and he's playing as a left back, in injury time he's clearing shots off the line and saving us.

He's contributed to so many important matches this year. He deserves all the praise he can get, especially as he also missed a bit of the season with an injury

2924~~~
Blomquist hardly ever played in fairness.

2925~~~
Blomqvist played 38 times for United in the treble season. That's not "hardly played"

2926~~~
How many times as a sub?

2927~~~
How many goals and assists did Evra get last season?

2928~~~
He started the final in Barcelona I remember that much!

Edit: 9 of his 38 appearances came off the bench.

2929~~~
1 goal, 5 assists in the Premier League
1 goal, 1 assist in the Champions League
1 goal in the League Cup
1 assist in the Community Shield
3 goals, 7 assists total

2930~~~
I know that my opinion will be a bit weird for some, but Ashley Young being our best player so far, is a very very bad news. I know that from his point of view, it’s just excellent because he has a great impct on the team, in the dressing room, and revealed as a leader… But in an other way, you will never see Pedro as the best player in Barcelona, never see Shaqiri (in his time) for Bayern, or Khedira for Madrid… In big clubs, big player are there and reveal, and this season he was our best player (as outfield player)

I’m sorry, but he was great at Anfield and against a struggling City at home, but he was anonymous at Chelsea and Everton, like the team…. He’s the type of player that will never step higher in big games…

I’m happy for him, but I would rather have Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, Van Persie, being our best players than Young, because they are supposed to lead the team to a certain extend in CL next year…

2931~~~
I completely agree with you, the United standard has really dropped, we tend to celebrate mediocrity these days, this is something that started after Ronaldo's blockbuster move to Madrid, Fergie has to take some of the blame, Ashley Young has had a magnificent season, probably his personal best but he really shouldn't be a contender for United's POTY based on his performances, we just happen to have a lot of players who are currently under performing which helps to highlight the likes of Young's contributions.

I guess the alternative would be to ramble on about our best players not performing so fans have chosen to praise the slightly above average players for their brilliant performance to promote positivity.

2932~~~
well that's why I included Fellaini (CM) and Valencia (RB) in there too. CB I agree, seems it's high on the list anyway, and while I agree Smalling, Jones and Rojo are not good enough, or injury free enough, collectively to form a partnership at the back, I do think they're good enough to form a foursome of CBs with someone else brought in. striker is also an issue, but Rooney is at least better than the other 4 players I mentioned, even though, ultimately, I agree we ultimately need someone more dynamic and younger up front, particularly to build alongside Depay.

2933~~~
Just forget that he was still playing as an offensive wing back before then and still expected to create stuff, and forgetting that half of his output came in one game in over 20 starts.

2934~~~
It really is not Young`s fault that our "star players" are not performing in a way they should. With all respect for him and Fellaini I agree that they should never be the standout players when you have names like Rooney, di Maria, Falcao, Mata etc. on the team sheet.

2935~~~
Not saying its his fault.

2936~~~
I don't think we should be judging performances on the players name. Young has contributed to the team and we've missed him when he's not been there. We're currently a far better team with him than without him.

2937~~~
I appreciate his performance against Palace. I don't appreciate most of his performances throughout the rest of his games in his nigh on four years here.

2938~~~
Yeah. I remember vividly that he featured in a lot of games that season. He had some fine performances too.

2939~~~
i'd like to state for the record that i have never, ever missed him when he's not been there.

2940~~~
It's a new regime. Rafael was the best RB we had under Fergie's last era, but he couldn't perform under LVG. Thus he's (most probably) out. Januzaj was electrifying under Moses but pants under LVG, then he'll be most likely loaned out. 

We should judge players by their performance (and potential) under LVG's era.

2941~~~
that, to me and a number of others, still doesn't count young in. he was pants for most of his previous time here, and now because he's not quite as bad as he was, he's worthy of being a starter for united? i have a problem with that.

again, the amount of lives this guy has is amazing. he shouldn't have been here here come september, but he was. he shouldn't have been in the lineup against crystal palace, but he was, an admittedly he played well. but the previous three matches he was utterly anonymous and for someone as limited as this 29 year old (ie someone who should be at their absolute peak), there really isn't a lot of sense in having him play week in and week out.

2942~~~
Well, there are other players that were pretty anonymous in these last FOUR games. We'd have to change more than half of the team then <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>.

2943~~~
The team has performed better with him this season than without. You must not enjoy Utd winning that much.

2944~~~
People just don't enjoy watching the players they hate have good games, period.

2945~~~
I don't think most are questioning that.  The point is we should be looking for even better.
I said before that I think Young would make an excellent sub for us and stand by that.  He can actually impact a game unlike everyone currently on our bench but for a starter I'd like someone better than him.

2946~~~
I'm sure we all would like somebody better than him but while he's playing well it doesn't matter whether his name is Ashley Young or Angel Di Maria. I don't think enough people realise that being a better player doesn't necessarily make a better fit for the team.

2947~~~
What a ridiculous statement. I've no hate towards Young and I definitely enjoy when he does something good for the club I support. That and my overall feelings towards his contributions to the club are not mutually exclusive.

2948~~~
I'm not questioning anything to do with his name or who he is.  Just that some people have lowered their standards of what we should expect at United.
He's stood out because everyone else has been poor while he's been averagely good.  He's earned the right to stay at United (and I definitely want him to after this season), but I think we should be looking at improving there, as it seems we are.

2949~~~
Who's actually done that? I don't see many Utd fans shouting from the rooftops about how good we are. Saying Ashley Young has had a good season isn't lowering standards. It's a reasonable statement. He has had a good season and made as good a contribution to the team as anyone bar De Gea. For a team likely to finish fourth I'd say that qualifies. Nobody's claiming he's up there with Ronaldo. Park wasn't either but you would've been lynched here 5 years ago if you said you didn't rate him.

2950~~~
I'm not going to trawl through posts for this but it's cropped up plenty of times.

2951~~~
On a scale of how many fans we have I doubt it would be very high. The overwhelming majority of people on this forum do nothing but complain about our team.

2952~~~
That wasn't a blanket statement but if the shoe fits....

2953~~~
We should have signed Giovane, Jung or Joven.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://translate.google.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Link</a>

2954~~~
Pretty sure he's top 10 or 11 in all time premiership assists. Don't know why people pretend that he's not had a great career. Maybe cos they just dont know

and 'not quite as bad' = the best outfield player in a team incl di maria, rooney, herrera, van persie, falcao, mata. All likely on 200,000 / week +. Under a great manager. We shouldn't undersell our own players just because we don't want to look stupid for writing him off

2955~~~
you're right... that's exactly what that means. i don't enjoy united winning.


i agree about underselling our own players. but the top 10 in all time premiership assists? are you serious? ashley young?

2956~~~
He is 10th with 57

2957~~~
i would never in a million years have guessed that. wow.

2958~~~
One step at a time mate. We are far off from european glory. For now he has actually been one of our better players.

2959~~~
I think the point might be, why replace young? Why not replace mata or someone like that who's more fashionable but less effective?

2960~~~
That's not the point either.  We're talking about Young here and one is not mutually exclusive of the other anyway.  
Again, the point is that while Young has played well in comparison to almost everyone, if he'd done that years ago when we were performing better as a team (which is what we should be aiming for, albeit in a different system) we'd likely have deemed it not good enough.  So we shouldn't be settling for that now.  I'm not saying stop playing him immediately, because that would be stupid.
Addressing your Mata point, well, he has a higher ceiling than Young, and it's unfair to judge with what's going on around him.  Although it does look like he may never fit into this system.  That's got nothing to do with this though.

2961~~~
Couldn't have put it better myself. He's the ultimate symbol of mediocrity this club has descended into, well, either him or fellaini.

2962~~~
The mediocrity start because the supposedly star players couldn't perform. Now, why do we start complaining about player that has a better season than most of these stars, I don't know.

These marque signing, high paid players like fecking Rooney, RvP, Mata, Falcao, and Di Maria are the ones that supposed to take the team to another level. Young was bought as 'supporting cast' for these players. You don't buy and expect him to be United main man/men. And he's doing his job well.

2963~~~
So squad player,who at the moment performs better then some "stars" is ultimate symbol of mediocrity...even if he does not perform better,still how on earth can squad player be an ultimate symbol of mediocrity.

2964~~~
No, it's the so called star players that fail to deliver more often than Young and Fellaini this season that are the ultimate symbol of mediocrity.

2965~~~
Young wasn't bought as a supporting cast, he was bought like them, to take the team to a another level. We bought him for 18 million(heading to the last year of his contract) and paid him like a star, has done nothing to repay that. Most of those are recent signings, that came long after the rot had set in. He's been mediocre in every season he's been here including the current one, just our standards are so low right now that players can get away with it.

2966~~~
So he looks good just cause our star players are underperfoming. For some of those stars there always a nice excuse but god forbid someone says Young has had a very good season. It automatically means we lowered our standard and whatever...

2967~~~
Mata has been good for us, first double figures midfielder in a long time and Di Maria hasn't really been given a chance after his return from injury. He was really good at the start of the season.

2968~~~
This is true, actually. I'd argue he's been good this season, though, not mediocre.

2969~~~
This squad player has played 22 games this season while someone like Mata has played 26 games. How can you call one a squaddie and the other a "star" player? They both have had equal chances and even in his "better" season, Young's tally of goals and assists this season is appalling, much like Mata, but Mata has shown in the past that he is a sublime player who can deliver on the big stage.

2970~~~
This is the first time i heard that Young is the player United have been expected to carry them to another level.

And what does 'our standard are so low' have to do with Young performance? Young has improved, this is his best season in red shirt, and there's a poll that suggest he's one of the most improved players under LVG. Most can see that.

Although I agree that if Giggs and Beckham are our standard for wingers, Young is several levels below them. But never in million years i'd expect him become those players since we bought him. He wouldn't last that long playing for Villa if he had shown that kind of potential. And Liverpool wouldn't be our main rival for his signing.

Now if we sign Bale, though...

2971~~~
That doesnt excuse Mata for being MIA in some games.
You said it yourself, Mata is a star cause he proved he can deliver on the big stage.

2972~~~
Assist and goals are not the onlymeasurement  to value player performance. Iniesta, other than a few season here and there, is never a prolific goalscorer nor assister in the league. Albeit everyone puts him as one of the greatest attacking midfielder of all time.

2973~~~
Iniesta is the exception not the norm.

2974~~~
Check out Fergie's comment when he bought Young.

2975~~~
Young is a good squad player but he's not really a starter for a team with genuine PL or CL aspirations. He's low maintenance though in that he's not a sulker or someone who is going to disrupt morale if he is on the bench so definitely keep but we need a step up in terms of quality in his position. Ditto Fellaini.

2976~~~
Which one?

2977~~~
Young is or would be squad player if other players perform on their level.This season thats not a case and i did not call anyone star by name. Regarding Mata you asked and gave an answer on your on question Oo.

2978~~~
Luke Young.

2979~~~
I said he has played as a regular and his performances have not been better than someone like Mata. So if Mata has not performed well, how can one say Young has? Just because he has not been as dire as last couple of seasons does not mean he has played very well. He has had some good games but that's about it, esp when you consider his output for a winger has been awful.

2980~~~
Well i never said that...maybe you quoted a wrong poster,dunno.

2981~~~
Or Nani

2982~~~
Chalk another one on please redcafe. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2983~~~
Outfield player of the season.

2984~~~
Agreed

2985~~~
Should've had 4 assists already

2986~~~
He has found his super sayain form. Definetly looks like the Aston villa/2010-2011 football player this season.

2987~~~
Yes, I think he is. Why is it that so many are so eager to have him replaced?

2988~~~
and Pre-Season too, who would've thought?

2989~~~
He has been rejuvenated. People don't want him in the line up next season simply because he is Ashley Young and not one of those top flashy foreign players. You cannot drop him when he is playing like this even if he has one bad match.

2990~~~
I assume they think this performance is an illusion consider how shite he has been the past few years. I am also surprised how well he has played this season if I am being honest.

2991~~~
Our most creative and threatening attacking player lately. Anyone saying otherwise is not watching us play. 

Apparently we should sell him....

2992~~~
This. I thought you were banned?

2993~~~
I requested to be banned for my exams.

2994~~~
How long do you have to perform before people will accept that maybe this is just your current level? He's been consistently good all season.

2995~~~
If Di Maria put in this exact same half of football, people would be wetting themselves. Top stuff.

2996~~~
Best player in the first half. The only player that's undroppable right now.

2997~~~
Brilliant half again.

2998~~~
Ashley "Garrincha" Young. Ripped Bellerin a new one.

2999~~~
Youngnaldo

3000~~~
His crossing is sexual at times

3001~~~
captain leader legend

3002~~~
We could put him in goal at this rate. Cracking half from Ash.

3003~~~
Absolutely on fire right now.

3004~~~
He's been the stand out player in the first half, Memphis has his work cut out for him if he wants to get into the team ahead of Young.

3005~~~
Confidence at an all time high. Just starting to take the piss out of bellerin and co.

Amazing what a new manager can do for a player.

3006~~~
The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be.

3007~~~
I like him this season because he takes players on. This is absolutely fundamental. He takes players on and more often than not he beats them. This is the essence of wide play. He also puts a shift in every game and his crossing is decent too. Respect due this season.

3008~~~
Bet Bellerin wouldn't fancy going out of that dressing room now.

3009~~~
you forgot to capitalize all the letters

3010~~~
Is he mates with Livermore's dealer or something?

3011~~~
He links up with Fellaini superbly, and has been our most threatening attacker for a long time now. The key is that he is willing and able to take his man on, and it makes all the difference.

3012~~~
Surely a England call up.

3013~~~
My MOTM so far.

3014~~~
What a transformation! Good on him. Yet another excellent half. Hopefully it can continue.

3015~~~
If Valdes didnt hurry up on the touchline, I imagine that wasnt to far off.

3016~~~
I know De Gea has been outstanding this season, but surely there's at least a conversation to be had about player of the season.
Young is a different player to the last couple of years. Brilliant today.

3017~~~
Having a very good game again, just needs to have that killer instinct when he gets in behind with the final ball, I have a new found respect for this lad, brilliant season from him.

3018~~~
Excellent today.

3019~~~
Yes, very good. Wanted the ball time and time again, a sure sign of his confidence.

3020~~~
And people wonder why Di Maria isn't playing

3021~~~
Retains the ball really well, defends really well, beats men for fun most games and he's a big game player, so there's no doubt he's an important squad player. That said all of this applied to Valencia at his best too. The difference was he got 15 assists, not 6. Surely that's the standard we have to be aiming for? 

He deserves credit for getting into great positions time and time again because the majority of it is from really nice dribbling, but seriously...I don't know how anyone can be content with the amount of times he puts in a poor ball. Yes he put in a good ball for the goal today but he messed up 5 other good chances when all his good work amounted to absolutely nothing.

3022~~~
Man of the match. How is Depay going to get a game?

3023~~~
Good performance, again. It's actually really disappointing how poor his final ball can be, sometimes. He ripped Arsenal's defense apart, at times, only to be let down by his inconsistent crosses. Other than that, he was good going forward and brilliant in his defensive work.

3024~~~
Our best player. Seriously.

3025~~~
Probably my favourite performance of his this season. Very impressive today, plus some end product. Colour me happy.

3026~~~
By far and away the best outfield player this season. Tremendous today.

3027~~~
After De Gea, he's been our best player this season.

3028~~~
That should be the case but sadly Andros Townsend is busy clogging up a spot.

Another great game from him. Was ripping them apart again and again, just a shame his final ball isn't a bit more consistent.

3029~~~
Agreed, he has the first and second part of attacking down well enough but the final ball or shot is way too often not good enough.

3030~~~
I really don't get it. Assist aside, his delivery was really poor again.

3031~~~
He wasn't great, but he was, along with Herrera, our best player. As you say his delivery was inconsistent, but he wasn't "really poor", 

Overall, it was a good performance. Similar to the Palace game, a 6/10 performance, in numbers.

3032~~~
Very very poor end product, it's like when ever he does the hard work and get's into the box he messes it up on purpose.

3033~~~
To be fair he rarely has a decent target in the box apart from fellaini. Falcao/rvp were non existent and mata is never getting on the end of a cross.

3034~~~
In back-to-back games he's had Mata in a bit of space just outside the 6 yard box waiting for the cut-back, with his man beaten and the time and space to pick out a pass, and he's completely fecked up the pass. It's such a weak excuse. Fellaini's the biggest aerial threat in the league, Mata's one of the best at finding pockets of space in the box and he's had Rooney picking up great positions in the box for most of the season and yet time and time again he's failed to find them. That's a huge deficiency that the majority of people here seem happy to completely overlook.

3035~~~
Very good game. Our best player this season after De Gea.

3036~~~
He has weaknesses no doubt. 

But we'd be a lot shittier if it wasn't for him.

3037~~~
Quality game again, wish some on here would stop knocking him, he deserves his place on merit and if he keeps up this form next season.. then he should stay in the team regardless of who else we bring in, simple as that.

3038~~~
If Nani or Valencia were beating their man as easily as that (which they used to do a lot) and putting in that sort of delivery, they'd be blasted on here, and have been before.

3039~~~
MOTM. Easily too. What a turnaround.

3040~~~
He's very decent footballer when he's not diving. Tries harder than anyone despite detriments in his precision and technique.

He'll have harder life here if we'll add another powerhouse winger with Memphis already here but this is Manchester United and standards needs to be higher especially on the wings.

If he'll stay injury free next season he got a real chance to surprise everyone.

3041~~~
I thought he was doing well but gradually I started getting annoyed with him.

For me, he does the hard bit by beating his man but then fecks up a lot of simple crosses and passes. Either he blasts it into the first man or doesn't even come close to finding a man in the box or takes a ridiculous shot when an easier pass is on.

He presses well and is defensively good, so I can see why Van Gaal likes him, but if we want to win the title we need wingers who will provide 15+ assists a season.

3042~~~
We're already quite shit. And I don't think he's made a massive difference to us. Additionally, given that di Maria probably would have started in place of Young, I think he'd have performed similarly; if not, he'd have created as much, if not more.

3043~~~
Good game today. Memphis will have to play consistently well to keep Young out for that spot on the left.

3044~~~
Great game from him today, fantastic attitude.

3045~~~
So the solution to our shittiness is to drop our most dangerous looking player going forward?

See, this is what I don't get. When a team is playing shit how does it make sense to drop the only player even attempting to create chances? I don't mind Di Maria coming in (although he absolutely does not deserve it on his recent performances) but it should not be for Young.

3046~~~
Only Ashley Young could pick up man of the match and still get criticised on here. 
but, but... what if Di Maria played instead??!

3047~~~
No I didn't say that. You said without him, we'd be even shitter. I said without him, we'd have had di Maria starting in his place and he'd have created more, no doubt about it.

It's just a hypothetical.

3048~~~
The criticism is fair, though. He doesn't create enough. Yes it was a <b>good </b>performance, but we needed better. 

He and Mata are assigned the role of the creators, yet neither create enough.

3049~~~
He's doing absolutely excellent at 90% of what is required, with the 10% being his final ball which is too often poor.

3050~~~
Based on recent games I doubt that. Regardless, if we're looking for players to criticize Young should be somewhere near the bottom of that list.

3051~~~
He's been MoTM vs Arsenal and City lately, both top sides.
Today he had an assist for Herrera, vs City he got a goal and created 2 more of the 4.

Not to mention his work rate and being defensively astute into the equation.
Seems fine to me?

But hey, <i>what if Di Maria played instead?! </i>

3052~~~
With Memphis coming in i won't be surprised if he starts whipping in balls like Beckham next season.

3053~~~
Given he has less assists than Ashley Young that's not very likely

3054~~~
Just look in the Di Maria thread how different he is when comparing Young and Di Maria. With Di Maria he can play how awful as possible, if he's getting assists it doesn't matter how poor he played, Young on the other hand..

3055~~~
Is there still time to vote for the player of the season and if yes where can I vote? He deserves to win it for sure. He gives 100% every game.

3056~~~
Since the attempted home break-in, his form has flatlined, literally flatlined dead, he's an infinitely more talented player than Young, nobody is denying it, but the probablity of him coming in today and giving away 30 terrible passes, not look arsed coming back from offsides or attempt to chase his man down, but then... maybe create one chance, is higher than him suddenly pulling a good performance where he stars despite his confidence hitting rock bottom.

Just feels like an bias mindset against Young on here, the guy is putting in MotM team performances, he deserves his place and even...  some praise!.

3057~~~
I've said nothing other than the fact that his final ball is very poor, it's fair; and I'll say no more.

Like I said before, it was a good performance. Nothing more, nothing less.

3058~~~
Fantastic performance. That is all.

3059~~~
He was brilliant today. Has been all season. Definitely agree that he's been our best outfield player.

3060~~~
Great to see him performing so well Fully deserves a new contract.

3061~~~
He's one hell of a player when his contract is running down.

3062~~~
I'll put it this way: In his last 12 starts, he's scored 2 and assisted 4. Yes, he's put in shifts, here and there, but it's quite simply not enough.

3063~~~
New contract would be deserved.

3064~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3065~~~
Been our best player?

Di Maria's started 19 games this season. In how many of them was he our best player?

3066~~~
You love stats when comparing Di Maria and Young, but Di Maria's last 8 starts he has 0 goals and 2 assists. Simply not good enough and that's what got him dropped. Oh and being one of our worst players in all those games too..

3067~~~
If you like this type of Young, just wait until Depay gets his jiggy on.

3068~~~
Just let him play for a contract against next season.

3069~~~
Was excellent today. Amazing what confidence can do to a player

3070~~~
An assist every third game and goal every six is a good return for a winger in any context (Beckham and Giggs good). Add that to the fact that the team have been lacklustre in a fair few of those games and it makes the return quite impressive. He has also been one of the only players to consistently stand up and take the responsibility of wanting the ball and trying to create something, many of his cohorts have shirked this challenge over the last two seasons.

I don't think he is the solution moving forward but you can't use his current form/productivity to justify that.

3071~~~
What a game from him! Loved seeing him confident enough to attempt to dribble, and succeed too.

3072~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> <a class="username" data-user="7967, @Man-United" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/7967/">@Man-United</a> 

I've used stats to specifically state that di Maria's season hasn't been as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I've never said he's been our best player; if you can find a quote where I've implied that, then please do so (as I don't remember).

As for Young being our best player, I just don't think he has. Players are judged on results, not effort. Is Park Ji-Sung remembered as a great for the effort he put in? No, I wouldn't think so. Young, for me, doesn't do enough which is partly why we've won 1 of our last 5. It's as if people on here are trying to make up for the times they overly bashed Young for his performances in 12/13 and 13/14 by now overly hyping these ones. I remember how many criticised Young last year for his "blind" crosses, which he's continued delivering this season, but it's all forgotten. 

As for the di Maria performing to a similar level to Young, it's hardly farfetched. In, arguably his worst season, he's created and scored double the amount of goals Young has. 

I'm all for effort and defensive responsibility, and I've quite enjoyed how much effort Young puts in with his tackling etc. But going forward, he's not good enough. 

Do remember this is just my opinion.

3073~~~
You can, though. In our last few games, he's received so much of the ball, yet he's created two in five and we've only picked up 3 points from 15. Like I've said before, him and Mata, recently, have not done enough. You'd expect more from Man United wingers/creators.

3074~~~
Hater. The only player willing to take on beat players is not showing us what a Man utd winger is expected to be

3075~~~
It may not be evident, but I'm actually quite a fan of Young. I, honestly, expect more from him, as I believe he's capable of a lot more, such as is performance against City.

3076~~~
It's amazing how he's turned it around, he's buzzing, attacking, defending, everywhere. He's continually putting that stupid "LVG told them to not take risk" theory to bed every game. More than every he's attempting more dribbles, attemting more crosses and more final third passes, even though it does't always come off, honestly the guy has made me look like an absolute mug and I like that.

3077~~~
Start of the season if you'd told me Young would be in the team ahead of Januzaj and Di Maria I would have laughed my ass off but credit to him hes really stepped up. Just shows what a good manager can get out of his players

3078~~~
Another top performance. He is 30 this summer so a rolling one year deal would be appropriate.

3079~~~
Same. I knew Januzaj would not feature much, but was shocked to see Di Maria less involved as well.

3080~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He should be on a 1 yr rolling contract. As my Arsenal mate remarked during the game "he only plays well when he's got something to play for".

3081~~~
I think LVG instruct him to use his left leg more often, and that's the reason he is regain his form,
The down side is, due to his weak foot he has some of inconsistent cross, but he can work on his weak foot in preseason.
More often I think some of his cross are good but due to our forward's lack of imagination there is no one to receive.

I can't blame him he is giving 100% and if we have proper right winger who can do half of thing like young we could be more dangerous.
Its look to predicated to me.

And if he is not good enough, than I wonder apart from DDG, Rooney which players are good enough for our club?

3082~~~
Oh dear. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

We should give him a rolling one-week contract.

3083~~~
Sell him, his end product and final pass are driving me insane.

He has played well this year and his stock has gone up, I'm sure there are some clubs interested.

3084~~~

<i>Disappointed we didn't win today but another great atmosphere, the kids loved it. Thanks for your support all season, it's been incredible, it doesn't go unnoticed</i>

3085~~~
Why sell him though? Why not just keep him here as a squad player. 

And never mind that, if he keeps this form then he'll keep starting games. 

I often wonder if people actually watch the game now. Are you supporting the club or individual players?

3086~~~
I was talking about today's game.

He created our only goal, regularly beat his man, made 5/5 tackles, passed the ball accurately and generally played very well. He was, IMO, our best player on the pitch today (Hererra probably ran him close tbf).

You claimed that - had Di Maria started - he'd have "performed similarly". There's feck all evidence to back that up. Like I said, he's started 19 games for us. In how many of those was he our best player?

3087~~~
I feel the key difference between Young and Di Maria that keeps Young in the team is that he very rarely gives the ball away. Di Maria, conversely, does it quite a lot.

Di Maria is more productive but Young fits the Van Gaal philosophy better. It was always said that Van Gaal would sacrifice stars for his system. His blind spot seems to only be with Dutch players.

3088~~~
feck me, you're a barrel of positivity aren't you? He's been integral to us <i>scraping</i> top 4 this year, and in turn it not being an absolute disaster of a season.

3089~~~
That and Young putting a shift in for the team, at both ends of the pitch. He's also completely stopped diving, which is good to see.

3090~~~
He is very good defensively. Better than Rojo at left back for me. I find it uncanny just how good Young is at looking after the ball. He is a more intelligent player than I realised. If only he had a touch more quality, or at least consistency with his quality.

3091~~~
And if he does lose the ball he doesnt go down like hes injured waiting for sympathy like Di Maria does quite a lot which is frustrating as feck.

3092~~~
If only he had a better left foot! Van Gaal likes winger on the 'wrong' flank, which means when he's usually on his left foot when he has his best opportunities to create. Would be a different story if he was playing those final balls with his right foot.

3093~~~
He's infuriating in that he screws up the simple final pass.

He did it last week against Palace when he rolled it back to Mata instead of giving it to Falcao who was about 2 yards out, and he also failed to put it on a plate for Falcao today who had an open goal just after half time. Young had all the time in the world and shanked it straight at Ospina, so much so the commentator on my stream thought he was shooting until Dixon corrected him.

He's ok as a squad player but if we are serious about winning things he can't be starting every week. These are game defining moments that simply have to be taken. He got away with it last week thanks to Speroni, not today unfortunately.

3094~~~
What exactly did he "Get away with"?! Are you saying if we had drawn last week it would have been his fault!?

3095~~~
He got away with picking the wrong option in a big moment and costing his team a goal. He didn't today.

3096~~~
Pleasantly surprised that people are looking past his good performances lately. Credit to his mental strength, he has fought back and won himself the right to be a bit part player for United.

3097~~~
That is a really odd way of looking at it, I'll give you that.

3098~~~
Destroyed Bellerin today on a few occasions, loved it. His crossing is still a bit inconsistent, but he made a huge improvement this season, especially in taking players on and keeping the ball. Well done Ashley.

3099~~~
Not passing to a player 2 yards out (ok it was Falcao but even so) with an open goal is not costing your team a goal? Of course it is.

Falcao was visibly fuming last week and today.

3100~~~
So good again today, de gea has had an amazing season and i still think ashley is in with a shout

Not just going forward either, 50% of his performance is defensive 

If mata could defend like him he would be playing for chelsea still and we'd be quoted 90m for him this summer

3101~~~
Been on a roll lately but today he was something else. Dominated Bellerin and Ramsay time and again. Every time he got on the ball it seemed like he could make something happen. MOTM without a doubt.

3102~~~
2 assists every five games would equate to 16 assists in a 40 game season. If he achieved that then plenty of people would be raving about him. Damn, if he achieved that I might see him as the long term solution on the left.

You have shifted the time period and therefore the stats that I quoted which does weaken my argument but even still two assists in five games is a decent return, not enough to win five games I grant you but he should not be shouldering the burden of providing everything on a plate for the team week in week out. Few players do that and they are lauded suitably for the rarity that they are. I can easily understand why you would want more but to demand more from him when he is clearly giving his all in every aspect of the game (attacking, defending, pressing) seems to be a bit unreasonable. There are things you can criticise him for, and with no complaint from me, but he has been pulling his weight and then some recently, other players need to do the same and then we wouldn't be as reliant upon him as we seem to be at the moment.

It is not like he has been given a free rein in order to maximise his creativity. He is still required to do a lot of tracking back and be positionally disciplined as well as having to beat his man (or two in many cases due to lack of an overlapping fullback quite often and the fact that Fellaini makes a beeline for the far post as soon as he passes it to him) and then deliver a ball to an area usually packed with opposition bodies. Yes he makes the wrong decisions sometimes or fails to execute a perfect cross but that is true of any winger that has ever played for the club in my time as a supporter. I'm just confused as to the standards you are trying to hold him to as he is one of the few that has come out of this last period of matches with any credit IMO.

Interestingly enough I do agree with you on Mata though.

3103~~~
With him playing like this I am starting to wonder if he would benefit from having a better player than Fellaini alongside him, I mean Fellaini does win a few balls but on the right Herrera manages to create so much by combining with Mata while Young is doing most of his work alone or after long balls from Mata. Also I think if we had a decent striker in place of Fellaini it would give Young more options to cross the ball on the ground rather than just try to lump it in

3104~~~
It was hardly a "big moment" ... but I digress - I don't discount that he should have done better, but to say he "got away with it" implies that it was a lucky escape or something - which it wasn't, because you know, he then went on to create the goal we scored from.

Also, the keeper could have saved it, defenders could have blocked the cross, who knows...

Assume you've been in the Smalling thread saying about how he cost us the game today?

3105~~~
the real question is, should we have our most effective players in young and fellaini able to feed off each other by putting fellaini on the right side of midfield and letting him get to back post easier when young crosses. Mata has shown he doesn't have any of the qualities to get a decent ball into the box for fellaini and one of the most dangerous players in the league is being wasted

3106~~~
Problem is, he's improved immensely this year in his overall contribution but for us to get back to the very top, having a starting winger only contribute 8 goals in 28 appearances is not going to cut it.

3107~~~
Young seems to be one of those players who performs best under immense pressure.

1) Play shit
2) Get booed at and harassed by fans
3) Club buys seemingly superior replacement
4) Start giving good performances at every opportunity
5) Win back spot from seemingly superior competitor
6) Get lazy, start playing shit again

Repeat forever.

3108~~~
He's had a good season but looking forward to him not starting next season.

3109~~~
Fixed.

3110~~~
He played really well today, but he always leave me feeling like I want more. Take today, he had Bellerin on toast, beat him numerous times, kept the ball very well, defended fantastically, got in great positions, and got the assist for our only goal. And yet, I was left feeling like he could have done more.

He gets into so many good positions, then delivers a good final ball 1 out of every 5 attempts. I guess that's his problem, its his consistency in quality, rather then a lack of actual quality.

3111~~~
Was super impressed with him (again). His turnaround has been incredible. My MOTM.

3112~~~
second only to de gea in recent months..what a turnaround..credit to him.

3113~~~
He is the type of player who should never be sold, he never complains when he doesn't play and he tries his best when given the chance. Why the feck would you wanna sell him ? Rather blame the other supposedly more talented players who can't win the starting spot over him. It's not his fault if he's doing/trying more than others.

3114~~~
I never said he cost the game, he cost a goal.

Of course it's a big moment, it only wasn't a goal because Young was unable to play a relatively simple pass for a United winger. He literally had the whole of the left side of the penalty box to himself. I'm not sure you remember the event I'm on about.

He did well in creating the goal, but when you play for United it's not enough to to do well and then mess up the simple thing. He played well today but failed when we could've killed the game.

3115~~~
Very good post.

3116~~~
Sometimes I wonder what game people are watching. By far the best player on the pitch yesterday, one of many brilliant performances this season. One of very few players to make himself undroppable and the praise is richly deserved.

3117~~~
I don't get this opinion. I don't know whether Young can keep up this level but if he can, he should be one of the first men on the team sheet. Arguably our best outfield player this season and the only productive player we have right now. He's undroppable.

3118~~~
He's not my favorite player but he deserves to remain. What message do we give if we start selling players who had done well with us? We'll be as cnuts as the team in white who sell players because they don't have a big reputation or aren't cute enough. We only have to make sure we don't give him a long term contract. 

Also relying on Depay to be magnificent from day 1 is kind of stupid.

3119~~~
I like his passion and dedication to continue despite knowing he is only a one bad performance away from being booed again.

3120~~~
Some fans will never praise young for whatever reason.
If he score hat-trick in next game, some members will moan about 'he has six short on target and only score 3 so its not good enough'.

3121~~~
My outfield player of the year. Excellent all season and is has improved dramatically. Hopefully he can carry this form into next season. Sign the extension.

3122~~~
Kevin and Devilish are pleased with him

Close the thread it will never get any better for Ashley Young

3123~~~
No world beater, but will not  be shipped out as he is a  solid first team performer and a very good backup. Kudos to Ashley, he loves it in Manchester, and obviously LvG likes him as well.

3124~~~
Fantastic season for him really. Can't fault his work ethic, playing in numerous positions/roles and has done very well. Definitely worth a spot in the squad next season.

3125~~~
During the time di Maria was a regular starter he created many chances, often beat his man, his defensive responsibilities weren't bad, his passing wasn't great. I also said that if he didn't perform to a similar level, he'd have created more.

WRT his best games - Burnley, QPR, Leicester, Everton, Arsenal (till the sending off), Burnley are the ones (off the top of my head) were he was easily our best player. That, too, when majority of our team were crap.

3126~~~
Ashley Young did well this season but he is not the player we should look to if we are to challenge for trophies next season.  But he is a good player to have as he can be a good cover for a few positions.  With Depay coming, and also with di Maria, don't think he will get that many games next season. 
I also noticed he is good over a distance of about 10-15 yards where he beat his man and put in crosses.  But over a longer distance, he seemed to lose some pace like how Bellerin came and swept the ball away during our counter attack with Young on the ball.

3127~~~
So, even if I go with your personal rating of his performances (which is potentially slightly biased) we'd be talking about six games out of the 19 he started where he was our best player. So that's less than a one in three chance of him being our best player in any given match. Like I said, your presumption that he would have "performed similarly" to Young, if picked instead of him, doesn't really fit the evidence.

3128~~~
I think that was simply due to him running around like a maniac for the entire match. He tired in the final 20 minutes which is only natural given how much effort he put in.

3129~~~
Could also be due to the fact that Bellerin is the fastest footballer in the league over 40 metres (or something to that effect)

3130~~~
I've been over the moon with him this season and there's no doubt he'll be a very effective squad player next season too. He may not be a player that wins you titles, but he'll be a big contributor in the long run.

3131~~~
better this season than i gave him credit for early on and better than ADM. good season for him.

3132~~~
he's great and consistent dribbler, which is what I like about him, he's got great touch and operates well in tight spaces, never really tries to beat his man if he doesn't have a chance like diMaria or other footballers tend to do, he's clever and can keep possession at right moments and good in combination.. 

his defensive work is also great, if shaw is fit he would be also much better as Rojo isn't the best left back and Blind might be too slow young has to cover a lot for him, but he copes quite well with the changes he has on that left hand side

it will be interesting to see how we start next season.. hope also Januzaj gets some gametime

3133~~~
It's bad that Di Maria can't get a game considering how much he's cost, but honestly he doesn't deserve to be starting when Young's being putting in good performances all season. Deserves to rewarded with a new contract.

3134~~~
What get's me is that people are coming on here say not good enough get rid then heading over to the DDG thread and bellyaching that players have no loyalty anymore? What about fan loyalty to a player who has been instrumental in us getting this top 4 finish this season? 

I'd start next season with Ash as first choice on LW then gradually start integrating Memphis into the position. If we are going to compete in all compositions next season  we will need both of them firing on all cylinders over the course of the season.

3135~~~
Hes been a revelation this year and showed some of the form that brought him into tge spotlight under O'Neill at Villa when him and Agbon..  ripped the league up.

Hope it continues next season.

3136~~~
I agree with that point, like I said on the transfer thread, the club needs to raise the bar with its own starting 11. Fellaini mata and young fall in that same category, done well but we need better players to replace them in a starting 11. If VG has not got much faith in di maria, we need another winger. I do not really like the idea of going into next season seeing young and rooney coming to 30 next season playing every week, depay is a start, depay and herrera is a fantastic start of rebuilding our midfield.

3137~~~
If Depay takes the left wing spot, could Young be our RB? His interplay with Blind and Fellaini is great. I can see him suiting Mata and Herrera excellently as he's quick and can beat a man too providing more space for those two to have. He'll offer more attacking threat than Valencia, and has shown to be clever in picking his moments and being defensively responsible.

3138~~~
Its crazy how much of a factor confidence has in a players ability to perform. You could incredibly gifted and if you're down on confidence you just can't produce the goods. 

I'm not saying Young is the most naturally gifted player, but the difference between this season and last is massive. I'm delighted for him. I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't as frustrated as everyone else was last season, and I really thought he was garbage. But he's proved everyone wrong in style this year. Fair play to him.

3139~~~
The new Ryan Giggs.

3140~~~
To be honest Ashley Young was consistently doing this for Villa before we signed him. He was just haunted with injuries and turn to shit the moment he signed for us. I have to be honest, I used to really enjoy watching him play for Villa. I was genuinely excited when we signed him.

3141~~~
Damn right! Loyalty should work both ways.

3142~~~
If he had a better final ball and better delivery into the box, he'd be a world class winger. However, even if his final delivery is inconsistent, he's still a valuable player to have in the team and can be relied on to perform well, but I don't think he's someone who should regularly start for a team challenging for trophies.

His dribbling causes so many problems for the opposition whenever he's in 1-on-1 situations (the Everton game seemed like an anomaly in this regard). His decision-making is also very good, and he works so well with whoever moves into the left flank. His delivery's the only real issue for me as it's not good enough, but that doesn't mean it's bad; I just think that there are more productive wingers that we can play on the left.

Anyone watching SSN right now? They're talking about stand-out United players and Merse looked absolutely devastated when someone told him Young isn't in the England squad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3144~~~
Not his best game in midfield the day, bizarre that he started there and Di Maria on the wing.

I actually think he could become a half decent midfielder though, ala Milner. Hard worker and decent enough athlete.

3145~~~
Keep him on the wing

3146~~~
No Young out wide no party. Wasted centrally.

3147~~~
Not suited to the role he was in today, strange choice from LvG to play him there randomly.

3148~~~
Looked like he didn't know where to be, understandable. If we were going to experiment, I'd liked to have seen him swap with mata

3149~~~
Van Gaal talks about balance then puts Young central. I guess he might be experimenting for next season, and I get the feeling he wanted to see Di Maria on the wing again, but it really didn't work. Young, in the last couple of months, has arguably been our most dangerous attacking player down the left wing and should have played there today.

3150~~~
He did a couple of good things early, but then completely disappeared from the match. Understandably so.

3151~~~
We had no wing attack with LVG's stupid decision to play Young centrally.  DiMaria never came into the middle third and made himself available for a pass, which left Herrera with only Mata, Valencia, and Rojo to work with.

Aside from that, I give Young credit for turning things around this season and LVG for encouraging him as a starter.  He will probably become a backup with Depay joining us but he is certainly worth holding onto.

3152~~~
Makes sense to me to experiment with Young in CM today. Depay is likely to have the LW position locked up next season, plus we have Januzaj pushing for game time, so if Young is to stick around (he surely will) it would be beneficial for him and us if he could play in a second position. He's about to turn 30 too, so his pace will start to go and he will become less and less effective on the wing from here on.

Don't get me wrong I don't have particularly high hopes that it will work, but I think it's a logical thing to experiment with.

3153~~~
Ashley young does fall into that squad player category, he has been starting allot lately, but for us to reach certain standards and raising the bar in our starting 11, he must be replaced by better players. The same applies with valdes valencia mata and fellaini, I would put rooney in that pool of players who need replacing. Hopefully depay is the start

3154~~~
Had to laugh, we see the lineup and think either Mata or Di Maria would play in the central #10 role (where they are usually better), and the other one and Young as the wingers. Then in the actual game Young is in the middle.. Didn't do badly I thought, just he's obviously better wide. He's had a very good season though.

3155~~~
Strange decision by LVG to play him in midfield. He really can only play one position and that is winger and it showed today

3156~~~
Play him on the wing or don't play him at all.

He was terrific for us this season but we need better players. Valuable squad player for next year but like Fellaini, Rojo, Blind and even Mata, should not be first choice every week.

3157~~~
Massive improvement from his previous seasons at the club. Still, despite this his assists and goals ratio were poor. 

6.5

3158~~~
Was rather surprised to see him play in centre midfield. He was average yesterday.

3159~~~
Just realized he's 30 now. Thought the lad is still in his late 20s.
Young isn't young anymore..

3160~~~
Yep, I just hope the boss does not play overplay him, a good squad player, not someone that should be a week in week out player

3161~~~
Has anything happened with his contract? I know his last one was set to expire in 2016.

3162~~~
Haven't heard anything since we were 'working on a new contract' at the end of May. I'd be very surprised if we didn't end up signing him up pretty smoothly though. He was superb last season, and by all accounts is keen to stay.

We shouldn't forget that he was close to being our best player over the whole course of last season. Especially impressive given that he spent the first six months playing as a WB/FB. I for one have to hold my hands up and say I couldn't have been more wrong about his prospects if I'd tried last summer!

3163~~~
think he will have to wait into the new season for a one-year extension if he performs well

3164~~~
Didn't watch the game but from the highlights looks like he was very influential down the left in the first half?

3165~~~
he was decent enough, combining well with Shaw but also wasted two or three crosses, anyway as long as you create three great chances per game it shouldn't matter, typical Ash Young performance from last season I'd say

3166~~~
Young doesnt have his 15/16 performances thread. Just sayin'. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3167~~~
Why don't our players actually be ready at the far post when Young is about to cross? Even if Young just gets up from bed and hits a cross, it will always end up at the far post. Everyone who watches us can say that then surely the players must have realized it by now as well.

3168~~~
My question is, why the feck do we insist on crossing the ball into the box when we have only offensive players who are more often than not surrounded by a defence that have been given time to defend it? None of those 3 are big and tall targets either.

3169~~~
Sell and give the game time to lingard.

3170~~~
think we may move on. strange that we havent offered a new contract yet. and with all this talk of new fwds. makes you wonder

3171~~~
Have to disagree with the idea that Youngs crosses always end up at the back post. Problem is his so called crosses end up all over the place. He has no left foot and the vast majority of the time he attempts a cross with his left it ends up being a waste of time. He however rarely tries to cross with his left foot, preferring to cut in onto his right which in doing so often means strikers have had to check their run, which in turn means more wasted balls. If you take a long hard look at him in any game his crossing is very inefficient which it shouldnt be given his position. His big saving grace last season was that he worked his balls off and provided some great defensive cover and whilst his crossing was poor he did get forward well and mean defences had to commit players to cover him.

3172~~~
so true. Fellaini no game yet and already a thread

3173~~~
He has been stealing a living from us for years, but given his much improved form last season, we should at least award him a 1-year extension to his current contract, maybe with a pay cut.

3174~~~
Didn't he sign a 3 year extension recently or am I mistaken?

3175~~~
not yet and no such length for an extension, he is 30 years old. not gonna happen

3176~~~
Yeah, my bad. It was just reported that he had.

speak of the devil

3178~~~
I would have to disagree. His crossing is not the best but most of the times they are aimed at the far post. Now whether that is his default or he does it deliberately, I do not know, but even in the two pre-season games so far we have seen the same. I agree that he is not the greatest threat but in saying that I also have to point out that he has worked well with both Blind and Shaw down the left hand side. He is not as talented individually as a Di Maria to pick apart a defense by himself but hopefully he will be a good squad option rather than an important player in the first team this coming season.

3179~~~
If Pedro comes in and Di Maria stays it might leave Ashley available depending on what LVG thinks of Januzaj and  Pereira.

lots of ifs and buts there and his effort and versatility might earn him an extension.....liked his attitude last year and (i'm not sure if its true but) i read he would consider a pay cut to stay

3180~~~
Think he had a good season but I would be tempted to flog him - would rather we gave chances to Adnan and Pereira than continue with him.

3181~~~
As well as he played last season, looking at the stats at the top of the page... 2 goals, all year? That's a bit of a surprise.

3182~~~
Like his attitude, if hes willing to accept a squad role and take a pay cut then we should sign him up. 

As well as he played last season, he doesnt have the required quality in terms of end product to be considered a starter for a title winning team. Saying that though he is still a very good player. 

I would priorities Memphis and maybe Periera over him, but I still think he would be a useful member of the squad.

3183~~~
I suggest you take a count next time he plays as to where his crosses go and also if they find their man successfully. You will be in for quite a shock. Just keep count.

3184~~~
I loved his attitude and effort last season as well. he also did a superb job of helping the defence out in a season where it was all over the place, especially while LVG was trying 3 at the back. He worked his socks off all season getting up and down the pitch.

3185~~~
if you want to discuss his contract situation, please take it to the Utd forum and make a thread, this is for performances only, and what more, it's last seasons performances, so I'm locking it.
